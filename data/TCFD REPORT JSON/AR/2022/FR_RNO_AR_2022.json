The presentation of our future vehicles at the Paris Motor Show, the renewable electricity supply contract, the ramping up of our strategic partnerships, the label of excellence obtained by the Refactory Campus and the announcement of the reorganization of the Group were some of the highlights of the year, topped off by financial results that exceeded expectations.\n\nFor these remarkable achievements, I would like to give my warm thanks and  congratulations  to  the  Group's  teams,  led  with  the  exceptional energy  and  talent  of  Luca  de  Meo,  bandmaster  of  a  company  that  is playing louder and louder, more and more in tune, faster and faster!\n\nWhen  the  strategy  is  clear,  when  the  momentum  is  strong,  risks  and hazards can be tackled more effectively. The company  has demonstrated this in the face of various crises that have been prolonged (semiconductors, supply, war in Ukraine) or intensified (inflation, energy crisis).\n\nThe  early  weeks  of  2023  suggest  that  these  difficult  conditions  will continue. Our resilience and solidarity will be called upon again. I know I can count on the remarkable work of the board of directors, which Luca now joins, as well as on the commitment and confidence of the teams in the  Group's  orientations,  as  evidenced  by  the  recent  success  of  the employee shareholding plan. We will also be driven by the acceleration of our strategic plan. Finally, we will benefit from the new momentum of our Alliance. The agreement we announced on February 6, allows us to open a new chapter on solid foundations. Going forward, hidden agendas and mutual frustrations are a thing of the past, giving way to a reinvigorated Alliance focused on concrete projects offering very high added value.\n\nFour  years  ago,  I  agreed  to  take  over  the  presidency  of  Renault,  in  a context of unprecedented economic, political and geopolitical chaos.\n\nIn  2019,  the  priority  was  to  take  emergency  measures  and  avoid  the implosion and bankruptcy of Renault Group and the Alliance; in 2020, we had to resist and rebuild the fundamentals; in 2021, it was recovery and reconquest; in 2022, the company amplified the strength of its rebound.\n\nAs I  complete my first term as President and Chief Executive Officer of Renault, I am driven by a dual feeling of pride and gratitude. I would like to express my deepest thanks to the Board of Directors, who worked with remarkable quality and intensity throughout these years, as well as to the Group's teams, whom I have had the pleasure of meeting regularly and who  have  always  given  me  their  warm  support.  Thanks  to  the  perfect alignment between the board of directors and the management, thanks to the agility and the talents of the teams, we were faster and stronger than imagined by all observers.\n\nOn December 15, the Board of Directors proposed my reappointment. If the shareholders approve this proposal at our next AGM on May 11, I will be keen  to  continue  working  to  ensure  that  the  Group  completes  its impressive  recovery,  at  the  forefront  of  a  fair  and  sustainable  mobility industry.\n\nI",

Our new frontier is to add to this culture of resilience the mindset of a company that now intends to race ahead.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Renault Group\n\nThe  year  2022  confirmed  all  the  hopes  that  the  Renaulution  plan  had raised and even more! After such an existential crisis which had not been experienced for almost 40 years, Renault Group is now out of the woods. This  year  we  completed  the  restructuring  phase  of  our  plan  -  the Resurrection - almost three years ahead of schedule. With an operating margin of 5.6%, compared with a negative margin only two years ago, we are  already  achieving  the  target  for  2025.  The  Group  has  generated \u20ac3.4  billion  in  free  cash  flow  since  2021,  which  is  already  more  than  we expected by 2023.\n\nFew examples of such a rapid turnaround could be found throughout the automotive  industry.  This  result  was  achieved  in  a  particularly  difficult context  marked  by  the  continuing  semiconductor  crisis,  disruptions  in global supply chains, the conflict in Ukraine and the generalized inflation which weighs particularly heavily on energy and raw materials. This is the best  proof  that  the  fundamentals  of  the  Group  have  been  thoroughly cleaned up, thanks to the reduction of our fixed and variable costs but also  thanks  to  the  adoption  of  a  commercial  policy  centered  on  value. One  indicator  reveals,  better  than  any  other,  the  depth  of  the  work accomplished: with a 50% drop in incidents over the first months of 2022, Renault has now reached unprecedented levels of quality, which places it at the reference in the sector, in Europe.\n\nThe second phase of the plan, Renovation, which focuses on the product, is largely underway. It is no exaggeration to say that Renault is on the eve of  having  the  best  range  it  has  had  in  30  years.  Of  the  launches  made between 2022 and 2025, 50% will concern vehicles in the C segments and above. Nearly 50% will be electric vehicles. The past year has shown the beginnings of this wave that will carry the Group in the years to come. The launches  of  Megane  and  Austral  were  major  commercial  successes, while the Group's presence at the Motor Show in October, with no fewer than six launches, symbolized Renault's return.\n\nThe announcement on November 8, of the Group's transformation into a next-generation automotive company opens a new stage. We see in the forced transformations that the automobile is undergoing today as well as  in  the  rapid  evolution  of  the  technological  landscape  a  unique opportunity to make a new start by adapting the company to the reality of  a  playing  field  that  is  disrupting  routines  established  for  decades. A  next-generation  company,  Renault  will  be  able  to  excel  equally  in traditional activities - linked to combustion engines and hybrids - and in new activities, from electricity and software to circular economy, to new mobility services.\n\nThe  financial  implications  of  this  transformation  are  major.  Today, Renault  achieves  approximately  25%  of  its  turnover  in  activities  with either growth or a margin of more than 10%. In 2030, it will achieve 45% in activities  whose  growth  and  margin  will  show  such  a  performance. At that time, the Group itself will show a double-digit margin.\n\nThe challenge in 2023 is to roll out this metamorphosis. Renault no longer has to prove its ability to weather storms. Our new frontier is to add to this culture of resilience the mindset of a company that now intends to race ahead. As we have seen in recent months, impossible is not Renault!\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## 1.1.2 Strategy and objectives\n\nFollowing the approval by the Board of Directors, chaired by Jean-Dominique Senard, at its meeting on November 7, 2022,  Luca  de  Meo,  CEO  of  Renault  Group  and  Thierry Pi\u00e9ton, CFO of Renault Group, presented the third chapter of  the  \"Renaulution\"  strategy  on  November  8,  on  the occasion of the Capital Market Day.\n\nUntil now,  car  manufacturers  have  operated  in  an environment characterised by mature combustion-engine technology  and  stable  customer  expectations.  Current changes reshaping the automotive industry are leading to the emergence of new value chains: electric vehicles (EV), software, new mobility services and the circular economy.\n\nToday,  after  Resurrection  and  Renovation,  the  first  two phases  of  the  Renaulution  strategic  plan  presented  on January  14,  2021,  Renault  Group  begins  the  third  chapter and  launches  its Revolution with the ambition  of becoming a next generation automotive group .\n\nThis  new  organization,  which  will  be  implemented  gradually from 2023, will enable Renault Group to draw value from all the new  profit  pools  (estimated  by  external  sources  at  around \u20ac220 billion in 2030, compared with \u20ac110 billion today). To seize opportunities  in  these  markets  and  to  adapt  to  the  current environment, Renault Group is creating dedicated organizations.  It  will  transform  its  business  portfolio  by exploiting  value  chains  that  are  structurally  more  profitable. Renault  Group  will  leverage  a  horizontal  and  ecosystem approach  to  co-create,  co-finance  and  scale  up  strategic initiatives with leading partners.\n\n## The five Businesses\n\n## These five businesses are the following:\n\n## 1. Power: innovative low-emission internal-combustion and hybrid vehicles\n\nInternal combustion and hybrid vehicles will still account for up to 50% of global passenger car sales even by 2040. The development of efficient technologies in this area is essential  for  the  future  of  any  global  car  manufacturer. This  is  why  Renault  Group  is  keen  to  develop  its  core business, with the launch of an all-new range for Renault ICE & Hybrid (passenger cars), Dacia and LCV - and with the  creation  of  a  world-leading  supplier  of  internal combustion and hybrid engine technologies.\n\n## Renault  Group  will  combine  its  internal  combustion engine and hybrid technologies (Horse project) with Geely to create a world-class automotive manufacturer\n\nRenault  Group  and  Geely  will  combine  their  internal combustion  engines  in  a  50/50  entity.  This  dedicated business will design, develop, produce and sell components  and  systems  for  internal  combustion  and hybrid  engines  with  advanced  technologies.  From  day one,  this  entity  will  generate  a  turnover  of  over  15  billion euros with a volume of 5 million units per year. It already has  8  customers  who  will  benefit  from  increased productivity and synergies.\n\nThis  fully-fledged  entity  will  have  a  global  presence  and activity with:\n\n- \u25cf 17 plants to supply 130 markets;\n- \u25cf 5  R&D centers in Europe (Spain, Romania and Sweden), China  and  South  America,  comprising  a  total  of  3,000 engineers;\n- \u25cf 19,000 employees, in total, on 3 continents.\n\nThis entity will offer a comprehensive range of technologies for all components:  engine, gearbox, hybridization system (xHEV) and batteries, at the highest level.  Through  this  project,  Renault  Group  will  double  its size  and  grow  its  market  coverage  from  40%  to  80% worldwide. Such growth is driven by geographic expansion with access to North America and China and by  product  complementarity,  thank  to  which  complete low-emission solutions and systems will be offered to car manufacturers. To achieve this, this entity will develop its technology  offering  in  the  field  of  alternative  fuels through a strategic cooperation with a potential partner from the energy industry.\n\n## Renault ICE & Hybrid: global premiumisation\n\nDespite the steep rise in the EV offer, internal-combustion vehicles will continue to grow, particularly outside Europe. The Renault brand will therefore continue to be present in the  internal-combustion  and  hybrid-vehicle  markets, particularly in Latin America, India, South Korea and North Africa.  Sales  of  Renault  ICE  &  Hybrid  passenger  vehicles will  continue  to  grow  by  an  average  of  2%  per  year  over the period 2022-2030.\n\nTo move upmarket in all regions, Renault will continue its offensive  in  the  C-segment  and  between  2022  and  2030 will  increase  net  income  by  20%  and  the  margin  on variable costs by 30%.\n\n## Dacia:  from  an  operating  margin  of  over  10%  to  15% in 2030\n\nThe  Dacia  model  is  unique  and  based  on  the  winning combination of three main components:\n\n- \u25cf design-to-cost  engineering  (cost  efficiency)  already providing a solid double-digit cost benefit;\n- \u25cf an  industrial  and  supply  base  with  a  benchmark  cost competitiveness;\n- \u25cf an  asset-light  distribution  model  ensuring  a  cost  level comparable to the agency model;\n- \u25cf 85% sales mix to private customers.\n\nAs a result, Dacia already generates an operating margin of over 10% and aims to reach 15% in 2030.\n\nTo  fulfill  this  goal,  Dacia,  currently  the  leader  in  the B-segment,  will  boldly  set  its  sights  on  the  C-segment. After Jogger this year, Bigster will embody this move into the C-segment, with two other vehicles to follow, doubling its profit pool coverage.\n\nAt  the  same time, Dacia will continue to reduce its costs and  will  benefit  from  the  doubling  of  volumes  on  the\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group",

Dacia  will gradually  electrify  its  range  in  Europe  by  pioneering  the deployment of accessible electric solutions.\n\n## LCV  business:  propelled  into  the  future  by  2  disruptive projects\n\nRenault Group's LCV (light commercial vehicle) business is built  on  solid  foundations  with  a  European  fleet  of  over 5 million vehicles, an ecosystem of over 600 Pro+ dealers, four  plants  and  the  latest  range  that  will  be  launched  in around 2026.\n\nRenault  LCV  will  develop  two  disruptive  projects  to respond to a dynamic and changing market:\n\n- \u25cf Hyvia: Renault  Group's  joint  venture  with  Plug  Power,  for mobility with decarbonized  hydrogen,  which  offers solutions  covering  all  needs,  from  fuel  cell  vehicles  to hydrogen refueling and electrolysis. Hyvia combines Plug Power's  hydrogen  expertise  with  the  industrial  and engineering assets of Renault Group. Hyvia aims to have a 30% of the hydrogen LCV market in 2030 in Europe and a cumulative order book of 1 billion euros by 2026;\n- \u25cf FlexEVan: a  family  of  electric,  commercial  vehicles defined  around  revolutionary  software,  which  will  be launched as of 2026. FlexEVan will  be  compact  for  city use  thanks  to  a  specially  designed  electric  platform. FlexEVan  will  benefit  from  the  SDV  (Software-Defined Vehicle)  developed  within  Ampere.  The  vehicle  will become a fully  connected  extension  of  the  warehouse and integrated in the customer's digital ecosystem. It will be  the  first  vehicle  to  benefit  from  the  application  of Renault  Group's  SDV  technology,  including  real-time end-to-end operations monitoring and data-driven fleet management.  FlexEVan  will  reduce  the  total  lifetime cost of  ownership by at least 30% for customers, more than the price of the vehicle. To support the development  of  FlexEVan,  Renault  Group  intends  to create  Flexis,  a  partnership  with  a  major  player  in  the industry  with  a  complementary  business.  Through  this partnership, development costs will be shared, allowing for  a  significant  reduction  in  costs  and  customer coverage will be maximized.\n\n## 2. Ampere: the first electric and software pure player born out of the disruption of a traditional car manufacturer\n\nWith  Ampere,  Renault  Group  creates  an  autonomous entity  that  will  be  the  first  electric  and  software  pure player  born  out  of  the  disruption  of  a  traditional  car manufacturer. Ampere will develop, manufacture and sell all-electric passenger cars with advanced SDV technology under the Renault brand. Ampere will combine the  best  of  both  worlds:  the  know-how  and  assets  of Renault Group with the focus and agility of a 100% electric player.\n\nBased  in  France,  Ampere  will  be  a  fully-fledged  car manufacturer with approximately 10,000 employees. As a technology company, Ampere will favour innovation with\n\napproximately 3,500 engineers, half of whom specialize in software.\n\nBy  2030,  Ampere's  range  of  six  electric  vehicles  will  be ideally  positioned  in  the  most  dynamic  segments  in Europe covering 80% of the generalists' electric market: in the  B-segment  with  the  new  Renault  5  Electric  and Renault  4  Electric  and  in  the  C-segment  with  Megane E-Tech Electric, Scenic Electric and two other vehicles that are still to come. A large part of the investment for the first four vehicles has already been spent.\n\nAmpere aims to make around 1 million electric vehicles for the  Renault  brand  in  2031.  Ampere  is  set  to  grow,  with  a compound annual growth rate of more than 30% over the next 10 years.\n\nAmpere is based on three technological pillars that make it unique in the electric vehicle and software ecosystem:\n\n- \u25cf A high-tech and competitive industrial base: ElectriCity is  already  one  of  the  largest  and  most  competitive electric-vehicle manufacturing hubs in Europe. In 2025, it will  turn  out  one  vehicle  in  less  than  10  hours.  With  a production capacity of 400,000 units from day one, it will be able to produce up to 1 million vehicles by relying on other  Renault  Group  facilities.  ElectriCity  also  offers  a unique  local  ecosystem  with  80%  of  suppliers  located within a radius of 300 kilometers;\n- \u25cf An European electric-vehicle value chain : Ampere works with  the  most  relevant  players  to  access  know-how, ensure sustainable supplies and gain clarity and control over  costs  and  performance.  Through  its  European supply chain, Ampere will procure the more than 80 GWh of power needed for its vehicles by 2030. From covering 10%  of  the  electric-vehicle  value  chain  in  2020,  it  now covers more than 30% and will reach 80% by 2030;\n- \u25cf Revolutionary Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) technology :  SDV is the future of the automotive industry as  it  enables  a  vehicle  to  be  constantly  updated throughout its life cycle, while learning from its users and remaining in contact with the manufacturer, from design until  end  of  life.  To  launch  its  first  open  and  horizontal SDV in 2026, Renault Group has built strong partnerships with two major tech player;\n- -Qualcomm  Technologies, to co-develop highperformance computing platforms based on Snapdragon\u00ae  Digital  Chassis\u2122  solutions  for  the Centralized  Electronic  Architecture.  This  includes the System-on-Chip (SoC) and the bottom layers of the  software,  as  well  as  functionalities,  on-board services and applications. Qualcomm Technologies, or one of its subsidiaries, intends to invest in Renault Group's electric and software entity, Ampere;\n- -Google,  to  create  an  Android  platform  for  the Software-Defined  Vehicle,  as  well  as  a  Cloud system to store the digital twin.\n\nNo other company in the industry intends to build an SDV using  a  horizontal  approach.  This  approach  reduces development  time  and  costs.  The  partnership  with Google,  to  create  the  open  Android  platform,  allows Ampere to tap into one of the largest global ecosystems of independent application developers. They will create a",

In  addition,  the  value  for users will increase  thanks  to  continuous  software innovation and regular updates.\n\n## 3.  Alpine:  an  exclusive,  zero-emission  and  global  brand with motor racing in its DNA\n\nOver  the  past  two  years,  Alpine  has  undergone  a renaissance,  capitalising  on  its  iconic  A110  sports  coup\u00e9 and  its  entry  into  Formula  1,  where  it  aims  to  become  a contender. Today, Alpine is a truly exclusive brand, a fullyfledged,  asset-light,  technology-focused  manufacturer with a team of 2,000 people, 50% of whom are engineers. Being part of the Group gives Alpine access to Ampere's electric  and  software  technology  assets.  In  the  future, Alpine  will  rely  on  business  partnerships  and  investor support  to  accelerate  its  growth  and  international expansion.\n\nAlpine is developing a brand-new range that will support its  growth  and  international  ambitions  and  will  be  allelectric  as  from  2026.  In  the  meantime,  Alpine  will  unveil the  next  A110  and  two  new  models:  a  B-segment  sedan and a C+ segment crossover. Alpine plans to launch two vehicles  equipped  with  advanced  technology  in  the D- and E-segments to support its international expansion: half  of  Alpine's  growth  will  come  from  new  markets outside  Europe,  potentially  including  North  America  and China.\n\n## 4. Mobilize:  built  around  a  leading  captive-finance company  to  target  the  new-mobility,  energy  and  dataservices markets\n\nMobilize  is  built  around  one  key  asset,  Mobilize  Financial Services  (Mobilize  F.S.),  one  of  the  best  captive-finance companies  in  the  market  with  4  million  customers. Mobilize F.S. will expand its traditional business activities while  developing  new  activities  such  as  subscription, insurance and operational leasing.\n\nMobilize  is  poised  to  become  a  leading  and  profitable, dedicated Vehicle-as-a-Service (VaaS) provider, combining  financial,  mobility,  energy  and  data  services\n\nsupported  by  purpose-built  vehicles.  These  services, combined  in  a  single  solution,  will  meet  the  needs  of private  customers,  fleets  and  mobility  operators  while generating recurring income. What differentiates Mobilize from  any  other  car  brand  is  that  it  provides  services  for the product and not the other way around. Thanks to the VaaS  model,  Mobilize  will  generate  three  times  more income  over  the  entire  life  cycle  of  the  vehicle,  in comparison with traditional sales.\n\n## 5. THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL: the automotive industry's first company  dedicated  to  the  circular  economy:  from  the closed loop of materials to battery recycling\n\nTo  confirm  its  commitment  to  the  circular  economy  and make progress on the path of resource neutrality, Renault Group  announced  on  13  October  2022,  the  creation  of  a new entity: THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL. By bringing together all  the  existing  expertise of the Group and its partners in this  activity,  the  new  entity  offers  closed-loop  recycling solutions at every stage of a vehicle's life: supply of parts and  raw  materials,  production,  use  and  end  of  life.  THE FUTURE  IS  NEUTRAL  currently  covers  about  50%  of  the value chain and is aiming for over 90% by 2030. This entity is  set  to  become  the  European  leader  in  the  closed-loop automotive circular economy, on an industrial scale. It will serve  Renault  Group  and  the  entire  industry.  In  order  to accelerate its development and strengthen its leadership, THE  FUTURE  IS  NEUTRAL  is  making  a  minority  of  its capital  available  to  external  investors  with  the  aim  of co-financing investments of around \u20ac500 million until 2030.\n\n## ESG (Environment, Social, Governance): a performance lever for Renault Group\n\nThe Group's Revolution will see an acceleration of its ESG trajectory,  which  represents  a  key  lever  for  the  Group's operational and financial performance.\n\nThe  re-engineering  of  Renault  Group's  business  will enable it to become a forerunner in the quest for carbon neutrality and an inclusive future.\n\nRegarding  the  climate,  the  Group  aims  to  be carbon neutral  in  Europe  by  2040  and  in  the  world  by  2050 ,  by taking  a  cradle-to-grave  approach.  The  Group  has  set interim  carbon-footprint  reduction  targets  to  mark  its path, with specific action plans for each of its activities.\n\nI",

For  example,  with ReKnow  University,  which  is  open  to  the  entire  industry, 15,000 Renault Group employees and 4,500 students and suppliers will be trained by 2025 in the future skills needed by the automotive industry, in electric mobility, the circular economy, software, cybersecurity and data.\n\n## Financial outlook\n\nRenault  Group's  new  organization,  based  on  the  five businesses,  will  be  directly  reflected  in  its  financial reporting to foster simplicity, accountability and transparency, both internally and externally. The performance of these five businesses will continue to be underpinned by the financial discipline introduced during the  Resurrection  phase.  The  Group's  levers  -  a  policy focused on value rather than volume, improved competitiveness  and  capital  efficiency  -  will  be  further accelerated  through  its  new-product  offensive,  a  strong emphasis  on  variable  costs,  the  development  of  a sustainable supplier network and digitalisation, respectively.  In  addition,  an  ecosystem  approach  to partnerships,  which  is  unique,  will  allow  the  Group  to extend its coverage of key value chains with a low capital commitment.\n\nTo  meet  the  challenge  posed  by  the  unprecedented transformation  of  the  industry,  Renault  Group  has adopted an approach based on two principles:\n\n- \u25cf a self-financing plan, secured by the extensive generation of free cash flow from its operations;\n- \u25cf partnerships  or  external  finance  to  accelerate  growth, innovation  or  competitiveness  and  to  reduce  capital requirements.\n\n## Ampere: low cash consumption & external financing\n\nRenault Group wishes to accelerate the future development  of  Ampere  and  propel  the  Renault  brand towards  an  electric  future  by  mobilising  the  Group's financial resources in a disciplined manner. In this context, the Group plans to call on external partners and investors to participate  in  this  adventure  with  the  following assumptions:\n\n- \u25cf established electric-vehicle player with low cash consumption. Free cash flow above 0 in 2025;\n- \u25cf open  to  external  investors  to  accelerate  R&D  and  the development of the ecosystem;\n- \u25cf Alliance  (Renault  Group,  Nissan,  Mitsubishi  Motors): capital participation under consideration;\n- \u25cf initial Public Offering on Euronext Paris envisaged at the earliest  in  the  second  half  of  2023  (subject  to  market conditions)  with  Renault  Group  retaining  a  strong majority and the support of potential strategic investors (including Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.).\n\n## Horse  project:  financially optimising  the  future  of internal-combustion and hybrid engines\n\nFrom  a  financial  perspective,  the  Horse  project  aims  to generate  productivity  gains,  reduce  fixed  costs  and significantly improve  the  Group's  financial  position. Renault  Group  should  retain  50%  of  the  capital  of  this entity  and,  as  a  result,  will  separate  this  activity  from Renault Group's scope and financial statements as from the second half of 2023.\n\nThe impact of this carve-out is estimated as follows:\n\n- \u25cf \u20ac2.5 billion reduction in fixed assets;\n- \u25cf \u20ac1.2  billion  in  fixed-cost  variabilization  per  year  on average  and  \u20ac2.4  billion  reduction  in  Capex  and  R&D, from 2023 to 2030;\n- \u25cf cost  competitiveness  of  engines:  \u20ac2.5  billion  between 2023 and 2030. Positive impact as from 2024;\n- \u25cf dividend corresponding to the share of capital retained by Renault Group;\n- \u25cf future potential capital gain.",

Board of Directors;\n- \u25cf R&D  and  Capex:  maximum  of  8%  of  revenues  over 2022-2030;\n- \u25cf ROCE  (Return  On  Capital  Employed):  above  30% from 2025;\n\nIn  addition,  Renault  Group  has  exceeded  its  financial objectives for the year 2022:\n\n- \u25cf Renault Group operating margin of over 5%;\n- \u25cf automotive  operating  free  cash  flow  of  more  than \u20ac1.5 billion.\n\n## Restoring the dividend\n\nRenault  Group  plans  to  reinstate  the  payment  of  a dividend as from 2023 (based on the 2022 financial year, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting). This\n\ndividend  symbolises  a  new  era.  The  pay-out  ratio  will increase gradually and in a disciplined manner to 35% of net income - Group share, in the medium term. To do so, the  Group  will  have  to  fulfil  its  first  priority,  which  is  to return to an investment grade financial rating.\n\n## Capital allocation policy\n\nRenault  Group  plans  to  reinvest  at  least  50%  of  the surplus  cash  generated  within  the  Group.  In  the  future, Renault Group would like to be more active in financial investments,  in  line  with  its  ecosystem  approach,  but limiting  them  to  a  maximum  of  15%  to  20%  of  its  free cash flow.\n\nFor  the  allocation  of  the  remaining  cash  and  separate from the dividend, the Group wishes to involve employees in  its  performance  in  order  to  foster  a  common  sense  of belonging  to  the  project  and  to  nurture  a  value  culture. Through dedicated employee share-ownership plans, the Group aims to increase employee share ownership to 10% of capital by 2030.\n\nExisting  bonds  will  remain  under  the  name,  Renault  S.A., which  is  the  issuer  for  the  Group's  industrial  activities. Each  business  will  be  able  to  use  financing  instruments according to its own needs and strategy.\n\nI",

Bold in its offer, attentive to  people,  upbeat  and  brimming  with  life,  the  Renault brand has been inventing the future of mobility.\n\nSynonymous  with  progress,  Renault  cars  have  become icons, like Renault 4 and Renault 5, cult vehicles from the 70s and 80s.\n\nSince 2010, Renault has been a pioneer in electric vehicles.\n\nThe year 2022 was marked by the major launch of Megane E-Tech  Electric  (100%  electric  technology)  and  Austral (second generation full-hybrid E-Tech technology).\n\nToday,  Renault  continues  to  innovate  on  the  latest generation of the 'Cars for life and for living' concept that it  has  invented,  for  an  ever  more  welcoming,  intuitively intelligent, warm and safe experience.\n\nInvolved in the challenges of its time, the Renault brand is committed  to  the  development  of  the  electric  mobility ecosystem.  It  uses  a  circular  vision  to  consider  the recyclability  of  the  product,  from  its  design  and  over  its entire life cycle.\n\nIn  2022,  Renault  also  continued  its  internationalization  in Latin  America  with  the  launch  of  Kwid  phase  2  in  all markets and the launch of Kwid E-Tech Electric in Brazil, where the HR13 Turbo engine was also introduced on the new Duster, to the public's delight.\n\nIn India, the promotion of the Renault range was based on \"model year\" promotions on Kwid, Triber and Kiger.\n\nIn  2023,  promotional  activities  will  also  continue  outside Europe  with  the  expansion  of  the  marketing  of  Kwid E-Tech Electric in Latin American markets, the promotion of the range in India and the expansion of Taliant in new markets in the rest of the world.\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n## With Renault E-Tech, pioneer and leader in the electric vehicle market, Renault is continuing its product offensive\n\nSince 2010, Renault, a pioneer in electric vehicles, has been one of the major players in electric mobility in Europe.\n\nThanks  to  its  Formula  1  innovation  laboratory,  Renault  has developed its E-Tech hybrid powertrain, protected by 150 patents.\n\nRenault E-Tech includes all Renault vehicles able to run on electric  traction  and  have  an  electric  motor.  There  are hybrid models, plug-in hybrids and 100% electric vehicles.\n\nThe  E-Tech  technology  was  first  used  on  the  Renault brand's Best Sellers and is now being used on new models as soon as they are launched.\n\nAcross  the  brand,  electric-powered  E-Tech  vehicles,  all technologies  combined,  represented  51%  of  private  sales  in 2022 in Europe.\n\nSince its launch, with more than 400,000 units, Zoe is one of the best-selling electric vehicle in Europe.\n\nToday, it is an electric revolution that is picking up pace. A  dynamic  supported  by  Luca  de  Meo's  'Renaulution' strategic plan. A new era where all Renault brand electric vehicles will be popular and generate value.\n\nTo  continue  the  story  of  its  electric  revolution,  Renault launched  the  first  model  of  its  'generation  2.0'  electric vehicles: All-New Megane E-Tech Electric.\n\nAll-New Megane E-Tech Electric is both an emotional and a  technological  breakthrough  in  Renault's  core  range. Connected and integrated into the EV ecosystem and the digital ecosystem of its users, it allows Renault to continue its  history  as  the  creator  of  the  'Cars  for  life  and  for living'.\n\nSporting Renault's new 'Nouvel'R' logo, All-New Megane E-Tech Electric embodies the brand's transformation.\n\nTo  cater  to  its  customers,  Renault  continues  to  enhance its vehicles with innovative connected services.\n\n## The 'technical minute' on E-Tech hybrid :\n\nHybrid vehicles are equipped with five main components :\n\n- \u25cf the  multi-mode,  clutchless  smart  gearbox  resulting from  our  Formula  1  experience  has  been  developed  to reduce energy losses. It has a total of 15 modes: three for electric  and  five  for  thermal,  which  can  work  together or not. It offers a strong acceleration capacity, intensity in  mid-range  acceleration  and  reduced  consumption and CO2 emissions;\n- \u25cf an e-engine, the main electric motor, which starts the vehicle,  ensures  100%  electric  driving,  drives  the wheels and allows the battery to be recharged;\n\nI",

It also acts as a battery regenerator during hybrid driving and as a gear shift stabilizer to avoid jolts and vibrations;\n- \u25cf a  battery  that  stores  the  energy  necessary  for  vehicle travel  and  then  ensures  the  autonomy of the vehicle in electric  mode  (battery  size  on  the  second-generation Austral E-Tech full hybrid = 2 kWh);\n- \u25cf a  combustion  engine  specially  designed  to  reduce consumption  and  CO2  emissions.  It  is  equipped  with  a particulate filter and combines economy, efficiency and performance.\n\nThese features allow the E-Tech hybrid version to run in 100% electric mode for up to 80% of city driving time.\n\n## Passenger cars (PC)\n\n## Passenger cars (PC) - EUROPE :\n\n## Renault's strategy to reconquest the C-segment:\n\nThe C-segment is at the heart of the Renaulution strategic plan.  Renault  has  mobilized  to  win  background  in  the market's  most  profitable  segment.  Arkana  began  the offensive and has been very successful since its launch in March  2021.  Renault  continues  the  offensive  in  this category  with  All-New  Megane  E-Tech  Electric  and strengthened its position in 2022 with Austral.\n\n## Austral:\n\nRenault refreshes its offering in  the  C-SUV  category  with  a particularly  ambitious  product  Austral.  This  Renaulution family SUV combines the look of an SUV with comfort worthy of the family minivans that have helped shape the history of Renault. Its elegant design is spiced up by an 'Esprit Alpine' finish,  a  first  for  Renault.  This  version  offers  special  design aspects  that  are  inspired  by  the  world  of  the  Alpine  brand and are particularly dynamic and attractive.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Austral is the first  Renault vehicle designed  on  the  CMF-CD3  platform  jointly developed within  the  Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi  Alliance. It benefits from a fully electric engine range, including two mild-hybrid units with 12v or 48v hybridization and a new generation of the E-Tech Hybrid system, developing up to 200  hp  with  a  very  low  level  of  consumption  and  of  CO2 emissions (from 104 g/km and 4.6 l/100 km).\n\nAustral's  generous  cabin  space  also  offers  an  enhanced driving  experience  thanks  to  high-tech  equipment.  The openR\u00ae  HMI*  brings  together  data  from  the  instrument panel with the openRlink\u00ae multimedia system all within the same unit. Its two 12-inch large diagonal screens provide an unprecedented,  technological  on-board  experience,  in addition to the head-up display system on the windscreen. The openRlink\u00ae multimedia system offers Google services. The  32  driver  assistance  systems  provide  peace  of  mind and safety for the driver and the passengers.\n\nLastly,  quality  and  durability  have  been  at  the  heart  of Renault  Austral's  technica  l  specifications,  from  its development to its production.\n\n*HMI = 'Human-Machine-Interface'\n\n## Megane E-Tech Electric:\n\nRenault  and  electric  vehicles  represent  10  years  of unparalleled experience and expertise, as shown by the 10 billion  'e-kilometers'  already  covered  by  more  than 500,000 vehicles sold around the world. Renault Group, an EV pioneer, is continuing its story with a product plan that targets the core market.\n\nThis  strategy  is  embodied  in  the  Renault  range  with Megane  E-Tech  Electric,  which  heralds  the  extension  of Renault's  100%  electric  range  into  the  C-segment,  the automotive market's largest segment.\n\nThis sleek and elegantly styled sedan exceeds expectations. Thanks  to  the  Alliance-developed  CMF-EV  platform,  it rewrites the rulebook and pushes the boundaries in terms of design,  footprint/spaciousness  ratio  and  versatility.  The platform  fully  dedicated  to  electric  vehicles  also  brings exceptional  energy  efficiency  to  Megane  E-Tech  Electric, which has a range of up to 470 km (WLTP).\n\nMegane  E-Tech  Electric  symbolizes  the  reinvention  of  the core  market,  representing  a  leap  forward  in  all  aspects.  It provides  unparalleled  driving  pleasure.  It  features  the  allnew openR\u00ae HMI*, which merges dashboard data with the openRlink\u00ae multimedia system. Its two 12-inch large diagonal screens provide an unprecedented, technological on-board experience.\n\n*HMI = Human-Machine Interface\n\nMegane  E-Tech  Electric  is  the  first  model  to  be  100% 'Made in ElectriCity', Renault Group's new industrial hub and  European  leader  of  electric  vehicles  located  in  the north of France.\n\nMegane E-Tech  made  its  commercial  debut  in  July  2022 and  has  already  sold  32,000  units  in  Europe,  with  a  very high  proportion  of  top-of-the-range  finishes,  thereby testifying  to  Renault's  return  to  the  premium  segment.  It has  been  acclaimed  by  the  European  press  for  its dynamism,  comfort  and  efficiency,  not  to  mention  its presentation and finish.\n\n## Arkana:\n\nBy launching its sporty Arkana SUV in Europe in the spring of 2021, Renault has shaken up traditional market codes. It has  become  the  first  generalist  manufacturer  to  offer  a coup\u00e9 SUV in Europe, this segment having so far been the prerogative of premium brands.\n\nThis new offering, which complements the other models in the  compact  range,  is  in  line  with  a  very  fast-growing global SUV market - particularly in the C-segment. It is a precursor  to  the  renewal  of  the  C-segment  in  the 'Renaulution' plan.\n\nArkana  offers  a  range  of  multiple  hybrid  engines integrating  the  innovative  145  hp  E-Tech  hybrid  engine and its 1.3 TCe 12v mild-hybrid engines in 140 hp and 160 hp (since  October  2021)  versions.  Arkana,  which  started  the offensive  in  the  C-segment,  has  been  very  successful: more than 82,000 units were sold in Europe in 2022.\n\nThese  volumes  expand  on  those  already  achieved  in South  Korea  with  approximately  20,000  units  in  2022, where the model is marketed under the name XM3.",

The biggest  markets  for  Twingo  Electric  are  France  and Germany, which together account for more than 80% of worldwide  Twingo  Electric  sales.  In  2022,  there  was  a general shift from internal-combustion engines to electric engines, with Twingo E-Tech making up 60% of all Twingo models sold.\n\nTwingo  Electric  benefits  from  Renault's  electric  vehicle expertise,  notably  through  Zoe,  Europe's  leader  in  electric vehicles for 10 years. Electric vehicle sales have increased to the point of overtaking the petrol versions of the model in some countries.\n\nSales  of  Twingo  Electric  are  marked  by  a  significant proportion of top-of-the-range versions. This good distribution of sales allows the model's financial performance to exceed expectations.\n\nThe arrival  of  the  new  'URBAN  NIGHT'  trim  in  the  range allowed  Twingo  to  reach  a  wider  audience  and  satisfy increasingly demanding  design  and  urban-mobility requirements.\n\nRenault  continues  to  market  its  longstanding  internal combustion version in parallel, with registrations reaching 18,433 units during the year 2022.\n\n## On the B segment\n\n## Zoe:\n\nCompetition  in  the  EV  market  continued  to  grow throughout 2022 with the arrival of many competitors. In this  context,  Zoe  continued  to  be  one  of  the  leaders  in terms of sales with 40,434 vehicles sold in 2022, putting it 5 th in the AB segment of EV sales.\n\nZoe demonstrates again and again Renault's desire to build the future of vehicles thanks to the better autonomy of its segment,  its  top-level  connectivity  and  its  unequaled comfort.  Zoe  also  offers  many  passive  safety  features  as well  as  ADAS  up  to  market  standards,  such  as  automatic emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection, lane keeping assist and an audible line departure warning.\n\nThe  biggest  markets  for  Zoe  are  France,  Germany,  the United Kingdom and Italy, all of which offer a wide range of products that perfectly match the needs of the market.\n\nZoe  continues  to  write  the  Renault  electric  vehicle  story, which makes it a strategic vector for the brand. The model has  been  successful  for  10  years  thanks  to  the  many technical, technological and comfort improvements, allowing it to remain the segment's most attractive offering.\n\nZoe therefore remains an important pillar of the Renault range:  the  updating  of  design  elements  as  well  as  the adding  of equipment  meant  that  top-of-the-range versions made up a significant proportion of sales.\n\n## Clio:\n\nOverall  in  2022,  Clio  was  number  8  in  global  sales  in  the B-segment with nearly 213,692  vehicles sold. In a context of  scarcity,  Renault  has  given  priority  to  sales  to  private customers  and  has  thus  been  able  to  boost  its performance in this market.\n\nIn 2022, Clio added a touch of elegance and sportiness to the  already  recognized  qualities  of  a  well-equipped, versatile compact  with  the  launch  of  its E-Tech Engineered  edition  in  September.  This  version,  with  its black and warm titanium tones (F1 blade and wheel rims, radiator grille), is marketed as a full hybrid and highlights its  engine  with  new  E-Tech  Engineered  badges.  It  is accompanied  by  a  new  shale-grey  launch  colour  for  an added touch of elegance.\n\nWith E-Tech hybrid, Clio was ranked third in the European hybrid B-segment in 2022, with more than 30,000 vehicles sold at the end of December. Clio therefore maintains its position  in  the  hybrid  market  with  technology  that  is recognized  for  its  simplicity  of  use  and  its  benefits  in terms of fuel consumption and driving pleasure.\n\n## Captur:\n\nIn  2022,  Captur  expands  its  range  and  arouses  emotion with its new version.\n\nE-Tech  Engineered  and  its  E-Tech  hybrid  145hp  and E-Tech Plug-In hybrid 160hp engines were introduced at the end of September. The new version stands out thanks to its gloss-black  grille  and  rear  end  panel,  warm  titanium accents on the F1 blade and exhaust pipes, the E-Tech label on the left-hand side and the badge at the rear for added exclusivity.  Inside,  the  same  bold  style  can  be  found  with the  E-Tech  emblem  on  the  steering  wheel  and  the dashboard  with  glossy  black  trim  enhanced  with  warm titanium  touches  that  match  the  seats.  Finally,  hybrid technology  means  drivers  can  enjoy  up  to  80%  electric driving on city roads and a guaranteed electric start 100% of the time. The E-Tech Hybrid engine also saves on fuel up to  40% (in  hybrid  mode)  and  75%  (in  Plug-In  hybrid  mode) compared with an urban-cycle ICE engine equivalent.\n\nCaptur  also  launched  a  new  range  of  equipment  and finishes  in  Europe  with  the  Equilibre,  Evolution,  Techno, RS  line,  E-Tech  Engineered  and  Iconic  versions  as  from September 2022.\n\nThe  range  offers  a  wide  range  of  engines,  unique  in  its market, to meet all needs. The range comprises a choice of  petrol  (TCe  90),  mild-hybrid  petrol  (140,  140  EDC,",

It  has  been  marketed  in  France,  Belgium and Switzerland since the summer of 2022 and is the result of  the  collaboration  of  Renault  Group  with  the  French specialist Group Pilote.\n\nIn its top-of-the-range  version,  it  is  fully  equipped, including a solar panel as standard.\n\n## Passenger cars (PC) - OUTSIDE EUROPE :\n\n## On the C segment\n\n## New Duster:\n\nThe  Turbo  engine  (1.3  T)  was  introduced  in  Brazil  on  the new Duster and was recognised for its versatility in both city and off-road use.\n\nIn 2022, the new Duster was modernised in South America with  new  multimedia  that  incorporates  Wi-Fi  replication and two USB sockets for added convenience.\n\n## Megane Sedan:\n\nIn  2022,  Megane  Sedan  continued  its  performance  with the Ph2, in its local Turkish market as well as in the other countries to which it is exported (30 countries).\n\nManufactured in Turkey, 70% of Megane Sedan sales are made in this market.\n\nWith 29,000 vehicles sold, it reached 3 rd place and a 19.7% segment share in Turkey.\n\nMore  than  37,000  Megane  Sedans  were  sold  in  2022 around the world.\n\nGeographical  expansion  is  planned  for  2023  with  the integration of new markets (Algeria, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Mongolia, Iran, etc.).\n\nExpress , manufactured in Tangier (Morocco), also reinforces Renault's position in the Combispace segment in certain markets outside Europe.",

A  disruptive  brand,  Dacia designs  vehicles  that  are  simple,  versatile,  reliable  and  in tune  with  its  customers'  lifestyles.  Dacia's  models  have become market benchmarks: Sandero, the best-selling car in Europe; Duster, the most affordable SUV; Jogger, the 5- or 7-seat  family  model;  and  Spring,  Europe's  champion  of accessible electric mobility. Dacia is a Renault Group brand, present in 44 countries. Since 2004, it has sold over 8 million vehicles.\n\nIn  1999,  guided  by  Louis  Schweitzer,  Dacia joined Renault Group and opened up to new ambitions.\n\nThis turning point in the brand's history came in 2004 with the  launch  of  Logan,  a  modern,  robust  and,  above  all, affordable  family  sedan.  Initially  designed  for  emerging markets,  at  an  unbeatable  price  of  5,000  euros,  it  was  a great  commercial  success,  including  in  Western  Europe, where it went on sale in 2005. A new vehicle at a secondhand price, it was a revolution in the automotive market.\n\n2008 saw the arrival of the Sandero, Dacia's second major launch  under  Renault  Group.  It  also  proved  to  be  its biggest  commercial  success.  Its  many  advantages  -  an interior  volume  worthy  of  a  higher  segment,  a  practical, versatile spirit and an affordable price - have made it the top-selling car for individuals in Europe since 2017.\n\nIn  2010,  Dacia  launched  the  Duster,  an  attractive  vehicle with  true  off-road  capabilities.  It  was  once  again  a commercial  success,  selling  more  than  two  million  units worldwide.\n\nIn 2021, the brand revealed Spring, the brand's first electric model,  which  is  the  most  affordable  on  the  European market.  In  2022,  Spring  is  the  third  vehicle  sold  to individuals in Europe.\n\nThe latest addition to the range, Dacia Jogger, reinvents the family  car.  As  either  a  5-  or  7-seater,  Jogger  perfectly embodies  Dacia's  positioning  and  spirit.  With  versatility thanks to its record levels of space and modularity and an attractive,  rugged  design,  Jogger  is  made  for  adventure. This  model  reinforces  Dacia's  commitment  to  making mobility accessible to all: a sustainable mobility since it will soon  be  offered  with  a  hybrid  engine.  Jogger  is  the  ideal companion for all daily activities or family recreation.\n\nDacia  thus  offers  a  complete  range  of  light  vehicles equipped with efficient engines based on Renault Group's proven  technology.  Dacia  is  the  European  leader  in  this field, offering dual-fuel vehicles (LPG and petrol) across its entire range.\n\n## Dacia today and tomorrow: Dacia will always be Dacia\n\nDacia  continues  to  write  its  own  script,  without  ever forgetting what has made it a success: the guarantee of unbeatable value for money  on  all its vehicles.\n\nFrom  design  to  sales,  manufacturing  and  transport,  the brand remains faithful to its strategy of optimizing costs at  every  step  so  that  its  customers  pay  only  for  what they need.\n\nIn 2022, Dacia  started  marketing  Jogger,  the  new 5-7-seater wagon available since March. This model takes up  the  best  of  each  category:  the  length  of  a  station wagon,  the  roominess  of  a  MPV  and  the  attributes  of an SUV.\n\nFrom  2023,  Dacia  will  offer  its  first  model  with  a  hybrid version  on  Jogger:  the  Hybrid  140  engine  developing 140  hp.  This  technology,  mastered  within  the  Renault Group,  once  again  allows  Dacia  to  benefit  from  proven technical components.\n\nAnd  Dacia  will  complete  the  engine  range  of  its  Spring electric city car with the arrival of the Electric 65 engine.\n\nIn June 2022, Dacia's new visual identity was revealed for all  of  the  brand's  vehicles.  New  Dacia  Link  emblem,  new logotype, new colors\u2026 but still the same essentiality.\n\nAfter  the  communication  media,  including  digital  (mid2021)  and  the  dealer  network,  which  began  to  change  at the start of 2022, it is the turn of the vehicles to adopt the brand's new identity. Beyond the design changes, this new identity  also  carries  commitments  for  the  future,  while capitalizing on the strong values that have made Dacia so successful.\n\nIn  September 2022, Dacia revealed Manifesto: a concept car  that  concentrates  and  reaffirms  the  brand's  values. This essential and cool vehicle is intended for outdoor use, economically and ecologically efficient. It is a laboratory of ideas from which certain innovations will benefit future production models.\n\nThe Manifesto concept respects the fundamentals of the Outdoor  with  a  4-wheel  transmission,  very  generous ground  clearance  associated  with  large  wheels  and  a bodywork resistant to the most difficult terrain. With the Manifesto concept, the brand offers a vision of a vehicle that  reduces  its  environmental  footprint  to  a  minimum. Compact and lightweight, it limits its energy consumption.\n\nThis year, Dacia is reaffirming its 3 brand values:\n\n- \u25cf Essential but cool\n\nDacia  is  ingenious,  creative,  attractive,  with  innovations such as Media Control and modular roof bars. This is also true in terms of design, with a cool look\u2026 and at no extra cost.\n\n- \u25cf Robust and outdoor\n\nReliability  and  sturdiness  are  among  the  attributes  on which Dacia has built its success. These attributes make Dacia ideal cars for outdoor activities.\n\n- \u25cf Eco-smart - economical and ecological\n\nDacia is committed to reconciling individual interests with those  of  society  as  a  whole.  Eliminating  the  superfluous thus  reduces  weight  and  therefore  saves  fuel  and  emits less CO2.",

Within its sales scope, Dacia increased its market share by +0.5 pt to 4.0%.\n\nDacia's  growth  is  due,  in  particular,  to  the  success  of  its new  range  with  private  customers.  In  2022,  Dacia achieved  a  record  7.6%  (+1.4pt)  share  of  the  European passenger-car market, retaining its place as the 3 rd bestselling brand in Europe in this channel.\n\nThis performance is based on the success of its 4 pillars: Sandero, Duster, Jogger and Spring.\n\nSandero posts  229,495  sales  in  2022  and  for  the  sixth consecutive year, Dacia Sandero is the best-selling model to private customers in Europe.\n\nDuster follows  the  same  trend  by  being  the  best-selling SUV to individuals in Europe since 2018. With 197,058 units sold in 2022 in all countries, Duster has exceeded 2 million units on the road since its launch in 2010.\n\nLaunched  in  the  spring  of  2022, Jogger has  successfully entered the station wagon market. Jogger sold 56,812 units in its first year on the market and is the second vehicle in the  C  segment  (excluding  SUVs)  sold  to  individuals  in Europe.\n\nWith 5 or 7 seats, Dacia's new family model takes up the best of each category: the length of a station wagon, the roominess of a MPV and the attributes of a SUV.\n\nLaunched  in  2021, Spring ,  Dacia's  100%  electric  vehicle, reached 48,887 units sold in 2022, i.e. +75% vs 2021 and has recorded more than 100,000 orders since its launch. It  is the 3 rd best-selling electric vehicle to individuals in Europe. Designed  to  democratize  access  to  the  electric  car  for daily  travel,  Spring  is  becoming  a  benchmark  city  car  in many  markets  and  80%  of  Spring  buyers  were  not customers of the brand previously.\n\nDesigned  around  customer  essentials,  the  Dacia  range remains  just  as  attractive  thanks  to  its  better-equipped versions. For example, 84% of Dacia Spring customers opt for the Expression trim, the Stepway versions account for 66% of Sandero sales and 63% of Duster customers opt for the  Journey  and  Extreme  versions.  Finally,  the  Up&Go offer,  which  allows  customers  to  benefit  from  a  fully equipped  vehicle  delivered  more  quickly,  is  favored  by 58% of Jogger customers and 24% of Duster customers in the  countries  where  the  offer  is  marketed:  France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Romania + (Morocco Duster Only).\n\n## Alpine: ambitions driven by success\n\nAlpine is still aiming higher one year after the presentation of the \"Renaulution\" plan. In January, Luca de Meo, CEO of Renault Group, visited Dieppe, the birthplace of the Alpine brand,  accompanied  by  Bruno  Le  Maire,  French  Minister for the Economy, Finance and Recovery. Renamed on this\n\nInformation about\n\nthe company,\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n| presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | the capital and     | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group     | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | the share ownership | meeting          | information  |\n\noccasion,  the  historic  manufacturing  site  saw  its  future confirmed  with  the  announcement  of  the  production  of the  future  100%  electric  GT  crossover  in  around  2025, thereby  ensuring  the  long-term  future  of  manufacturing and of its employees.\n\nA  true  flagship  of  the  Group,  Alpine  saw  its  ambitions confirmed  once  again  with  the  announcement  in November of  a  roll-out  on  new  continents  and  a  further expansion of the range to complement the three electric vehicles of the dream garage. As demonstrated by A110's historic results, Alpine successfully combines technological  excellence  with  a  passion  for  racing, particularly thanks to the bridges created with Formula 1. Driven by a unique commitment to motor sport, vector of a strong and international image, Alpine is aiming for pole position at all levels.\n\n## A high-end zero-emission global brand\n\nAfter  the  recent  Capital  Market  Day  announcements,  in late 2022, the Alpine brand is a true high-end brand, a fullfledged  OEM,  asset-light,  tech  focused,  a  team  of  2,000 people,  of  which  50%  are  engineers.  Being  part  of  the Group ensures Alpine access to Ampere EV and Software technological assets. Looking forward, Alpine will leverage commercial partnerships and investors support to accelerate its growth and international expansion.\n\nIn  addition,  Alpine  plans  to  launch  two  vehicles  with advanced  technologies  in  the  D  and  E  segments  to support its international expansion. Thus, half of Alpine's growth  will  come  from  new  markets  beyond  Europe, potentially including North America and China.\n\n## Alpine A110, 60 years old and just as much passion\n\nIn  2022,  Alpine  continued  its  development,  expanded  its A110  range and multiplied the number of news headlines and partnerships:\n\n- -Alpine  A110  Tour  de  Corse  75 dons  the  colors  of  the legendary  Berlinette  of  the  1975  Tour  de  Corse.  With  this limited  edition  of  150  cars,  Alpine  honors  sportiness  by celebrating a historic race;\n- -Alpine A110 GT J.

This  unique  piece  is  the  result  of  a conversation  between  Alpine  and  Obvious,  a  collective that pioneered the use of artificial intelligence in art.\n\n## The future of Alpine is being written today\n\nThe brand is actively preparing a complete range of 100% electric  vehicles.  A  first  for  Alpine!  This  exciting  future takes on a sporty look with the Alpine Alpenglow concept car. It embodies the renewal of the Alpine brand, in terms\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## 1.2.1.2. Business - to - business Powertrain activity\n\nThe  powertrain  business  provides  major  manufacturing R&D  synergies  with  the  other  Alliance  members  and Renault Group partners. A dedicated department oversees this B-to-B Powertrain activity, both in respect of exchanges  of  powertrain  parts  with  partners,  and  for related engineering activities. The aim of these synergies is to pool development costs, absorb fixed production costs, and generate economies of scale in the industrial activities of  Renault  and  its  suppliers  in  order  to  optimize  Renault Group's  free  cash  flow.  In  addition  to  the  alliance  with Nissan  and  Mitsubishi  Motors,  which  share  a  common range  of  products,  an  industrial  system  and  a  supplier network, this activity seeks to promote and offer Renault's powertrain units in the context of automotive cooperation or  third-party sales. These operations enable our partners to  benefit  from  Renault  technology  and  give  Renault access,  where  useful,  to  its  partners'  developments  and manufacturing  capacity.  This  activity  also  serves  to identify  and  set  up  one-off  cooperation  projects  and  to evaluate our competitiveness and level of quality compared to our competitors.\n\n## Strengths\n\nA modern, CO2-efficient powertrain range: with its internal combustion, hybrid and electric range, Renault has once again  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  reducing  the environmental  footprint  of  vehicles  throughout  their  life cycle. The qualities of the Renault powertrain range have convinced  our  partners  of  the  advantages  of  using  our engines for their vehicles.\n\nNissan, Renault's partner in the Alliance, has thus relied on the  latest  generations  of  Renault  engines  to  reduce average CO2 emissions in its  range  of  passenger  cars  in Europe.\n\nRenault Group is among the most efficient manufacturers in Europe in terms of certified CO2 emissions (based on 2021 CAFE).  For  more  details,  refer  to  chapter  2.3.2.1.2.3  'Tools and processes in place to manage risks and opportunities'.\n\n## The organization\n\nIn Renault's Strategy, Business Development and Business Management  Department,  dedicated  teams  work  to detect opportunities, prepare bids and negotiate contracts.  Sensitive  to  the  expectations  of  carmaker customers, these teams allow for optimal responsiveness by interfacing with all Renault Engineering departments.\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n## 1.2.1.3. Main manufacturing sites Production figures\n\nTo meet its customers demands, Renault Group relies on an  industrial  footprint  of 34  Manufacturing sites located around  the  world  as  close  as  possible  to  the  markets  in which it sells its brands' vehicles.\n\nAll these sites operate under common principles:\n\n- \u25cf making employee safety a priority;\n- \u25cf making customer satisfaction a priority;\n- \u25cf constantly  working  to  improve  the  competitiveness  of our sites, in particular through convergence towards our industry  4.0  vision  (see  section  2.4.3.7  'Plants  that  are transforming');\n- \u25cf integration of the value chain.\n\nThe  Alliance  and  Renault  Group's  strategic  partnerships offer opportunities for synergies based on the pooling of production  resources  and  enable  us  to  increase  the industrial activity of our sites. Thus:\n\n- \u25cf the  Flins,  Batilly,  Maubeuge,  Sandouville  and  Cordoba plants produce vehicles for Nissan;\n- \u25cf the  Maubeuge  plant  produces  vehicles  for  MercedesBenz Group;\n- \u25cf the Sandouville plant produces commercial vehicles for Renault Trucks;\n- \u25cf finally, Nissan plants in Chennai (India) and Cuernavaca (Mexico) produce vehicles for Renault Group.\n\nConcerning  powertrain  parts,  the  cross-utilization  of Alliance  plants  makes  it  possible  to  share  investments and optimize the use of our production capacities. Some examples:\n\n- \u25cf diesel engines are produced for Nissan in Renault Group plants  in  Cl\u00e9on  and  Valladolid,  and  petrol  engines  and components in Valladolid and Mioveni;\n- \u25cf gearboxes  are  assembled  for  Nissan  in  Cl\u00e9on,  Pitesti, Seville, Cacia and Los Andes;\n- \u25cf Renault Group Le Mans plant manufactures chassis for Nissan and Mercedes-Benz Group;\n- \u25cf the  Cl\u00e9on  foundry  produces  crankcase  blanks  for Mercedes-Benz  Group  and  the  Valladolid  foundry produces crankcase blanks for Nissan;\n- \u25cf Nissan's plants in Yokohama (Japan) and Chennai (India) produce  engines  (petrol  and/or  electric)  for  Renault Group, and Cantabria, Avila (Spain) and  Sunderland (UK) produces  mechanical  components  (rotors,  cardles/ axles) for Renault Group.\n\nRenault Group also relies on partnerships and/or industrial cooperation for the production of vehicles:\n\n- \u25cf in  China: in Shiyan (eGT) for the production of Spring, in Nanchang (JMEV) for the production of vehicles for the Mobilize (Limo) and EV Easy brands;\n- \u25cf in Lagos (Nigeria), Coscharis assembles DKD (Dismantled Knocked Down) vehicles for Dacia.\n\nI",

The Renault Group sales network\n\n## Organization of the distribution networks\n\nRenault Group distributes vehicles under its brands through both primary and secondary distribution networks.\n\nThe  primary  network  is  contractually  bound  to  Renault Group brands via a concession agreement (or agency or authorized  repair  center  agreement,  depending  on  the country) and comprises:\n\n- \u25cf dealers independent of Renault Group;\n- \u25cf establishments belonging to  Renault  Group  through  its subsidiary Renault Retail Group (RRG) or branches.\n\nThe  secondary  network  includes  mainly  smaller  sites, independent  of  Renault  Group,  and  bound  contractually to  the  primary  network,  most  often  through  an  agency contract  or  through  an  authorized  distribution  or  repair center contract. These are generally smaller sites whose role is to round out the territorial coverage of the primary networks of the Renault Group brands.\n\nIn  the  context  of  Renaulution  presented  at  the  beginning  of 2021, the Renault and Dacia brands announced the renewal of their  visual  identity,  the  coordinated  deployment  of  which started  in  2022.  At  the  same  time,  in  collaboration  with  the Renault Enlarged Dealership Group (GCRE), Renault Group has redefined  the  bases  of  the  future  contractual  relationship\n\nwith its Renault and Dacia Networks, whose new contracts will enter into force in 2024. Renault Group has thus confirmed its ambition to ensure sustainable and profitable growth for the Manufacturer  and  for  its  network  by  relying  on  strong independent  players  who  promote  the  image  of  Renault Group's brands while optimizing territorial coverage in order to meet customers' expectations.\n\nCustomer  satisfaction  is  a  core  focus  of  Renault  Group's policy.  The  acceleration  of  sales  of  E-Tech  vehicles  relies  on the continuous upgrading of methods, support for networks, the spread of E-Tech services and the necessary skills.\n\n## Renault Pro+: the expert network of commercial vehicles for professionals\n\nSince 2009, the Renault Pro+ network has been dedicated to  serving  and  supporting  professionals  in  more  than 25 countries.\n\nNearly 600 Renault Pro+ centers make up this specialized network  and  apply  specific  standards  that  meet  the requirements of professionals.\n\nWhether  regarding  the  choice  of  vehicles,  including coach-built and customized light commercial vehicles, or advice from expert, trained teams or after-sales service, everything is done to satisfy the needs of professionals.\n\nRenault  Pro+  is  always  at  the  side  of  professionals  to guarantee the choice of a work tool adapted to their uses and its maximum availability over time.\n\n|                                          | 2022   | 2022       | 2021   | 2021       | 2021       |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|------------|--------|------------|------------|\n| Number of Renault sites                  | Global | o/w Europe | Global | o/w Europe | o/w Russia |\n| Primary network                          | 4,958  | 2,680      | 5,152  | 2,619      | 156        |\n| o/w RRG dealers and branches             | 111    | 101        | 159    | 147        | 0          |\n| o/w Renault Pro+ specialized dealerships | 663    | 502        | 667    | 507        | 0          |\n| Secondary network                        | 4,993  | 4,744      | 5,288  | 5,007      | 0          |\n| TOTAL SITES                              | 9,951  | 7,424      | 10,440 | 7,626      | 156        |\n\n|                       | 2022   | 2022       | 2021   | 2021       |\n|-----------------------|--------|------------|--------|------------|\n| Number of Dacia sites | Global | o/w Europe | Global | o/w Europe |\n| Primary network       | 3,088  | 2,738      | 2,986  | 2,626      |",

Renault Retail Group (RRG)\n\nA  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  manufacturer,  RRG  is Renault  Group's  leading  European  distributor of  vehicle sales and related services and after-sales activities.\n\nRRG's mission is to distribute all of the Alliance's products and  services  (Renault,  Dacia,  Alpine  and  Nissan,  in  some countries) to professional and individual customers.\n\nActivities  cover  new  vehicles,  used  vehicles  and  spare parts and also includes maintenance, mechanics, bodywork,  express  repairs  (Renault  Minute),  short-term rental (Renault Rent), mobility services (Renault Mobility), financing and brokerage.\n\nRRG  has  nearly  101  sales  and  service  outlets  in  six European countries: Germany, Spain, France, Italy, United Kingdom and Switzerland.\n\nIn  2022,  RRG  pursued  its  plan  to  change  the  scope  of  its operations  by  selling  in  France  the  establishments located  in  Angers  (Group  Rouyer),  Tours,  Loches-Chinon and  Le  Mans  (Group  Gemy),  Rouen  and  Le  Havre  (Group\n\nMary)  to  reliable  and  robust  buyers  who  have  preserved jobs.  Furthermore,  RRG  moved  out  of  the  Courcelles building  (Paris  17),  which  had  been  rented;  activities  and staff were allocated to the other sites in Paris. The same applied  to  Lyon  Est,  whose  operations  and  staff  left  the site, which is up for sale, for other sites in Lyon.\n\nFollowing the same principles, some sales were also made outside France:\n\n- \u25cf disposal  and  closure  of  activities  in  Poland  (4),  Czech Republic (1), Belgium (3), Luxembourg (3) and Portugal (2);\n- \u25cf partial disposal of activities in Italy (1) and Spain (8).\n\nThe other two highlights in 2022 were:\n\n- \u25cf a return to profitability with a positive operating margin, reaching  \u20ac85  million,  driven  by  NV  and  UV  activities which  showed  strong  growth  in  profitability,  thanks  to the optimisation of the mix of channels and unit margins;\n- \u25cf the  launch  of  the  Tekion  project:  a  new  business management  system  that  will  enter  the  test  phase in 2023.\n\n| 2022                                 | Revenues  (\u20ac billion)   | NV sales   | UV sales   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Total                                | 6.4                     | 171,000    | 112,000    |\n| France                               | 3.6                     | 92,000     | 73,000     |\n| Europe                               | 2.8                     | 79,000     | 39,000     |\n|                                      |                         | 2022       | 2021       |\n| Number of Renault Retail Group sites |                         | Europe     | Europe     |\n| o/w RRG dealers and branches         |                         | 101        | 147        |\n\nI",

Automotive cash flow management\n\nFor Automotive, Renault Group has established a financial organization whose aims are to:\n\n- \u25cf automate  the  processing  of  routine  cash  inflows  and outflows;\n- \u25cf meet  the  subsidiaries'  refinancing  requirements  and pool surplus cash;\n- \u25cf centralize the handling  of  euro-denominated  and foreign  exchange  transactions  so  as  to  optimize  the management  of  currency, liquidity, interest rate, counterparty  and  country  risk  while  reducing  financial and administrative costs;\n- \u25cf centralize  virtually  all  financing  operations,  including securities  issuance,  bank  loans  and  credit  agreements, at parent company level.\n\nWithin this  framework, Renault's Financing and Treasury Department (DFT), which is responsible for cash management and financing for the Group's industrial and commercial  activities,  has  a  specialized  entity,  Renault Finance, which it uses to25\n\n- \u25cf conduct capital market trading after intra-Group netting: forex, rates, commodities and short-term investments;\n- \u25cf make  foreign  currency  payments  for  French  and European subsidiaries;\n- \u25cf conduct  cash  pooling  in  the  currencies  of  certain subsidiaries  (United  Kingdom,  Poland,  Switzerland  and the Czech Republic).\n\nFor  the  euro  zone,  cash  is  centralized  through  a  Renault S.A.  IT  platform  that  manages  all  subsidiaries'  eurodenominated  transactions  and  interfaces  with  the automotive sector's banks.\n\nOutside  the  euro  zone,  Renault  Finance  offers  certain subsidiaries access to centralized cash management tools.\n\n## Renault Finance\n\nA Swiss company domiciled in Lausanne, Renault Finance is active in the international financial markets, following a set  of  strict  risk  management rules. Its arbitrage activity allows  it  to  obtain  very  competitive  quotes  for  financial products from foreign exchange markets, interest rates or raw materials. This makes it Renault's natural counterparty  for  most  automotive  market  transactions.

In this  context,  exposure  to  residual  value  risk  will increase.\n\n| presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group     | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n## Business activity 3\n\nDespite  an  automotive  market  still  penalized  by  the semiconductor  shortage,  Mobilize  Financial  Services  is experiencing 3.3% increase in new financing compared to 2021, driven by higher average amounts financed.\n\nIn  an  automotive  market  down  4.6%,  the  volumes  of  the Alliance brands stood at 1.90 million vehicles in 2022, down 5.7%.  The  penetration  rate  amounts  to  44.8%  down  1.3pt compared to 2021.\n\nMobilize Financial Services financed 1,195,380 contracts in 2022,  down  6.4%  compared  to  2021.  Used  Car  Financing decreased by 1.2% compared to 2021 with 341,655 financed contracts.  Electric  vehicle  financing  reached  82,179  units in 2022, i.e., 6.9% of the number of new financing contracts compared to 6.4% in 2021.\n\nNew  financings  (excluding  credit  cards  and  personal loans)  stood  at  \u20ac18.0  billion,  up  3.3%  thanks  to  the  10.4% increase of the average financed amount.\n\nAverage  performing  assets  (APA) 4 related  to  the  Retail Activity totalized \u20ac38  billion in 2022. The  amount increased by 1.8%, thanks to the progression observed on the new financings.\n\nAverage  performing  assets  linked  to  the  Wholesale Activity  amounted  to  \u20ac6.4  billion,  down  9.8%,  due  to electronic  component  shortage  and  stock  optimization policy  in  the  dealer  network  implemented  by  Renault Group.  Overall,  average  performing  assets  totalized \u20ac44.7 billion, down slightly 0.1% compared to 2021.\n\nThe  number  of  insurance  and  service  contracts  sold  in 2022 account for 3.8 million down 4.7% compared to 2021 especially  due  to  the  fall  of  registrations  and  number  of new financing contracts.\n\nEurope  region  remains  the  main  pillar  for  Mobilize Financial Services activity, with new financings (excluding credit cards and personal loans) totalizing \u20ac15.8 billion, up 2.7% compared to 2021, and representing 88% of Mobilize Financial  Services  new  financings.  The  growth  is  mostly concentrated in Germany and in the UK.\n\nAmericas region, strongly impacted by the sanitary crisis in  2021  is  back  in  the  black.  The  new  financings  are  up 23.2% compared to 2021, reaching \u20ac1.4 billion. All countries within  the  region  are  improving  compared  to  previous year.\n\nNew financings for Africa - Middle-East - India and Pacific region amounted to \u20ac0.8 billion, down 11.0% compared to 2021. This decrease is mainly due to the decline of Renault Group registrations in Korea.\n\n- 2 Net assets at year-end: total net outstandings at year-end + operational leasing operations net of depreciation and provisions.\n- 3 Excluding Equity Affiliated Companies.

This increase is partly explained by a one-off positive impact of 101 million euros  related  to  the  valuation  of  interest  rate  swaps covering  sight  deposits  in  the  context  of  rising  interest rates.  The  contribution  to  NBI  from  Services  activities represented 32.7%, down slightly by 2.9 points compared with 2021.\n\nOperating  expenses  amount  to  624  million  euros,  up  54 million euros compared to the end of 2021. They represent 1.39% of NPAs, an increase of 12 basis points compared to 2021. This 12 basis point increase is linked to investments to  support the growth of our client finance business and the development of new activities such as car subscription.\n\nThe cost of risk on client activity (individual and corporate financing) was 0.55% of net banking income at end-2022,\n\ncompared with 0.26% of net banking income at end-2021. This  is  in  line  with  historical  trends,  after  a  year  of increased  provisions  for  Covid  in  2020  and  reversals  of these provisions in 2021 following the normalization of the health situation. The cost of risk on the network's business (concessionaire  financing)  was  a  reversal  of  -0.33%  of NPA  at  the  end  of  December  2022,  versus  a  reversal  of -0.52% at the end of December 2021. The total cost of risk was 0.44% of the APM, or 195 million euros, compared with 0.14%, or 62 million euros at the end of December 2021.\n\nA depreciation  of  119  million  euros  on  the  equity investment  in  the  Russian  JV  has  been  recorded, impacting net income.\n\nPre-tax income stands at 1,050 million euros compared to 1,194 million euros at the end of December 2021.\n\nConsolidated net income - parent company shareholders' share  -  was  700  million  euros  in  2022,  compared  to 846 million euros at the end of December 2021.\n\n## Results\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nIn  2022,  the  average  performing  assets  of  the  Retail Customers  business  increased  thanks  to  growth  in  new financing. The Dealer network activity's average productive  assets  were  negatively  impacted  by  the semiconductor shortage as well as the optimization policy for vehicle inventories in the dealer network, implemented by Renault Group brands.\n\nAt  the  end  of  December  2022,  net  assets 5 amounted  to \u20ac49.5  billion,  compared  to  \u20ac45  billion  at  the  end  of December 2021 (+10.2%).\n\nConsolidated  equity  amounted  to  \u20ac6,310  million  compared with \u20ac6,222 million at the end of December 2021 (+1.41%).\n\n## Solvency\n\nThe  overall  solvency  ratio 6 came  to  16.84%  (including  a CET1  ratio  of  14.47%)  at  end-2022,  compared  with  17.68% (including  a  CET1  ratio  of  14.76%)  at  end-December  2021. The  decrease  in  the  overall  ratio  is  explained  by  the increase  in  RWEA  (+\u20ac2,008m),  largely  due  to  the  rise  in network  business  (+\u20ac1,542m),  and  by  the  inclusion  of structural  foreign  exchange  risk  in  the  market  risk component 7 (+\u20ac1,002m  in  RWEA).  This  increase  in  REA 8 is partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  CET1  capital  (+339  M\u20ac) due  to  a  reduction  in  EL/PROV 9 (+257  M\u20ac)  and  to  the integration  of  the  half-yearly  result  deducted  from  the forecast dividend (+100 M\u20ac).\n\n- 5 Net assets at year-end: net total outstandings + operating lease transactions net of depreciation and impairment.\n- 6 Ratio including interim profits net of forecast dividends, after approval by the regulator in accordance with Article 26 (2) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013.\n- 7 Guideline (EBA/GL/2020/09) on structural foreign exchange positions applicable from 1 January 2022.\n- 8 Risk Exposure Amount: RWA (Credit Risk), CVA, Operational Risk and Market Risk.\n- 9 The  calculation  of  EL/PROV  deductions  at  sound  or  defaulted  portfolio  level  rather  than  at  the  contract  level  as  in  the  previous  year  (CRR  article  159 confirmed by Q&A EBA 2013\\_573) led to an increase in CET1 capital (+\u20ac212m) partially offset by a decrease in T2 (-\u20ac113m).\n\nI",

The  labor  market  is still  robust  with  an  unemployment  rate  that  stays  low (3.5%  at  the  end  of  December).  Inflation  continues  to  be very high but is starting to show the first signs of slowing down (6.5% in December compared to 7.1% in November, 7.8% in October, 8.3% in August).\n\nThe persistence of a tight labor market and high inflation led  the  Fed  to  begin  its  monetary  tightening  cycle  in March.  The  Fed  Funds  rate  target  was  thus  raised  by 425 bps to reach 4.25-4.50% at the end of December.\n\nThe  ECB  increased  its  key  rate  by  250  bps  during  2022, raising the marginal deposit rate from -0.50% to 2.00%. It plans  to  raise  interest  rates  further  to  ensure  a  rapid return  of  inflation  to  its  medium-term  target  of  2%.  The ECB also specified that it will begin to reduce its balance sheet  from  the  beginning  of  March  2023  (the  asset purchase program 'APP' portfolio will be reduced by an average  of  \u20ac15  billion  per  month  until  the  end  of  the second quarter of  2023,  and  its  subsequent  pace  will  be determined over time).\n\nThe Bank of England (BoE), one of the first central banks to have started the monetary tightening cycle, has raised its key rate several times, bringing it to 3.50% from 0.25% at the end of 2021.\n\nFears  of  stagflation  led  to  high  volatility  in  the  financial markets.  In  Europe,  bond  yields  rose  in  the  path  of  US rates.  The  ten-year  German  sovereign  bond  rate  rose above the 2% mark to 2.57%, compared to a level of -0.19% at the end of 2021.\n\nFollowing  the  slowdown  in  inflation  in  the  United  States and  Europe,  equities  and  corporate  bonds,  which  had suffered  in  the  second  and  third  quarters,  began  to recover at the end of the year. After hitting a -25% decline at the end of September, the Euro Stoxx 50 ended the year at  3,793,  down  -11.74%.  Credit  spreads  experienced  a similar  trend:  after  peaking  at  138  bps  in  July,  the  IBOXX Corporate Bond Euro index stood at 99 bps at the end of December compared to 61 bps at the end of December 2021.\n\nIn  this  volatile  market  context,  the  Group  issued  the equivalent  of  \u20ac2.8  billion  in  2022  and  launched  its  first green bond for \u20ac500 million. Proceeds are being used to\n\nfinance  electric  vehicles  and  charging  infrastructures. This transaction demonstrates the Group's willingness to support  the  transition  to  electric mobility and  its commitment to tackling climate change. The Group also returned  to  the  Swiss  market,  with  the  placement  of  a CHF110  million  bond  with  a  three-year  maturity  and extended  the  maturity  of  its  debt  with  a  \u20ac650  million transaction  with  a  six-year  maturity.  Two  issues  of  \u20ac750 million  at  3.5  and  three  years  respectively  were  also carried out.\n\nIn the securitization market, the Group placed approximately \u20ac700 million in notes backed by auto loans granted by its French subsidiary. The Spanish branch also carried out its first securitization, issuing \u20ac1.1 billion in selfsubscribed  Senior  notes,  which  reinforced  the  liquidity reserve.\n\nThe  retail  savings  activity  proved  to  be  particularly dynamic  and  competitive  in  terms  of  funding  cost. Deposits allowed to reduce the impact of the increase in the  cost  of  market  funding,  thus  demonstrating  the relevance of the financing diversification strategy initiated 10 years ago. Savings deposits received increased by \u20ac3.4 billion since the beginning of the year to stand at \u20ac24.4 billion.\n\nThese  resources,  to  which  should  be  added,  on  the European scope, \u20ac4.4 billion  in  undrawn  confirmed  bank lines,  \u20ac4.6  billion  in  collateral  eligible  for  Central  Bank monetary policy operations, and \u20ac5.8 billion in high quality liquid assets  (HQLA),  enable  the  Mobilize  Financial Services  group  to  maintain  the  financing  granted  to  its customers  for  11  months  without  access  to  external liquidity.  As  of  31  December  2022,  the  liquidity  reserve  of the  Mobilize  Financial  Services  group  (Europe  scope) stood at \u20ac14.9 billion.\n\nRCI  Banque's  overall  sensitivity  to  interest  rate  risk remained below the Group's limit of \u20ac70 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, a parallel rise in rates would have an  impact  on  the  Group's  net  interest  income  (NII)  of \u20ac0.78 million, with the following contribution by currency:\n\n- \u25cf -\u20ac1.6 million in EUR;\n- \u25cf -\u20ac0.3 million in BRL;\n- \u25cf -\u20ac 0.1 million in KRW;\n- \u25cf +\u20ac 1.0 million in GBP;\n- \u25cf +\u20ac0.1 million in PLN;\n- \u25cf -\u20ac 0.3 million in CHF.\n\nThe  sum  of  the  absolute  values  of  the  sensitivities  to  a parallel interest rate shock 10 in each currency amounts to \u20ac7.0 million.\n\nThe  group  RCI  Banque's  consolidated  transactional foreign exchange position 11 is \u20ac12.7 million.",

The  Worldwide Mobility  Department  with  the  support  of  Renault  M.A.I (Mobility as an  Industry)  has  made  it  possible  to accelerate  synergies  since  2020,  simplify  the  decisionmaking chain, clarify existing offers and create new ones, with  the  launch  on  January  14,  2021,  of  the  new  Mobilize Business  Unit  which  now  brings  together  all  services (financial with Mobilize F.S., Energy, Mobilities).\n\n| presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group     | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\nbasis  and  has  been  marketed  in  the  form  of  flexible packages since 2022 in Madrid and Paris.\n\nMobilize  brings  together  several  initiatives  and  start-ups around mobility and energy ecosystems:\n\n- \u25cf Zity by Mobilize ,  this  self-service,  car-sharing service is available in Madrid (since 2017) and in Paris and several nearby municipalities (since 2020) as well as in Lyon and Milan;\n\nMobilize has also launched several connected services to promote the adoption of electric vehicles:\n\n- \u25cf 'Mobilize Charge  Pass': this app  provides  access (location, routing and payment) to a network of more than 260,000 charging stations across 25 European countries. The app is available in Germany, Belgium and Spain;\n- \u25cf 'Mobilize  Smart  Charge': this  app  allows  Renault  EV owners  to  optimize  the  cost  of  charging  their  car  at home  while  reducing  their  carbon  footprint  and  is available in France, the Netherlands and Belgium;\n- \u25cf 'Battery Certificate': this  app  allows  owners of Renault and  Dacia  electric  vehicles,  in  France,  to  create  a certificate  showing  their  battery's  remaining  energy capacity  directly  on  their  smartphone  or  the  internet. Objective: to facilitate the sale of used electric vehicles.\n\nMobilize  is  committed  to  carbon  neutrality,  the  circular economy and extending the life cycle of vehicles. Within the  Flins  Refactory,  Mobilize  is  centralizing  initiatives  to extend  the  life  cycle  of  vehicles  and  batteries.  It implements  solutions  for  the  reuse  of  batteries,  in particular for energy storage solutions, and thus supports the energy transition.\n\nMobilize solutions can be combined within the territories to help them achieve carbon neutrality, as is already the case in the  Smart  Islands,  in  Europe  (Porto-Santo,  Belle-\u00cele-en-Mer, Ile d'Yeu, etc.), and in Brazil (Fernando de Noronha).\n\nTogether  with  various  partners,  Renault  Group  develops and offers its  customers energy-related services so that they  benefit  from  all  the  advantages  of  their  electric vehicles.  For  example:  Renault  Goup  created  the  Elto entity in 2020 in order to offer its professional customers tailor-made charging solutions. These offers are already deployed  in  11  countries  in  Europe  with  local  partners:  in France with Solstyce, in Germany with GP Joule, in Belgium with Enersol and in Spain with IBIL.\n\nRenault  Group  has  also  entered  into  a  partnership  with Jedlix ,  since  2017,  a  Dutch  technology  start-up,  with  which the  Group  has  developed  a  smart  charging  mobile application which makes it possible to control the charging of electric vehicles, guaranteeing  users  carbon-free electricity  and  savings  on  their  energy  bill.  This  service, operational  in  the  Netherlands,  France  and  Belgium,  is intended  to  be  deployed  in  other  European  countries.  In 2021,  Mobilize  Ventures  strengthened  its  commitment  to Jedlix  as  part  of  a  capital  increase  carried  out  with  2  new energy  partners,  leaders  in  their  markets:  the  Japanese group Osaka Gaz and the Norwegian Skagerak.\n\nI",

For  24  years,  this  partnership  has  offered  a unique, pragmatic and agile model, always able to evolve and  integrate  new  projects  and  partners.  Extended  to Mitsubishi group, it forms the largest automotive alliance in the world.\n\n## 1.3.2 History\n\nOn  March  27,  1999,  Renault  and  Nissan  Motor  Co.  Ltd ('Nissan')  entered  into  the  founding  agreement  of  the Alliance,  the  Alliance  and  Equity  Participation  Agreement (the  'AEPA').  Under  the  provisions  of  the  AEPA,  Renault acquired  a  36.8%  stake  in  Nissan's  share  capital  and subscribed for share subscription warrants that enabled it to  increase  its  stake  first  to  39.9%  and  then  to  44.4%  of Nissan's  capital.  For  its  part,  Nissan  was  given  the opportunity to acquire a stake in Renault.\n\nNissan's turnaround and the Alliance's rapid success led the partners to take a new step forward by accelerating the  implementation  of  their  financial  agreements,  and further institutionalizing their commercial and industrial cooperation.\n\nAccordingly,  on  December  20,  2000,  Renault  and  Nissan entered into the Alliance's second framework agreement, the 'Alliance Master Agreement' (the 'AMA'), which was reiterated  and  updated  on  March  28,  2002,  in  the 'Restated Alliance Master Agreement' (the 'RAMA').\n\nUnder the AMA and then the RAMA, Renault strengthened its  stake  in  Nissan,  and  Nissan  acquired  a  15%  stake  in Renault's share capital:\n\n- \u25cf on  March  1,  2002,  Renault  increased  its  stake  in  Nissan from 36.8% to 44.4%; on April 6, 2010, a share exchange agreement  between  Renault,  Nissan  and  Daimler resulted  in  Renault's  stake  in  Nissan  decreasing  from 44.4% to 43.4% at the same time as Daimler entered the capital of Renault and Nissan;\n- \u25cf on March 29, 2002, and May 28, 2002, Nissan increased its stake  in  Renault  to  15%  through  two  capital  increases reserved  to  Nissan  Finance  Co.  Ltd.,  a  wholly  owned subsidiary of Nissan;\n\nThe Alliance has proven its leadership in electric vehicles and is developing the innovative technologies of tomorrow's  autonomous,  connected  and  affordable vehicles.\n\nThe Alliance aims to create value for each partner and for all stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, etc.).\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article L. 233-31 of the French Commercial Code, Renault shares held by Nissan Finance Co. Ltd. are not taken into account in the calculation of the quorum,  and  do  not  confer  voting  rights,  i.e.,  the  voting rights  attached  to  such  shares  cannot  be  exercised  at Annual General Meetings.\n\nIn  application of the RAMA, Renault-Nissan B.V. ('RNBV') was  incorporated  on  March  28,  2002.  This  Amsterdambased company has been owned equally by Renault and Nissan  since  2002.  It  was  designed  to  coordinate  the common activities on a global scale and contribute to the preparation of the Alliance's strategy and mid and longterm planning (see section 1.3.3.3 'Powers of RNBV').\n\nIn the context of the increase by the French State's stake in  the  share  capital  of  Renault  in  2015  and  then  the introduction of double voting rights, the Board of Directors of Renault authorized, on December 11, 2015, the signing of the  following  agreements,  which  the  Annual  General Meeting approved on April 29, 2016:\n\n- \u25cf a  governance  agreement  entered  into  on  February  4, 2016,  between  Renault  and  the  French  State,  aimed  at restricting the free exercise of the French State's voting rights  for  certain  decisions  submitted  to  Renault's Annual General Meeting;\n- this agreement is described in section 6.2.6.2 'Shareholders' agreements on shares and voting rights of the Company;\n- \u25cf a third amendment to the RAMA, signed on December 11, 2015,  between  Renault  and  Nissan  that  enshrines  in particular  the  constant  practice  of  non-interference  of Renault in the governance of Nissan.\n\nI\n\n01",

On  that  occasion,  and  in accordance  with  applicable  regulations,  Renault  bought back  1,400,000  shares  (i.e.,  10%  of  the  shares  sold  by  the French  State)  with  the  aim  of  implementing  an  offer reserved for employees and former employees of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn  October  20,  2016,  Nissan,  which  is  43.4%  owned  by Renault,  acquired  a  34%  stake  in  Mitsubishi  Motors,  thus becoming its largest shareholder.\n\nOn March 12, 2019, Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi Motors formed  the  Alliance  Operating  Board,  the  body  that oversees  operations  and,  in  practice,  performs  the governance  functions  of  the  Alliance,  signaling  a  new beginning for the world's leading automotive alliance.\n\nIn 2020, the three partner companies reaffirmed that the Alliance  is  essential  for  strategic  growth  and  improving their  respective  competitiveness.  Thus,  on  May  27,  2020, the  Alliance  announced  the  adoption  of  a  new  business model for cooperation.\n\nEach member becomes a reference in the regions where it has the best strategic assets, and acts as a facilitator and provider of support for the competitiveness of the others.\n\nThe  three  members  build  on  the  Alliance's  existing strengths,  such  as  joint  purchasing,  by  leveraging  their respective leadership positions and geographic strengths to support their partners' development.\n\nThe acquisition of Mitsubishi Motors by Nissan enabled the expanded Alliance to consolidate its industrial position.\n\n## 1.3.3 Functioning of the Alliance\n\n## 1.3.3.1. The Alliance Operating Board\n\nThe Alliance Operating Board, created on March 12, 2019, is in  charge  of  operational  coordination  between  Renault Group,  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi  Motors  and  will  take  new initiatives  that  will  create  value  for  their  respective shareholders and employees.\n\nThis new  Alliance  Operating  Board  comprises  four members,  appointed  by  Renault  Group  (two  members, including the Chairman of the Alliance Operating Board), by  Nissan  (one  member),  and  by  Mitsubishi  Motors (one member).\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Alliance Operating Board was composed  of  Jean-Dominique  Senard,  Chairman  of  the Board  of  Directors  of  Renault  and  Chairman  of  the Alliance  Operating  Board,  Luca  de  Meo,  Chief  Executive Officer of Renault, Makoto Uchida, Chief Executive Officer of  Nissan,  and  Takao  Kato,  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Mitsubishi Motors.\n\nThe decisions of the Alliance Operating Board are made by all  members  by  consensus.  The  Alliance  Operating  Board meets  monthly,  and  as  often  as  the  Alliance's  interest requires,  in  France,  in  Japan  or  by  videoconference  when necessary.\n\nThe Alliance Operating Board oversees the operations and performs the governance functions of the Alliance.\n\nThe Alliance Operating  Board's  General  Secretary, V\u00e9ronique  Sarlat-Depotte,  appointed  in  April  2021,  is tasked  with  coordinating  and  facilitating  the  Alliance's major  projects  launched  to  accelerate  the  operating efficiency of the respective companies. and reports to the Alliance Operating Board.\n\nThe  Alliance  Operating  Board  is  assisted  by  specific operating committees that make recommendations on new sources of value creation between the three carmakers.\n\nDuring  2022,  Alliance  members  were  always  at  the forefront  of  the  industry  in  terms  of  their  performance, products,  technologies  and  markets,  while  continuing  to benefit from joint purchasing and development.\n\nDuring  the  2022  AOBs 12 ,  the  Alliance  Operational  Board met  seven  times,  including  twice  in  Japan  and  once  in France. In addition, a meeting of the Boards of Directors of Renault  Group,  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi  Motors  was  also organized  in  Yokohama  in  November  2022  in  order  to share  the  progress  of  joint  work,  and  an  extraordinary workshop took place in December 2022 in France, in order to  accelerate  synergies.  Strategic  plans  for  platforms, vehicles,  powertrains,  batteries,  electronic  architecture and advanced engineering have been reviewed, as every year.  The  ranges  of  each  company  were  shared  and reviewed in depth, and new synergy projects were studied.\n\nOpportunities  were  clearly  identified,  the  work  plan  was established,  and  technical  roadmaps  were  recognized and shared.\n\nA  global  product  plan  for  2025  (ICE  +  xHEV  +  BEV),  80% based on common platforms, is being rolled out, as is the BEV-specific product plan, increased to 90% by common platforms (vs. 0% at the end of 2020).\n\nRegarding  the  future  battery  strategy,  the  Alliance  is converging  towards  shared  common  technology/cost/ capacity  roadmaps.  For  a  next  generation  of  electric vehicles,  the  Alliance  has  selected  a  single  supplier  to produce  its  batteries  for  Renault  Group  and  Nissan  in France, the UK, Japan and China.",

In  Europe,  for  example, Renault Group is working closely with Mitsubishi Motors on several  cross-badging  projects  in  the  B-segment  with regular follow-up meetings and milestones.\n\nAn  'Alliance  Com'  event  was  held  on  January  27,  2022, during which Renault Group, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors announced a  common  roadmap  for  2030 (described below) dedicated  to  electric  vehicles  and  smart  and connected mobility, sharing investments for the benefit of its three members and their customers.\n\n## Alliance vision for 2030\n\n## Moving together for the benefit of each\n\nThe Alliance members  have  developed  a  'smart differentiation'  methodology  that  defines  the  desired level of commonality for each vehicle, integrating several parameters  of  possible  pooling,  such  as  platforms, production plants, powertrains or vehicle segment. This is supplemented  and  enhanced  by  a  stricter  approach  to design  and  upper-body  differentiation.  For  example,  the common platform  for  the  C  and  D  segment  carries  five models from three brands of the Alliance (Nissan Qashqai and  X-Trail,  Mitsubishi  Outlander,  Austral  and  upcoming Espace). Strengthening this process, the Alliance members will enhance usage of common platforms in the coming  years  from  60%  today  to  80%  of  its  combined 90 models in 2026. This will allow each company to deepen their  focus  on  their  customers'  needs,  their  best  models and  core  markets,  while  also  extending  innovations across the Alliance, at a lower cost.\n\nAs part of this, Mitsubishi Motors will reinforce its presence in Europe with two new models, among them the new ASX based on Renault Group best-sellers.\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n## Five common EV platforms: the largest global offer of the industry\n\nRenault Group, Nissan and  Mitsubishi Motors  have pioneered the EV market, with more than \u20ac10 billion already invested in the field of electrification. In the main markets (Europe,  Japan,  the  US,  China),  15  Alliance  plants  already produce  parts,  motors,  batteries  for  10  EV  models  on  the streets. More than one million electric cars have been sold to date and 40 billion kilometers driven.\n\nBuilding on this unique expertise, the Alliance is accelerating  with  a  total  \u20ac23  billion  more  investment  in the next five years on electrification, leading to 35 new EV models by 2030.\n\n90%  of  these  models  will  be  based  on  five  common  EV platforms, covering most markets, in all major regions:\n\n- \u25cf CMF-AEV ,  the  most  affordable  platform  in  the  world,  is the base for the new Dacia Spring;\n- \u25cf KEI-EV ,  (mini vehicle) platform family for ultra-compact EVs;\n- \u25cf LCV-EV , family platform family for professional customers, as the base for the Kangoo and Nissan Town Star;\n- \u25cf CMF-EV, the global, flexible EV platform is already on the roads  as  the  base  for  the  Nissan  Ariya  and  Megane E-Tech Electric. The CMF-EV platform, with its technological  innovations  and  the  potential  offered  by its  modularity,  is  a  benchmark  platform  for  a  new generation of electric vehicles for the Alliance partners. The  platform  has  been  created  to  integrate  and optimize  all  the  elements  specific  to  a  100%  electric powertrain, hosting a new, high-performance motor and an ultra-thin  battery.  By  2030,  more  than  15  models  will be based on the CMF-EV platform, with up to 1.5 million cars produced on this platform per year;\n- \u25cf CMF-BEV , the most  competitive  compact  electric platform in the world, to be launched  in  2024. It provides  up  to  400  km  range;  its  aerodynamics performances  are  outstanding,  helping  reduce  cost  by 33%  and  power  consumption  by  more  than  10% compared  with  the  current  Zoe.  It  will  be  the  base  for 250,000  vehicles  a  year  under  the  Renault,  Alpine  and Nissan  brands.  Among  the  vehicles  are  the  Renault  R5 and  the  new  compact  EV  that  will  replace  the  Nissan Micra.  Designed  by  Nissan  and  engineered  by  Renault Group, the new model is planned to be manufactured at Renault  ElectriCity:  the  electric  industrial  center  in northern France.\n\nI",

Based  on  its  deep expertise  and  unique  experience  as  a  pioneer  in  battery technology, Nissan will lead innovations in this area that will benefit all Alliance members.\n\nThe  ASSB  technology  will  double  the  energy  density versus  current  liquid  lithium-ion  batteries.  Charging  time will also  be  greatly  reduced  to  one  third,  enabling customers to make longer trips with more comfort.\n\nThe aim is to mass produce ASSB technology by mid-2028 and, in the future beyond that, to realize cost parity with ICE  vehicles  by  bringing  costs  down  further  to  $65  per kWh 13 , accelerating the global shift to EVs.\n\nThe Alliance also has a state-of-the art battery management  system.  Unlike  others  in  the  industry,  the Alliance has chosen to control 100% of its hardware and software,  benefiting  from  very  valuable  predictive  data, allowing for monitoring the state of health of the battery and improving technology.\n\nThe Alliance is working with strategic partners to offer the best solutions to customers for public charging. Mobilize Power  Solutions  provides  to  B2B  customers  a  complete end-to-end  service  including  project  design,  installation, maintenance and management of optimized recharging infrastructure  and  all  related  services  to  meet  their business needs.\n\nAn agreement has been signed with Ionity via the Alliance Emobility Service Provider Plug Surfing, which will allow its customers to  access  at  preferential  pricing  to  the  Ionity ultra-fast charging network in Europe.\n\nWith  more  than  10  years'  experience  in  the  EV  business, Alliance members have deep knowledge that allows them to  be  ahead  of  the  competition  in  optimizing  battery\n\nreuse,  notably  with  second-life  battery  applications, recycling and achieving efficient and sustainable solutions over the full battery life cycle.\n\n## 25 million cars connected to the Alliance Cloud by 2026: the best-in-class digital experience for customers\n\nIntelligent  and  connected  mobility  are  critical  areas  for increased shared innovation across the Alliance.\n\nWith  20  years'  experience  in  ADAS  (advanced  driverassistance systems) and autonomous driving, the Alliance keeps  improving  real-world  driving  safety,  convenience, and  enjoyment  by  delivering  innovations  in  intelligent vehicle  and  driver-assistance  technologies,  with  an example being Nissan's award-winning ProPILOT system.\n\nWith  shared  platforms  and  electronics,  by  2026  Alliance members expect to have more than 10 million vehicles on the  road  across  45  Alliance  models  equipped  with autonomous driving systems.\n\nToday,  4  million  vehicles  are  already  connected  to  the Alliance Cloud with ongoing data exchanges.\n\nBy 2026, more than 5 million Alliance cloud systems will be delivered  per  year,  with  a  total  of  25  million  connected cars on the road. The Alliance is also the first global, massmarket OEM to introduce the Google ecosystem in its cars.\n\nUnder Renault Group's leadership, the Alliance is developing a common centralized electrical and electronic architecture converging electronics hardware and software applications to offer maximum  benefits  and  an  optimal  level  of performance.\n\nThe  Alliance  will  launch  its  first  full  software  defined vehicle  by  2026.  With  this  technology,  the  Alliance  will improve  the  performance  of  its  cars  'Over  The  Air' throughout  their  life  cycle.  This  will  mean  greater  value added for customers, in particular with the integration of the  car  into  their  digital  ecosystem  to  offer  them  a personalized  experience,  new  enhanced  services  and reduced maintenance costs. This will also allow Alliance members to boost vehicle resale values. In addition, these vehicles  will  be  able  to  communicate  with  connected objects,  users,  and  infrastructure,  opening  new  fields  of value for the Alliance companies.\n\nThe  Alliance's  unique  digital  experience  will  be  the gateway to an unprecedented amount of data, paving the way  to  the  automotive  industry's  next  frontier,  with Renault  Group,  Nissan  Motors  and  Mitsubishi  Motors positioned at the forefront of this revolution.",

Through  this intended investment in Ampere Nissan would enhance and accelerate new business opportunities for Nissan in Europe.\n- \u25cf Mitsubishi Motors is also reportedly considering investing in Ampere.\n- \u25cf Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors would become customers of Renault Group's Horse project, an initiative to achieve further  scale  and  market coverage for its low-emission internal  combustion  engine  (ICE)  &  hybrid  powertrain technologies.\n\nThese  initiatives  would  complement  ongoing  areas  of technology collaborations such as All Solid-State Battery (ASSB),  Software-Defined  Vehicle  (SDV)  and  Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) & autonomous driving.\n\n## A rebalanced Renault Group-Nissan cross-shareholding and reinforced Alliance governance\n\nAs  each  Alliance  member  company  delivers  on  its business  plans,  it  was  important  to  put  in  place  a  crossshareholding structure and governance terms aligned to the goals of the next-generation Alliance. Whilst previous Alliance  agreements  enabled  the  companies  to  execute their  respective  strategies  over  the  last  24  years,  a  new approach is required to  enable  the  Alliance  members  to best prepare for future industry opportunities.\n\nRenault Group and Nissan, the founding-members of the Alliance,  have  therefore  agreed  to  rebalancing  their cross-shareholding  and  governance  terms  to  ensure effectiveness and maximize value creation.\n\nA binding framework agreement defines the principles of a new governance scheme and the rebalancing of the crossshareholdings between Renault Group and Nissan. The two companies intend to enter into a new Alliance agreement by March  31,  2023  and  replace  the  current  agreements governing  the  Alliance  (i.e.,  the  Restated  Alliance  Master Agreement, the Alliance Equity Participation Agreement and the Memorandum of Understanding of March 12, 2019).\n\nThis new Alliance agreement would be put in place for an initial period of 15 years.\n\n## Rebalanced cross-shareholdings between Renault Group and Nissan to enable future collaboration\n\n- \u25cf Nissan  and  Renault  Group  would  retain  a  15%  crossshareholding,  with  a  lock-up  obligation,  as  well  as  a standstill obligation.\n- \u25cf Renault  Group  would  transfer  28.4%  of  Nissan  shares into a French trust. The entrusted shares would be voted neutrally, except for:\n- \u25cf the  election  or  dismissal  of  the  directors  of  Nissan nominated by Renault, (where the trustee would vote as directed by Renault);\n- \u25cf the  election  or  dismissal  of  directors  who  are nominated  by  the  Nissan  Nomination  Committee, other  than  the  Renault  Group  nominees  (where  the trustee should vote in favor of the Nissan Nomination Committee decisions and proposals).\n- \u25cf shareholder  proposals  not  supported  by  the  Nissan board of directors (where the trustee should abstain).\n- \u25cf Renault  Group  would  continue  to  fully  benefit  from  the economic  rights  (dividends  and  shares'  sale  proceeds) from the entrusted shares until such shares are sold. The transfer  to  the  trust  would  trigger  no  impairment  in Renault Group financial statements.\n- \u25cf As a result of the transfer of the 28.4% of Nissan shares to  the  trust,  Nissan  would  be  able  to  exercise  its  voting rights attached to its shareholding in Renault Group.\n- \u25cf The voting rights of Renault Group and Nissan would be capped at 15% of the exercisable voting rights, with both companies  able  to  freely  exercise  their  voting  rights within such limit.\n- \u25cf Renault  Group  would  instruct  the  trustee  to  sell  the entrusted Nissan shares if commercially reasonable for Renault Group, but it has no obligation to sell the shares within a specific pre-determined period of time.\n- \u25cf Renault Group would have full flexibility to sell the Nissan shares held in the trust, within a coordinated and orderly process with Nissan, in which Nissan would benefit from a right of first offer, to its or the benefit of a designated third party.\n\n## Voting rights & governance\n\n- \u25cf As  a  result  of  the  new  arrangements,  the  governance agreement  entered  into  on  February  4,  2016,  between Renault  Group  and  the  French  State  related  to  its shareholding in Renault Group would be terminated. This would  enable  the  French  State  to  exercise  freely  all  its voting rights in Renault Group.\n- \u25cf Renault  Group  would  remain  entitled  to  nominate  two representatives  at  Nissan's  board  of  directors,  and Nissan would remain entitled to nominate two representatives at Renault Group's Board.\n- \u25cf The Alliance Operating  Board  would  remain  the coordination  forum  for  Renault  Group,  Nissan  and Mitsubishi Motors.",

(RNBV)\n\nSince  2002,  under  the  RAMA,  RNBV  has  had  decisionmaking and recommendation powers concerning strategy and planning at Alliance level.\n\nFurthermore,  RNBV  is  the  sole  shareholder  of  Alliance Purchasing  Organization  (APO),  created  in  April  2001 under  the  corporate  name  Renault-Nissan  Purchasing Organization (RNPO).\n\nRNBV does not intervene in the operational management of  Renault or Nissan and does not share in the profits or bear the associated risks. Operational decisions are made and  implemented  by  each  company  to  the  extent  that such company is affected by them.\n\nThis  company  is  not  consolidated  due  to  its  nonsignificant  nature  in  accordance  with  the  accounting principles  described  in  note  2-C  of  the  consolidated financial statements presented in section 5.2.2.6.2.\n\n## Powers of RNBV\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  RAMA,  Renault  and  Nissan  had delegated  certain  powers  to  RNBV  pursuant  to  a management agreement signed on April 17, 2002,  for  an initial period of 10 years (the 'Management Agreement').\n\nIn  April  2012,  the  Management  Agreement  was  renewed for  another  10-year  period  pursuant  to  an  agreement entitled Renewal Agreement of the Management Agreement, the provisions of which are identical to those of the Management Agreement (the 'Renewal Agreement of the Management Agreement').\n\nThe Management Agreement has expired on April 16, 2022, and  has  not  been  renewed.  Renault  shareholders  were informed  of  this  during  Renault's  General  Meeting  of May 25, 2022.\n\nAs long as the RAMA exists, and until new agreements are reached (see section 1.3.3.2), RNBV will have the decisionmaking and recommendation powers listed in the RAMA. However, these decisions are no longer directly applicable within  Renault  s.a.s.  and  have  to  be  formally  ratified  by the governance bodies of Renault s.a.s. on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe list of RNBV powers under the RAMA is restrictive and has not changed since the creation of the Alliance.\n\nFirst  and  foremost,  RNBV  has  decision-making  powers that cover:\n\n- \u25cf adoption of 3, 5 and 10 years plans (strategic Company projects, with quantified data);\n- \u25cf approval  of  product  plans  (phase  of  strategic  projects corresponding to the design, manufacturing and sale of current or future products, vehicles and components);\n- \u25cf decisions  concerning  the  sharing  of  products  and powertrains  (such  as  platforms,  vehicles,  gearboxes, engines and other components);\n- \u25cf principles of financial policy, including:\n- \u25cf discount  rates  used  for  profitability  studies  and hurdle rates, applicable to future models  and investments;\n\n| presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group     | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n- \u25cf risk  management  rules  and  the  policy  applicable  to them;\n- \u25cf financing and cash management rules;\n- \u25cf strategy regarding debt-to-equity ratios.\n- \u25cf management of common subsidiaries, and the creation, modification,  steering  and  disbandment  of  CrossCompany  Teams  (CCTs)  and  Functional  Task  Teams (FTTs). These teams operate in all the main sectors and areas  of  activity  and  are  tasked  with  exploring  new synergies between the two companies. Team managers report  regularly  to  the  Alliance  Board  on  the  progress made in their specific area of activity;\n- \u25cf any other subject or project assigned to RNBV on a joint basis by Nissan and Renault.\n\nRNBV  also  has  the  exclusive  power  to  propose  a  set  of decisions  to  Renault  and  Nissan.  Both  manufacturers remain free to follow those proposals or not.\n\nThese proposals relate to:\n\n- \u25cf creation and scope of joint subsidiaries;\n- \u25cf supplementary financial incentive schemes for management;\n- \u25cf significant changes in scopes involving total expenditure of $100 million or more;\n- \u25cf strategic investments exceeding $500 million;\n- \u25cf strategic  cooperation  between  Nissan  or  Renault  and third parties.\n\n## Governance of RNBV\n\nThe  functioning  of  the  Management  Board  of  RNBV  is described  in  Articles  14  et  seq.  of  the  RNBV  articles  of association.\n\nA French translation of the RNBV articles of association is available on the Renault website.\n\nThe composition of the Management Board of RNBV has always followed a principle of balance in the representation of Renault and Nissan.\n\nPursuant  to  the  RNBV  articles  of  association  and  the RAMA, the Management Board comprises 10 members:\n\n- \u25cf five members are appointed by Renault, the 'R Members',  including  Renault's  Chief  Executive Officer,  who  holds  the  title  of  'Chairman  and  CEO', i.e., Chairman of the Management Board of RNBV;\n- \u25cf five members are appointed by Nissan, the 'N Members',  including  Nissan's  Chief  Executive Officer  who  holds  the  title  of  'Vice-Chairman',  i.e., Vice-Chairman of the RNBV Management Board.\n\nThe Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the Management Board of RNBV have four votes each, and the other members of the Management Board have one vote each. In the event of a tie, the Chairman has a casting vote.\n\nAll  decisions  of  the  Management  Board  are  made  by simple  majority  of  the  votes  of  the  members  present  or represented.\n\nI",

Likewise,  the  Chairman  and  the Vice-Chairman  each  have  the  power  to  represent  RNBV with respect to third parties.\n\nAll  decisions  affecting  the  Alliance  are  made  in  the common interest  of  Renault  and  of  Nissan.  In  the  event that a member of the Management Board finds itself in a situation  where  there  is  a  conflict  of  interest  in  the decision-making  process,  he  or  she  shall  abstain  from taking part in the decision.\n\nThe implementation of the orientations defined by RNBV and  all  of  the  resulting  operational  decisions  remain within  the  exclusive  competence  of  Renault,  which  is represented by its Board of Directors and the executives authorized to represent the Company.\n\nBeyond  the  areas  falling  within  RNBV's  competence, Renault  is  entirely  free  to  conduct  its  activities,  and  all decisions relating to the operational, commercial, financial  and  social  management  of  the  company  are made  by  its  management  and  administrative  bodies acting autonomously and independently.\n\n## 1.3.4 Strategic cooperation\n\nThe Alliance has demonstrated its ability to cooperate with various  partners.  These  strategic  cooperations  make  it possible to increase economies of scale, accelerate growth in  new  regions,  gain  access  to  new  technologies,  share costs and jointly fund research and development of nextgeneration  vehicles  and  engines.  Existing  and  potential partners of the Alliance especially appreciate its ability to deepen collaboration over several business cycles.\n\nOne  of  the  Alliance's  strategic  collaborations  is  the  one with the premium manufacturer Mercedes in April 2010.\n\nThis cooperation is managed by a Cooperation Committee co-chaired by Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of the Alliance Operating Council, and Mr. Ola K\u00e4llenius, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and composed  of  senior  executives  from  Renault,  Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors and Mercedes. This committee oversees the implementation  of  agreed  projects  and  makes proposals  for  new  projects.  No  area  of  collaboration  is excluded.  When  the  teams  identify  projects  that  could benefit  all  partners,  they  initiate  feasibility  studies.  If  the executives and board members of all companies agree, the project is approved.\n\nIn  2018,  Mitsubishi  Motors  has  been  fully  integrated  into the cooperation with Mercedes.\n\nThe key projects in which Renault is currently participating are as follows:\n\n- \u25cf Renault and Mercedes have developed a joint platform for Smart and Twingo. The electric Smart was launched in  2017,  followed  by  the  electric  Twingo  in  2020.  The electric  motors  are  built  at  the  Renault  plant  in  Cl\u00e9on. The  battery  for  the  electric  Smart  is  produced  by  a Mercedes subsidiary, 'Deutsche ACCUmotive', in Kamenz,  Germany,  the  battery  for  the  Twingo  is produced in Novo Mesto (Slovenia);\n- \u25cf Renault developed a small light commercial vehicle based on  Kangoo  for  Mercedes.  This  vehicle,  named  Citan,  has been manufactured in the Renault Maubeuge plant since 2012.  The  successors  of  Kangoo  and  Citan  in  thermal version were launched in 2021, and the electrical version is in development;\n- \u25cf the  Alliance  and  Mercedes  have  jointly  developed  a direct-injection  turbocharged  small  gasoline  engine family (1 L and 1.3 L). These new, more compact engines feature state-of-the-art technology enabling improvements  in  fuel  economy,  as  well  as  significant reductions  in  emissions.  The  new  engines  debuted  in Mercedes, Renault and Nissan vehicles in late 2017.",

The ability to innovate is supported by levers such as  the  network  of  experts  or  the  many  partnerships. Research  and  Advanced  Engineering  activities are managed cross-functionally within the various Engineering sectors via a structured plan shared throughout  the  company.  This  global  plan  covers  all vehicle and mechanical applications, products, processes,  after-sales  and  services.  The  innovations worked on are developed to serve brands,  business  and customers.\n\nRenault Group identifies the key innovations of tomorrow very early on. It can be a very innovative product concept such  as  the  minivan  in  1983  or  the  first  Twizy  and  Zoe electric vehicles in the early 2010s. A nugget can also be a major technological breakthrough such as the engine to hydrogen. New uses can also give rise to nuggets of high value such as new mobility services, data monetization or even  the  second  life  of  batteries.  Regulatory  changes such as the ban on internal combustion vehicles by 2035 in Europe for the sale of new cars are also to be considered.\n\nResearch  and  Advanced  Engineering  activities  are divided into 4 perfectly complementary categories.\n\nThe Research  plan and  doctoral  theses  (under  CIFRE agreement for the most part) shed light on the future and prepare  for  future  technological  breakthroughs.  Their purpose  is  to  identify,  anticipate  and  prepare  Renault Group for future trends to be incorporated into developments over a period of 5 to 10 years.\n\nThe Technological  plan makes  it  possible  to  prepare innovations  with  a  view  to  vehicle  or  component\n\napplications  by  developing  new  technologies  over  a period of 3 to 5 years. It materializes the innovations to be introduced in platforms, engines, systems and the vehicle range plan.\n\nThese  two  plans  are  based  on  three  main  pillars:  the planet, the territories and the people.\n\nResearch and Advanced Engineering are also in charge of the production of numerous demonstrators ( Demonstrator plan ) which aim to inspire the future range plan  by  allowing  a  grouping  of  technological  bricks  in order  to  compare  innovations  with  realistic  integration into a  vehicle,  and  thus  potentially  bring  out  new automotive concepts.\n\nFinally, an essential axis is the development of simulation/ validation  tools  and  models  through  the Performance Engineering plan . This plan aims to make breakthroughs in methodologies,  expertise  and  multiple  skills  (business, process, sales, marketing, organization and management).\n\nThe Research  and  Advanced  Engineering  plan  is  a  joint Alliance  plan which  is  structured  around  the  plans presented  above  to  fully  meet  the  prioritized  needs  of Product,  Design  and  Engineering.  The  aim  is  to  develop innovations  to  serve  future  customers  and  to  guarantee the  competitiveness  of  the  vehicle  range  by  pooling  the development capacities of the two companies, where the objectives  are  common.  Cooperation  with  the  Alliance also increases the Renault Group's patent portfolio.\n\nThe  budget  for  Research  and  Advanced  Engineering activities  in  2022  is  distributed  across  these  4  plans. Engineering is a strong contributor in terms of technologies  and  innovations  through  its  skills  but  also through its product and service offerings.",

The network of experts\n\nThe  changes  affecting  the  world  are  of  a  nature  and magnitude  unprecedented  for  the  planet.  They  are  also for the automotive  sector.  In  the  context  of  two concomitant  revolutions  (digital  and  energy  transition), the fundamentals of the market as well as the regulatory and  technological  bases  are  or  will  all  be  called  into question. For the company, it is a question of differentiating  itself  by  knowing  and  listening  to  our markets - translated into permanent innovation - and of positioning  itself  in  new  sectors  of  activity,  with  a  high degree  of  scientific  and  technical  knowledge.  In  this context  where  the  mobilization  and  transformation  of knowledge are  becoming  strategic,  the  expertise  sector occupies  a  central  place  by  giving  itself  the  means  to identify and then capture the value created by knowledge in order to put it at the service of Renaulution and offer an advantage.  competitive  to  the  business.  The  sector expertise represents 43 areas of strategic expertise such as  \"Artificial Intelligence\",  \"Electrical  and  Electronic Architecture\", \"Immersive Simulation and Virtual Reality\", \"Manufacturing\", \"Logistics\", etc. This sector is organized into four levels of expertise:\n\n- \u25cf the Expert Fellow responsible for defining and ensuring the consistency of the strategic areas of expertise and coordinates  the  Experts  Leaders  network  in  order  to structure production both at the strategic level and the operational level regarding technical or methodological\n\ninnovations and support for projects under development. The collaborative work carried out during expert  workshops  contributes  to  a  dynamic  of  shared progress for the affected business activities as regards the  Company's  main  challenges,  which  are  largely technical  (hydrogen,  coupling  of  complex  systems, additive  manufacturing,  etc.).  The  network  of  experts can thus be described as an agile organization serving the  cross-business  and  the  construction  of  shared roadmaps up to CEO level for strategic technologies;\n\n- \u25cf the 43  Seniors  Expert, each  reporting  to  a  Department Head, are responsible for their  roadmap. Responsible for one of the 50 areas of strategic expertise. They structure and  guide  their  internal  network  of  experts  and  use  an external network consisting of universities, other manufacturers, associations, incubation structures, etc., to enable the Company to work in an 'extended' way;\n- \u25cf the 250  Experts are  in  charge  of  secondary  fields  of expertise, responsible for benchmarks,  identifying relevant  partners  and  investing  in  the  protection  of know-how  through  patents.  They  are  responsible  in particular  for  defining  and  promoting  standards  and processes;\n- \u25cf the 500  Specialists further  the  state  of  the  art  in  their practice, developing standards on which the teams can then capitalize.\n\nThe  organization  of  the  network  of  experts  and  its  agile mode of operation allow the way ahead to be mapped out using  a  set  of  coherent  roadmaps,  the  enhancement  of knowledge to be accelerated through innovation and the performance  of  operations,  thus  allowing  the  business activities to excel in their various areas of expertise.\n\nI",

Renault Group engineering centers (RTX - Renault Technical Center) around the world\n\nRenault  Group  engineering  centers  are  located  in  Spain, Romania, Korea, India and Latin America. Thanks to their knowledge of local and regional markets, they are tasked with  adapting  vehicles  to  the  customers  needs  and expectations,  local  regulatory  constraints  and  national economic  situations.  Through  the  application  of  a  skills upgrading policy that continues from year to year, Renault Group continuously increases the responsibility of engineering  centers  for  cross-functional  activities  and enables them to take charge of vehicle project design at an increasingly early stage in the process. This upskilling also enables the most mature RTX to move from regional to  more  global  responsibilities.  The  engineering  centers will  be  assigned  new  responsibilities  under  the  new organization that will be put in place in 2023 through the Horse entity.\n\n## 1.4.2.3. Open-innovation labs and links with start-ups\n\nAnother  important  lever  for  the  company  is  the  global ecosystem of Renault Group open-innovation laboratories, known as 'Labs'. The Labs have existed for a decade  and  are  complementary  to  the  other  processes and  entities  of  the  Renault  Group.  They  allow  for unscheduled, rapid innovation, in test mode & learning by 'doing  it  yourself'.  In  France  and  historically  born  in  the movement  of  Fab  Labs  and  Maker  culture,  the  Creative Lab has introduced several hundred employees to the use of  rapid  prototyping  means  (3D  printing,  engraving, cutting,  thermoforming,  etc.).  The  Creative  Lab  with thematic Labs (Smart EV Lab, Electronic-Shaker Lab, Car Data  Lab,  AfterSales  Lab,  etc.)  brings  together  the community of Group makers. He is able to support project leaders from idea to completion, to help with technological plan projects and to launch challenges for Renault  Group  brands.  The  labs  make  it  possible  to develop know-how and internal skills on innovation topics. Another  example,  the  Collective  Intelligence  Laboratory is led by an internal collective of coaches, facilitators and actors  of  transformation  who  have  consulting  activities with other collectives of the company, and synchronization on collective intelligence activities. between these different sectors.\n\nThe other Labs are located in strategic  areas  where  the world  of  automobiles  and  services  is  changing  rapidly: Israel, China, or even Brazil in order to ensure continuous technological  monitoring  of  emerging  trends,  increased knowledge  of  customer  needs  in  closer  to  the  field  and also  to  strengthen  the  link  with  technological  partners around the world. The Labs also make it possible to test the potential of a partnership with a start-up.\n\n## 1.4.2.4. Innovation partnerships\n\nThe vehicle of tomorrow will be frugal in terms of energy, greatly reduced in weight, connected and able to replace the  driver  for  all  or  part  of  their  activities,  this  is  a challenge  that  can  only  be  taken  up  collectively.  For Renault  Group,  R&D  collaboration  contracts  make  it possible to accelerate the development of the technologies  necessary  to  meet  these  challenges,  but also  to  enrich  skills  by  sharing  costs:  a  key  lever  for bringing  innovations  to  fruition  more  quickly  in  order  to introduce  them.  more  in  vehicle  projects.  In  the  world  of competitive industry, performance and frugality, whether with  industrial  or  academic  partners,  this  mode  of collaborative innovation is encouraged by public funders at  both  French  and  European  level.  Materialized  in  the form of public aid (subsidies, repayable advances), it is an additional  lever  for  accelerating  innovation.  In  this context,  the  participation  of  the  Renault  Group  in cooperative  initiatives  has  always  been  a  priority  in  the activities of Research and Advanced Engineering, which is an  effective  tool  in  the  service  of  the  growth  of  the \"Renaulution\" strategic plan. In 2022, Renault managed a portfolio  of  60  subsidized  projects  on  average,  split equally between French projects and European projects. 21  projects  were  submitted  during  the  year:  10  were accepted, 6 are still under review, and 5 were refused. In particular,  Renault  remains  very  active  in  the  CORAM system (2022 version) (Steering Committee for Automotive  Research  and  Mobility)  with  3  ambitious projects submitted (1 refused and 2 under investigation).\n\n## Academic partnerships\n\nRenault Group has always worked with leading schools and the  best  academic  partners.  In  2022,  the  CIFRE  campaign allowed the collection of 34 thesis subjects.\n\nBelow are some examples of theses addressed in 2022:\n\n- \u25cf self-supervised multi-camera perception for joint situational awareness inside and outside the cabin;\n- \u25cf improvement  of  oxygen  reduction  reaction  in  PEMFC fuel cell;\n- \u25cf modeling  and  simulation  of  different  architectures  of electrical systems with a view to their energy optimization. Application to the electric vehicle;\n- \u25cf all-solid, green, inexpensive and fast-charging battery;\n- \u25cf energy modeling of manufacturing workshops;\n\nThe  chairs  are  also  an  important  lever.  Below  are  some examples:\n\n- \u25cf \"Supply Chain of the Future\" with Ponts Paristech as well as Michelin, Casino, Louis Vuitton;\n- \u25cf \"Theory and methods of innovative design Ph1, Ph2\" with Mines  Paris  Tech  and  Armand  Hatchuel  as  well  as Dassualt Syst\u00e8mes, RATP, Thales and Valourec;\n- \u25cf \"CyberSecurity\"  with  Telecom  ParisTech,  WaveStone, Thales, Nokia, Valeo, ANSSI, Road Safety Delegation, etc.",

The challenge lies in the speed of development  of  a  new  electronic  architecture  of  the vehicle of tomorrow and therefore of sovereignty for the French  automotive  industry  by  imposing  a  French standard for software services and the future ecosystem. The  project  continued  in  2022,  with  in  particular  the passage of the first  Key  Stage,  during  an  event  bringing together  all  the  project  partners  and  the  funder  at  the Technocentre.\n\n## 1.4.2.5. Technology Partners\n\nIn  order  to  constantly  explore  new  opportunities  for innovation,  Renault  Group  joins  forces  with  the  best companies on the market in multiple fields.\n\nWith regard to battery cells, Renault Group has chosen to partner  with Envision  AESC,  which  will  develop  a gigafactory  in  Douai with  a  capacity  of  9  GWh  in  2024 aiming  at  reaching  24  GWh  by  2030.  Close  to  Renault ElectriCity,  Renault  Group's  partner  will  produce  latest technology, cost-competitive, low-carbon and safe batteries for electric models, including the future Renault 5.\n\nRenault  Group  has  also  signed  a  Memorandum  of Understanding  to  become  shareholder  of  the French start-up Verkor with a stake of over 20% . The two partners intend to co-develop a high-performance battery suitable for  the C  and  higher  segments of  the  Renault  range,  as well  as  for  the  Alpine  models.  The  partnership  also includes  the  development  of  a  pilot  production  line  in France  for  battery  cells  and  module  prototyping  from 2022. In a second step, starting from 2026, Verkor aims to build the first gigafactory for high performance batteries in  France,  with  an  initial  capacity  of  10  GWh  for  Renault Group, potentially rising to 20 GWh by 2030.\n\nRenault  Group  keeps  one  step  ahead  of  competition  by being the first OEM to develop its own e-motor - with no rare  earth (no-permanent  magnets)  and  based  on electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) technology,  along  with  its  own  reducer.  Having  already done most of the investment, the Group has been able to cut the battery cost by two over the past ten years and will divide  it  by  two  again  in  the  upcoming  decade.  Renault Group will gradually embed new technological improvements from 2024 on its EESM: stator hairpin, glued motor stack,  brushless  and  hollow  rotor  shafts;  lowering costs and improving the efficiency of the motor.\n\nRenault  Group  has  also  signed  a  partnership  with  the French start-up Whylot for an innovative automotive axial flux  e-motor . This  technology  will  first  be  applied  on hybrid powertrains aiming to reduce the costs by 5% while saving  up  to  2.5  g  CO2  on  WLTP  (for  B/C-segment passenger  car).  Renault  Group  will  be the  first  OEM  to produce axial flux e-motor on a large scale from 2025.\n\nOn Power Electronics, the Group will extend its value chain control by integrating the inverter, DC-DC converter and the  on-board  charger  (OBC)  into  a  unique  box  produced in-house. With a compact design, this One Box Project will be 800 V compliant, with fewer parts to reduce the cost, and  will  be  used  across  all  platforms  and  powertrains (BEV, HEV, PHEV) for further scale effect. Power modules for inverter, DC-DC  converter and OBC  will rely respectively  on  silicon  carbide (SiC) and  gallium  nitride (GaN)  thanks  to  our strategic  partnership  signed  with STMicroelectronics .\n\nOn top of  these  new  technologies,  Renault  Group  is  also working on a more compact e-powertrain called the all-inone system. This e-powertrain consists in integrating the e-motor, the reducer and the power electronics (One Box Project) in a single package: enabling -45% volume in total (equivalent  to  the  volume  of  the  current-generation  Clio fuel tank), -30% cost of the overall powertrain (this saving in  value  being  the  equivalent  of  the  e-motor  cost),  and -45% on wasted energy on WLTP giving an extra EV range of up to 20 km.\n\nOther technological partnerships in innovation are presented in Chapter 1.2.1.7: Partnerships and Cooperation .\n\n## 1.4.2.6. Patents Filing\n\nWith  the  challenges  posed  by  climate  change  and  the development of digital technology, mobility is undergoing major changes. This real change of era is opening up new fields,  and  technological  breakthroughs  are  occurring more  and  more  rapidly  in  a  wide  range  of  areas,  and Renault Group is adapting its strategy to position itself as a  major  player  in  the  sector.  Renault  Group  has  always been able to innovate, and the significant acceleration in patent filings in 2022 (+30% vs. 2021) reflects the extent of the  technological  shift  that  the  company  is  taking,  for example  in  software  or  services.  For  example,  further 300 patents have been filed for the New Megane E-Tech Electric  vehicle  and  its  CMF-EV  platform.  This  figure demonstrates the vitality of innovation within the Renault Group  and  its  determination  to  protect  its  inventions internally or with its partners.\n\nRenault  Group  also  continues  to  be  inventive  in  its recognized  areas  of  expertise,  particularly  in  terms  of engines.  The  wound  rotor  technology,  resulting  from  the development of the Zoe and used in the collaboration with Valeo is a very good example. The partnership with Whylot, announced last November, to create a new type of electric motor,  is  another.  The  new  patents  filed  under  these partnerships cover a range of innovations applicable to the motor, but also to the charging system, the battery, thermal management, architecture and acoustics.\n\nIndustrialization solutions are also patented. The ability to integrate new technology on an industrial scale is one of Renault's strong points, and a definite contribution to the partnerships in which Renault Group is involved.\n\nIn 2022, the Renault Group patent portfolio will amount to 13,950.\n\nI",

Digital transformation\n\nDue to the growing complexity of vehicles (electrification, connected vehicles, driving aids, etc.), the explosion of onboard  software  and  increasing  regulatory  pressure, Renault Group is strengthening the configuration management  and  development  processes  for  systems and software as well as their validation through its digital transformation. This transformation will enable the entire company  to  collaborate securely, seamlessly and efficiently  in  a  single  environment.  All  the  players  in  the design (Process, Purchasing, Costing, Design, Quality, etc.) and  validation  processes,  as  well  as  partners  and suppliers,  will  make  the  data  on  the  vehicle  product accessible  around  digital  twins  throughout  its  life  cycle with the aim of reducing costs and lead times.\n\nRenault Group's digital transformation continues with the Renaulution  Virtual  Twin'  program.  The  Enterprise  PLM (Product  Life cycle Management)  project,  renamed Renaulution Virtual Twin', is a major program that aims to transform and bring Renault's design into a new era. This project will provide engineering and all of the company's upstream businesses with a new digital tool for managing its  product  data  and  mobility  services.  Thanks  to  the extension  of  the  digitalization  of  Engineering  to  the company,  this  tool  will  offer  a  lighter  governance  from design to after-sales.\n\nFollowing  20  years  of  collaboration,  Renault  Group  and Dassault  Syst\u00e8mes  are  strengthening  their  partnership  to contribute to the \"Renaulution\" strategic plan. In a first-of-a-\n\nind  deployment  for  an  industrial  company  of  this  scale, Renault Group is adopting the Dassault Syst\u00e8mes 3DEXPERIENCE  platform  on  the  cloud  globally  to  develop programs for new vehicles and mobility services.\n\nThis  enterprise  platform  will  offer  lean  governance  from design to after-sales in order to reduce costs and vehicle development  time.  It  will  provide  Renault  with  a  new backbone  for  sharing,  in  real  time,  all  product-related data throughout the product life cycle and for managing the digital twins in all the required configurations.\n\nMore  than  20,000  of  Renault  Group's  employees  will benefit  from  digital  twin  experiences  to  improve  data sharing and collaboration across the company to reduce costs and vehicle development time.\n\nThis  program  will  enable  full  deployment  from  design  to after-sales, including industrialization, from 2022, with the objective of a completed solution in 2025.\n\nIn  2022,  more  than  2,000  users  were  trained,  a  gearbox was entirely developed on Dassault's new 3D Experience platform on the Cloud and a new innovative Renaulution vehicle  (platform  and  upper  bodies)  was  designed  with Renaulution  Virtual  Twin,  involving  all  the  upstream departments  (product/process/after-sales  engineering, purchasing,  costing,  quality,  etc.).  The  reduction  of  the cost  of  vehicles  during  their  production  life  was  also resourced  with  Dassault  Syst\u00e8mes'  data  science/AI solutions  while  connecting  the  data  managed  by  the legacy  systems  of  the  major  functions  (Engineering, Purchasing, Costing, Manufacturing).\n\n## 1.4.3 Energy and digital transitions: a challenge for innovation\n\n## 1.4.3.1. Digital transition\n\nSoftware  will  play  an  increasingly  important  role  in  the vehicle of tomorrow, whether for human-machine interfaces,  multimedia  and  connected  services,  or  even driver  assistance  systems.  It  is  necessary  to  respond  to the growing need for the customer for a service content and services that are enriched as and throughout the life of  the  vehicle,  and  this  thanks  to  the  software.  We  must also  be  able  to  accommodate  the  arrival  at  maturity  of new technological solutions for the automobile.\n\n## Software Defined Vehicle\n\nTo  meet  such  a  challenge  of  digital  transition,  the company  has  put  itself  in  working  order  in  order  to respond  to  the  necessary  changes  in  the  embedded software architecture. The partnership with Google and Qualcomm  announced  at  the  end  of  2022  will  make  it possible to develop the connected car of tomorrow. The\n\n\"Software Defined Vehicle\" will  bring  together  the  best of  the  automotive  and  digital  worlds,  to  offer  new  ondemand  services and enable continuous vehicle updates,  building  on  the  existing  collaboration  around Android  Automotive  which  will  be  consolidated  by Renault  Group  with  its  partners  in  a  vehicle  operating system (CAR-OS).\n\nThe  'Software  Defined  Vehicle'  will  make  it  possible  to introduce new functionalities and services more and more quickly  from  development  in  the  Cloud,  and  carried automatically  in  the  vehicle.  This  centralization  of  the architecture has the advantage of reducing costs thanks to  the  reduction  in  the  number  of  computers;  improving the flow and fluidity of data exchanges as well as allowing better  use  of  data  to  extend  the  services  offered  to customers.  The  vehicle  'defined  around  the  software' thus opens up an immense field of possibilities with new market prospects and technological innovations.",

By 2030, it aims to reduce its CO2 emissions by 50% compared with 2010. By 2022, all new models sold will have an electric or electrified version, in a market that in five years' time will see 50% of vehicles sold running on electric or hybrid power.\n\n## The battery technology\n\nSince the announcement of its electric-vehicle offensive in place since early 2007, Renault Group has been able to rely  on  recognized  internal  expertise  (electrochemistry, materials science, thermal modelling, control electronics, high-voltage network, mechanical packaging, etc.) to make the wisest choices in terms of cells,  modules  and  lithium  ion  (Li-ion)  battery  packs  in order to offer solutions in its electric and hybrid vehicles at  the  best  level  in  terms  of  autonomy (energy density), performance over time (durability), reliability, cost and of course safety, which remains a priority objective over all the  others.  Witness  the  cumulative  14  billion  kilometers traveled by the 600,000 Renault electric vehicles sold in Europe  since  2011\u2026  without  any  major  battery-related incident (no electric shock, no fire).\n\nThis  upstream  expertise  has  also  extended  to  taking  into account  the  entire  life  cycle  of  Li-ion  batteries  (from extraction of raw materials to dismantling and recycling): again,  Renault  Group  has  chosen  to  be  a  pioneer  in  this global approach and to participate in the development of more  virtuous  industrial  sectors,  as  well  as  in  the emergence of 'second life' applications for batteries.\n\nThis expertise accumulated over time has enabled Renault Group  to  build  up  particularly  effective  cooperation  with world-class cell suppliers in order to optimize the performance and cost of its batteries without compromising safety  and  to  carry  out  -  with  a  view  to  creating ecosystems  -  promising  collaborations  on  the  various stages  of  the  life  cycle  or  on  the  emergence  of  energy services associated with vehicle charging.\n\nThe  Group's  Research  and  Innovation  departments  are now continuing their work to push current Li-ion technology to  the  limits  along  several  lines:  energy  density  (to  further increase the vehicle's autonomy or to be able to reduce the volume of the battery pack), but also the charging power or the cost of batteries - depending on the uses and services targeted for each vehicle.\n\n'Post-Li-ion' alternatives are also being looked at, in particular 'all-solid state' technologies ('ASSB' - All Solid State Battery'), or even mixed solid-liquid or gel-type solutions.\n\nRenault Group is the first car manufacturer to act on the entire  battery  life  cycle,  from  raw  materials  to  recycling and second-life applications. The Renault Group's ambition  is  also  to  develop  a  battery  \"made  in  France\", green,  carbon-free  and  responsible,  thereby  helping  to reduce the carbon footprint of its batteries by up to 35% by 2030 (reference: Zoe 2019).\n\nRenault  Group  is  also  developing  'vehicle-to-grid'  (V2G) solutions,  which  send  energy  back  to  the  electricity  grid\n\n| presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group     | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\n## General presentation of Renault Group\n\nfrom the battery of an electric car. These  V2G technologies will have a double benefit: economic (for the customer,  for  the  electricity  network  operator  and  for Renault), but also technical (support for the development of renewable energies by providing storage capacity).\n\nAt the end of their first life in the vehicle, batteries may still contain  around  two  thirds  of  their  capacity  and  can  be reused  for  a  second  life.  Mobilize  is  developing  new applications  around  stationary  battery  storage  to  manage punctual power  needs,  mobile  electricity storage or generators for use in other industries. Through Mobilize, the Group  is  pioneering  this  market  and  has  defined  a  unique industrial setup to lead this market in Europe:\n\n- \u25cf the collection of end-of-life batteries with the support of its dealer network;\n- \u25cf the ability  to  assess  their  condition,  thanks  to  real-time technical monitoring;\n- \u25cf the industrial capacity to refurbish batteries at competitive prices and  repackage  the  upcoming 250,000 units of Zoe leased batteries.\n\nEnd  of  life:  through  its  subsidiary  Indra  and  its  longstanding partnership with Veolia, the Group benefits from a robust know-how in EV battery collection and recycling. It has already recycled a cumulative 75 MWh of batteries, half of which in 2020 alone. To go even further, the Group is deploying  battery  retrofitting,  reuse,  dismantling  and recycling  facilities  through  its  Refactory  project  in  Flins with the aim of generating more than \u20ac1 billion in revenues from these end-of-life and recycling activities by 2030.\n\n## THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL\n\nTo  go  further  in  recycling,  Renault  Group  announced  on October  13,  2022,  the  creation  of  THE  FUTURE  IS  NEUTRAL, the first company to operate across the entire value chain of the automotive circular economy, which aims in particular to become a European leader in closed-loop battery recycling.\n\n## Hydrogen\n\nThe reduction of CO2 emissions in the short term and the achievement of  carbon  neutrality  by  2040  (Europe)  then 2050  (World)  require  an  in-depth  overhaul  of  mobility technologies and ecosystems. While electrification remains the backbone of Renault Group's strategy, other technologies  are  being  studied  so  as  not  to  miss  any opportunity, even in niche uses.\n\nThis  is  why  Renault  very  early  on  initiated  upstream studies  to  assess  the  potential  of  hydrogen,  in  a  global approach (analysis of the life cycle \"from the cradle to the grave\").\n\nIn  January  2021,  Renault  Group  and  Plug  Power  Inc.,  the world  leader  in  fuel  cell  systems  and  hydrogen-related services, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU), which was formalized in June with the creation of a 50/50 joint  venture  named Hyvia .  This  new  company  based  in France,  with  its  headquarters  and  R&D  center  based  in Villiers-Saint-Frederic,  aims  to  achieve  a  30%  market share  of  hydrogen-powered  light  commercial  vehicles (LCVs) in Europe by 2030.\n\nHyvia offers  a  unique  range  of  services  on  the  market: complete  turnkey  solutions,  including  the  supply  of",

Through concept cars such as  Renault  Vision  and  Alpine  Alpenglow,  Renault  Group confirms its technological excellence and stands ready to make  the  most  of  this  technology  according  to  the evolution that the global hydrogen ecosystem could take.\n\n## 1.4.4 Focus on some products and technologies of 2022\n\nNew  engines,  patented  innovations,  Advanced  DriverAssistance Systems (ADAS), multimedia system\u2026 Engineering  is  at  the  service  of  Renault  Group  and  our brands. The selection below is not exhaustive.\n\n## 1.4.4.1. Renault Austral: the tech SUV\n\n## Engines with the best level of consumption and emissions\n\nAustral  offers  a  range  of  innovative  powertrains,  with different  electrification  technologies  to  cover  all  uses without changing habits: a new generation of the E-Tech 'Full Hybrid' system as well as two other petrol engines: a Mild  Hybrid  Advanced  48V  with  130hp  and  a  Mild  Hybrid 12V with 140 and 160hp.\n\nThe self-charging  E-Tech  \"Full  Hybrid\" engine  has  been the subject of 200 patent applications. It was designed to propel  a  higher  segment  vehicle  and  generate  more performance and driving pleasure while reducing consumption and CO2 emissions. It receives a new 1.2-litre turbocharged 3-cylinder petrol engine associated with an electric motor, a 2 kWh and 400V lithium-ion battery, and an intelligent automatic multi-mode gearbox with optimized  claws.  This  engine  thus  displays  a  combined power  of  up  to  146kW,  or  200  horsepower.  As  with  the previous  generation  of  E-Tech  Hybrid  engines,  all  starts are 100% electric to provide the driving pleasure specific to electrified vehicles, combining silence and responsiveness.  Equipped  with  this  new  E-Tech  Hybrid engine,  Austral  displays  optimal  consumption  and  CO2 emissions (from 4.5 l/100km and 102 g/km of CO2) for the best possible cost of use.

A  unique offer  in  the  C-SUV  segment,  it  provides  unprecedented comfort,  increased  agility  and  unparalleled  dynamic performance.  Thanks  to  the  addition  of  a  steering actuator  on  the  multi-arm  rear  axle  associated  with  this equipment,  the  steering  angle  of  the  rear  wheels  now reaches 5\u00b0 for an even smaller turning diameter than that of  a  city  car,  i.e.  10.1  meters.

Renault Megane E-Tech Electric: the high-tech compact car\n\n## Ultra-thin battery\n\nMuch  like  its  new  power  train,  the  Megane  E-Tech  Electric also has a new 395 kg battery designed to fit perfectly on the CMF-EV  platform.  At  110  mm  (for  1,960  mm  length  and 1,450 mm width) - 40% smaller than the Zoe battery - it is the thinnest  on  the  market.  It  contributes  to  lowering  the  total height of the vehicle at 1.50 m for better aerodynamism and efficiency. In order to attain such a compact size, engineers had to turn to a new chemical make-up for its batteries with the lithium-ion NMC (Nickel, Manganese, Cobalt) batteries by LG,  which  have  more  nickel  and  less  cobalt  for  greater energy density. Reaching 600 Wh/L, it is 20% more than the Zoe.  They  also  benefit  from  a  new  liquid  coolant  system located in the battery's lower housing unit - a Renault first that makes the battery more compact and efficient thanks to the extruded aluminum tubes. Measuring only 18 mm high, it  makes  fitting  the  battery  pack  on  the  platform  much easier, leaving more room for overall design and space.\n\n## Balanced performance\n\nMegane  E-Tech  Electric  comes  with  a  choice  of  two battery capacities:\n\n- \u25cf 40 kWh for a range of 300 km (WLTP cycle);\n- \u25cf 60 kWh for a range up to 470 km (WLTP cycle, depending on each version).\n\nThe 40 kWh battery is made of 8 modules of 24 cells each, distributed  over  a  single  layer.  The  60  kWh  battery consists  of  12  modules  of  24  cells  each,  spread  over  two layers.  In  both  cases,  the  battery's  dimensions  remain unchanged,  including  the  record  height  of  110  mm.  They come with an 8-year guarantee. In this interval, they will be replaced  free  of  charge  if  they  deteriorate  to  less  than 70% of their nominal capacity.\n\nAn ultra-thin battery of only 110 mm.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI",

This is thanks to the vehicle's high efficiency. This has been made possible thanks to the many affordable charging possibilities (see below), but also thanks to optimized energy recovery management and heat exchange that harnesses a new, patented, three-part system:\n\n- \u25cf new generation heat pump that improves the battery's coefficient  of  performance  by  30%  (-10  \u00b0C)  compared with  Zoe.  It  incorporates  a  completely  new  heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system and now uses electronic valves;\n- \u25cf intelligent  system  for  managing  energy  lost  by  the batteries  and  powertrain,  which  reuses  it  to  heat  the cockpit. This has been made possible by the arrival of a liquid  cooling  system  for  the  batteries  and  powertrain (water-cooled oil);\n- \u25cf predictive charging management uses the route on the vehicle's  navigation  system  to  set  the  battery  at  the appropriate  temperature  as  the  car  nears  a  planned charging  station.  It  makes  the  best  use  of  the  specific charging  point's  capabilities  for  a  faster  and/or  fuller charge.\n\nWith  these  technologies,  a  journey  between  Paris  and Lyon, Paris and La Rochelle, Hanover and Copenhagen or Munich and Venice requires only a single short charging stop  of  30  min,  with  an  optimized  consumption  of  only 12.8 kWh/100 km (WLTP).\n\n## Patented sound cocoon (Soaft Damping Foam)\n\nThe  innovative  'Cocoon  Effect  Technology',  developed and patented by Renault engineers, brings a level of audio comfort  while  driving  that  is  unparalleled,  even  for  a 'naturally'  silent  electric  car.  A  layer  of  sound-absorbing foam  has  been  pressed  in  between  the  car's  floor  and across  the  whole  battery.  Improvements  are  best  felt above 30 km/h as it creates a sort of sound cocoon most often found on upper segment models so passengers can better  enjoy  the  silence,  their  music  or  conversational moments  with  other  passengers  even  on  motorways. Moreover, the 'Cocoon  Effect Technology' is very lightweight;  it  weighs  3  kilos  less  than  regular  sound proofing. It is enhanced by additional door lining, the sort of 'privilege' reserved for more premium models.\n\n## 1.4.4.3. Dacia Jogger: the 7-seater family car\n\nFamily-friendly and versatile, Dacia Jogger seeks the best of  each  category:  the  length  of  a  station  wagon,  the roominess of a leisure activity vehicle and the attributes of an SUV.\n\n## Modular roof rails\n\nIn  the  longitudinal position, they contribute to the design without  penalizing  the  vehicle's  aerodynamics.  In  the\n\ntransverse  position,  they  act  as  a  roof  rack  that  can support up to 80kg (bicycles, skis, roof box, etc.).\n\nThis ingenious system is patented. Smart, practical, simple and economical, it embodies the Dacia spirit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Record spaciousness and modularity\n\nThanks  to  its  3  rows,  Jogger  can  carry  up  to  7  adults. Designed in the spirit  of  a  Swiss  army  knife  car,  it  offers more  than  60  possible  configurations.  The  rear  space includes a three-seater folding bench seat with 2/3-1/3 seat and  backrest  (in  row  2)  and,  in  the 7-seater  version,  two  individually  folding  and  removable seats (in row 3).\n\nJogger has a maximum cargo capacity of up to 2094 liters.\n\n## First  Dacia  model  to  be  equipped  with  Renault  Group hybrid technology\n\nJogger inaugurates the hybrid engine for the Dacia brand with a combined power of 140 hp, fuel consumption at the highest level and CO2 emissions from 108 g/km. It is based on  technologies  that  are  proven  and  recognized  within the  Renault  Group,  comprising a 90 hp 1.6 liter  4-cylinder petrol  engine  (HR16),  two  electric  motors  (a  50  hp  motor and  a  high-speed  starter/generator  tension)  and  an electrified automatic gearbox, equipped with four reports dedicated  to  the  thermal  block,  as  well  as  two  others allocated  to  the  electric.  This  combined  technology  is made possible by the absence of a clutch.\n\nRegenerative  braking,  combined  with  the  high  energy recovery capacity of the 1.2 kWh (230 V) lithium-ion battery and the efficiency of the automatic gearbox, offer:\n\n- \u25cf up to 80% of driving time in town in all-electric mode;\n- \u25cf fuel consumption savings of up to 40% (compared to an equivalent  internal  combustion  engine  in  the  urban cycle, without changing driving habits).\n\nThe 100% electric traction on start-up and the automatic transmission  give  Jogger  comfort  and  ease  of  use  to optimize  driving  pleasure  and  energy  performance.

Factory  integration  of  this  technology  is  a  guarantee  of safety and reliability. The duration of the manufacturer's warranty,  the  intervals  and  the  cost  of  maintenance operations, the capacity of the boot are identical to those of a petrol version (the LPG tank is located in place of the spare  wheel).  The  combined  consumption  of  the  ECO-G 100 engine in the WLTP cycle starts at 7.7 l/100 km in LPG mode  (i.e.  118  g  CO2/km),  6.0  l/100  km  in  petrol  mode  (i.e. 135  g  CO2/km).  By  running  on  LPG,  Dacia  Jogger  emits  on average 10% less CO2 emissions than an equivalent petrol engine.  In  addition,  it  offers  more  than  1000  km  of autonomy thanks to its 2 tanks: 40 l for LPG and 50 l for petrol.  With  Dacia,  LPG  combines  ease  of  use,  driving pleasure,  reduced  CO2  emissions  and  great  autonomy. Depending  on  the  country,  bi-fuel  petrol/LPG  benefits from tax incentives or reductions, a low purchase price at the pump, or the absence of an ecological penalty.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n## 1.4.4.4.

Alpine A110R: lightness, aerodynamics and performance\n\nEntirely made of carbon fiber, the bonnet of the A110 R loses 2.9 kg. The two air ducts optimize the aerodynamics of the sports car.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Alpine  A110  R  is  the  most  radical  expression  of performance and sportiness on the track, but also on the road. At the heart of its genesis: lightness, the chassis and the  search  for  perfect  aerodynamics,  based  on  the optimal balance between improving ground support and reducing  drag.  Inspired  by  motorsport,  many  elements have been added or modified on the New Alpine A110 R to optimize  its  behavior  at  high  speed.  In  particular,  it  has benefited from technologies and development tools in the wind tunnel from Formula 1.\n\nThe  bespoke  tuning  and  tuning  of  the  Alpine  A110  R's exclusive  chassis,  developed  to  get  the  best  out  of performance with its Michelin Pilot Sport Cup2 semi-slick high-performance tyres, make it a car with unprecedented  performance,  perfect  for  the  circuit  and still homologated for the road.\n\nIf  lightness  is  in  Alpine's  DNA,  the  engineers  have  gone even further in its expression. Thanks to the intensive use of carbon fiber, the Alpine A110 R weighs only 1082 kg, 34 kg less than the A110 S. With a weight / power ratio lowered to 3.6  kg  /  hp,  this  new  sports  car  sprints  to  100  km/h  in  just 3.9 seconds, completes the 1000 m standing start exercise in  21.9  seconds  and  is  thus  positioned  among  the  best performing cars in its category.\n\nThe New Alpine A110 R stands out for its energy efficiency. By far the lightest in its category and with aerodynamics that  combine  low  drag  and  significant  downforce,  this new  sports  car  allows  maximum  energy  efficiency  in  all driving conditions, which translates into an exceptionally low CO2 level (1/3 less minimum than the competition) and reduced consumption.\n\nMade in  France,  at  the  Manufacture  Alpine  Dieppe  Jean R\u00e9d\u00e9l\u00e9, it opens a new chapter in the brand's know-how in terms of sportiness.\n\n## 1.4.4.6. A110 E-Ternit\u00e9: a 100% electric prototype at the cutting edge of Alpine innovation\n\nOn the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the A110, Alpine has  unveiled  the  A110  E-ternit\u00e9,  an  unprecedented prototype loaded with 'Made in' Alpine innovations and projecting  the  brand  into  the  future.  A  veritable  rolling laboratory, the A110 E-ternit\u00e9 is a 100% electric convertible, which  manages  to  retain  Alpine's  legendary  agility  with unparalleled lightness for an electric car in this segment!\n\nThe  A110  E-ternit\u00e9,  100%  electric,  is  the  result  of  real exploratory work. A link between a prestigious past and a 100%  electric  future,  it  illustrates  the  work  that  Alpine  is currently  implementing  to  develop  its  range  of  new models.\n\nCommitted to electrics  for  more  than  ten  years,  Renault Group is a pioneer in this area and has acquired rich and valuable  experience  in  all  automotive  sectors.  It  is therefore  quite  natural  that  the  teams  began  their reflections on the subject very early on. In the \"restomod\" spirit,  the  A110  has  become  the  ideal  support  for  this research work with a clear objective: to electrify a myth of sportiness recognized for its lightness and agility, all for a realistic  budget.  Challenge  succeeded  with  an  A110 E-ternit\u00e9  produced  in  record  time  and  presented  in  July 2022.  A  real  source  of  inspiration  and  lessons  for  the engineers  who  are  actively  preparing  the  launch  of  the dream garage from 2024.",

General framework\n\nVehicle manufacturing regulations are designed to meet the requirements of States regarding, on the one hand, the need to  reduce  the  number  and  consequences  of  accidents  to people,  whether  in  vehicles  or  on  public  roads  (such  as pedestrians  and  cyclists)  and  on  the  other  hand,  the environmental  impact  of  the  vehicle  fleet  (reduction  of pollutant emissions, noise or pressure  on  resources). The Group constantly ensures that it has appropriate tools to enable it to respond to these requirements.\n\nThe  regulatory  framework  of  the  European  Union,  which  is applicable by extension to around 40 countries geographically  in  or  close  to  Europe,  allows  approval granted  in  one  European  Union  country  on  the  basis  of a  common list  of  technical  regulations  to  be  recognized  in another  European  Union  country  and  registration  in all  European  Union  countries  without  additional  technical constraints.\n\nThe  European  framework  is  historically  the  pioneer  of many  national  technical  regulations  around  the  world. It is based in particular on Regulation (EU) No. 2018/858 on the  approval  and  market  surveillance  of  motor  vehicles and  their  trailers,  and  of  systems,  components  and separate  technical  units  intended  for  such  vehicles , amended by Regulation (EU) No. 2019/2144 of November 27, 2019, type-approval requirements for motor vehicles and their trailers, and systems, components and separate  technical  units  intended  for  such  vehicles,  as regards their general safety and the protection of vehicle occupants and vulnerable road users ,  called the 'General Safety  Regulation'  (GSR),  which  has  reinforced  approval checks  and  production  process  controls,  as  well  as statistical and continuous oversight of vehicles placed on the market and many passive and active safety technical requirements from 2022.\n\nCarmakers,  and  more  generally  the  automotive  sector, are involved in this continued strengthening of European technical  regulations,  within  the  framework  of  working groups organized by the European Commission and made up  of  the  industries  involved  in  the  Member  States.  The automotive  sector  is  also  involved  within  the  broader framework of the UN working groups, made up of around 60  countries  and  international  organizations  (including the  European  Union),  to  ensure  regulatory  changes  are made while  taking  into  account  technical  and  industrial challenges and opportunities, as well as implementation deadlines.\n\nIt should be noted that the health situation experienced in 2020 and extended to 2021 resulted in some delays in the drafting  of  regulatory  texts,  but  without  delaying  the adoption  dates.  Nor  has  it  had  any  influence  on  the determination  of  the  levels  of  regulatory  requirements\n\nwhether in terms of active and passive safety or in terms of emissions and pollutants.\n\n## 1.5.1.2. Pollutant emissions and CO 2\n\nIn  the  last  few  years  there  has  been  a  considerable change  in  regulatory  requirements  set  out  on  pollutant emissions  by Regulation  (EC)  No.  715/2007,  amended  by (EU) No. 2018/858 on type approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information , supplemented by Commission regulation (EU) No. 2017/1151 of June 1, 2017, amended by (EU) No. 2018/1832.\n\nSince  September  1,  2018,  the  pollutants  of  all  new passenger cars (PC) and light commercial vehicles (LCV) are measured using the Euro 6 and CO2 limits, during a new cycle that is more representative of use, called the WLTP (Worldwide  harmonized  Light  Duty  Test  Procedure).  The WLTP  was  implemented  one  year  later  for  new,  heavier LCVs.\n\nIn  addition  to  WLTP,  which  measures  pollutants  in  the laboratory,  a  procedure  known  as  RDE  (Real  Driving Emissions) was introduced in two stages. This procedure allows emissions to be checked  under  real  road conditions (driving, road profiles, weather, etc.).\n\nThe first  interim  stage,  called  Euro  6d  TEMP,  sets  controls for  NOx  (nitrogen  oxide)  emissions  using  a  compliance factor  of  2.1  and  particulates  by  number  (PN)  using  a compliance factor of 1.5, taking measurement uncertainties  into  account.  Euro  6d  TEMP  has  been applicable to all new PCs and LCVs since September 1, 2019, and to all heavy LCVs from September 1, 2020.\n\nA second step, known as Euro 6d, reduces this compliance factor  to  1.00  for  NOx  and  PN,  and  takes  into  account  a measurement uncertainty margin of 0.43 for NOx and 0.5 for  PN,  it  being  specified  that  the  latter  factor  will  be revised each year in the light of progress in the Portable Emissions  Measurement  System  (PEMS)  procedure  and equipment.  Euro  6d  has  been  applicable  to  new  models since 1 January 2020, and to all PCs and LCVs, as well as new  heavy  LCVs  from  January  1,  2021,  and  lastly  to  all heavy LCVs from January 1, 2022.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  regulations,  which  apply  to  exhaust emissions, evaporative emissions from the fuel systems of gasoline  vehicles  have  also  been  reduced  through  a stricter  procedure  applicable  to  all  new  vehicles  since September 1, 2019.\n\nThe regulation 'emissions' (CE) No. 715/2007 is not limited to  approval  of  new  products  but  also  requires  the inspection of customer vehicles by the manufacturer and by any Member State.

Their publication, expected at the end of 2022, will take place in early 2023.\n\nWithout  changing  the  Euro6  limits,  these  new  stages introduce more stringent requirements:\n\n- \u25cf Euro 6e (September 2023 new vehicles / September 2024 all vehicles): reduction of PEMS measurement uncertainties to 0.1 for NOx and 0.34 for PN;\n- \u25cf Euro 6ebis (January 2025 new vehicles / January 2026 all vehicles):  extension  of  temperature  conditions  for  RDE driving,  introduction  of  an  indicator  tracking  the  use  of an auxiliary emission-related strategy and reduction of the CO2 emission calculation factor for PHEVs;\n- \u25cf Euro  6ebis  FCM  (January  2027  new  vehicles  /  January 2028 all  vehicles):  second  stage  of  the  reduction  of  the CO2 emission calculation factor for PHEVs.\n\nThe  next  major  regulatory  milestone  is  Euro  7.  The European  Commission  commissioned  a  consortium  of consultants (CLOVE) to develop a substantiated proposal for the  Euro  7  technical  requirements.  The  CLOVE consortium issued proposals in April 2021.\n\nThe  co-decision  proposal  to  be  submitted  to  the Parliament and the Council, expected at the end of 2021, has been repeatedly postponed and has not been taken during 2022. The Commission's ambition is for Euro 7 to be the final step before \"zero emissions\". *\n\nAt  the  same  time,  Regulation  (EU)  2019/631  setting  CO2 emission  performance  standards is  applicable  to  new passenger  cars and light commercial  vehicles. It represents  a  very  important  component  of  climate protection in Europe.\n\nThe regulation (EU) 333/2014 had stipulated a limit of 95 g of  CO2/km  applicable  to  95%  of the  passenger  car  fleet starting from 2020. Starting from 2021, the regulation (EU) No. 2019/631 defines the targets to be reached by 2030. It stipulates  achievement  by  2025  of  a  reduction  of  15% compared  with  a  start  point  calculated  in  2021  and,  in 2030, a reduction of 37.5% compared with this same start point.  These  objectives  cannot  be  achieved  without  a significant  increase  in  the  share  of  hybrid  and  electric cars in the Renault range. In addition, regulation No. 2019/ 631 introduces an incentive to exceed a minimum level of zero- or low-emission vehicles (ZLEVs) as a percentage of the range in 2025 and 2030.\n\nUnder  the  new  package,  Fit  for  55,  passed  in  mid-2022, these targets have been raised -55% in 2030, and -100% in\n\n2035,  respectively.  This  represents  a  total  ban  on marketing new vehicles that emit CO2 at the exhaust pipe: internal-combustion  engines  but  also  hybrids,  whether rechargeable  or  not.  The  zero-  or  low-emission  vehicles (ZLEV) incentive for 2030 will also disappear.\n\nThe  same  principles  apply  to light  commercial  vehicles , with a target of 147 g of CO2/km in 2020 and ambitions for a reduction of 15% in 2025 and 31% in 2030, compared with a base  defined  in  2021.  Similarly,  the  Fit  for  55  package raises these ambitions to -50% in 2030 and -100% in 2035, with the same consequences as for private vehicles.\n\nWhile the ambition levels up to 2035 are already defined, some other points of the text were finalized in December 2022.\n\nThe health situation did not have a significant impact on regulatory  requirements  in  terms  of  emissions,  either  on their content or their timing.\n\nRegulation  2019/631  also  stipulates  a  penalty  of  \u20ac95  per gram of CO2 and per vehicle sold in the event of failure to achieve  the  above-mentioned  objectives.  However,  this regulation provides a certain amount of flexibility, such as the possibility of forming a pool between manufacturers or benefiting from gains made through eco-innovations.\n\nThis  desire  to  combat  global  warming  is  found  in  other countries where Renault operates, such as China, Brazil and India.  In  addition,  China  in  particular  has  comprehensive regulations for electric vehicles (pure and hybrid electric).\n\n*Zero  emissions  in  use:  no  CO2  emissions  or  regulated  atmospheric pollutants  when  driving,  in  accordance  with  the  WLTP  certification  cycle, excluding wear parts.\n\n## 1.5.1.3. Passive safety and active safety\n\nThe  entry  into  force  of (EU)  regulation  No.  2019/2144  on type-approval requirements for motor vehicles and their trailers, and systems, components and separate technical  units  intended  for  such  vehicles , will  require manufacturers  to  incorporate  an  entire  series  of  safety systems  and  to  design  the  structure  of  new  vehicles taking into account new requirements aimed at minimizing the severity of accidents in head-on, side and rear impact collisions.\n\n## 1.5.1.3.1. Passive safety\n\nAll newly approved PCs and LCVs from July 2022 will have to meet new requirements for head-on, side and rear impact collisions.  The  requirements will be applicable to all newly registered vehicles in the European Union from July 2024.\n\nTwo  years  after  these  dates,  new  requirements  for  the safety of pedestrians will apply to the front end of these vehicles, in order to extend the protection zones up to the windscreen.\n\nI",

Active safety\n\nFrom July 2022, all newly approved PCs and LCVs (classes M1  and  N1)  will  be  required  to  be  equipped  during manufacture with:\n\n- \u25cf an  AEB  (Advanced  Emergency  Braking)  system  to reduce the risk of collision with other vehicles, whether stationary or in motion;\n- \u25cf an  Emergency  Lane  Keeping  system  that  brings vehicles  back  into  their  lane  before  an  involuntary crossing (without indicator signals) of an unbroken line and alerts drivers in the event of an involuntary crossing of a broken line;\n- \u25cf an  Intelligent  Speed  Adaptation  system  capable  of alerting  the  driver  when  vehicle  speed  exceeds  the limits;\n- \u25cf a Driver Drowsiness & Attention Warning system, which should be based on analysis of activity at the steering wheel, pedals, etc.\n\nThese  advanced  driver  aid  systems  (ADAS)  will  become obligatory from July 2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.\n\nTwo  years  after  these  dates,  new  ADAS  will  become mandatory in turn, such as the AEB system, which takes pedestrians and cyclists into account, and the Advanced Driver  Distraction  Warning  system,  which  will  require technologies  that  use  cameras  and  image  analysis algorithms.\n\nFrom July  2022,  all  newly  approved  PCs  and  commercial vehicles  (LCVs  and  public  transit)  must,  depending  on their  PC,  public  transit,  light  LCV  or  heavy  LCV  category, be  equipped  with  pedestrian  and  cyclist  proximity detection and/or vision systems on the front, side and rear of the vehicle.\n\nThese systems will become obligatory from July 2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.\n\n## 1.5.1.4. Cybersecurity\n\nRegulation 661/2009 also introduces vehicle cybersecurity requirements (all categories) through the adoption of the new  Geneva  regulation  that  codifies  this  area.  These requirements  became  effective  in  July  2022  for  newly approved vehicles  and  will  come  into  effect  in  July  2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.\n\nThese  new  provisions  require  manufacturers  to  put  in place  a  very  well-structured  cybersecurity  governance system  to  ensure  traceability  and  transparency  of  all decisions  and  approvals  in  respect  of  the  inspection authorities  and  require  all  state-of-the-art  technical solutions  that  limit  cyber  risks  to  be  considered  in  the design of their vehicles. The system must be accredited by a third party.\n\nRenault's cybersecurity governance system was already \"accredited\" by UTAC and CNRV at the beginning of 2022, and  extensions  are  currently  taking  place,  notably  with the addition of new production sites.\n\nSeveral  countries,  including  Japan,  South  Korea,  Turkey and  Israel,  are  in  the  process  of  adopting  or  will  adopt similar requirements with the same timelines.\n\nAlongside these requirements for setting up a system of governance  of  the  cybersecurity  of  their  products, manufacturers will have to set up a system for managing software developments in order to ensure the traceability of update decisions and vehicle configurations.\n\nThe  accreditation  of  Renault's  software  development management system is scheduled for 2023.\n\n## 1.5.1.5. Autonomous and/or connected vehicles\n\nAlthough  not  a  compulsory  feature,  regulations  for vehicles  with  driverless  operation  services  cover,  in  the initial stages, systems that help drivers to stay in lane and to drive in congested traffic and on highways (Advanced Lane Keeping Systems).\n\nExtensions  to  more  ambitious  use  cases  should  become reality by 2025.\n\n'Driverless' vehicles are a special case  that  will undoubtedly be handled through testing carried out at the national level, and authorizations issued locally, for public transport and other uses.\n\nIn parallel, the rules of the road are gradually beginning to be  changed  in  order  to  authorize  the  use  of  these autonomous  driving  systems.  The  amendment  to  the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which was adopted in 2020  and  formalized  in  2021,  thus  paves  the  way  for developments in this direction in Germany, France and the UK.\n\nConnectivity  is  also  a  special  case,  insofar  as  it  involves several players outside the automotive sector, which is a real  obstacle  to  the  deployment  of  Intelligent  Transport System solutions.\n\nThe  European  Commission  is  currently  working  on  the introduction  of  electronic  means,  which  are  easier  to deploy,  of  checking  the  condition  of  vehicles  during  the Periodic Technical Inspection, for which vehicle compatibility could be imposed as early as the middle of the decade.\n\nLastly, the  \"connected  vehicle\"  poses  a  significant challenge  with  regard  to  data  and,  in  particular,  \"data access and transfers\", whether to or from the vehicle, with substantial monetization and new business possibilities in the background.",

Prohibited substances and materials and recycling\n\nThe substances regulation governs the registration of all substances and materials present in vehicles and sets out prohibitions  and  limitations  of  these  substances  and materials,  with  monitoring  of  each  vehicle  to  avoid distribution  on  the  market  of  harmful  or  prohibited products  and  facilitate  recycling  of  end-of-life  vehicles and their batteries.\n\nGlobal guidelines on regulatory substances and recycling of vehicles and batteries are mainly set by the European Union.\n\nThey include:\n\n- \u25cf the European regulations, REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of Chemicals), POP  (persistent organic pollutants), and  biocidal products for substances;\n- \u25cf the  F-GAS  regulation  on  greenhouse  gases  and  the air-conditioning systems directive;\n- \u25cf the ELV (end-of-life vehicle) and recyclability directives on  the  end-of-life  treatment  of  vehicles  with  minimum recovery,  recyclability  and  reuse  quotas  and  bans  on certain hazardous materials;\n- \u25cf the evolving battery directive on battery recycling.\n\nThe European Commission's Green Deal will prompt many vehicle  design  changes  in  the  coming  5  to  10  years  that will affect vehicle design and are expected to lead to:\n\n- \u25cf For substances, a ban on them before 2030 as long as they have a short-term or long-term negative effect on the  environment and human and life health in general through  an  accelerated  process  of  banning  by  entire families with limited exemptions.\n\nThe ban on fluorinated substances (PFAS) started in 2020 and is expected to be gradually extended until 2027 to the entire  family  of  4,700  substances.  This  accelerated process  applied  for  the  first  time  to  this  PFAS  family  is expected  to  be  extended  rapidly  to  phthalates  and  all substances  and  their  families  since  they  are  endocrine disruptors, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and to any substance that has a negative effect on the reproduction of  living  organisms  (CMR  substances),  bioaccumulative and toxic substances, substances that develop respiratory or skin allergies, or immunotoxic or neurotoxic substances.\n\nInformation about\n\nthe company,\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n| presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | the capital and     | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group     | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | the share ownership | meeting          | information  |\n\nThe European Commission is expected call for any ban on the European Union to be extended worldwide as soon as an  international  convention  of  the  UN  environmental program allows it. This is the case for persistent organic pollutants (POP).\n\n- \u25cf For batteries, transformation of the current regulation limited  to  recovery  criteria  into  a  regulation  covering their entire life cycle from the supply of raw materials to the  processing  of  batteries  as  end-of-life  waste,  while introducing conditions to facilitate the extension of the life  of  batteries  including  the  second  life  of  batteries and the re-use of their parts. This new regulation would introduce:\n- \u25cf technical  requirements  for  performance,  durability, carbon  footprint,  demountability,  recyclability  and introduction  of  recycled  materials  for  construction with new batteries;\n- \u25cf industrial  organization  requirements  imposing  on  us the  implementation  of  ethical  rules  throughout  the supply chain (due diligence) to be periodically audited by the authorities;\n- \u25cf a new regulatory framework to facilitate the second life of batteries, including in non-transport sectors;\n- \u25cf a  new  obligation  to  communicate  with  customers through a digital passport regarding the summary of the  technical  and  environmental  performance  of each battery;\n- \u25cf greater involvement in the operation of the collection and recycling channels through the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policy.\n- \u25cf For vehicles, transforming, like for batteries, the current regulations  limited  to  recovery  and  recycling  into regulations covering their entire life cycle with requirements  on  the  content  of  recycled  plastic products and ethical requirements on our supply chain. This  new  regulatory  content  should  be  extended  to  all vehicles including large commercial vehicles.\n\nOther  countries  such  as  China,  Korea,  Japan  and  India could  also  adopt  specific  requirements  for  the  recycling of  batteries  and  vehicles  and/or  emissions  of  materials present  in  vehicles  to  guarantee  passenger  cabin  air quality.\n\n## 1.5.1.7. Stronger oversight\n\nThe unique legal environment in European Union Member States  shows  a  general  trend  towards  more  stringent requirements  and  oversight  of  them  by  regulatory authorities, whether  through  stricter monitoring of approval tests,  maintaining  the  performance  of  vehicles throughout  their  life  via  engine  compliance  inspections, maintaining  the  general  condition  of  the  rolling  vehicle population  via  reinforced  technical  controls,  enhanced verification  of  the  compliance  of  production  (COP)  and monitoring  the  compliance  of  new  vehicles  put  on  the market.\n\nI",

Another  purpose  of  market oversight is the monitoring of the functioning of technical services and approval authorities in each European Union Member State to detect and correct malfunctions in the European approval system.\n\n## 1.5.2 Environmental regulations\n\nAs  part  of  its  production  of  automotive  vehicles  and mechanical  equipment  and  the  sale  of  its  products, Renault Group is required, in the various countries where its  vehicles  and  products  are  located  or  marketed,  to comply  with certain regulations that are directly applicable to it, in particular with regard to the sites and installations  that  operates  and  the  substances  used  as part of its production process.\n\nBecause  of  its  activities,  Renault  Group  is  subject  to environmental  regulations,  concerning,  among  other areas,  emissions  into  the  air,  waste  management  and water and soil impacts.\n\nThe  main  regulations  applicable  to  Renault  Group's industrial, logistics and commercial activities are described below.\n\n## 1.5.2.1. Industrial emissions management\n\nDirective No. 2010/75 of November 24, 2010, known as the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) , replaced the Integrated Pollution Prevention and  Control (IPPC) Directive  and  six  sector  directives,  including  the  large combustion plants directive (2001/80/EC).\n\nThe  IED  strengthens  a  number  of  requirements  for  the prevention and reduction of pollution emitted by industrial installations into the air, water and soil. It also establishes thresholds that are not to be exceeded.\n\nIt  states  that  certain industrial facilities must first obtain administrative authorization. This authorization cannot be issued by the competent administrative authority unless certain  environmental  conditions  are  met  (the  operator takes  adequate  preventive  measures  against  pollution and  the  facilities at least respect the regulatory thresholds).\n\nOne of the guiding principles of this directive is the use of best available techniques (BAT) to prevent pollution of all kinds. Activities that require administrative authorization must  meet  the  BAT  standard  established,  reviewed  and updated  by  the  European  Commission,  which  publishes\n\nthe  conclusions  in  the  'BREF'  (best  available  techniques reference document).\n\nMost  of  the  Group's  industrial  sites  depend  on  the  BREF STS  (surface  treatment  using  solvents)  for  automotive paint  activities,  which  has  been  revised  and  whose  new conclusions  were  published  on  9  December  2020  in Decision  (EU)  2020/2009.  After  submitting  the  review dossier, the sites concerned will have to put in place BATs by  December  2024  to  comply  with  the  new  thresholds established  in  this  document.  In  addition,  the  revision  of the  BREF  SF  concerning  foundries,  and  STM,  concerning surface treatment activities, also started in 2019 and 2022, respectively.  Following  the  same  logic  as  the  BREF  STS, this  revision  will  eventually  set  the  future  emission  limits for these activities.\n\nThe IED Directive also requires a \"base report\" describing the  facilities  concerned  and  comprising  a  soil  and groundwater  diagnosis  before  the  facility  is  put  into operation  or  before  the  first  update  of  the  authorization issued. Finally, the Directive redefines the requirement to restore the site upon cessation of activity.\n\n## 1.5.2.2. Air emissions management\n\n## European Directive  (EU)  2015/2193  of  November  25,  2015 ,\n\nregulates  emissions  from  medium-sized  combustion plants.  It  sets  emissions  thresholds  for  sulphur  dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust into the atmosphere from  combustion  plants  with  a  nominal  thermal  power greater  than  or  equal  to  1  MW  and  less  than  50  MW, regardless  of  the  type  of  fuel  that  they  use.  It  also establishes  rules  to  monitor  carbon  monoxide  (CO) emissions.\n\nOperators  must  implement  emissions  monitoring  in accordance with the requirements set out in Annexe III to this  directive  and  periodic  measurements  in  particular. CO measurements are required for all facilities.\n\nEuropean  regulation  (EU)  517/2014  of  April  16,  2014, (F-Gas) , which  repealed  regulation  (EC)  842/2006  on January  1,  2015,  aims  to  contain,  prevent  and  reduce emissions  of  fluorinated  greenhouse  gases  covered  by the Kyoto Protocol.",

Its  application  for the  4 th phase  that  has  started  (2021-2030)  is  mainly governed by Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse  gas emissions.\n\nThis  system  requires  sites  subject  to  the  regulation  to report  their  greenhouse  gas  emissions  each  year  and return a number of 'allowances' equivalent to the metric tons  of  CO2  emitted.  A  certain  number  of  allowances  is allocated free of charge, and additional allowances may be purchased on the primary or secondary markets.\n\nFor  the  4 th phase,  the  allocation  of  free  allowances  is governed by strict rules, specified in Delegated Regulation (EU)  2019/331.  Annual  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are verified  by  an  independent  accredited  third  party  as described in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067.\n\nChanges  to  this  regulation,  in  particular  the  loss  of  the 'carbon leakage' exposure status since the entry into the 4 th phase,  has  greatly  reduced  the  number  of  free allowances for sites subject to the regulation.\n\nIn Korea, an exchange system was put in place in 2015, by a 2012 law (Act on Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas  Emissions  Allowances)  and  an  associated  decree. The  sites  in  Busan  (RSM)  and  Giheung  (since  2021)  are subject to this.\n\n| presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group     | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n## 1.5.2.3. Water management\n\nRenault Group is subject to applicable European regulations  on  the  use  and  protection  of  water  since  it abstracts, uses, and discharges water during its production processes.\n\nEuropean Directive No. 2000/60/EC of October 23, 2000, known  as  the  Water  Framework  Directive  (WFD) , establishes a framework for a community water policy.\n\nThe WFD defines a framework for the management and protection of waters by major hydrographic basin at the European  level.  It  plays  a  strategic  and  founding  role  in water policy, setting ambitious objectives for the preservation  and  restoration  of  the  condition  of  surface water (freshwater and coastal water) and for groundwater.\n\nThe main objectives of the directive are:\n\n- \u25cf achieving,  starting  in  2015,  a  good  condition  for  all  of these  waters,  which  means  a  good  ecological  and chemical condition for surface water, as well as a good qualitative and quantitative condition for groundwater;\n- \u25cf adopting  a  combined  approach  of  environmental quality standards (Directive 2008/105/EC of December  16,  2008)  through  removal  of  hazardous substances and emission thresholds based on the best available techniques, using the approach leading to the most stringent standards;\n- \u25cf immediately  implementing  this  approach  for  priority hazardous substances for the Community, i.e., identifying  them  and  establishing  emission  thresholds and quality standards for them;\n- \u25cf establishing a management plan for each hydrographic basin;\n- \u25cf taking into account the principle of recovering the costs of  water-related services, integrating the polluter pays principle established by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;\n- \u25cf increasing  public  participation,  through  more  and better information and involving the public in decision-making.\n\nPublic authorities are also imposing strict regulations on industrial  wastewater  that  may  be  discharged  into collection systems and on treated wastewater and sludge from urban wastewater treatment plants.\n\nThe  WFD  set  targets  for  2015,  but  its  implementation timetable runs until 2027. Discussions are still underway on the  issue  of  water,  and  on  the  reuse  of  domestic wastewater  in  particular.  Better  treatment  of  this  water could  significantly  increase  the  use  of  wastewater, especially for agricultural irrigation.\n\nI",

This  directive  is  in  response  to  the demands  of  over  1.8  million  Europeans  who  signed  the first-ever successful European Citizens' Initiative, 'Right2Water',  in  support  of  improving  access  to  safe drinking water for all Europeans.\n\nIn 2022, the European Commission drew up a watch list of substances  and  compounds  of  concern  (2)  for  water intended  for  human  consumption  in  accordance  with Directive  (EU)  2020/2184  of  the  European  Parliament  and of  the  Council.  The  two  substances  in  question  are endocrine  disruptors;  we  will  take  into  account  the transposition  texts  in  each  of  the  countries  in  which Renault operates in order to meet these new requirements. These requirements apply to the owners of the  water  distribution  networks  (companies),  among others.  In  addition,  we  will  apply  the  new  drinking-water quality standards. It is worth nothing that the theoretical time frame for transposing this Directive into local law is two years.\n\nLastly, the scarcity of water resources is a major issue for the  coming  years.  India  has  already  put  in  place obligations in this regard. In that country, domestic water must be treated and reused in toilets.\n\n## 1.5.2.4. Waste management\n\nEuropean  Directive  2008/98/EC  of  November  19,  2008, known as the Waste Framework Directive (WFD) ,  defines the rules applicable to the treatment of waste within the European  Union.  It  applies  to  all  objects  or  substances that  the  holder  discards  or  that  he  or  she  intends  or  is required to discard. The WFD reaffirms, in the name of the polluter  pays  principle,  the  responsibility  of  a  waste producer  to  manage  its  waste  in  a  way  that  does  not endanger human health or harm the environment.\n\nThe  Directive  also  introduces  a  requirement  for  waste producers to limit their impact on the use of resources by preventing and reducing waste with a view to transitioning to a circular economy.\n\nIt  establishes  a  hierarchy  of  waste  treatment  methods, requiring  waste  producers  to  prioritize,  in  the  following order:\n\n- \u25cf waste prevention;\n- \u25cf preparation for its reuse;\n- \u25cf recycling;\n- \u25cf other forms of recovery, in particular energy recovery;\n- \u25cf disposal.\n\nIt  also  clarifies  the  concept  of  recovery,  disposal,  end  of waste status and by-products and requires the establishment  of  separate  collections  for  paper,  metal, plastic, and glass, as a minimum.\n\nThe  Basel  Convention  on  the  control  of  transboundary movements of waste and its disposal , which was adopted on March 22, 1989, and entered into force on May 5, 1992, regulates and limits transboundary shipments of waste.\n\nIt calls  on  the  187  Parties  to  observe  fundamental principles such as proximity to waste disposal, environmentally  sound  management,  prioritize  recovery, and prior informed consent to the importing of potentially hazardous substances, etc.\n\nEuropean  Regulation  (EC)  1013/2006  of  June  14,  2006 , on the  shipment  of  waste transposes  the  principles  of  the Basel Convention into European law.\n\nIt requires  the  limitation  of  cross-border  shipment  of waste through observance of the principles of proximity and prioritization of recovery. To determine if transfer of waste is possible, and the applicable procedure (communication or notification), the following need to be considered:\n\n- \u25cf the origin of the waste (country of production);\n- \u25cf the destination and route of the waste (transfer inside or outside the EU/EFTA/OECD);\n- \u25cf the  type  of  treatment  to  be  applied  to  the  waste (recovery or disposal);\n- \u25cf the type of waste transferred:\n- \u25cf non-hazardous  waste:  green  list  (Annex  III  of  the regulation);\n- \u25cf hazardous  waste:  orange  list  (Annex  IV  of  the regulation).\n\nUnder 'extended producer responsibility' (EPR) regimes , producers  who  place  waste-generating  products  on  the market must take responsibility for management of that waste financially and/or operationally. This responsibility can  be  implemented  through  individual,  shared,  or collective systems (eco-organizations).\n\nSeveral European directives have introduced this type of obligation for certain types of waste (sectors). In light of its activities,  Renault  Group  is  particularly  concerned  by regulations  relating  to  household  packaging,  batteries and accumulators (particularly for electric-vehicle batteries), end-of-life vehicles and lubricants.\n\nSeveral  new  EPR  schemes  will  be  set  up  by  2025,  with Renault  Group  being  affected  by  the  EPR  scheme  for industrial and commercial packaging.\n\nDirective  2006/66/EC of September 6, 2006, on batteries and  accumulators  as  well  as  battery  and  accumulator waste prohibits  the  marketing  of  certain  batteries  and accumulators with a mercury or cadmium content above a determined threshold.\n\nIn  addition,  it  encourages  a  high  level  of  collection  and recycling for battery and accumulator waste as well as an improvement  in  the  environmental  performance  of  all actors  in  the  life  cycle  of  batteries  and  accumulators, including during the recycling and disposal of battery and accumulator waste.",

Only  their  residues  from  both  treatment  and recycling may be landfilled or incinerated.\n\nThe  net  costs  of  collecting,  processing,  and  recycling industrial  and  automotive  batteries  and  accumulators must be paid by the producers.\n\nDirective  2000/53/EC  of  September  18,  2000,  on  end-oflife  vehicles  (ELVs) defines  the  measures  to  be  taken  to prevent and limit waste from end-of-life vehicles and their components, and to ensure that they are reused, recycled or recovered.\n\nVehicle  and  equipment  manufacturers  must  take  into account the dismantling, reuse, and recovery of vehicles in  the  design  and  production  of  their  products,  limit  the use of hazardous substances, and integrate an increasing share of recycled materials into vehicles.\n\nThe reuse and recycling rate for end-of-life vehicles must reach a minimum of 85% by weight per vehicle per year on average.  The  reuse  and  recovery  rate  must  reach  a minimum  of  95%  by  weight  per  vehicle  per  year  on average.\n\nProducers (manufacturers or importers) must set up ELV collection systems, and owners may drop off their ELVs at\n\nauthorized  treatment  facilities  only,  at  no  cost  to  them (unless the vehicle is incomplete).\n\nThere is currently no need for producers to contribute to the  economic  balance  of  the  sector,  as  the  costs  of processing ELVs is offset by the sale of stripped vehicles to  approved  shredders  and  parts  and  materials  on  the used vehicle, renovation and recycling market.\n\nIn conclusion , European  and  global  environmental regulations  have  changed  significantly  over  the  last 20  years.  Renault  Group  ensures  that  the  regulations applicable  to  it  are  identified  as  soon  as  possible  and taken into account in its production system. The European Union's  Green  Deal  is  a  new  European  roadmap  for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The policy is aimed notably at the circular economy and the preservation of resources and biodiversity,  which  are  also  central  to  the Group's concerns. Renault Group is therefore preparing to meet the new challenges by being vigilant and continuing to  pursue  an  approach  designed  to  continuously  reduce its impact on the environment.\n\nEven though the European Union is still the leader in this area,  countries  like  Korea,  China,  and  India,  which  are strongly  impacted by the scarcity of resources (water in particular)  and  increasing  pollution  (air  and  waste)  are beginning to introduce more stringent regulations.\n\n## 1.5.3 European regulations applicable to the distribution of new vehicles and spare parts\n\nRenault  Group  is  subject  to  European  competition  law. Among  other  things,  this  law  prohibits  agreements  that prevent,  restrict  or  distort  competition.  By  way  of exception, agreements limiting competition (in particular through  selection  of  resellers  or  provision  for  exclusive terms for them) are authorized when they may contribute to  improving the production and distribution of products or to promote technical or economic progress.\n\nThe  purpose  of the European  Commission's  block exemption regulations No. 2022/720 of May 10, 2022, and No. 461/2010 of May 27, 2010 ,  which are applicable to the distribution  of  new  vehicles  and  the  supply  of  spare automotive parts and to repair and maintenance services for  motor  vehicles,  respectively,  is  to  exempt  from  the prohibition  of  cartels,  agreements  presumed  to  improve distribution without eliminating competition.\n\nThe criteria for this automatic exemption depend on the market shares of the parties to an agreement (maximum threshold  of  30%)  and  the  absence  of  any  marked restrictions on competition. As applied to the automotive\n\nsector,  this  exemption  is  in  principle  applicable  to  the selection by manufacturers of their network of authorized distributors and repairers.\n\nHowever, the presence of one of the following restrictions may prohibit the exemption from being applied:\n\n- \u25cf setting the price (fixed or minimum)  at  which distributors can resell vehicles or spare parts (prohibition of resale price maintenance);\n- \u25cf the  distribution  of  geographic  markets  or  customers between  distributors  (in  particular,  the  restriction  of passive sales in a reserved region or customer group);\n- \u25cf the  ban  on  sourcing  by  authorized  distributors  from other  authorized  distributors  (restriction  of  crossdeliveries);\n- \u25cf the ban on the resale by authorized distributors of spare parts  to  independent  repairers  for  use  in  repair  or maintenance services;\n- \u25cf the  ban  on  the  use  by  authorized  repairers  of  spare parts of a quality equivalent to original parts for repair\n\nI",

Accompanied  by  new  guidelines,  also adopted  on  May  10,  2022,  it  contains  new  provisions  on e-commerce  and  the  digital  economy  and  updates  the legal  framework  for  distribution  networks.  The  most substantial changes  concern  the  strict  control of information exchanges in the context of dual distribution (a  system  combining  direct  sales  and  resales  through  a\n\nnetwork  of  distributors), the reinforcement  of the protection of selective distribution networks and the new flexibility in setting the duration of non-compete obligations.  The  exemption  conditions  in  Regulation  461/ 2010 have generally been retained.\n\nRegulation  461/2010  expires  on  May  31,  2023.  Following public consultations  held  in  2022,  the  Commission published a new draft of Regulation 461/2010 for a period of  five  years  from  June  1,  2023,  and  new  draft  guidelines. The main purpose of the updates is to clarify that vehiclegenerated  data,  which  is  considered  essential  input  for the provision of repair and maintenance services, will be subject to the same rules on access, provision of tools and training  as  the  technical  information  needed  for  repair and maintenance covered by the current framework.\n\n## 1.5.4 Community design regulations\n\nCouncil regulation (EC) No. 6/2002 of December 12, 2001, on  community  designs provides  for  the  principle  of  the repair  clause,  which  excludes  the  protection  of  visible spare  parts  of  a  vehicle  via  designs  and  models  (repair clause  principle)  in  order  to  promote  free  market competition  by  allowing  any  company  to  manufacture and sell spare parts on the after-sales market.\n\nAt the national level, European states remain divided over the  transposition  of  the  repair  clause  into  national  law. Some  countries,  such  as  Poland,  Spain  and  Germany (since  January  1,  2020),  have  transposed  this  clause. However,  other  countries  such  as  France,  Slovakia  and Croatia  refuse  this  deregulation  and  therefore  do  not apply the repair clause principle.\n\nNevertheless,  in  the  long  term,  it  is  likely  that  the  repair clause  will  become  applicable  to  all  EU  countries.  In  the\n\n## 1.5.5 Banking regulations\n\nSeveral banking sector regulations applicable to Renault Group through its subsidiary RCI Banque are likely to have a significant impact on its activities.\n\nDirective 2013/36 of June 26, 2013, on access to the activity of  credit  institutions  and  the  prudential  supervision  of credit  institutions  and  investment  companies ,  known  as the  'CRD  IV  Directive'  was  transposed  in  France  by Order  2014/158  and  by  the  Decree  of  November  3,  2014. These  texts  have  redefined  the  rules  governing  the approval conditions for credit institutions, the governance of credit institutions, internal control and senior executive compensation, with the aim of harmonizing the\n\nsummer  of  2021,  the  European  Commission  launched  a public  consultation  on  the  overall  assessment  of  the design  and  model  system  with  questions  relating  to  the repair clause.\n\nThe extension of the repair clause to all European Union countries  would  have  a  significant  economic  impact  on Renault Group's after-sales market share.\n\nFrance has just taken a first step towards  this liberalization by passing a law that, starting on January 1, 2023:\n\n- \u25cf removes copyright protection for spare parts;\n- \u25cf reduces  the  duration  of  protection  of  spare  parts  by designs to 10 years (instead of 25 years);\n- \u25cf allows original equipment manufacturers to manufacture  spare  parts  for  replacement  without  the manufacturer's prior agreement.\n\nregulations applicable to credit institutions in these areas at  European  level.  They  are  therefore  an  essential  step towards  the  achievement  of  the  internal  market  in  the banking sector. Directive 2019/878 amended Directive  2013/36  as  regards  exempted  entities,  financial holding  companies,  mixed  financial  holding  companies, compensation,  supervisory  measures  and  powers,  and capital conservation measures. This directive was transposed  into  French  law  by  Order  No.  2020-1635  of December  21,  2020,  bringing  in  a  number  of  provisions adapting  the  legislation  to  European  Union  law  on financial matters.",

This  regulation  aims  to  strengthen  the solidity of European banking institutions by improving the qualitative  and  quantitative  aspects  of  capital.  This  text was  amended  by  regulation  2019/630  as  regards  the minimum coverage of losses on non-performing exposures.  This  new  regulation  also  supplements  the existing prudential rules as regards capital with provisions for a deduction from capital if non-performing exposures are  not  sufficiently  covered  by  provisions  or  other adjustments. The CRD IV Directive was also amended by Regulation  (EU)  2019/876  of  May  20,  2019,  as  regards  the leverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio, requirements for  own  funds  and  eligible  liabilities,  counterparty  credit risk,  market  risk,  exposures  to  central  counterparties, exposures  to  collective  investment  undertakings,  large exposures, reporting and disclosure requirements, as well as  Regulation  (EU)  2020/873  of  June  24,  2020,  as  regards certain adjustments in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nDirective 2014/59 of May  15, 2014, establishing a framework  for  the  recovery  and  resolution  of  credit institutions  and  investment  companies , known  as  the 'BRRD'  set  out  a  framework  for  the  recovery  and resolution  of  credit  institutions.  This  text  aims  to  ensure that  bankruptcies  of  European  banks  are  managed  in such a way as to preserve financial stability and minimize costs for taxpayers. It gives the competent authorities the means  to  intervene  before  difficulties  arise  and,  where necessary,  at  the  start  of  the  resolution  process.  The directive  entered  into  force  on  January  1,  2015.  These measures  were  supplemented  by  regulation  806/2014  of July 15, 2014, which  established  a  single  resolution mechanism  (SRM)  and  a  single  resolution  fund  (SRF). Finally,  this  directive  was  amended by Directive 2019/879 of May 20, 2019, as regards the capacity to absorb losses and recapitalize credit institutions. This directive clarifies the  fixing  of  the  MREL  (Minimum  Requirement  for  own funds and Eligible Liabilities specific to each establishment)  and  was  transposed  into  French  law  via Order  No.  2020-1636  of  December  21,  2020,  on  the resolution regime in the banking sector.\n\nDirective 2008/48 of April 23, 2008, on credit agreements for consumers was transposed in France by Law 2010-737 of July 1, 2010, on consumer credit reform. The purpose of these texts is to provide better consumer protection and to harmonize national credit distribution rules. These texts require credit institutions to strengthen consumer information  by  providing  them  with  a  standardized\n\nEuropean pre-contractual information sheet. This directive is currently being revised at the European level.\n\nDirective 2018/843 of May 30, 2018, amended Directive 2015/ 849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes  of money  laundering  or  terrorist financing . This  text  was  transposed  in  France  by  Government  Order 2020-115 of February 12, 2021. This system:\n\n- \u25cf strengthens the transparency of complex legal entities and legal structures by broadening access to registers of beneficial owners;\n- \u25cf sets  out  the  enhanced  due  diligence  measures  to  be implemented with respect to business relationships  or transactions involving high-risk third countries;\n- \u25cf sets  out  the  guarantees  to  be  put  in  place  to  mitigate high  money  laundering  risks  associated  with  entering into a remote business relationship;\n- \u25cf establishes the principle of consolidated supervision of AML-CFT procedures by banking and insurance groups.\n\nDirective  2016/97  of  January  20,  2016,  on  insurance distribution ,  transposed  in  France  by  Decree  2018-361  of May 16,  2018,  aims  to  ensure  better  consumer  protection and  harmonize  national  rules  for  the  distribution  of insurance products. This text requires the establishment of governance procedures for the design and distribution of insurance  products  and  the  delivery  of  a  new standardized information document (IPID) to customers.\n\nOn  February  25,  2019,  the  European  Banking  Authority published Outsourcing Guidelines (EBA/GL/2019/02). These guidelines set forth a governance  framework  for outsourcing  operations.  Accordingly,  they  require  an evaluation  of  each  subcontractor,  the  keeping  of  a register  of  services  outsourced,  and  the  inclusion  in contracts  with  subcontractors  of  a  certain  number  of clauses  to  ensure  good  control  of  the  risks  associated with the outsourcing.\n\nOn  January  18,  2017,  the  European  Banking  Authority published guidelines on the application of the definition of default (EBA/GL/2016/07).  The  purpose  of  this  text  is  to harmonize the definition of default by providing a detailed clarification  of  the  various  reasons  for  default  (including the counting of days in arrears), the conditions for a return to non-default and the associated processes. The text will be applicable starting January 1, 2021.\n\nIn  addition,  the  European  Commission  has  adopted  the delegated  regulation  2018/171  entitled  \"Final  report  on materiality threshold for credit obligation past due\" (RTS/ 2016/06).  This  text  introduces  a  unique  methodology  for the  counting  of  days  in  arrears  (Day  past  due  counting) based  on  the  application  of  absolute  and  relative materiality thresholds.\n\nI",

The  transactions contemplated in  these  definitive  agreements  would  be  subject  to  a  limited  number  of  conditions  precedent,  including regulatory approvals, and completion is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThis far-reaching program paves the way for a renewal and strengthening of the 24-year partnership, creating a new agile spirit and harnessing the pioneering technologies of all three Alliance members. This next level will create more growth opportunities and help secure operating efficiencies for each Alliance company to innovate and transform in the fastchanging market for automotive products and mobility services.\n\nUnder  it,  Renault  Group  would  transfer  28.4%  of  its  Nissan  shares  into  a  French  trust,  where  voting  rights  would  be 'neutralized' for most decisions, but where economic rights (dividends and proceeds from the sale of shares) would still fully benefit Renault Group until the sale of those shares. Renault Group and Nissan would retain a 15% cross-shareholding, with a retention obligation, as well as an obligation to cap their holdings. They would both be able to freely exercise the voting rights attached to their 15% working interest, with a 15% cap. Renault Group would instruct the trustee to sell these Nissan shares if the economic conditions are reasonable for Renault Group, in an organized and orderly process, but the trustee would have no obligation to sell its shares within a specific predetermined period. The Alliance Operating Board would remain the coordinating body.\n\nThis announcement has no impact on the consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Aramco  signs  letter  of  intent  with  Geely  and  Renault  Group  for  new  powertrain  company  to  focus  on  lower  emission technologies :\n\nAramco has signed a letter of intent to potentially become a minority shareholder in the new powertrain company (PWT) to be  established  by  Geely  Holding  Group  (Geely  Holding),  Geely  Automobile  Holdings  Limited  (Geely  Auto  HK.0175)  collectively referred to above as \"Geely\" - and Renault Group. The new company will focus on internal combustion and hybrid powertrain technologies.\n\nAramco's  investment  would  be  used  to  support  the  company's  growth  and  contribute  to  research  and  development, particularly in synthetic fuel solutions and future generation hydrogen engines.\n\nWith a global network of 17 powertrain factories and five R&D centers on three continents, the future company will be a fullfledged global supplier with a total capacity of more than 5 million powertrains and engines, hybrids and plug-in hybrids per year to supply further 130 countries and regions.\n\nI",

These  three  pillars  support  Renaulution's transformation  into  a  greener,  more  tech-intensive company driven by data, energy and services:\n\n- \u25cf the first pillar, the environment, involves carbon footprint reduction  and  optimized  use  of  resources  through  the development of our circular economy activities;\n- \u25cf the second pillar, safety, by leveraging the technology in our  vehicles  to  improve  the  safety  of  users  of  our vehicles and services on the roads. This pillar also covers the safety of employees in the workplace;\n- \u25cf the  third  pillar,  inclusion:  the  shift  toward  the  new businesses  of  electrification, data  and  the  circular economy will be achieved by supporting the\n\ntransformation of skills and promoting diversity within the Group.\n\n'Carmaker and caremakers': we make cars but also take care of those who design and build them and those who use them while limiting our impact on the planet we rely on to produce them.\n\nThis  strategy  is  the  result  of  a  major  collaborative  and unifying  process  involving  the  Company's  management bodies,  the  Group  Works  Council  and  all  employees worldwide (via an open global survey) as well as external stakeholder panels. A study on the company's culture was also carried out at this time.

Each year, members must attest to the effective implementation of these  principles  in  a  'progress  communication'  report, which is posted on the Global Compact's website.\n\nTwenty-two  years  later,  the  United  Nations  Global Compact  is  the  world's  largest  voluntary  corporate sustainability  initiative,  bringing  together  more  than 13,000  participants  in  170  countries.  Nearly  70  local networks  around  the  world  ensure  a  close  relationship with members and national mobilization.\n\nThese 10 principles are inspired by:\n\n- \u25cf the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;\n- \u25cf the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work;\n- \u25cf the International Labour Organization;\n- \u25cf the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development;\n- \u25cf the United Nations Convention against Corruption.\n\nThe  Global  Compact  is  also  the  starting  point  for  any organization  seeking  to  support  the  17  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in September 2015 by the  UN.  These  goals  offer  a  universal  agenda  to  be achieved  by  2030  to  build  a  more  sustainable  and inclusive world.\n\n## Our contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)\n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in September 2015 by the Member States of the United Nations, is an  action  plan  designed  to  eradicate  poverty,  protect  the  planet  and  ensure  that  all  human  beings  live  in  peace  and prosperity.  It  is  structured  around  17  Sustainable  Development  Goals  and  169  targets  that  take  into  account  the three aspects of sustainable development: the economy, social aspects and the environment. The latter are aimed at all stakeholders: States, local authorities, civil society, and economic and financial actors.\n\nThrough its geographical footprint, the diversity of its businesses and its commitment to ESG, Renault Group contributes to a greater or lesser extent -  to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals identified by the United Nations. This contribution is highlighted in the table below based on the targets the company has set and examples of actions. It should be noted that the Group contributes directly to SDGs 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 16.\n\nI",

Chaired by Jean-Dominique Senard and made up of representatives  of  (most  of)  our  stakeholders  and  certain  members  of  the  Leadership  Team  (formerly  BoM)  of  Renault Group,  the  Raison  d'\u00eatre  Committee  sheds  light  on  matters  for  the  Board  of  Directors  through  its  analyses  and recommendations on environmental, social and societal issues.\n\nDialog with stakeholders also helped to develop the materiality matrix of ESG challenges.\n\n## 2.1.4.1.

Renault Group materiality matrix: identification of material issues and ESG risks\n\nAt  the  end  of  2019  and  the  beginning  of  2020,  Renault Group  conducted  a  materiality  analysis  to  identify  and prioritize the environmental, social, societal and governance issues it will face over the next five years.\n\nThis analysis consists of crossing an internal vision of the importance  of  ESG  (environment,  social,  societal  and governance) topics with the vision of external stakeholders  in  order  to  identify  the  'material'  topics, those  on  which  the  Company  must  focus  its  efforts because they have a major impact on its ecosystem and its performance over the next five years.\n\nThis new materiality matrix updates the 2015 matrix and enables the Group to focus its strategy and environmental, social, societal and governance initiatives. Spearheaded by the Sustainable Development Department, a group-wide steering committee supervised the  methodological  approach and the key stages of the project. This matrix was validated in January 2020 by the Group  Executive  Committee  and  by  Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Methodological approach\n\nThe  materiality  matrix  was  defined  by  management representatives  from  the  Company's  main  departments/ functions, based on internal and external data.\n\nThe  first  stage  of  the  process  was  to  define  the comprehensive list of ESG issues to which Renault Group is faced  as  a  car  maker  and  supplier  of  mobility  services. Numerous  sources  were  consulted  to  prepare  this  list, particularly the ESG rating criteria, competitors' materiality matrices, press articles and interviews with experts.\n\nAll  of  the  issues  collected  were  grouped into 14 coherent macro-issues.  The  importance  of  each  issue  along  each axis of the matrix was then assessed.\n\nThe  y-axis  represents  the  influence  on  stakeholders' opinions or behavior and classifies the issues according to the  ESG  expectations  of  the  Group's  stakeholders.  The importance of issues along this axis was determined from interviews  with  stakeholder  representatives  (employees, NGOs,  suppliers,  car  dealerships,  start-ups,  researchers, public sector, investors) as well as a survey of 3,500 customers in seven countries.\n\nThe  x-axis  illustrates the impact  on  the  Company's sustainable performance and represents the contribution of each  theme  to  long-term  value  creation.  To  assess  the importance of each issue along this axis, internal interviews took place with the Group's General Management, employees  in  the  main  departments/functions  and  an internal survey with 200 of Renault Group's top managers.\n\nThe  issues  were  then  refined  and  placed  on  the materiality matrix  during  a  collaborative  workshop bringing  together  the  representatives  of  the  company's main business lines/functions.\n\nAs in 2015, reducing the total carbon footprint and reducing the impact of the use of vehicles on air quality are Renault Group priorities. Internal and external stakeholders expect the Group to continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution due to road transport. They also assessed the impact of these two issues on Renault's longterm  sales  performance  as  critical,  notably  due  to tightened  regulations  and  the  decrease  in  the  societal acceptability of vehicle emissions.\n\nSimilarly, Improving passenger and road user safety and Limiting the impact on resources particularly through the circular economy remain two major stakeholder expectations,  as  well  as  being  important  issues  to guarantee the Company's performance. These expectations  were  taken  into  account  in  the  new sustainability strategy announced in April 2021.\n\nSome  issues  increased  in  importance  in  the  2020 materiality  matrix.  One  of  the  main  changes  compared with 2015 concerns stakeholder expectations (particularly for investors  and  the  public  sector)  on  corporate governance. Guaranteeing robust governance was considered to be an essential prerequisite when undertaking  any  transformation  of  Renault  Group  and was,  therefore,  prioritized  both  in  terms  of  stakeholder expectations and impact on Company performance.\n\nIn  a  context  of  changes  in  skill  requirements  (related  to the electric vehicle, connected and autonomous technologies, etc.) and growing employee expectations in terms of the environment and working methods, Ensuring employee well-being and development is also a growing issue  for  Renault.  This  expectation  was  also  taken  into account  in  the  new  sustainable  development  strategy with the creation of ReKnow University.\n\nIn response to the ongoing transformation of the mobility industry and the growing search for optimization of urban areas, the internal stakeholders expect the contribution of Renault Group to the transformation of urban mobility to have  a  more  significant  impact  on  the  Company's performance than in 2015.\n\nStakeholder  expectations  concerning  the  Company's actions  on  Ensuring  respect  for  human  rights  and  work throughout  the  supply  chain  were  also  reinforced compared with 2015.",

The  complete  approach  and comprehensive information on risks in general are presented in chapter 4 this Universal registration document.\n\n## 2.1.5.1. Extra-financial performance reporting methodology\n\n## Regulatory context\n\nIn accordance with Order No. 2017-1180 of July 19, 2017, and Decree  No.  2017-1265  of  August  9,  2017,  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  Renault  Group  has  established  the Extra-Financial Performance Declaration ('EFPD').\n\nIdentification of the main social, societal and environmental risks of the Group is based on international standards and norms - such as INERIS (National Institute for  the  Industrial  Environment  and  Risks)  and  the  GRI (Global  Reporting  Initiative)  -  as  well  as  internal  mapping (Group  major  risks,  corruption  risks,  pursuant  to  the provisions of the French 'Sapin II' act, risks relating to the vigilance plan, as well as issues identified in the materiality matrix (see 2.1.4)).\n\n## Process of identification of the main extra-financial risks\n\nIdentification and summarizing of the principal risks with regard to the expectations of the EFPD were undertaken collaboratively,  under  the  supervision  of  the  Sustainable Development  Department  and  the  Risk  Management Department, with representatives of the various departments and managers in charge of subjects coming within  the  scope  of  the  Extra-Financial  Performance Declaration, and notably:\n\n- \u25cf the environment;\n- \u25cf human resources;\n- \u25cf international social relations;\n- \u25cf purchasing and relationships with suppliers and subcontractors;\n- \u25cf health, safety, ergonomics and the environment (HSEE);\n- \u25cf IS/IT;\n- \u25cf road safety;\n- \u25cf the development of new products and services;\n- \u25cf tax;\n- \u25cf legal affairs;\n- \u25cf ethics and compliance.\n\nRenault Group also takes into account the United Nations Sustainable Development  Goals  (SDG)  and  market practices identified in its sector.\n\nThe  Company  has  also  taken  into  consideration  the information  listed  in  Article  L.  225-102-1  (III)  of  the  French Commercial Code. Certain topics have not been identified as  pertinent  principal  risks  in  respect  of  the  Group's activities and shareholders' known expectations, notably those  relating to food  (food  waste,  fighting  food insecurity, respect for animal welfare and responsible, fair and sustainable food).\n\nThis  list  of  risks  was  reviewed  by  the  Strategy  and Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nThis  work  enabled  identification  of  a  list  of  31  principal extra-financial  risks  grouped  within  the  following  five areas:\n\n- \u25cf social;\n- \u25cf societal;\n- \u25cf environmental;\n- \u25cf human rights;\n- \u25cf the fight against corruption and tax evasion.\n\nPolicies, procedures and the results of these procedures, including performance indicators, have been established for each of these risks.\n\nThe 31 principal risks were categorized as E for the main Environmental  risks,  S  for  Social  and  Societal  and  G  for Governance  and  related  to  the  issues  in  the  materiality matrix (see table in 2.1.5.2 below).\n\n## Data collection process\n\nEach indicator is associated with a coordinator, generally a  business-line  expert,  who  has  collected,  checked  and consolidated the data within his/her reporting scope.\n\nThe indicators are then initially validated by the manager responsible  for  producing  the  indicator  within  his/her activity, then validated again by the manager of the entity concerned.\n\nAll of  the  data  is  consolidated  by  the  Sustainable Development Department.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.6 Taxonomy EFPD7b\n\nThe  publication  of  information  about  the  role  that companies will have to play in mitigating and adapting to climate change is currently expected within the framework  of  the  European  taxonomy.  The  Group  is responding to these challenges by aiming for net zero by 2040 across Europe and by 2050 worldwide, adopting an approach which covers the entire life cycle of its vehicles.\n\n## The most diverse range of electric vehicles\n\nThe  carbon  footprint  of  vehicles  in  use  accounted  for nearly  80%  of  the  Group's  carbon  footprint  in  2022. Thanks  to  the  range  of  vehicles  described  below,  the Group aims to achieve a reduction of up to -65% in Europe and  -35%  worldwide  for  emissions  in  use  (scope  3 downstream). Renault Group has a decade of experience in the design, manufacture, sale, and after-sale service of electric vehicles (EV). More than 30,000 Group employees worldwide  have  been  trained  in  the  considerations specific to electric mobility, including the entire European sales  network.  Worldwide,  there  are  more  than  685,000 electric vehicles are on the road. In just over 10 years, the Group and the Alliance have already invested more than \u20ac10 bn in electrification. Thanks to these long-term efforts, the  two  brands  Renault  and  Dacia  have  a  total  of  10 different  models,  from  the  Twizy  small  city  car  to  the Master light commercial  vehicle. In 2022, Renault launched  Megane  E-Tech  Electric,  the  first  model  of  its 'generation  2.0'  of  electric  vehicles  to  benefit  from  the advantages  of  the  Alliance's  CMF-EV  platform,  100% 'Made in ElectriCity', Renault Group's new industrial hub, one of the most competitive in Europe, located in northern France.  In  2021,  Dacia  unveiled  the  most  affordable electric  vehicle  on  the  market:  Spring.  This  movement  is accelerating: the Alliance will invest \u20ac23 bn over the next five  years.  Thanks  to  five  common  electric  platforms covering  most  segments,  the  Renault  brand  aims  to become  100%  electric  for  passenger  cars  in  Europe  in 2030. In November 2022, Renault Group announced a new organization  that  will  enable  it  to  capture  value  from  all the new profit pools by creating five targeted businesses, with  specialized  teams,  each  built  on  a  uniform  set  of technologies,  with  its  own  dedicated  governance  and profit and loss account income statement:\n\n- \u25cf Ampere: the first electric and software pure player born out of the disruption of a traditional car manufacturer;\n- \u25cf Alpine:  an  exclusive,  zero-emission,  global  brand  with racing as its DNA. A unique asset-light model combined with proprietary technologies;\n- \u25cf Mobilize:  built  around  a  first-class  financial  captive  to address  the  new  mobility,  energy,  and  data  services market;\n- \u25cf THE  FUTURE  IS  NEUTRAL:  the  automotive  industry's first company dedicated to the 360\u00b0 circular economy: from the closed loop of materials to  battery  recycling. This activity contributes  to  the  objective  of  the transition  to  a  circular  economy  of  the  European Taxonomy, which will be published later;\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nSustainable development\n\n- \u25cf Power:  Renault  Group's  traditional  core  business  will continue to develop innovative low-emission combustion  and  hybrid  vehicles  under  the  Renault Dacia  and  Renault  LCV  (light  commercial  vehicles) brands,  each  with  its  own  dedicated  organization  and governance.\n\n## Ampere: the first EV and software pure player originating from a manufacturer\n\nWith  Ampere,  Renault  Group  is  creating  an  autonomous entity that will be the first electric and software pure player originating  from  a  vehicle  manufacturer.  Ampere  will develop, manufacture, and sell fully electric passenger cars with  advanced SDV (Software Defined Vehicle) technology under the Renault brand. Ampere will bring the best of both worlds: the know-how and assets of Renault Group with the focus and agility of a pure player in electric vehicles.\n\nBy  2030,  Ampere's  range  of  6  electric  vehicles  will  be ideally  positioned  in  the  most  dynamic  segments  in Europe  covering  80%  of  the  non-specialized  electric market: in the B segment with the new Renault 5 Electric and Renault 4 Electric and in the C segment with Megane E-Tech  Electric,  Scenic  Electric  and  2  other  vehicles  to come. Much of the investment in the first  4  vehicles  has already been spent.\n\nAmpere  aims  to  produce  around  1  million  EVs  for  the Renault brand by 2031.\n\nAmpere  relies  on  3  technological  pillars  that  make  it unique in the EV and software ecosystem:\n\n- \u25cf a  high-tech  and  highly  competitive  manufacturing footprint:  ElectriCity  is  already  one  of  the  largest  and most competitive EV production centers in Europe. This involves  three  industrial  sites  in  the  north  of  France capable  of  producing  and  assembling  more  than 400,000 electric vehicles -expandable to 1 million - including batteries, using other Renault Group facilities. ElectriCity also offers a unique local ecosystem with 80% of suppliers within a 300km radius;\n- \u25cf a  European value chain for EVs: Ampere partners with the most relevant players to access know-how, ensure sustainable sourcing and gain visibility and control over costs  and  performance.  Through  its  European  supply chain,  Ampere  will  provide  more  than  80  GWh  needed for its cars by 2030. The value chain coverage of electric vehicles  has  increased  from  10%  in  2020  to  over  30% and will reach 80% by 2030;\n- \u25cf Revolutionary Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) technology: SDV is the future of the automotive industry, as  it allows  the  car  to  be  constantly  upgraded throughout  its  life  cycle,  to  learn  from  its  users  and  to remain  linked  to  the  manufacturer  from  the  time  it leaves the factory to the end of its life. It allows further progress  to  be  made  in  terms  of  energy  performance: the mass of the vehicle is reduced by transferring many functionalities from the hardware to the software, and the  high  level  of  integration  allows  advanced  ecodriving aids to be provided.\n\nI",

These  services, combined  in  a  one-stop  solution,  will  meet  the  needs  of individuals, fleets and mobility operators.\n\nMobilize's  mission  is  to  make  mobility  cleaner,  shared, more accessible and more affordable.\n\n- \u25cf Electric  vehicles  have  many  advantages  that  make them not only an ideal choice for personal use, but also the perfect vehicle for car-sharing. Renault has understood  this,  since  nearly  12,000  of  the  brand's electric vehicles are available for car-sharing every day in some twenty European cities, either on point to point with dedicated parking spaces or free-floating with no pick-up or drop-off points, such as Zity, which was first introduced in Madrid in 2017, in Paris in 2020 and then in Milan and Lyon in 2022.\n\nThe  Group  works  across  the  entire  value  chain,  and  its efforts  also  focus  on  decarbonizing  its  supply  chain (scope  3  upstream)  and  production  factories  (scopes  1 and 2).\n\n## A decarbonized industrial value chain\n\nThe  Group  is  targeting  a  reduction  of  up  to  30%  in  the carbon footprint per kilo of materials purchased by 2030 (scope  3  upstream)  through  a  specific  effort  on  steel, aluminum, tires, polymers and electronic components and up  to  a  35%  reduction  in  the  carbon  footprint  of  its battery.\n\nThe  upcoming  application  of  an  internal  carbon  price  in our  purchases  of  parts  and  materials  will  enable  us  to better manage this effort.\n\nIn addition to this responsible sourcing strategy, there are structuring partnerships such as with Envision AESC and Verkor for low-carbon batteries, which will be manufactured  in  France,  with  Valeo  for  rare-earth-free electric motors, also manufactured in France, Plug Power for hydrogen, Terrafame for nickel sourcing from Finland, Vulcan  Energy  for  low-carbon  lithium  extracted  from geothermal resources in Germany, and Managem for lowcarbon cobalt sourcing from Morocco.\n\nPartnerships have also been announced to accelerate the decarbonization plan for our production sites (scope 2):\n\n- \u25cf With  Voltalia,  the  largest  green  electricity  supply contract in France to cover up to 50% of the electricity consumption of its production activities in 2027 through the installation of photovoltaic panels;\n- \u25cf With the ENGIE Group, a first-of-its-kind deep geothermal project in Europe that would replace 70% of the gas needs of the Douai factory by 2025;\n- \u25cf With  Dalkia,  EDF  Group,  a  partnership  to  install  a biomass boiler to replace 65% of the gas consumption at its Maubeuge plant;\n\nThese three strategic partnerships constitute a new step in  the  Global  Climate  Plan  and  will  contribute  to  the  net zero  carbon  objective  for  the  factories  of  the  ElectriCity division in France in 2025, in Europe in 2030 and worldwide in 2050.\n\n## Eligible activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy\n\nAll  of  the  Group's  sustainable  development  efforts  are now  developed  by  Regulation  (EU)  2020/852  of  the European Parliament and of the Council of June 18, 2020, on  the  establishment  of  a  framework  to  facilitate sustainable investment within the European Union, known as 'Taxonomy'.\n\nFor  the  2022  financial  year,  the  Group  considers  that, among  its  various  industrial  and  service  activities,  the following activities are eligible for the taxonomy:\n\n- \u25cf Low-carbon manufacturing technologies for transport (taxonomy  code  3.3),  including  activities  such  as  the manufacture, repair, maintenance, adaptation, repurposing, and sale of vehicles\n- \u25cf Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and commercial vehicles (taxonomy code 6.5), including the activities of purchasing, financing, renting, leasing and operating passenger and light commercial vehicles\n\nThese  eligible  activities concern  both  electric  and combustion-engine  vehicles;  the  Group  thus  complies with  the  'Commission  notice  on  the  interpretation  of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under  Article  8  of  EU  Taxonomy  Regulation  on  the reporting  of  eligible  economic  activities  and  assets' (2022/C 385/01), published on October 6, 2022.\n\nWithin this scope, activities are considered to be aligned if they:\n\n- \u25cf make  a  substantial  contribution  to  the  objective  of climate change mitigation, i.e. those relating to vehicles emitting  less  than  50  g  of  CO2e  per  kilometer , also referred to as 'low-emission vehicles' in this section\n- \u25cf do  not  cause  significant  harm  (\"Do  Not  Significantly Harm\" or DNSH) other environmental objectives: climate change  adaptation,  protection  and  sustainable  use  of water  and  marine  resources,  transition  to  a  circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and ecosystem biodiversity protection and restoration\n- \u25cf respect the Minimum Social Safeguards .",

The Group is thus ahead of the curve in terms of the circular economy, with the Refactory in Flins and  Seville in terms  of battery recycling, reconditioning  and  electrical  retrofitting  of  vehicles,  and the creation of THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL.\n\n## Fulfillment of DNSH criteria\n\nThe  methods  used  for  the  detailed  verification  of  these criteria  are  described  in  the  methodological  note  (see 2.6.1.1).\n\nRenault  Group  complies  with  European  regulation  No. 1907/2006,  known  as  \"REACH\",  particularly  in  the  use  of chemicals known as \"Substances of Very High Concern\" (SVHC). The  DNSH  criteria  linked  to  the  Pollution Prevention and  Control goal go beyond  'REACH' requirements by prohibiting the manufacture, placing on\n\nthe  market  and/or  use  of  these  substances,  and  even more  generally  of  all  non-regulated  substances  called \"Substances Of Concern\" (SOCs), except if their 'use has been  proven  to  be  essential  for  the  society'.  Such  a requirement  has  not  yet  been  precisely  defined  by  the European authorities, and a many of these substances are currently needed to produce the majority of manufactured  products  while  complying  with  current regulations. To date, we are unable to say whether the use of  these  SVHCs  and  SOCs  is  \"essential  for  society\", because  of  both  the  legal  vacuum  and  the  lack  of evidence to support the use of SOCs, as there is no official comprehensive list and REACH requirements for them. We hope  to  be  able  to  reassess  our  compliance  with  these DNSH criteria based on the definition of 'essential use for the  society'  that  will  ultimately  be  adopted  and  the subsequent documentation that may be put in  place  on SOCs.\n\n## Sets of substances defined by (CE) no 1907/2006 'REACH' regulation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compliance with Minimum Social Safeguards\n\nRenault  Group  implements  the  procedures  and  tools necessary  to  ensure  that  legislative,  regulatory  and contractual  rules  are  applied  at  the  level  of  each  group entity and that suppliers and subcontractors undertake to comply with them.\n\nRenault  Group  is  committed  to  key  values,  respect  for human rights and ethical practices, and it contributes to the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals (SDGs) (see 2.1.3).\n\nIn addition, the Group's vigilance plan (see 2.2) implemented  pursuant  to  the  law  of  March  27,  2017, relating to the duty of vigilance of parent companies and ordering companies is based on:\n\n- \u25cf risk mapping (identification, analysis and prioritization);\n- \u25cf a regular assessment of the situation of the Group and its  subsidiaries  with  regard  to  the  mapping  of  risks broken down by type of risk;\n- \u25cf the  implementation of appropriate actions to mitigate risks or prevent serious harm;\n- \u25cf monitoring  implementation  measures  and  evaluating their effectiveness;\n- \u25cf an alert mechanism and collection of reports relating to the existence or occurrence of risks.\n\nConsequently,  we  consider  that  the  overall  policy implemented  both  as  an  employer  and  as  a  car manufacturer is sufficiently solid so that, in the absence of indications  of  non-compliance,  it  is  considered  that  the aforementioned rules are respected.\n\nI",

However, given the fact that these are, to date,  only  recommendations  and  given  the  many  legal uncertainties  attached  to  them,  in  particular  on  the consequences  of  non-compliance  with  these  new  rules, moreover underlined by the Platform in its report, Renault Group chose not to anticipate its implementation and to wait  for  all  the  CSRD  and  CSDDD  texts  to  be  definitively adopted.\n\n## Key performance indicators for aligned activities\n\n## Turnover\n\nThe definition of turnover in the EU taxonomy corresponds to turnover  as  reported  in  the  IFRS  consolidated  financial statements,  which  totaled  \u20ac46.4  bn  for  the  2022  financial year (see 2.6.1.1).\n\nOf this total:\n\n- \u25cf \u20ac41.7 bn, or 89.8% of the Group's turnover, is attributable to  economic  activity  3.3  (Low-carbon  technologies  for transport)\n- \u25cf \u20ac3.2  bn,  or  7.0%  of  the  Group's  turnover,  is  attributable  to economic activity 6.5 (transport by motorbikes, passenger cars, and light commercial vehicles)\n\nand  classified as eligible for the taxonomy.  This represents  a  total  of  \u20ac44.9  bn,  or  96.8%  of  the  Group's turnover\n\nOf these receipts, \u20ac5.2 bn meets the selection criteria used to measure  the  substantial  contribution  to  climate change  mitigation.  This  includes  all  revenues  generated by  our  electric  vehicles  (EV)  and  plug-in  hybrids  (PHEV), which account for 11.3% of total Group turnover.\n\nDue to a prudent interpretation of the DNSH requirements relating to the pollution prevention and control objective (see  2.6.1.1),  the  aligned  turnover  is  declared  nil.  However, 9% of our sales of low-emission vehicles 2 comply with:\n\n- \u25cf the European  environmental  regulations  in  force, including those covering the use of substances;\n- \u25cf the DNSH  criteria concerning  the  environmental objectives of adaptation to climate change, protection and  sustainable  use  of  water  and  marine  resources, transition  to  a  circular  economy  and  protection  and restoration of the biodiversity of ecosystems and\n- \u25cf minimum social safeguards.\n\n## Investments\n\nAccording  to  the  definition  given  by  the  Taxonomy (see 2.6.1.1), the Group's investments (Capex) amounted to \u20ac4,231m for the 2022 financial year.\n\nOf this total, 100% is attributable to economic activity 3.3 (Low-carbon technologies for transport) and classified as eligible for the taxonomy.\n\nOf these Capex, \u20ac836m, or 19.8% of the total amount meet the  selection  criteria  used  to  measure  the  substantial contribution  to  climate  change  mitigation.  On  this perimeter, are respected:\n\n- \u25cf European environmental regulations;\n- \u25cf the DNSH  criteria concerning  the  environmental objectives of adaptation to climate change, protection and  sustainable  use  of  water  and  marine  resources, transition  to  a  circular  economy  and  protection  and restoration of the biodiversity of ecosystems;\n- \u25cf minimum social safeguards.\n\nTaking  into  account  all  the  DNSH  criteria  the  aligned Capex  amounted  is  \u20ac476m,  or  11.2%  of  the  Group's  total Capex.",

Procedures for regular assessment of the situation of the Group and its subsidiaries based on the risk mapping\n\nThe  assessment  of  the  situation  of  the  Group  and  its subsidiaries  in  view  of  the  risk  mapping  is  based  on  two pillars:\n\n- \u25cf Local  audits  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  policies defined in the Global Framework Agreements as well as in  section  2.2.1.  of  this  document. 89.6% of the Group's employees  are  covered  by  a  collective  agreement  at branch  and/or  company  level.  The  Internal  Audit Department  includes  knowledge  of  and  compliance with global framework agreements in its local audits of human  resources  practices.  In  the  event  of  any application difficulties arising, a memorandum concluded  in  January  2018  with  the  signatories  of  the\n\n2013  framework  agreement  constitutes  a  genuine action guide for dealing with them  under  joint responsibility.\n\n- \u25cf In  the  event of an alert, a formalized handling process (see  section  2.2.6.2). Any  alerts  are  the  subject  of  a specific  item  at  the  plenary  sessions  of  the  Renault Group Committee (RGC). In 2022, this meeting was held on September 30 with all members of the RGC. The RGC has 40 members, representing 26 countries, and is the preferred forum for open and responsible international social  dialogue.  In  2022,  as  in  2021,  the  Group  has  not received  any  feedback  from  the  parties  to  the  global framework agreements.\n\nI\n\n02",

By 2030, Renault Group aims to have 30% women in management positions.\n\nIn this context, Renault Group is implementing actions in several areas:\n\n- \u25cf Gender diversity: Renault Group is committed to implementing specific measures regarding the position of women in the company, which results in an evolution of its HR processes in terms of recruitment and career management and in the development of an international network of women;\n- \u25cf Disability: Renault Group facilitates the integration of the individuals with disabilities within the Group by implementing specific integration measures, installing adapted workstations, and actions for communication and raising awareness among employees. In 2022, the Group signed the ILO Disability Charter;\n- \u25cf Origin: Renault Group promotes cultural and social diversity within its teams in all the countries in which it operates;\n- \u25cf Age: Renault Group ensures balance between generations and supports its employees throughout their professional life. It draws on the experience, training and know-how of seniors while providing training and ensuring integration of young people in the workforce. In 2022, Renault Group, along with 30 other companies, signed a charter on the employability of people over 50 years old covering ten key commitments.\n\n## 2.2.2.4. A system to monitor measures taken and assess their effectiveness\n\nThe  Duty  of  Vigilance  Steering  Committee  monitors measures on a monthly basis. A summary is presented to the  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  once  a  year  (see section 2.2.6.2 Governance for details).\n\nThe effectiveness of measures is principally determined in light  of  the  number  of  incidents  reported  by  signatory parties to Global Framework Agreements resulting in the implementation of the measures provided for in the 2018 memorandum.  We  can  note  that  in  2022,  as  in  2021,  no incident was subject to measurement  within  the framework of the Renault Group memorandum (RGWC)\n\nThe  figures  below  also  reflect  the  effectiveness  of measures taken by the Group.\n\n7,659\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemployees trained in 2022 as part of ReKnow University\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.4 %\n\nPay gap between women and men\n\nImprovement of 0.7 point (at equivalent scope) between 2021 and 2022\n\nI",

Procedures for regular assessment of the situation of the Group and its subsidiaries based on the risk mapping\n\n## 2.2.3.2.1. Health, safety and ergonomics:\n\nEach site's situation is assessed based on four pillars:\n\n- \u25cf coaching  on  the  basis  of  the  Mandatory  Rules  and associated Key Requirements of the various HSEE areas (HSEE  in  projects, safety, burn  and  asphyxiation prevention, ergonomics, industrial hygiene, and environment);\n- \u25cf site self-assessments;\n- \u25cf audits by corporate or by teams composed of members of the HSEE network and members of corporate to align the levels of requirements;\n- \u25cf analyses  of  the  frequency  rates  of  occupational accidents and diseases.\n\nThese  regular  assessments  are  carried  out  during  field audits and are supplemented by detailed analyses of the results of accidents and occupational diseases.\n\nThey feed into the Group's HSEE strategy and allow it to be adapted if necessary.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.2. Security: risks of malicious acts\n\nA questionnaire to self-assess the security management system  is  circulated  every  year  to  all  Group  sites.  This assessment  is  part  of  internal  control  procedures.  The Group  began  automating  these  questionnaires  in  2022 with a view to optimizing analysis of results.\n\nIf an instance of non-compliance is observed, the Group's Prevention and Protection Department helps the relevant site create and implement a corrective action plan.\n\nI",

Policy and Management System\n\n## 2.2.3.3.2.1. Health, Safety and Ergonomics\n\nAs  part  of  Renault  Group's  commitment  to  health  and safety, a dedicated department was created in September  2016 , reporting  directly  to  the  Executive Committee.  The  commitment  of  the  HSEE  Department and Renault Group was reflected in the signing of a Health and Safety policy by the Group HR Director and CEO.\n\nOur  objective  is  'zero  accidents  and  occupational illnesses'  by  2030.  We  have  established  a  strategic roadmap  which  shows  how  we  will  progress  to  this ambitious objective.\n\nTo address risks, the company has established qualitative references namely Mandatory Rules and Key Requirements  which  cover  health,  safety,  ergonomics, burns and asphyxiation in projects and serial life.\n\nWe are in the planning stages of implementing ISO45001 with  25  HSEE  managers  already  trained  by  AFNOR  and 1  site  (Bursa  in  Turkey)  already  accredited  which  we  will use as a reference.\n\nThe  internal  control  department  have  implemented  a dedicated  procedure  to  check  the  effectiveness  of  the health, safety and ergonomics management system.\n\n## 2.2.3.3.2.2. Security\n\nRegarding  the  risks  of  malicious  acts,  the  Group's Prevention and Protection Department (D2P) has built the\n\n'SMS' (Security Management System): a set of rules and procedures  which  are  the  basis  of  the  mitigation  and prevention  measures.  These  documents  are  updated when and as the assessment of the various risks changes.\n\n## 2.2.3.3.3. Communication\n\nThe  HSEE  department  communicates  monthly  and  widely (to more  than  1,000  people  of  various  functions  and hierarchical levels) the statistical results and progress of all the  approaches  within  its  scope.  This  communication includes  information  from  the  HSEE  Department  (results, new standards, new technologies, projects, etc.), information from  regional  HSEE  coordinators,  and  site  publications  in order to share widely the good practices deployed.\n\nA  \"club  m\u00e9tier\"  is  organized  for  each  of  the  HSE  domain  and gathers monthly all the network members to exchange on new initiatives and track their progress, to share good practices \u2026\n\n## 2.2.3.3.4. Project Management\n\n## 2.2.3.3.4.1. Health, Safety and Ergonomics\n\nThe  HSEE  project  team  has  developed  its  5  Mandatory Rules  regarding  HSEE  in  projects  and  22  associated  Key Requirements (5MRs/22KRs), which have been integrated into  the  company's  quality  management  system.  The contributing  business  lines  have  been  identified,  and training has been carried out to ensure that actor implied in projects knows the 5MRs/22KRs.\n\nI\n\n02",

Security\n\nEach project is monitored by the Group's Prevention and Protection  Department  (D2P).  At  each  project  milestone, D2P  identifies  the  risks  and  determines  the  measures associated with them, along with adequate budgets.\n\n## 2.2.3.3.5. Training\n\n## 2.2.3.3.5.1. Health, Safety and Ergonomics\n\nEmployee  awareness  and  skills  are  among  the  main drivers of the overall HSEE strategy.\n\nTo raise awareness  of  health  and  safety  among employees  and  to  ensure  the  necessary  skills,  a  threetiered training program has been defined:\n\nTier  1  -  HSE  basics  with  training  such  as:  SWI  (Safety Workstation Induction) training, virtual reality hazard hunt, new  hire induction, general introduction to HSEE Mandatory Rules, safety dojo, and accident management.\n\nTier  2  -  established  qualifications  with  external  training courses conducted by recognized training organizations such as: NEBOSH  and  ISO  45001  AFNOR  (French standardization  committee)  on  management  systems, CMSE\u00ae  on  machine  safety  and  the  CNPP  for  the  Fire Safety - Fire Investigation Methodology.\n\nTier  3  -  specific  theme-based  and/or  technical  training covering  HSEE  specific  subjects  to  certain  employees may  be  exposed  based  on  their  activity  such  as  LOTO (Lock-Out  Tag-Out  -  identification  and  blocking  of energy),  electric  vehicles,  machine  safety,  chemical safety, using tackle equipment,  operating  handling equipment, and ergonomics.\n\nIn  addition  to  training  provided  at  corporate  level,  sites are  also  very  involved  in  training  processes  addressing their specific needs.\n\nVideo  simulations  deriving  from  specific  risks  identified through  some  accident  investigations  are  produced  to raise  awareness.  Since  2019,  21  such  simulations  have been  created  and  shared  at  various  levels  of  the company.  Once  the  appropriate  risk  control  measures have been identified, they are summarized and shared in a transversal memo,  and  the  deployment  of  the associated  action  plans  is  monitored  monthly.  To  date, 30  transversal  memos  have  been  or  are  being  deployed and progress is tracked on a regular basis.\n\n## 2.2.3.3.5.2. Security\n\nThe Group's Prevention and Protection (D2P) Department has a Safety School providing training to Prevention and Protection  (D2P)  employees  and  all  Renault  Group employees. Specific courses are available in use of video surveillance and in the European Agreement concerning the  International  Carriage  of  Dangerous  Goods  by  Road (notably the use of dangerous goods to commit malicious acts).\n\nAll malicious acts are analyzed by the site teams and D2P experts to provide feedback and, if necessary, training for\n\nemployees  working  in  security  or  human  resources, communication, general management, etc.\n\nAn e-learning course to raise awareness of malicious acts will be rolled out to all Group employees in 2023.\n\nD2P  also  leads  crisis drills to train management committees  in  methods  and  best  practices  to  manage this kind of situation.\n\n## 2.2.3.3.6. Further risk mitigating initiatives\n\n## 2.2.3.3.6.1. Health, Safety and Ergonomics\n\n## Psychosocial disorders\n\nRenault  Group  clearly  affirms  its  commitment  to  wellbeing and mental health in the Health and Safety at Work Policy signed in 2021.\n\nA  Mandatory  Rule  is  dedicated  to  mental  health.  It  was defined in partnership between the HSEE Department, the medical coordinators, and the HR function. Its deployment was  initiated  in  2022  at  industrial  and  commercial  sites. Some ten committees for the promotion of psychological health and well-being at work have been set up.  Committee  members  receive  dedicated  training  to gradually roll out the approach.\n\n## Chemical-induced accidents and illnesses\n\n- \u25cf The  industrial  hygiene  team  works  on  a  daily  basis  to control worker exposure to hazardous substances and chemical compliance covering CLP/GHS/REACH regulations  and  to  reduce  the  number  of  the  most hazardous chemical substances used at Renault Group sites, including products containing carcinogenic, mutagenic,  and  reprotoxic  substances  and  endocrine disruptors.  Since  2010,  we  have  eliminated  or  avoided the use of approximately 758 chemicals, including 272 in 2022, in particular many paints containing cumene. This reduction  made  it  possible  to  achieve  the  Group's objective of -20% between 2016 and 2022. Following on from  the  measures  to  replace  the  most  hazardous substances, we have now committed to reducing their number by 50% by 2030.\n- \u25cf In  view  of  the  results  of  the  self-assessments  on  the 8 Mandatory Rules / 60 associated Key Requirements in Industrial  Hygiene  of  2021  and  the  seriousness  of  the potential  consequences  for  health,  a  priority  action program was established and rolled out incrementally throughout  2022  with  a  monthly  follow-up  on  their progress and verification of their implementation by the DHSEE,  Particular  emphasis  was  placed  on  the  posts where  the  most  toxic  substances  are  handled  or emitted with the provision of a training kit to  raise  the awareness  of  operators  at  these  workstations  both about  the  risks  and  about  the  importance  of  all  the protective measures implemented.\n- \u25cf The  first  internal  audits  on  these  8  Mandatory  Rules were conducted in 2022.\n- \u25cf Training in the regulations on the transport of dangerous  goods  was  also  provided,  with  almost 120  people  trained,  mainly  to  support  Li-ion  battery projects.",

This system, which was certified by AFNOR (French standardization committee) in January 2021, has prevented the formation  of  large  clusters  since  the  beginning  of  the  crisis.  It  is  based  on  rules  and  instructions  (70  HSE  operating standards) dealing with topics such as the correct way of wearing a mask, disinfecting shared equipment, aerating rooms, dealing with people presenting symptoms, the psychosocial aspects of Covid, etc. These rules and instructions are circulated to all sites through regular committee meetings. While the current trend is to ease health measures, the HSEE Department continues to define the pace of relaxing these measures on a weekly basis, country by country, based on the health situation and local regulatory developments.\n\n## Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD): Ergonomics\n\nDuring  2022,  the  Ergonomics  Department  supported  19 new vehicle projects with a focus on inherent ergonomics design.  In  parallel,  the  new  ergonomic  management system,  which  consists  of  three  pillars  (Ergonomics memorandum,  Ergonomics  evaluation method and Ergonomics  Mandatory  Rules),  has  been  defined  and deployed for all industrials sites and engineering.\n\n## 1. Ergonomics memorandum\n\nThe  Ergonomic  memorandum  is  a  reference  guide  that encompasses standard ergonomic principles, adapted to all  fields  of  activity.  Six  specific  ergonomics  memoranda have  been  finalized  and  deployed:  bodyshop,  assembly shop, paintshop, stamping, logistics, metal bodywork, and sales & aftersales.\n\n## 2. Ergonomics evaluation method (M2E)\n\nThe  new  workstation  ergonomics  assessment  is  now deployed  in  all  industrial  sites.  The  aim  is  to  perform  indepth risk assessments, in order to define action plans to reduce musculoskeletal disorders and thus the number of days  lost.  Since  2021,  a  training  plan  for  the  network  of human  factors  experts  has  been  deployed.  A  selfassessment of industrial sites is underway: All supervisors were  trained  by  ergonomics  experts  in  the  factory,  and 21,983 workstations were evaluated.\n\n## 3. Ergonomics Mandatory Rules\n\nThe  key  criteria  and  experience  gathered  from  all previous works have been consolidated into six Mandatory Rules.  Each  industrial  site  conducted  its  selfassessment  over  the  first  half  of  2022.  Formal  audits began  in  the  second  half  of  the  year  with  2  audits  in France.\n\nAll  these  specifications are used upstream in projects to avoid  the  introduction  of  new  ergonomic  strains  whilst simultaneously  applied  in  production  runs  to  enhance working conditions.\n\n## Risks related to logistics and internal traffic activities\n\n- \u25cf In 2022, the HSEE department, in collaboration with the site  and  central  logistics  departments,  continued  to improve the tools and standards developed previously, including  a  memorandum  on  traffic  (compilation  of applicable rules), a risk assessment method 'Safe Site,\n\nSafe  Vehicle,  Safe  Driver'  (SSSVSD),  a  pallet  truck memorandum  and  a  Safety  Compliance  Check  on vehicle resources.\n\n- \u25cf The sites conducted out a 'Safe Site, Safe Vehicle, and Safe Driver' (SSSVSD) self-assessment allowing them to evaluate  their  level  of  compliance  with  the  rules  and prioritize their prevention actions.\n- \u25cf Renault is continuing its collaboration with the Association  of  European  Vehicle  Logistics  (ECG)  to reduce  the  number  of  accidents  when  delivering  cars. Renault  plays  an  active  role  in  working  groups, specifically on accident analysis, safe loading/ unloading processes, and delivery site safety.\n\n## Accidents with machinery\n\n- \u25cf Tools and procedures have been developed to identify and  mitigate  machine-related  risks.  These  include,  to name a few, essential safety requirements for suppliers, inspection reports, and the safety compliance check for the  approval  of  new  facilities.  Tools  such  as  the 'machine interaction' application help to move towards safe conditions for interaction with machines.\n- \u25cf The production run machine safety inspection process, launched  in  2021,  has  resulted  in  4,403  addition inspections in 2022.\n- \u25cf The  monthly  workshop  managers'  meeting  initiated  in 2020  continues  and  brings  together  site  health  and safety  managers  and  machine  maintenance  experts. Various  more  or  less  technical  machine  safety  topics are covered.\n- \u25cf 6  sites  were  prioritized  in  2022  for  inspections  and coaching by corporate machine safety specialists.\n\n## Burns and asphyxiation\n\n- \u25cf The HSEE  Department  and  the  Prevention  and Protection Department have introduced a new procedure  to  ensure  the  safety  of  work  involving  hot spots  (fire  permits),  such  as  welding  or  cutting  with  a blowtorch.  This  'fire  permit'  is  established  in  order  to prevent the risk of fire and explosion caused by hot spot work.  Feedback  on  this  new  procedure  has  been positive  and  the  number  of  fires  caused  by  hot-spot work  has  decreased  since  then.  The  fire  tracking procedure  deployed  in  mid-2020  ensures  this  new  fire permit is effective.\n\nI",

The sites have started their  self-assessments.  These  enable  them  to  assess their level of compliance with the rules and to prioritize the preventive actions to be implemented.\n\n## Risk associated with electrical vehicles\n\n- \u25cf The  HSEE  dimension  has  been  strengthened  in  new electric  and  hybrid  vehicle  projects  from  the  product and process design stage in order to make the work of factory operators and after-sales technicians safer.\n- \u25cf Safety  is  integrated  upstream  in  the  design  of  the product  by  standard  solutions  like  safe  design  of  high voltage batteries, by electrical lockout/tagout procedure for safe assembly and maintenance on each vehicle. All the players involved in these projects have been trained. The safety training program is updated periodically with the  support  of  certified  organizations  (e.g.  APAVE  or Bureau  Veritas).  The  theoretical  part  of  the  training program  was  supplemented  by  several  practical exercises.  It  incorporates  more  practice  with  a  specific Dojo (safety school) focused on hazard characterization and the implementation of safety rules.\n- \u25cf The  new  training  program  is  already  implemented  at several  major  sites  (Douai,  Maubeuge,  Cl\u00e9on,  Pitesti, Valladolid,  and  Palencia).  Deployment  has  continued through  our  Manufacturing  Academy  and  Renault Academy. In Manufacturing, more than 3,000 employees  have  been  trained  since  2020, including 1400 in 2022.\n- \u25cf In  the  scope  of  transportation  and  concerning  the  EV battery,  guidelines  and  training  sessions  on  regulatory requirements  for  suitable  packaging,  test  of  battery before transportation, were  implemented  by  the internal Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor.\n\n## Management of safety of external companies and concurrent activities\n\nThe deployment of a dedicated contractor management tool (CMT)  allows  us  to  manage  contractors  and contractors'  activities  working  at  our  sites.  Six  key elements are integrated in the procedure:\n\n- 1. Support Renault Business Managers in drafting Prevention Plans;\n- 2. Define a pre-selection process for subcontractors from an HSE perspective;\n- 3. Ensure  that  the  subcontractors  involved  are  trained and competent before they arrive on site and that all the  necessary  authorizations  are  available  and  up  to date (administrative, technical, etc.);\n- 4. Assess risks prior to any activity and establish control measures to eliminate or minimize risks;\n- 5. Monitor  and  supervise  the  work,  report  HSE  problems that  need  to  be  corrected,  and  evaluate  the  HSE performance  of  subcontractors  to  be  included  in  the pre-selection process (refers to point 3.);\n- 6. Have a constantly updated map of all work for a better view of concurrent activities.\n\nAll HSE managers of French sites and their teams (except RRG)  have  been  trained  to  use  the  platform.  They  have started to train their business managers.\n\n## 2.2.3.3.6.2. Security\n\n## Malicious acts on site\n\nThe  rules  on  access  control  were  updated  in  early  2022. The status of persons with the right to access our facilities was reviewed. Regarding cyber risks, the Security Master Plan  was  updated  and  presented  to  the  Audit  and  Risk Committee (CAR) in 2021.\n\n## Digital malicious acts or threats\n\n- \u25cf Training  courses  in  information  protection  and  cyber risks are  provided  on  several  platforms  including e-learning  (a  new  e-learning  course  was  introduced  in 2021),  French  Home  Office  information  sessions,  and targeted training courses.\n- \u25cf In order to raise awareness of personal data protection among all the Group's employees, an e-learning course was rolled out in 11 languages in 2020 required for all new employees.\n\n## 2.2.3.4. System for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness\n\nThe  Duty  of  Vigilance  Steering  Committee  monitors measures on a monthly basis. A summary is presented to the  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  once  a  year (see section 2.2.6.2 Governance for details).\n\n## 2.2.3.4.1. Health, Safety and Ergonomics\n\n## HSEE is building its digital expertise\n\nThe DHSEE is going digital with a variety of applications managing,  for  example,  the  reporting  of  occupational accidents and illnesses, alerts and analysis of root causes, the management of chemical products, the evaluation of movements  and  postures,  the  management  of  external companies,  as  well as regulatory monitoring and compliance. Eventually, these tools will cover all aspects of HSEE. Digitalization helps to measure the effectiveness of the measures implemented.",

These  statistical  analyses  are  all  the  more important  as  audit  activity  has  been  reduced  in  recent years due to Covid and the subsequent component crisis. Nevertheless,  a  total  of  26  10MR/74KR  audits  (including 11  factory  audits)  were  conducted  in  2022,  bringing  the total number of audits conducted since 2017 to 353.\n\nAfter a significant reduction of the FR1 5 , the Group decided to change the main indicator of accidents at work to FR2 5 (lost-time  accidents)  in  2021.  The  objective  is  to  rapidly reduce the FR2, while maintaining a stable FR1, thanks to all the HSE measures initiated.\n\nThe  Group  also  promotes  the  reporting  of  low-severity (first aid) accidents  and  continues  to  improve  the reporting process, even in countries where reporting is not mandatory.  No  targets  are  set  to  encourage  their reporting. They do not appear in the graph below.\n\nThe  combination  of  preventive  and  corrective  actions described  above  has  resulted  in  a  reduction  of  the  FR2 from a high of 3.7 in 2018 to 1.70 in 2022. It should be noted that  the  Group's  performance  in  2022  was  maintained despite  the  exit  of  the  Russian  sites,  which  significantly affected  the  FR1  and  FR2  statistical  results.  Their  results were significantly weaker than the Group's results.\n\nAt the same time, the percentage of compliance with the 10  Mandatory  Rules  on  safety/74  Key  Requirements  of factories (biggest contributors to accidents and occupational  diseases)  increased  from  57.4%  in  2018  to 65.2  at  end-2022.  These  developments  demonstrate  the effectiveness of the strategy implemented.\n\n## Occupational accidents: Trends 5 EFPD3b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Changes in the frequency and severity of accidents at work (\u221a)\n\n(\u221a) Indicators audited by the independent third party at a reasonable level of assurance for the 2022 financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evolution of the number of work accidents per year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe trend is therefore encouraging and is moving towards the Group's goal of zero lost-time accidents by 2030, with an intermediate step of 1.0 expected in 2025.\n\nIt should also be noted that there have been no deaths of Renault employees or temporary workers since 2018 in the current Renault Group scope.\n\nI",

It  is  not  always  easy  to obtain  information  on  these  accidents,  as  the  injured  do not always visit the infirmary of the sites, especially when the  injuries  are  not  serious.  This  is  why  the  DHSEE  has defined a threshold of injury severity above which external companies must report accidents to Renault. The number of such accidents has steadily decreased since 2017, with 16  accidents  above this threshold for staff from external companies, compared with 3 in 2022.\n\n## Occupational illnesses: Trends (\u221a) EFPD3a\n\n(\u221a) Indicators audited by the independent third party at a reasonable level of assurance for the 2022 financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  graph  above  shows  the  data  on  occupational illnesses  reported  for  Renault  employees  only.  After investigation  by  the  authorities,  some  of  these  illnesses are not attributed to Renault, but they are not subtracted from the reported data.\n\nThe  steady  downward  trend  in  the  occupational  disease rate  was  interrupted  in  2020.  The  process  of  reporting occupational diseases in Romania, simplified at the end of 2019  and  therefore  in  place  throughout  2020,  explains  the trend reversal. Romania also impacted the Group's results in  2022,  as  COVID-related  hospital  access  restrictions  in 2021 led employees to delay reporting in 2022.\n\nFurthermore,  the  removal  of  the  Russian  sites  from  the Renault  Group  scope  also  negatively  affected  the indicator  because  these  sites  had  few  occupational illnesses but represented many hours.\n\nAbout 80% of occupational illnesses are musculoskeletal disorders, and 20% are related to historical exposures. In order to meet the Group's ambition of Zero Occupational Illnesses,  a  selection  of  Key  Requirements  among  the Mandatory  Rules  in  ergonomics  and  health  have  been prioritized and are subject to reinforced monitoring. These\n\nessential key requirements focus on preventive actions to reduce  employee  exposure  and  thus  ultimately  the number  of  occupational  diseases.  These  requirements include  detailed  and  systematic  risk  assessments  of workplaces, implementation of risk control measures and employee  training.  An  ambitious  target  for  compliance with these requirements has been set for each site.\n\n(\u221a) Indicators audited by the independent third party at a reasonable level of assurance for the 2022 financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  DHSEE  includes  in  this  category  of  events  any  losttime  accident  occurring  on  the  public  highway,  for example, between the workplace and home, between the workplace and a supplier's site,  or  between  home  and  a supplier's site.\n\nTraffic  accidents  occurring  within  the  geographical coverage  of  Renault  sites  are  monitored  as  part  of  the workplace accident frequency rate.\n\nIn  countries  where  information  on  traffic  accidents  is passed on to the employer, Renault Group uses such data to  draw  up  action  plans,  awareness-raising  initiatives, training, etc.\n\nThese actions include awareness-raising, specific communications,  and  employee  training  to  reduce  the number and severity of commuting accidents, regardless of  the  means  of  transport  used  (car,  motorized  twowheelers, bicycle, scooter, pedestrian).\n\n326  traffic  accidents  were  reported  in  Renault  Group  in 2022, 167 of which resulted in lost time.

Risk mapping: identification, analysis and prioritization\n\nThe main environmental risks that may impact ecosystems or human health and that may result from Renault Group's operating sites are shown the graphic below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Soil  and  groundwater  pollution: the  use  of  chemical products  in  processes  entails  the  risk  of  accidental spillage if the products  are  not  handled  properly. Furthermore,  at  the  oldest  sites,  which  were  built  before environmental regulations and best practices appeared, legacy pollution resulting exclusively from past operations is currently being treated. 1\n- Air pollution: bodywork painting in particular releases of  Volatile  Organic  Compounds  (VOC)  that  may  impact health if not controlled. 2\n- Greenhouse  gas  emissions: these  are  principally associated  with  energy  consumption  at  sites  and encompass  direct  emissions  from  internal  facilities  that consume gas and indirect emissions from the production of the electricity used. These air emissions have an impact on climate change. 3\n- Waste, and in particular hazardous waste, can have an impact if storage and transportation are inadequate and if it is not recycled and processed in specialist facilities. 4\n- Use  of  water  resources: in 2022,  Renault  Group consumed  4.7  m 3 of  water  per  vehicle  produced.  The impacts of water abstraction can be very different from one site to another: in some areas enduring water stress, 5\n\nthe  impact  can  be  very  significant  and  possibly  cause conflicts between users. Pressure on water resources will moreover increase, notably due to climate change.\n\n- Wastewater in natural environments: the water used in production  processes  and  sanitation  facilities  is  treated internally and externally before it is released into natural environments. It may impact the receiving environment in the event of a failure in the water treatment system. 6\n- Legionella: some industrial  processes,  in  particular  in cooling  towers,  may,  if  operating  conditions  are  not controlled properly, encourage  the  proliferation of Legionella  bacteria,  which  may  then  be  dispersed  in  the environment  via  the  released  water  particles  and potentially  impact  the  health  of  the  more  vulnerable people living in the surrounding area. 7\n- Noise: this  may  be  generated  by  logistics  and  site processes,  with  a  potential  impact  on  the  health  of  the surrounding population if they are excessively exposed. 8\n- Biodiversity: the Group's  activities may  impact biodiversity  in  the  areas  around  them,  for  the  reasons listed  above,  or  impact  it  directly  (new  construction  that involves sealing soil). 9",

This  tool  uses  a  qualitative approach (context,  risk  potential,  level  of  control  over  it) and  a  quantitative  approach  (noise,  natural  resources, waste,  emissions,  wastewater,  chemical  risks)  to  assess and  organize  into  a  hierarchy  the  risks  and  possible impacts  arising  from  the  site's  activities  with  a  view  to taking remedial measures.\n\nSince  2021,  a  new  in-house  tool  for  mapping  major  risks has  reinforced  this  approach  at  all  of  the  Group's  sites (industrial,  logistics,  engineering  and  dealerships):  the Mandatory Rules (MR) and the associated Key Requirements.\n\nThis  is  a  reference  system  containing  all  the  identified critical  risks  and  providing  a  key  to  score  each  site  in relation  to  these  risks,  in  a  prioritized  and  systematic manner.  This  in-house  reference  system  developed  in 2020  draws  on  more  than  20  years  of  feedback  from experience  from  experts  at  the  Corporate  Environment Department. It covers the main families of risks discussed above and the 50 key risks, providing a precise description of  the  various  levels  of  criticality  associated  with  each risk, which  serve  as  a  basis  for  each  site's  selfassessment.\n\nThe  resulting  mapping  undergoes  a  shared  approval process  and  conclusions  are  shared  among  Corporate and site management.\n\nI\n\n02",

Actions to mitigate risks and prevent serious infringements EFPD7b\n\nAt  large  sites  potentially  involving  more  significant environmental  impacts,  the  action plan is a key component  of  the  Environmental  Management  System and  an  organization  endowed  with  specific  resources  is tasked with running and updating the system on a regular basis. Once the impacts and risks are known, these sites roll  out an action plan aimed at preventing and reducing the identified potential harm to the environment.\n\nThis  approach  was  reinforced  in  2021  for  all  sites  by  the mapping of  major  risks  developed  through  the  rating  of\n\nenvironmental fundamentals or 'Mandatory Rules,' which makes  it  possible  to  classify  each  site  according  to  its level  of  deployment  of  these  fundamentals  and  good practices in terms of environmental protection (A, B, C, D, or  E  and  overall  %  per  site).  For  each  of  the  50  identified risks,  the  system  provides  a  detailed  presentation  of  the actions required to reduce  criticality and  achieve adequate or optimum status. When building action plans, the priority is to address any critical situations with a view to  mitigating  the  most  significant  risks  and  preventing serious infringements.\n\n2",

System for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness\n\nThe  Duty  of  Vigilance  Steering  Committee  monitors measures on a monthly basis. A summary is presented to the  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  once  a  year  (see section 2.2.6.2 Governance for details).\n\nSeveral systems are in place to monitor measures taken and ensure they are effective. They are summarized in the table below.\n\nEach site regularly assesses the progress it has made in deploying  the  '8  Mandatory  Rules'  on  the  environment.\n\nThe resulting score changes in sync with the progress that the  site  makes  in  implementing  these  environmental fundamentals  and  best  practices.  The  sites'  scores  are verified  in  the  course  of  internal  audits,  updated  and published  several  times  a  year  at  every  level  in  the company.  Suitable  implementation  of  the  action  plans specifically  targeting  each  of  the  risks  listed  in  section 2.2.4.3 is also assessed through this process.\n\nI",

Each  site  reports  its  environmental  data (quantities  of  waste,  wastewater  and  air  emissions, consumption  of  water  and  energy)  in  a  shared  system. These  statistics  are  consolidated  at  Group  level  and verified once a year by an independent organization. The results are monitored by the company's top management at Leadership Team (formerly BoM) meetings.\n\nLastly, the sites that have the most significant environmental impacts apply a tighter control mechanism  based  on  their  certified  environmental management system. This adds two layers of control, with internal and external audits:\n\nAudit reports\n\nResults monitored by the Board of Management and published regularly\n\nRegular internal publication of site positioning (ABCDE and global)\n\n- \u2714 Internal  audits  in  an  environmental  management system cover the requirements of ISO 14001 on various topics  (soil, water,  air, waste,  energy,  chemicals, legionella,  noise  and  risk  prevention)  in  order  to ascertain that the system is effectively dealing with the possible impacts  resulting  from  activities. These internal audits are carried out by teams of two to four Renault auditors from other sites. When it receives the audit report, the audited site maps out its action plan to address each point of non-compliance. The execution and effectiveness of the action plan are verified during the next annual audit.\n- \u2714 The last level is an external annual audit carried out by an  independent  accredited  body  with  a  view  to obtaining ISO 14001 certification.\n\n## 2.2.5 Suppliers and subcontractors EFPD15a EFPD15b\n\n## 2.2.5.1. Risk mapping: identification, analysis and prioritization\n\n## Methodology\n\nRenault Group considers that the risks presented above in sections 2.2.2 to 2.2.4 of the Vigilance Plan are applicable to  our  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  These  risks  are therefore addressed 7 as part of the responsible purchasing approach.\n\n- -Human rights and fundamental freedoms: 10 risks\n- -Health and safety: 10 risks\n- -Environment: 9 risks\n\nTo  prioritize  them,  Renault  Group  relies  on  an  external database,  the  experience  of  in-house  specialists,  and analysis of audit reports over the years. As the nature of the  most  critical  risks  hinges  heavily  on  the  geographic area, the Group maps risks by country.\n\n## Illustration of a country-risk mapping\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  addition  to  the  three categories  in  the  Vigilance  Plan  (i.e.  risks  of  impacts  on human  rights,  human  health  and  safety,  and  the environment),  this  mapping  includes  criteria  relating  to governance.\n\nThis  analysis,  which  is  being  continuously  improved,  has made  it  possible  to  classify  supplier  and  subcontractor sites  based  on  four  levels  of  criticality:  'low',  'medium', 'high' and 'very high'.\n\n## 2.2.5.2. Procedures for regular assessment of the suppliers' and subcontractors' situation with which the Group has an established business relationship, in light of the risk mapping\n\nThe assessment of suppliers' situation in light of the risk mapping is based on two pillars:\n\n- -assessments  via  an  Internet  platform  (principally EcoVadis)  to  assess  suppliers'  and  subcontractors' policies  and  actions  relating  to  environmental,  social and corporate governance;\n- -on-site  audits  of  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  From 2018 to 2022, the Group commissioned 122 social, safety, health, environmental and ethics audits of supplier sites, performed  by  outside  companies  in  six  countries: Algeria, China, India, Romania, Russia and Turkey.\n\n## 2.2.5.3. Actions to mitigate risks and prevent serious infringements\n\nIn  order to prevent serious infringements, under the duty of vigilance, Renault Group:\n\n- \u25cf applies  its  responsible  purchasing  policy,  a  set  of requirements with respect to its suppliers and subcontractors (a);\n- \u25cf regards the commitment to comply with its responsible purchasing policy as a decisive criterion when choosing suppliers and subcontractors (b);\n- \u25cf monitors  implementation  of  corrective  action  plans prepared following supplier site audits (c);\n- \u25cf relies on a dedicated team, reporting to the Purchasing Department (d).\n\nThis  action  plan  includes  constant  progress  updates, which will be reported on at a later date.\n\n## a. A  responsible  purchasing  policy,  the  cornerstone  of the supplier relationship\n\nThe  risks  identified  in  the  mapping  are  addressed  in  a requirement with respect to our suppliers and subcontractors (see table next page). Renault Group relies on  documents  that  set  out  principles  of  responsible contractual relationships with suppliers:\n\n- \u25cf Renault-Nissan Corporate Social Responsibility Guidelines for Suppliers (2015). Distributed to all Renault Group  suppliers  and  subcontractors,  this  document summarizes the Group's ESG expectations of suppliers and  subcontractors  in  matters  of  safety  and  quality, human and labor rights, environment, compliance and non-disclosure  of  information;  The  Group  asks  its suppliers  and  subcontractors  to  commit  in  writing  to comply with these guidelines. They are also requested to use them with their own suppliers;\n- \u25cf Global  Framework  Agreement  on  social,  societal  and environmental  responsibility,  signed  in  2013,  with  the\n\nIndustriALL Global Union and the Group Works Council. In this document,  Renault  Group  undertakes  to communicate the Framework Agreement to its suppliers and subcontractors. It asks them to commit to implementing  the  employees'  fundamental  rights mentioned in chapter 1 of the Framework Agreement in their  own  companies  and  encourages  them  to  do likewise with their own suppliers. If necessary, corrective action plans are put in place with the support of Renault Group;\n\n- \u25cf Renault Group Green Purchasing Guidelines (2018): this document  is  distributed  to  all  Group  suppliers  and describes  requirements  in  matters  of  environmental management, policies on chemicals and recycling;\n- \u25cf Renault  Group  policy  on  the  supply  of  cobalt  and minerals  from  conflict-affected  and  high-risk  areas (2019). This policy provides suppliers and their subcontractors  with  details  of  products  that  may contain such minerals, and the Group's expectations as regards  human  rights  and  child  labor  in  the  supply chain;\n- \u25cf Renault  Group  commitments  regarding  sourcing  of sustainable natural rubber (2022).\n\nThe  purchasing  function  also  has  a  dedicated  code  of practice  that  complements  the  Code  of  Ethics.  This document  is  available  on  the  Group's  intranet  site.  It  is aimed at all managers and employees in the Purchasing Department  and  the  Alliance  Purchasing  Organization (APO) and at anyone who is in contact with suppliers and/ or  who  has  an  influence  on  purchasing  activities  within Renault Group and/or for Renault Group. The code applies to all Renault  Group  purchasing  processes  and,  in particular,  to  compliance  with  Renault's  strategy,  to selecting  suppliers,  reviewing  performance  and,  more generally speaking, to any contact or communication with suppliers.\n\nI",

This  could  be  addressed  in  future action plans, monitored by the Duty of Vigilance Steering Committee, which was recently created (see section 2.2.6.2).\n\n## b. A  decisive  criterion  when  choosing  suppliers  and subcontractors\n\nRenault  Group  has  committed,  through  its  2013  Global Framework  Agreement,  to  ensuring  that  respect  for fundamental rights is a decisive criterion in the selection of suppliers and subcontractors. This applies to inclusion in  the  Group  of  eligible  suppliers  and  subcontractors but also to award of new contracts.\n\n## c. Monitoring of corrective action plans following audits at supplier and subcontractor sites\n\nIdentified  non-compliance  is  addressed  in  corrective action plans, which are put in place with the support of the Group. The Responsible Purchasing Department monitors implementation of these plans with the suppliers with the\n\nlowest  scores,  with  mandatory  re-auditing  for  these suppliers. Once identified, any uncorrected failure leads to various  measures,  including  Renault  Group  terminating relations with the company concerned.\n\n## d. An ESG-focused purchasing team\n\nFor  over  10  years,  Renault  Group  has  had  a  dedicated team to prevent serious infringements under the duty of vigilance  law.  The  team  reports  to  the  Purchasing Department and has the following objectives:\n\n- \u25cf Ensuring  that  suppliers  meet  standards  and  comply with laws, regulations  and  soft  laws  relating  to employment, health, safety, the environment and ethics (e.g.  the  French  law  on  the  duty  of  vigilance,  Sapin  II, traceability of conflict minerals or cobalt, OECD/UN/ILO Guidelines, etc.);\n- \u25cf Improving the identification and reduction of ESG risks in the supply chain;\n- \u25cf Strengthening the ESG assessment of suppliers (through an external provider and its online platform);\n- \u25cf Managing  external  ESG  supplier  audits,  based  on requirements set by the Group;",

System for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness\n\nThe  Duty  of  Vigilance  Steering  Committee  monitors measures on a monthly basis. A summary is presented to the  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  once  a  year  (see section 2.2.6.2 Governance for details).\n\nAs  discussed  in  section  2.2.5.2  of  this  document,  Renault Group uses audits and assessments to track its suppliers' and subcontractors' ESG  performance.  The  Group measures  its  suppliers'  compliance  with  its  ESG  criteria through four main topics:\n\n- \u25cf percentage  of  direct  purchase  volume  of  automotive parts covered by a ESG assessment;\n- \u25cf percentage  of  total  purchase  volume  of  automotive parts  covered  by  a  high  or  very  high  grade  ESG assessment;\n- \u25cf number of parts suppliers subject to a ESG assessment;\n- \u25cf number of parts suppliers whose ESG score reflects high or very high performance.\n\nIn 2022, the ESG performance (Group level) of the Top 200 and the Top 500 parts suppliers (representing approximately  87%  and  97%  respectively  of  total  parts purchases) of Renault Group was as follows:\n\n| Parts (Top 200)                                                                                 | Total 2021  (TOP200)   | Total 2022  (TOP200)   | Total 2022  (TOP500)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Percentage of direct purchase volume covered by a CSR assessment. 1                             | 98%                    | 98%                    | 97%                    |\n| Percentage of high or very high CSR performance in 3 years  (% of total purchases). 2           | 92%                    | 94%                    | 91%                    |\n| Number of direct supplier groups covered by a CSR assessment.                                   | 190/200                | 193/200                | 431/500                |\n| Number of CSR supplier groups high or very high less than 3 years  (number of supplier groups). | 167/200                | 175/200                | 353/500                |\n\nBelow is the average performance in 202 2 of the 192/429 suppliers of the Renault Group Top 200/ 500 parts:\n\n- - 'Environment':\n- \u25cf Top 200: 63.2/100 (61.8 in 2021);\n- \u25cf Top 500: 59.7/100\n- - 'Social & Human Rights:\n- \u25cf Top 200: 55.9/100 (55.0/100 in 2021);\n- \u25cf Top 500:  54.4/100\n- - 'Ethics':\n- \u25cf Top 200: 52.7/100 (51.0/100 in 2021);\n- \u25cf Top 500: 50.6/100\n- - 'Responsible purchasing' (from our suppliers):\n- \u25cf Top 200: 50.3/100 (48.7/100 in 2021);\n- \u25cf Top 500: 47.1/100\n- - Overall average of\n- \u25cf Top 200: 56.7/100 (51.6/100 in 2021);\n- \u25cf Top 500: 54.3/100 .\n\nI",

Whistleblowing tool\n\nThe  Vigilance  Plan  includes  a  whistleblowing  tool  and system  to  collect  reports  relating  to  risks  or  events involving serious infringements of human rights, fundamental freedoms, health, safety and the environment.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  2016  French 'Sapin  II' Law  on  transparency,  the  fight  against corruption  and  the  modernization  of  economic  life, Renault Group very early on set up a whistleblowing tool, WhistleB,  which  is  accessible  to  Group  employees, external  or  occasional  employees  and  suppliers  with which the Group has an established business relationship. Note that the law of March 21, 2022, on the protection of whistleblowers 8 , in  addition  to  confirming  the  parties mentioned  above,  added  shareholders,  job  applicants and former employees.\n\nWhistleB covers the topics required by the 2017 French law on the duty of vigilance.\n\nThis  platform  is  managed  by  an  external  service  provider and can be accessed at any time, any day of the week, on a professional  or  personal  computer,  tablet  or  smartphone, via the Internet at https://Renault.whistleb.com. A telephone hotline for direct reporting is also available. The global whistleblowing system is available in 14 languages. It ensures  confidentiality  of  communication  and  therefore allows the whistleblower to remain anonymous subject to local  law.  Renault  Group  prohibits  and  does  not  practice any form of retaliation against whistleblowers.\n\nDuring  2022,  new  awareness-raising  initiatives  were carried  out,  notably  on  the  Group's  intranet,  to  remind\n\n## 2.2.6.2. Vigilance plan governance\n\nRenault Group set up specific governance arrangements for the Vigilance Plan in 2021. This new governance better defines  the  various  levels  in  the  company  that  are involved in preparing, approving and effectively implementing the Vigilance Plan:\n\npeople  how  the  system  works  internally.  In  France,  for example: communications on the Group's intranet and at the industrial sites. Renault Group has also reminded all its suppliers and subcontractors of the possibilities available on WhistleB and circulated a detailed user guide. Renault Group has committed to providing this type of  reminder every two years.\n\nIn 2022, 460 reports were received via the whistleblowing tool  worldwide 9 . All  reports  are  examined.  Most  of  the cases are dealt with locally, by the country or subsidiary Ethics  and  Compliance  Correspondent.  Reports  relating to France and Corporate departments are handled by the Whistleblowing  Department  and  the  Whistleblowing Committee  (CTA),  which  is  made  up  of  seven  members and three experts and is chaired by Renault Group's SVP, Audit,  Risk,  Ethics  and  Compliance.  In  other  countries, alerts are handled by the Country Ethics and Compliance Committee  (CECP),  chaired  by  the  Country  Director. detailed  report  containing  statistics  on  whistleblowing worldwide is presented annually to the Group Ethics and Compliance  Committee  (CECG)  and  the  Audit  and  Risk Committee  (CAR),  a  specialist  committee  of  Renault Group's Board of Directors.\n\nIn  2022,  we  worked  on  upgrading  the  mechanism  to integrate the requirements in the new EU Whistleblowing Directive 10 .\n\nThe  corporate  whistleblowing  tool  presented  here  is intended  to  complement  other  channels  to  report whistleblowing alerts, namely trade unions, management lines, human resources teams, the Ethics and Compliance Department.\n\n- \u25cf the  action  plan  is  coordinated  and  monitored  by  the Sustainable  Development  Department  via  a  Steering Committee;\n- \u25cf the Strategy Director, who reports directly to the CEO, is the sponsor of the Vigilance Plan.\n\n- 9 These reports go beyond the scope of the French duty of vigilance law. The deployment of this whistleblowing system also allows Renault Group to comply with the French law of 2016, known as 'Sapin 2,' on transparency, the fight against corruption and the modernisation of economic life.",

Renault Group environmental policy EFPD7\n\nThere is now a consensus on the magnitude of environmental challenges  and  the  urgency  of  finding  solutions.  These challenges  profoundly  affect  all  economic  activities  and notably mobility. Beyond the expectations of the stakeholders regarding the transport sector, the ability of Renault Group to propose  innovative  solutions  also  provides  new  economic opportunities and boosts competitiveness.\n\nThe automotive  industry needs  to address major environmental issues:\n\n- \u25cf climate change related to greenhouse gas emissions, for which  the  Paris  COP  21  agreement  has  plotted  an ambitious reduction path;\n- \u25cf resources,  the  limited  availability  of  which  implies changing modes of production and use;\n- \u25cf health,  a  major  concern  (particularly  in  cities),  which requires reduction of pollutant emissions;\n- \u25cf global  biodiversity  loss  caused  by  human-induced pressures on ecosystems.\n\nTo  meet  these  challenges,  Renault  Group  has  had  an environmental  policy  since  the  late  1990s.  It  applies throughout the vehicle lifecycle, from design to end of life, and is fully in line with the company's strategic plan (see figure below).\n\n## RENAULT GROUP ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY\n\n## COMMITMENTS\n\n## CREATING VALUE\n\nContribute to the creation of new sources of income and profit through innovative mobility solutions and circular economy activities, contribute to the competitiveness and protection of tangible and intangible assets.\n\n## PREVENTING AND REDUCING\n\nPrevent and continuously reduce the environmental footprint of activities, services and products throughout their lifecycle.\n\nClimate change and energy efficiency\n\nBiodiversity and ecosystems\n\n## STEERING\n\nImplement environmental management across the Group and throughout the value chain in order to ensure continuous improvement and compliance with regulations and voluntary commitments.\n\n## ENGAGING AND COMMUNICATING\n\nEnsure transparent and responsible communication and stakeholder dialogue.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As vehicle use is responsible for more than 80% of the Group's carbon footprint, this phase of the product lifecycle is the priority of the climate plan.\n\nFor each area of action, the Group has defined monitoring indicators,  specific  targets  and  action  plans.  These  are detailed in chapter 2.3.2 of this document.\n\nThe restructuring  and  reorganization  announcements  of November 8, 2022, will allow the creation of entities each dedicated to an ESG challenge: Ampere for\n\ndecarbonization  and  the  just  transition  to  all-electric, Power for decarbonization via alternative fuels and green hydrogen, THE  FUTURE  IS  NEUTRAL for conserving resources and creating short auto-to-auto loops.\n\nThe  transformation  of  the  Flins  plant  into  the Refactory , Europe's  first  circular  economy  plant  dedicated  to mobility, is emblematic of the Group's vision: to rely on a complete recycling and remanufacturing industrial ecosystem that is both a response to the environmental challenge,  particularly  for  the  most  strategic  or  critical materials, and  an  economic  asset  that  generates revenues and profits.\n\nLastly,  the  creation  of  the Mobilize brand,  which  aims  to develop  mobility,  data  and  energy  services,  is  another lever for the Group's transformation, creating environmental  and  societal  value  through  its  electric shared-mobility solutions and battery services.\n\n'The  Group's  environmental  policy  is  a  pillar  of  our engagement and responsible capitalism and is core to its transformation  and  its  raison  d'\u00eatre,  which  combine economic and environmental performance'\n\n(Jean-Dominique  Senard,  Chairman,  and  Luca  de  Meo, Chief Executive Officer, April 2021).\n\n## 2.3.1.2. Governance of environmental issues EFPD7a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supervision of the environmental strategy (including climate) by the Board of Directors\n\nThe  board  of  directors  oversees  the  definition  and implementation  of  the  Group's  environmental  strategy and the associated risks and opportunities. Each year, the board examines issues related to climate change, Renault Group's  strategy  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  the electrification of its product range and the impact of new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants.\n\nIn  order  to  strengthen  governance  on  these  issues,  the board  of  directors  created  a  specialized  committee  in 2019 whose  duties  include  conducting  an  in-depth examination of environmental issues: the Ethics and CSR Committee.

In  2022,  this  new Strategy and CSR Committee was renamed the Strategy and Sustainability Committee.\n\nThis Strategy and Sustainability Committee is made up of 60%  independent  directors,  in  accordance  with  the recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  It  met  five times  in  2022,  with  an  attendance  rate  of  97.1%  of  its members.\n\nIn 2022,  the  Strategy  and  Sustainability  Committee examined the following topics in particular:\n\n- \u25cf the  Group's  strategy  in  terms  of  social,  societal  and environmental responsibility;\n- \u25cf monitoring  and  implementation  of  the  \"Renaulution\" Strategic Plan;\n- \u25cf regular  monitoring  of  all  the  Group's  priority  strategic projects;\n- \u25cf the strategy and development of the circular economy activity;\n- \u25cf the development of 'ReKnow University' to support the development of mobility professions;\n- \u25cf the  development  of  partnerships  with  Nissan  on concrete operational projects covering markets, vehicles and technologies;\n- \u25cf the  impact  and  mitigation  plans  of  the  semiconductor crisis;\n- \u25cf the electric vehicle value chain strategy;\n- \u25cf the Group's decarbonization strategy and the review of its climate report;\n- \u25cf the used vehicle strategy;\n- \u25cf commercial vehicle strategy\n- \u25cf strategic trends in Latin America;\n- \u25cf the Alpine brand strategy;\n- \u25cf the  performance of  partnerships  and  the  Group's  new 'horizontal  strategy'  of  cooperation  with  the  various players in its ecosystem;\n- \u25cf the  objectives  in  terms  of  gender  diversity  in  the governing bodies and\n- \u25cf the  review  of  Chapter  2  'Sustainable  Development'  of the 2021 Universal Registration Document, including the non-financial performance statement (EFPD).\n\nFor more details on the activity report of the Strategy and Sustainability  Committee,  see  Chapter  3.1.6.3  of  the Company's 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Management of climate objectives by the Board of Management and the Strategy and Business Development Department\n\nThe  Leadership  Team  (formerly  BoM)  and  the  Strategy and Business Development Department steer the Group's environmental objectives. The focuses of the environmental  policy  are  discussed  once  a  year  and arbitrated within the BoM on the proposal of the Director of  Strategy and Business Development. For this purpose, the  BoM  relies  on  the  Group  Sustainable  Development\n\nCommittee. The areas of authority of the members of this Committee,  particularly  in  sustainable  development,  are detailed in section 3.1.3.\n\nThe  Strategy  and  Business  Development  Department  is responsible  for  preparing,  deploying  and  monitoring  the implementation of the environmental policy in all sectors of  the  company throughout its value chain and for each stage in the lifecycle of its vehicles. To do this, it relies on a network of correspondents deployed in all the company's functions, as well as on the areas of expertise. These were created in 2010 within the Group in areas such as 'energy, environment  and  raw  materials  strategy,'  'vehicle  CO2' and 'air quality and substances.' The experts who make up these teams provide in-depth knowledge of strategic issues and an approach recognized internally for its rigor, neutrality and cross-disciplinary nature.\n\nThe  roll-out  of  the  environmental  component  of  the strategic plan by the Strategy and Business Development Department thus  covers  all  of  Renault  Group's  activities and  supports  its  development  of  new  products  and services.\n\n## Compensation criteria linked to the achievement of environmental commitments\n\nIn light of the importance of climate issues for the Group, the  compensation  of  the  executive  corporate  officer includes, since 2013, a criterion related to respect for the environment  and  aimed  at  'leadership  in  environmental performance: CO2 emissions of vehicles in Europe, Renault Group carbon footprint.' More recently, on the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the board of directors proposed a change to the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer by adding criteria relating to:\n\n- \u25cf meeting  the  European  regulatory  target  for  passenger car CO2 emissions (CAFE standards 1 );\n- \u25cf reducing the carbon  footprint of Renault Group passenger cars and utility vehicles registered worldwide.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, the compensation policy regarding the Chief  Executive  Officer  has  changed  to  include  new environmental criteria:\n\n- \u25cf a criterion relating  to  the  number  of  used  vehicles reconditioned at Flins (in the annual variable compensation);\n- \u25cf a  criterion  relating  to  the  development  of  the  circular economy activity (in the annual variable compensation);\n- \u25cf a  criterion  related  to  the  Group's  electrified  passenger vehicle  sales  mix  in  Europe  over  cumulative  periods  of three years (in the performance action plan);\n- \u25cf a criterion related to the reduction of kg of CO2 emitted per vehicle produced in Europe over cumulative periods of 3 years (in the co-investment plan).\n\n(For  further  details  on  the  remuneration  elements  of  the Chief Executive Officer, see chapters 3.2.2.2 and 3.2.4.2 of this Registration Document).",

Resources EFPD7b\n\nRenault  Group  invests  about  \u20ac2.3bn  in  Research  and Development  every  year 11 . Most  of  these  resources  are allocated  to  the  development  of  new  low-emission vehicles,  powertrains  and  batteries.  Upstream  of  new vehicle projects, between \u20ac90m and \u20ac150m are allocated each  year  to  research  and  advanced  engineering 12 . A significant  share  of  this  spending  is  earmarked  for innovations specifically aimed  at  reducing  vehicle emissions (by extending the electric vehicle range), which is a regulatory imperative, particularly in Europe. Another share  is  allocated  to  developing  services  provided  by batteries (second-life use and smart charging).\n\n## 2.3.1.3.2. Life Cycle Assessments\n\nRenault  is  committed  to  measuring  the  environmental impacts of its vehicles throughout their life cycle from one generation  to  the  next.  Since  2004,  Renault  Group  has been measuring the environmental impact of its vehicles throughout their life cycle, from the extraction of the raw materials needed to manufacture them to their end of life. Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) are therefore performed:\n\n- \u25cf prior  to  the  vehicle  design  process,  to  analyze  the potential environmental impact and benefits of technological innovations;\n- \u25cf after  the  design  process,  to  confirm  and  measure  the reduction of environmental impacts from one generation of vehicles to another.\n\nAt  end-2022,  25  models  representing  78%  of  the  Group's global  passenger  car  sales  under  the  Renault,  Dacia,  Alpine and  RSM  (Renault  Samsung  Motors)  brands  were  thus subjected  to  a  complete  LCA.  Starting  with  the  launch  of Twingo III in September 2014, all new models are subjected to a comparative LCA with respect to their predecessor. Each of these LCAs is subjected to a critical review by an independent expert  following  the  ISO  14040  and  ISO  14044  standards,  to evaluate, firstly, the methodology used and, secondly, all of the\n\ncalculations and interpretations performed. The LCA reports for  new  models  and  their  critical  review  are  available  on request.\n\nFor further methodological  details,  please  refer  to section 2.6.1.2.\n\nThe graph below presents the results of the comparative life  cycle  analysis  of  the  1 st generation  ICE  Captur,  the 2 nd generation  ICE  Captur  and  the  Captur  Plug-in  Hybrid 'E-Tech,' in  the  form  of  a  norming  comparison.  Norming consists of measuring the relative weight of the impacts of the vehicles studied in relation to the global environmental  impacts  in  a  reference  year,  relative  to  a person.\n\n## The  LCA  results  illustrate  the  relevance  of  the  Plug-in hybrid  vehicle  in  terms  of  the  fight  against  global warming\n\nOver the entire life cycle, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  is  32%  for  Captur  E-Tech  compared  with  2 nd gen.  Captur,  taking  into  account  an  average  European electricity  mix  for  battery  charging.  With  the  electricity mix in France, the reduction was 53 %. The influence of the electricity mix used for charging on the final result is also notable  for  the  acidification  potential  indicator,  with  a reduction  of  34%  for  Captur  E-Tech  charged  with  the French  electricity  mix,  compared  with  Captur  E-Tech charged with the average European mix.\n\n## Potential depletion of mineral resources\n\nThe indicator of potential depletion of mineral resources shows  a  negative  impact  related  to  the  manufacture  of the  electrified  vehicle  traction  battery.  To  meet  this challenge, the Group is investing in the circular economy: participating  in  the  development  of  new  solutions  for recycling active battery materials, thus helping to reduce the  need  for  virgin  materials  (see  quantified,  dated targets in section 2.3.2.2).\n\nI",

Environmental skills and training\n\nPlant  employees  receive  workstation  training,  including environmental  aspects,  particularly  chemical  risks  arising from handling, storage and spills, and the sorting of waste.\n\nIn the majority of plants, this training is done through a specific Dojo (workshop) and involves a hands-on approach to waste\n\nmanagement  practices  and  the  handling  of  chemical products in day-to-day activities. In addition, educational and awareness-raising  activities  on  environmental  protection regularly take place through internal communication channels or through weekly team meetings.\n\nEmployees  in  positions  requiring  specific  environmental expertise  have  access  to  training  associated  with  their activity,  provided  in  the  form  of  internal  training  modules (e.g. training for ISO 14001 auditors or design-for-recycling) or through a specialized external organization if a specific area of  expertise  is  required.  Renault  employees  in  France  also have access to eco-driving training.\n\n## Fresque du Climat\n\nLaunched in 2021, the deployment of the ' Fresque du Climat ' among employees of Renault Group's Ile-de-France sites continued in 2022 with  571  people  trained.  These  educational  workshops  based  on  collective  intelligence  aim  to  raise  awareness  of  climate  change. This training is a permanent Group training opportunity and has been included in the 2023 plan.\n\n## 2.3.1.3.5. Environmental management system in the plants\n\nIn  2022,  the  industrial  environment network will be made up approximately 280 members spread over 12 countries and  42  sites.  Environmental  management  in  Renault Group plants is underpinned by four pillars:\n\n## 1. Continuous improvement based on ISO 14001\n\nStarting in 1995, Renault began systematically implementing an environmental management approach at its sites, along with a drive for continuous improvement, based on ISO 14001. This was done to reduce environmental impact and ensure regulatory compliance. Since 2008, 100% of Renault Group's industrial sites 13 and the  nine  main  engineering  and  logistics  facilities  have been ISO 14001-certified.\n\nI\n\n02",

Group-wide tools and standards\n\nIn  order  to  control  these  main  environmental  risks,  as required  by  the  French  vigilance  law,  Renault  Group  has developed a tool called 'Mandatory Rules Environment.' This  assessment  tool,  deployed  starting  in  2021,  can  be used  to  identify  and  prioritize  environmental  risks  (see 2.2.4.1. 'Environment' paragraph).\n\nIndustrial  standards  covering  all  areas  related  to  the environment define the minimum requirements that apply to the Group's sites (see 'Eco-design  of  industrial processes' paragraph below). These ensure that practices are standardized and reflect and adhere to the Company's policies  and  objectives  in  terms  of  the  environment,  no matter in which country the plants are located, in particular when  the  plants  are  not  subject  to  a  binding  regulatory framework.  The  'Mandatory  Rules  Environment'  tool highlights the key points of these standards.\n\nThis  is  particularly  important  in  countries  without  a stringent regulatory framework. For environmental management and the handling of chemicals, the sites can also rely on  the  availability of standardized  tools managed by expert functions. These tools include:\n\n- \u25cf an expert system called \u00c9corisques, available worldwide in the main languages used within the Group. The system determines  and  ranks  the  environmental  impact  from activities and potential hazards in relation to the plants' chemical  risk  and  prioritizes them  in  the  plants' environmental action plan;\n- \u25cf a  reporting  system  for  environmental  impacts  and energy consumption (R2E);\n- \u25cf a  CHEMIS  (Chemical  Information  System)  database, available in the main languages used within the Group, for  the  management of hazardous substances and the prevention  of  chemical  risks.  CHEMIS  is  the  key  tool  in Renault  Group  chemical  risk  management  process, which  aims,  from  both  environmental  and  health standpoints,  to  introduce  chemicals  safely,  to  prevent the  risks  associated  with  their  use,  and  to  anticipate technological and regulatory changes (see 2.3.2.3.2);\n- \u25cf a process to monitor and track compliance with national and EU environmental legislation;\n- \u25cf a  documentary  database  of  Environmental  standards and best practices, accessible from any Group site.\n\n## 3. Eco-design of industrial processes\n\nRenault's industrial projects are designed according to a development strategy punctuated by milestones. At these milestones,  each  business  line  checks  that  the  project\n\ncomplies with the defined rules and verifies convergence with the other business lines. The HSEE Department is part of this Group approach.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  environment,  the  project  must  be designed in such a way that the site hosting it is able to comply  with  the  mandatory  rules  described  in  the Environmental  Mandatory  Rules.  These  rules  define  the minimum requirements applicable to all the Group's sites, bearing in mind that if local regulatory requirements are more demanding, these take precedence. To achieve this objective, the Group also relies on the new methodological tool  currently  being  deployed,  the  'HSEE  in  projects' Mandatory Rules described in paragraph 2.2.3.\n\nFor example, acoustic emission modeling was carried out for  equipment  to  be  installed  in  2023  at  the  Flins  site. These  models  made  it  possible  to  take  into  account  the configuration  of  the  planned  site  (with  walls  capable  of reflecting sounds) and to challenge the supplier to ensure that  noise  levels  towards  the  neighborhood  would  be compliant  from  the  first  day  of  operation  of  the  future equipment.\n\nTo complement this shared base of minimum requirements applicable to all Group projects, technological  innovations  may  be  introduced  according to constraints  or  opportunities  related  to  the  local environment. This is the case, for example, of the 'NickelFree' technological innovation described in paragraph 2.3.2.4.2.\n\n## 4. Environmental management system audits\n\nSince  the  end  of  the  1990s,  the  Group  has  used  internal environmental audits at all of its industrial facilities as well as its main engineering and logistics facilities in order to monitor  the  implementation  of  ISO  14001  requirements, and  especially  the  compliance  with  its  own  internal standards  for  the  protection  of  the  environment.  These complement the external audits performed annually by a certified independent body.\n\nInternal audits are therefore conducted by members of the industrial environmental network (environmental managers and business specialists), using joint audits that encourage exchanges of best practice between plants and stimulate improvements in environmental performance.\n\nAs of end-2022, the network had 53 internal environmental auditors  who  were  specifically  trained  and  qualified  in accordance with  ISO  14001  and  knowledge  of  the  various environmental  topics.  Each  new  auditor  embarks  on  a progressive  skills development  path  until  eventually becoming an audit manager.",

The governance of climate issues takes place within the framework of the governance of all environmental issues.\n\n## 2.3.2.1.2. Strategy and Action Plan EFPD11c EFPD12b EFPD12c\n\nIn  2019,  Renault  Group  was  the  first  carmaker  to  have decarbonization  targets  validated  with  the  Science Based-Targets (SBTi) initiative.\n\nIn  April  2021,  Renault  Group  published  its  Climate  Plan. It  is  broken  down  into  nine  major  actions  over  the  entire lifecycle  of  vehicles  described  below.  They  will  be gradually rolled out across the Group until 2030, an interim milestone  toward  our  ambition  of  carbon  neutrality  in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050. In addition to the nine  actions,  the  Group  has  tools  and  processes  to manage risks and opportunities.\n\n## 2.3.2.1.2.1.  Actions on the vehicle usage phase - Scope 3 Downstream\n\nIn  2022, the vehicle usage phase accounts for more than 80% of Renault Group's carbon footprint 14 .\n\nAction #1: Electrify 100% of new Renault passenger car models by 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn  internal  combustion  engine  (ICE)  vehicle  in  Europe emits  3  times  more  CO2e  in  its  lifecycle  than  an  electric vehicle 15 .\n\nEU  Member  States  must  implement  national  energy  and climate  plans  (NECP)  guaranteeing  their  contribution  to achieving the EU's climate and energy goals. As part of this\n\neffort, they are phasing out the sale of ICE vehicles (by 2030 for the United Kingdom and by 2040 at the latest for France). Furthermore, the UN predicts that two thirds of the world's population  will  be  urban  by  2050,  and  cities  are  already increasingly restricting access for ICE cars.\n\nIn  order  to  achieve  its target of  electrifying  100%  of  new models  of  Renault  passenger  cars  by  2025  in  Europe,  the company is:\n\n- \u25cf Pooling  production  across  three  platforms: CMF-B and CMF-EV (for electric vehicles), CMF-CD;\n- \u25cf Establishing ' Renault  ElectriCity '  in  northern  France, which  will  be  the  largest,  most  competitive  electric vehicle production center in Europe;\n- \u25cf Launching 7 electric  models under  the  Renault  brand, including 2 C-segment models. Two electric models were launched in 2022: Megane and Kangoo EV;\n- \u25cf Accelerating  electrification by  shortening  the  time  to develop a new vehicle by 25%.\n\nThe Renault brand's ambition is to have electric vehicles represent  nearly  90%  of  its  passenger  vehicle  sales  in Europe by 2030.\n\nTo  support  this  acceleration,  Mobilize  Power  Solutions,  a Renault  Group  subsidiary  specializing  in  customized recharging  solutions  for  electric  and  plug-in  hybrid vehicles,  is  simplifying  the  transition  to  electric  mobility for  professionals and private individuals. Today, Mobilize Power  Solutions  is  present  in  11  key  European  electric mobility  markets:  Spain,  Portugal,  France,  Germany,  the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, and Luxembourg.\n\nFrom  advice  to  installation to the operation  and maintenance  of  charging  stations, Mobilize Power Solutions  supports  its  customers  for  their  recharging needs at work, at home, and on the move, including long journeys,  thanks  to  the  Mobilize  Fast  Charge  network, developed in partnership with Renault network dealers. By mid-2024,  200  stations  are  expected  to  be  deployed  in Europe.\n\nI\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nSustainable development\n\n02",

Ampere will develop, manufacture, and sell fully electric passenger cars with advanced SDV (Software Defined Vehicle) technology under the Renault brand. Ampere will bring the best of both worlds: the know-how and assets of the Group with the focus and agility of a pure player in electric vehicles (see section 1.1.2).\n\n## Action #2:\n\n## Become a European leader in hydrogen-powered light commercial vehicles by 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith models such as Kangoo, Trafic and Master, Renault is a European leader in light commercial vehicles (LCVs).\n\nThe very strong growth of this market and the tightening of diesel standards have led the Group to develop electric versions for these models.\n\nToday,  the  aim  is  to  improve  performance  in  terms  of range and charging speed for heavy-duty use.\n\nTo  extend  the  range  of  the  electric  vehicle  without increasing the size of the battery, or even by reducing it, hydrogen  fuel  cell  technology  (Dual  Power)  provides additional  zero-emission  energy.  In  addition  to  charging at electric stations, vehicles  can  be  charged  with hydrogen in just a few minutes.\n\nIn June 2021, Renault and Plug Power launched a joint venture called Hyvia to offer a global hydrogen solution providing:\n\n- \u25cf commercial  vehicles  with  a  range  of  400  kilometers (WLTP standard) and reduced charging time (less than 5 minutes);\n- \u25cf complete  turnkey  solutions  for  fuel  cell  commercial vehicles:  charging  stations,  supply  of  green  hydrogen from decarbonized energy.\n\nHYVIA has set  a  target  of  achieving  a  30%  share  of  the European hydrogen LCV market by 2030. Its first vehicles have been approved, and major customers have wanted to  test  the  Hydrogen  technology  with  HYVIA's  first production  vehicles:  Chronopost,  Engie,  Orange,  Equans, Alpine  F1  Team  (in  France),  Airbus,  Port  of  Hamburg, Packeta, and Maximator Hydrogen GmbH (in Germany).\n\nThrough  Hyvia,  Renault  Group  plans  to  continue  building strong  partnerships  in  the  field  of  hydrogen.  With  FOVIA since  the  end  of  2021,  the  Group  has  been  developing hydrogen tanks for light  commercial  vehicles.  In  addition, on  the  basis  of  collaborative  projects,  Renault  Group  will develop solutions integrating all public and private players in the production and distribution of energy.\n\nIn addition to mobility, Hyvia will offer fuel cell and charging solutions, manufactured in Flins, France, to other industries.\n\n## Action #3: Deploy hybrid technologies across all brands\n\nRenault Group  is developing low-emission engines (E-Tech hybrid and gas) to complement its offer of electric vehicles.\n\nDeveloped  exclusively,  the  E-Tech  hybrid  technology reduces the fuel consumption of a hybrid engine by 40% compared with an equivalent internal combustion engine in urban cycle. Its E-Tech plug-in hybrid version delivers a zero-emission mobility solution.\n\nAcceleration of the E-Tech hybrid offering:\n\n- \u25cf launch  of  a  new  hybrid  model  by  the  Renault  brand  in 2022  (Austral)  in  addition  to  the  three  in  2021  (Captur, Arkana, and Megane Saloon);\n- \u25cf target: 35% Renault hybrid vehicle sales in 2025;\n- \u25cf deploying  new  technologies  to  further  reduce  hybrid vehicle emissions: connectivity, eco-driving and a 100% electric mode to enable access to low-emission zones.\n\n## Additional action: Introduce eco-driving aids\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsumption  by  vehicles  is  approved  according  to standardized cycles that are representative of usage but do not cover all driving styles (more or less aggressive) or all real driving conditions (use of heating or air conditioning, urban or rural areas, traffic flow, etc.). For an electric  vehicle,  the  same  reasoning  can  be  applied  to electricity  consumption  and  range.  (See  appendix  2.6.1.7 Emission  standards  applicable  to  passenger  cars  in  the European Union).\n\nUnder  favorable  driving  and  temperature  conditions,  a driver  with  an  economical  driving  style  (an  'eco'  driver) can achieve the same fuel consumption as a WLTP cycle, which  is  up  to  25%  less  than  an  'average'  driver.  A 'dynamic' customer can consume up to 40 % more than the 'average' driver and 70 % more than an 'eco' driver 16 .",

These fall into two categories: delegative and constructive, adapted to the main driver profiles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1/ Delegative systems or active assistance.\n\nThese systems perform all or part of the driving tasks.\n\nThe  first  two  generations  of  systems,  becoming  more widespread  today,  limit  consumption  by  selecting  'Eco Mode', which acts on:\n\n- \u25cf reduction  of  acceleration  capabilities  under  certain conditions;\n- \u25cf maximum speed limitation for electric vehicles;\n- \u25cf efficient management of thermal comfort.\n\nThe  third-generation  technologies,  launched  on  Megane E-Tech  and  Austral  in  2021,  can  also  take  full  charge  of certain  tasks  for  more  energy-efficient  driving:  eco  and predictive  cruise  control,  adjustment  to  terrain,  speed limitations, traffic density, etc.\n\n## 2/ Participatory systems.\n\nThey  make  drivers  active  in  their  'eco-driving'  by providing information to help them to consume less fuel or electricity. Renault Group offers several types:\n\n- \u25cf 'Eco Coach' : the system displays real-time information on  the  vehicle's  operation  on  the  dashboard  (rev counter  for  internal  combustion  vehicles,  power  meter for electric vehicles, instantaneous  and  average consumption)  and  eco-driving  aids  (gear  change,  lift foot  off  accelerator  to  anticipate,  optimal  speed  to reach a green light, etc.);\n- \u25cf 'Eco  Score' : the  system  evaluates  the  driving  style; drivers become aware of their level of eco-driving and their potential for improvement.\n\n## 3/ Gamification and rewards\n\nMotivation is essential for sustainable behavioral change, so gamification tools based on challenge and reward are effective  levers  to  encourage  users  of  Renault  Group vehicles to adopt eco-driving:\n\n- \u25cf 'Eco Challenge' ('Reward'):  the  system  analyses  past journeys to generate advice on how to optimize future journeys;  the  driver  can  self-assess  and  compare  with others. This function belongs to generation 4 and will be available  on  smartphones  and  computers  for  both private customers and fleet asset managers.\n\nI",

Manufacturing actions Scope 1+2 and Scope 3 Upstream\n\n## Action #5:\n\n## Accelerate the deployment of more efficient, low-carbon, reusable batteries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccording to the French agency for ecological transition (ADEME),  producing  the  battery  of  an  electric  car accounts for a third of its carbon footprint due to the use of  electricity  from  fossil  fuels  and  the  extraction  of strategic raw materials such as cobalt and lithium.\n\nStarting  in  2024,  the  European  Union  will  require  battery manufacturers to measure this footprint over a battery's lifecycle,  from  production  to  recycling.  A  European  draft regulation  plans  to  set  a  maximum  carbon  footprint threshold for batteries put on the market by 2027.\n\nRenault  Group  intends  to  accelerate  the  deployment  of more  efficient,  low-carbon,  reusable  batteries  by  acting on their entire lifecycle:\n\n- \u25cf Low-carbon  battery  production: in  association  with suppliers, reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  battery production by using decarbonized energy and materials. Renault  Group  aims  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of the new R5's battery by 20% by 2025 compared with the Zoe's battery in 2019. The reduction is expected to reach 35 % in  2030.  In  this  respect,  Renault  Group  has  signed three  agreements  with  material  suppliers  since  2021: with  Terrafame  for  sustainable  nickel  sourcing  (low carbon and traceability of the entire supply chain), with Vulcan for less carbon-intensive lithium in 2021 and with Managem  for  low-carbon  cobalt  sulfate  produced  in Morocco  in  2022.  This  is  in  addition  to  the  agreements with Verkor and Envision-Aesc to produce the batteries in France by 2025.\n- \u25cf Maintenance: deployment  of  battery  repair  centers during their first life (around a hundred operate as of the end  of  2022,  including  a  center  of  expertise  and  repair within  the  Flins  Refactory).  Launch  of  an  offering  of second-hand batteries for the repair of electric vehicles.\n- \u25cf Second  life : repurposing  batteries  for  the  stationary storage  of  renewable  energy,  mobile  solutions  (boats, cooling systems, airport machinery). In 2022, production will start at Flins of stationary systems produced as part of Renault Group's partnership with 'Betteries,' a startup specializing in the recovery and use of batteries from electric vehicles. Betteries uses recycled EV batteries to develop transportable electric generators suitable for a variety of purposes (e.g. on construction sites or in food trucks).  These  systems  are  assembled  at  the  Flins Refactory. These second-life uses of our batteries make it possible to avoid GHG emissions.\n- \u25cf Recycling: closed-loop  recycling  of  strategic  materials (cobalt,  nickel,  lithium)  to  produce  new  batteries.  For these three materials, Renault Group plans to reach 80 % of recycled material reintegrated into the production of new batteries by 2030 (closed loop).\n\nRecycling, maintenance, repair and second-life activities are carried out at the Refactory in Flins, France (see box in section 2.3.2.2).\n\nIn addition to these activities, starting from the launch of the R5 model in 2024, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology will enable electric vehicles to feed energy into the power grid to regulate peak consumption.\n\nI",

In particular, this work led to the publication of a methodology commonly accepted by the international members of the GBA: the GHG Rulebook. The work carried out within Recharge, which is still ongoing, is contributing to the development of the first-ever battery regulation with European stakeholders in line with the Paris and Fit for 55% agreements.\n\n## Action #6: Engage the entire supply chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRaw  material  extraction and parts manufacturing account for  16%  of  a  Group  vehicle's  carbon  footprint  in 2022, second only to well-to-wheel emissions. Engaging all its suppliers  in  active  efforts  to  reduce  their  own environmental  footprint  is  a  priority  for  Renault  Group's climate strategy.\n\nRenault Group has set a target of reducing CO2e/kg emissions in  the  parts  and  materials  supply  chain  by  30%  by  2030 compared with 2019. To achieve this, Renault Group is working with its suppliers on six priority areas for improvement:\n\n- \u25cf Area  1: Set  up  a  carbon  footprint  assessment  system using outside surveys conducted by an accredited CDP supply chain organization.\n- \u25cf Area  2: Require  suppliers  to  make  CSR  commitments and  have  their  performance  assessed  by  an  outside organization (see 2.2.5).\n- \u25cf Area  3: Identify  the  six  highest-emitting  commodities (materials and parts) and implement a joint action plan with suppliers to design a lower-GHG process.\n- \u25cf Area 4: Co-develop a co-innovation policy to invent new technologies  to  meet  future  regulations  and  consumer expectations.\n- \u25cf Area  5: Increase  local  sourcing  for  production  plants. Partnerships  with  Verkor  and  Envision  to  produce batteries in France, as close as possible to the ElectriCity industrial hub, from 2025.\n- \u25cf Area 6: Establish internal carbon pricing for the selection of  materials  and  other  procurement  decisions  (see 2.3.2.1.2.3).\n\nIn addition, in 2020, Renault Group became a signatory of the  European  Raw  Materials  Alliance  (ERMA)  to  foster  a virtuous cycle for the supply of raw materials.\n\n## Action #7: Strengthening Renault Group's circular economy leadership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the fight against climate change, the circular economy is  an  essential  lever  because  greenhouse  gas  emissions can  be  avoided.  The  circular  economy  strategy  and indicators are set out in chapter 2.3.2.2 of this document ('Resources and circular economies').\n\nThis  work  includes  increasing  the  use  of  recycled materials  in  the  manufacture  of  vehicles.  Objective:  All new  vehicles  worldwide  to  be  made  with  33%  recycled materials by 2030.\n\n## Action #8:\n\n## Reduce emissions from our sites by 80% between 2019 and 2030 (scopes 1 and 2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the issues related to the constant increase in the price of fossil fuels, the use of low-carbon energy and the reduction of consumption are at the same time major levers for the climate trajectory, levers for competitiveness  (energy  savings)  and  levers  for  energy independence  in  an  increasingly  uncertain  geopolitical environment.\n\nThat is why it is being managed by a dedicated corporate team, via a network of energy managers deployed across all Group sites, according to an organization based on the principles of ISO 50001 outlined in the diagram below. The Group  has  also  embarked  on  a  global  roadmap  for  the certification  of  its  industrial  sites,  with  the  first  stage covering all French sites in 2023. At end-2022, the certified sites are Bursa, Cl\u00e9on, Le Mans and Sandouville.\n\nSince 2021, the energy-saving and controlled performance approach has covered tertiary,  logistics  and  distribution sites  in  addition  to  industrial  sites.  For  example,  the installation  of  solar  panels  on  the  roof  of  a  dealership  in Switzerland 17 will  avoid  the  emission  of  almost  50,000 metric tons of CO2e per year.\n\n## Four drivers:\n\n## 1. Industrial footprint:\n\nMore compact sites will lead to a reduction of space to be lit and  heated.  The  sites  are  continuing  their  overall compaction trajectory with a target of reducing 750,000 m\u00b2 of covered buildings by 2025. Of particular note in 2022",

In  April  2021,  Renault Group signed a contract with the energy supplier Iberdrola to cover 100% of its energy consumption in Spain with renewable energy.\n- \u25cf France . In November 2022, the Group announced three major partnerships with energy players:\n- \u25cf With Voltalia, the largest renewable electricity supply contract in France. This contract will enable Renault Group to cover up to 50% of the electricity consumption of its production activities in France in 2027 through the installation of photovoltaic panels.\n- \u25cf With  the  ENGIE  Group,  a  first-of-its-kind  deep  geothermal  project  in  Europe  that  would  replace  70%  of  the  gas needs of the Douai factory by 2025;\n- \u25cf With  Dalkia,  EDF  Group,  a  partnership  to  install  a  biomass  boiler  to  replace  65%  of  the  gas  consumption  at  its Maubeuge plant\n\n## Action #9: Reduce emissions from the transportation of parts and vehicles by 30%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## between 2019 and 2030\n\nIn  2015,  Renault  Group  was one of the first companies to join  the  FRET21  initiative.  It  unites  the  community  of shippers  in  efforts  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of freight. In 2019, the Group was awarded the EVE Trophy by ADEME  for  the  biggest  improvement  in  reducing  CO2e emissions  from  transport  and  decided  to  commit  to FRET21  a  second  time  (between  2019  and  2021  on  a  2018 baseline). The result of this second commitment was once again positive, with a result of -6.69% CO2e emissions for a target of -5.5%.\n\nToday,  the  objective  of  the  supply  chain  is  to  work  to further  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  transportation, logistics platforms and its packaging.\n\n2021-2030 action plan built on 4 pillars across the logistics chain:\n\n- \u25cf Deployment of biogas and biofuel trucks starting in 2021, and  continued  in  2022,  followed  by  the  deployment  of electric and  hydrogen-powered  trucks  from  2025. 584  metric  tons  of  CO2e  have  already  been  avoided  in inbound  logistics  thanks  to  the  implementation  of 4,650 GAS trucks (bio-CNG and CNG) with three carriers in  France.  On  the  vehicle  distribution  side,  11,350  new vehicles were transported with 1,870 B30 trucks from the carrier Dolotrans, for a reduction of 1,026 metric tons of CO2e on a France-Romania flow.\n- \u25cf Scaling  up  multimodal  transportation , in part by increasing the share of rail freight. The implementation of  trains  for  the  distribution  of  vehicles  has  enabled 3,250 metric tons of CO2e to be saved on flows from the Shiyan  factory  (China)  to  the  port  of  Shanghai  for 18,800 vehicles transported as well as on a Spain/Austria flow with 920 vehicles.\n- \u25cf Reduction  in  the  number  of  kilometers  traveled  per cubic meter of goods thanks  to  more  optimized  and\n\n18 Scope: the reporting scope is described in Annex 2.6.1.3.\n\ninnovative trucks (double-decker trucks, multipurpose  trucks,  etc.),  the  integration  of  a  CO2 transport  criterion  in  new  vehicle  projects  and  the optimization  of  loading.  Densification  actions  for parts and packaging have made it possible to avoid the equivalent of 11,350 trucks, for a reduction of 7,000 metric tons of CO2e.\n\n- \u25cf Rational management  of  packaging : reducing  its weight,  returning  used  packaging,  minimizing  waste, increasing the share of recycled material in packaging and eventual elimination of single-use plastics.\n\nTogether, these actions have allowed more than 416,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions to be avoided (cumulative over the 2017-2022 period).\n\nBeyond the 2021-2030 action plan, Renault Group expects to  further  avoid  emissions  through  the  development  of packaging recycling channels, both within the Group and with its suppliers.\n\nIn  addition,  Renault  Group  entered  into  a  partnership  in 2018  with  NEOLINE,  a  French  start-up  developing  windpowered cargo ships. Pilot ships are planned for 2024.\n\n2.3.2.1.2.3. Tools and processes in place to manage risks and opportunities\n\n## Monitor the reduction of CO2e emissions from vehicles: CAFE Control Tower\n\nIn  2018,  Renault  Group  created  a  specific  program  team called the 'CAFE Control Tower' to monitor the results in Europe and oversee the roadmap each year.\n\nStarting  in  2019,  the  Group  also  developed  a  tool  to forecast CO2e levels for its registered vehicles in Europe. The CAFE Control Tower reports its results to the Board of Management (BoM) every month.\n\nOutside  Europe,  the  Group  is  subject  to  regulatory standards similar to those in Europe. In total, around 70% of the Group's sales worldwide are thus subject to CAFEtype regulations.",

The BoM reviews these indicators each year to ensure their alignment with short-, medium- and long-term strategy.\n\n## Making strategic choices to manage GHG emissions reduction: Internal Carbon Pricing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group  uses  an Internal Carbon  Pricing  (ICP) mechanism  to  drive  the  reduction  in  its  CO2e  emissions and internalize the economic cost of its greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThese internal prices apply to several types of decisions:\n\n- \u25cf For new vehicle projects , two areas of application:\n- \u25cf decisions concerning  the  technological  building blocks that make it possible to improve the efficiency of vehicles in the use phase. The definition of the ICP integrates, in particular, regulations on in-use emissions  such  as  CAFE  (i.e.  \u20ac95  g  CO2  penalties  in Europe); and taxation linked to CO2.\n- \u25cf decisions regarding vehicle materials and components throughout the value chain. The definition  incorporates  future  regulatory  projects such  as  the  CBAM  in  Europe  (Carbon  Border Adjustment Mechanism).\n- \u25cf For  industrial  facilities , the  ICP  takes  into  account changes  in  the  energy  market  and  in  CO2e  emission allowances.  More  than  half  of  the  Group's  direct emissions,  i.e.  11  industrial  sites,  are  subject  to  the European  Union  Emissions  Trading  Scheme  (EU-ETS). The associated financial issues are managed through a specific  steering  committee.  In  the  context  of  the European Commission's gradual phasing out of the free allocation of EU ETS allowances, the strategy implemented  by  Renault  Group  aims  to  minimize  the financial  burden  of  the  allowances  in  the  medium  and long term through efforts to reduce energy consumption at  the  sites  (see  above)  and  rigorous  forward-looking management.  South  Korea  has  also  implemented  an emissions trading system since 2015, to which the Busan manufacturing site has been subject since then. Thanks to  the  emission-reduction measures undertaken before the  entry  into  force  of  these  regulations,  the  Group  did not  need  to  acquire  additional  allowances.  Starting  in 2021, the Giheung site is also subject to it and has also not resorted to purchasing allowances.\n\nThese various  ICPs  are  revised  at  least  once  a  year  and vary  between  \u20ac100/t  CO2e  and  \u20ac200  t/CO2e  to  take account of market developments and regional specificities.\n\nI",

First, in 2021, the Flins used vehicle plant started production, and the Shyan plant in China started exporting vehicles to Europe. Then, in 2022, a new manufacturing site started production in Karsan, Turkey. In addition, the electronic components crisis led to a very significant increase in the need for breakdown services and therefore deliveries by air. On a like-for-like basis in 2019 and excluding the effects of the component crisis, there is a reduction in emissions per vehicle of around 10 %. Renault Group remains on track to achieve the 30% reduction target in 2030. Thanks to new technologies that will become available in the next few years (such as 40 T EV or hydrogen trucks, a more massive deployment of sail-powered freighters, greater availability of rail solutions), the decarbonization of logistics activities should accelerate significantly starting in 2025.",

This significant progress is explained  on  the  one  hand  by  the  implementation  of ambitious  action  plans  on  all  the  sites  (improvement  of the  metering  plan,  new  energy  portal,  technological bricks,  etc.)  and  on  the  other  hand  by  setting  up,  for  the entire winter period, a task force dedicated to the energy crisis and reinforced management at all sites.\n\n* Until 2019, due to the large number of engines and gearboxes produced for the partners, a MWh/veh ratio is applied. For the calculation of this ratio, the consumption of the powertrain plants is adjusted in proportion to the total number of vehicles produced by the Group. However, no adjustment is applied to overall consumption presented in MWh in the chart.\n\n## Breakdown of energy consumption by type of energy\n\n|                                                                      | Total consumption   | Total consumption   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                                      | %                   | MWh                 |\n| Electricity                                                          | 53%                 | 2,165,656           |\n| Of which from renewable sources                                      | 27%                 | 1,099,376           |\n| Natural gas                                                          | 43%                 | 1,744,040           |\n| Thermal energy                                                       | 3%                  | 126,207             |\n| Of which thermal energy produced from renewable sources              | 2%                  | 76,269              |\n| LPG                                                                  | 1%                  | 44,938              |\n| Biomass                                                              | 0.1%                | 4,589               |\n| Heavy fuel oil and domestic fuel oil                                 | 0.1%                | 2,270               |\n| TOTAL                                                                | 100%                | 4,087,700 (\u221a)       |\n| Of which energy that is renewable or produced from renewable sources | 29%                 | 1,176,005           |\n\n(\u221a) Indicator audited by the independent third party at a reasonable level of assurance for the 2022 financial year.\n\n- 21 Scope: all manufacturing sites and main logistics, service and engineering sites of Renault Group, excluding establishments of the RRG sales network.

|    |\n\nRenault  Group's  strategy  for  dealing  with  the  risks  and  opportunities  associated  with  climate  change  is  detailed  in section 2.3.2.1.2.\n\n## 2.3.2.1.4.5. How the Group identifies climate risks\n\nTo meet the TCFD's recommendations on climate-related financial  disclosures,  a  working  group  was  created  in 2020. Its members represent the various Group departments  with  strategic  added  value  for  the  climate project:  they  include  the  Head  of  Risk  Management,  the Head of Financial Communications, the Strategic Environmental Planning Department and several technical experts. The 'Climate' working Group identified the  risks  related  to  climate  change  (including  transition and physical risks), built scenarios, assessed the impacts\n\n## 2.3.2.1.4.6. How the Group manages climate risks\n\nIdentifying and managing risks relating to the environment and to climate change are a part of the Group's global risk management  system,  which  is  supervised  by  the  Risk Management  Department.  The  Group's  risk  management system is detailed in section 4.1.\n\nof  each  risk  on  Group  performance under each scenario and developed action plans.\n\nStarting in 2015, work on a materiality matrix had made it possible  to  identify  'material'  issues,  i.e.  those  that  will have  a  major  impact  on  the  Group's  ecosystem  and  its performance, on which it will  therefore  have  to  focus  its efforts. This matrix was updated in 2020 (see section 2.1.4). 'Reducing the total carbon footprint' is a top priority for Renault Group. Internal and external stakeholders expect the Group to continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe risk management method applied by Renault Group is based  on  identifying  and  assessing  risks  of  any  kind, which  are  then  mapped  (as  mentioned  earlier),  and  on carrying  out  action  plans  to  deal  with  these  risks,  and specifically their net impact  and/or  probability  of occurrence, by means of elimination, prevention, protection or transfer.",

As  such,  with  regard  to  physical risks, the actions undertaken in the monitoring of existing risks (e.g. risk of natural disasters or risk to raw materials) were  supplemented  by  cross-cutting  initiatives  such  as\n\nthe launch of a study of the vulnerability of the industrial and  logistics  sites  in  connection  with  the  climate scenarios mentioned above.\n\nRisk  management  policy  is  applied  at  Group  level  for major risks, but it is also rolled out at operating entity level (countries, commercial and/or industrial subsidiaries), for vehicle programs and corporate functions.\n\n## 2.3.2.2.

This  project  is  part  of  the  Group's transformation strategy and builds on its pioneering commitment to the circular economy. It aims to develop a competitive industrial model for sustainable mobility, based on the value-creation potential generated by a vehicle throughout its life. The roll-out of the new activities, initiated in 2021, will continue until 2025.\n\nThe Refactory relies on a large network of multi-sector partners (start-ups, academic partners, major groups, local authorities, etc.) and is structured around four areas of activity.\n\nReTrofit: This division combines all the activities making it possible to extend the life of vehicles and their uses, in coordination with the Re-Cycle division, to ensure efficient management of the flow of used parts and materials within the company on a single site. Since the end of 2020, it has included a UV Factory for the reconditioning of used vehicles with a capacity of 45,000 vehicles per year, to which a new heavy body shop will be added in 2023 to repair up to 25,000 vehicles involved in an impact per year.\n\nA ReTrofit activity for the conversion of thermal vehicles to other less carbon-intensive energies is also planned, starting with the ReTrofit of electric motors for MASTER commercial vehicles. Announced in mid-July 2022, the partnership between Renault Group and Tolv (formerly Phoenix Mobility) is the first collaboration between a non-specialized vehicle manufacturer and a start-up in the ReTrofit sector. The partnership is a proof-of-concept project with the aim of launching a future commercial offering.\n\nThis will be supplemented by fleet repair services, particularly for car-sharing.\n\nReEnergy: The aim of this division is to scale up innovative applications using electric vehicle batteries and new low-carbon energies: assessment and repair of electric vehicle batteries, dismantling of end-of-life batteries and reuse of their components, development of  second-life  applications  such  as  stationary  electric  energy  storage,  industrialization  of  hydrogen  fuel  cells  and  charging infrastructure for low-carbon vehicles.\n\nReCycle: This division, including the remanufacturing workshops transferred from the Choisy-le-Roi site, will bring together various activities  contributing  to  the  efficient  management  of  materials:  dismantling  of  end-of-life  vehicles,  reuse  and  renovation  of automotive components, closed-loop recycling of materials from the various Refactory divisions and the INDRA network.\n\nReStart: To promote and develop industrial know-how, but also to accelerate research and innovation in the circular economy, this division  will  house  an  incubator  as  well  as  a  training  center  dedicated  to  circular  economy  professions.  It  will  also  include  an advanced manufacturing activity with ReTrofit services for industrial robots and production of parts from 3D printers.",

In  2022,  vehicle  production  (2.1 million  units)  at  the  Group's  plants  and  parts  suppliers required  approximately  2.7  million  metric  tons  of  steel, 185,000 metric tons of cast iron and 270,000 metric tons of aluminum.  These  estimated  figures  include  offcuts  of sheet  metal  and  metal  shavings  generated  during supplier parts manufacturing processes and in Renault's plants.  In  addition,  Renault  Group  used  about  350,000 metric  tons  of  plastic  materials,  including  offcuts,  in vehicle manufacturing in 2022.\n\nAmong the materials used in the plants in the Europe and North  Africa  Regions  (approximately  two  thirds  of  the\n\nquantities  above),  it  is  estimated  that  the  portion  of recycled steel materials ranges from 17 % for flat steel to more than 90 % for steel bars and cast iron. The recycled materials rate for aluminum varies considerably according  to  the  processes  used  to  manufacture  the parts:  it  is  nearly  100 %  for  aluminum  foundries  and secondary smelting and nearly 40 %  for pressed aluminum parts manufactured internally.\n\nThe  average  mass  of  recycled  plastics  for  all  vehicles produced in  Europe,  Turkey  and  North  African  in  2022  is approximately 19 kg per vehicle. For new vehicles, put into production in 2022, this same average rises to 23 kg.\n\n## Renault is a partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and member of the RECORD network\n\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation works with businesses, universities and decision makers to promote circular economic models and develop  the  scientific  and  managerial  knowledge  required  for  their  adoption  and  to  advise  on  the  potential  for  economic  and environmental benefits.\n\nAs  a  founding  partner  of  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation,  Renault  contributes  to  its  funding,  supports  the  work  and  events coordinated by the Foundation and develops activities based on the principles of the circular economy, such as the Refactory and the activities of Renault Environment.\n\nFor more information: https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/Renault\n\nIn addition, Renault Group has been a founding member of the RECORD network since 1989 and currently holds one of the two vicechair positions. RECORD is a recognized player in France in applied research in the field of end-of-life product management, waste management and resource efficiency in a circular economy perspective.\n\nFor more information: https://record-net.org/\n\n## 2.3.2.2.1. Designing vehicles that are recyclable and material-efficient\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault  anticipated  the  European  regulatory  requirement whereby  95%  of  vehicle  mass  should  be  recyclable  or recoverable  and  implemented  it  on  all  models  brought  to market starting in 2007. In addition, it has been voluntarily applied to all Group vehicles sold worldwide.\n\nAccordingly, since the early 2000s, the design of Renault vehicles has taken dismantling and recycling requirements  into  account.  For  example,  disassembly  is made easier by reducing the number of attachments. For example, dismantling has been made easier by reducing the number of fixing points. Similarly, preference is given\n\nto recyclable materials for which recycling systems exist; whenever possible, a single part will not contain materials that cannot be recycled together; and tanks are shaped to  allow all  fuel  and  oil  to  be  removed.  During  the  design phase,  every  new  vehicle  project  is  monitored  by  a recycling specialist.\n\nRenault  also  participates  in  research  projects  aimed  at developing  new  recycled  and  recyclable  materials recyclables (see example of the DECORE Project in the box in paragraph 2.3.2.2.6 Recycling).\n\nThe possibility of renovating powertrains or certain of their parts  (remanufacturing)  is  also  taken  into  consideration from  the  beginning  of  their  design  by  facilitating  the dismantling and assessment of their components.\n\nRenault Group is also working at reducing the amount of materials used in manufacturing its vehicles.\n\nI",

Since 2011, for its 100% electric vehicles, the company has chosen externally excited synchronous motors, a technology without permanent magnets and therefore requiring no rare earths.\n\nIn addition, when feasible, the Group chooses materials other than rare earths in its magnets, for example, ferrite for applications such as speakers.\n\nRenault Group is also reducing the use of the most critical rare earths through technological innovations. For example, the Group's consumption of Dysprosium (a heavy rare earth) decreased by 65% between 2011 and 2016. The Group strives to replace heavy rare earths (more critical in terms of supply) with light rare earths when possible.\n\nLastly,  Renault is  working on projects to recycle rare earths with the aim of reducing its dependence on the extraction of these minerals even further.\n\n## 2.3.2.2.2. Reducing at source and recovering waste\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn accordance with the principles of the circular economy, Renault  has  adopted  a  preventive  approach  to  achieve the  maximum  reduction  in  the  environmental  impacts associated with waste, through the implementation of the following principles, in order of priority:\n\n- \u25cf reduce the  quantity  of  waste  generated  at  source,  by first eliminating  the  source  of  its  creation,  where possible:  this  means  that  the  use  of  sustainable packaging in the transportation of manufacturing parts is favored over that of single-use packaging, particularly for  high-volume  parts  and  short  logistical  flows  (the economic  and  carbon  assessments  incorporating  the return  of  empty  packaging  are  not  favorable  for  low volumes transported over long distances).\n\nWhen the production of waste cannot be avoided, we seek to reduce the amount by separating the portion that is not waste  per  se.  There  are  several  solutions,  such  as dehydration  of  sludge  from  the  painting  process  and water treatment plants, separation of reusable oils from sludge  and  machining  chips,  etc.).  For  example,  the installation of a 3 rd evapo-concentrator at the Cl\u00e9on plant in  early  2020  made  it  possible  to  reduce  the  tonnage  of hazardous waste by around 10%;\n\n- \u25cf reuse spent  products,  production  offcuts  and  scrap:  in assembly plants, excess anti-corrosion protection waxes  are  recovered  after  application,  filtered  and returned  to  the  production  system.  Following  the implementation of regeneration of solvents used to rinse the  painting  robots  on  most  sites,  the  reuse  of  these regenerated solvents in the paint lines is now in place at the  Batilly,  Maubeuge,  Flins,  Sandouville  (France)  and Valladolid  (Spain)  sites.  In  Colombia,  the  Medellin  plant has  been  recycling  its  paint  solvents  internally  since 2014,  enabling  the  plant  to  eliminate  almost  all  solvent waste.  As  regards  powertrain  manufacturing  sites,  the Cl\u00e9on plant collects and regenerates used stamping and\n- 25 Environmental reporting scope described in appendix 2.6.1.3.\n- 26 See table at the beginning of chapter 2.3.2.2\n\nhydraulic oils from the Flins plant to use as a substitute for new oils. When they are in good condition, used wood pallets are reused within the Company or resold for the same purpose;\n\n- \u25cf recycle the  materials contained in the waste. This form of waste treatment can be applied to most recoverable materials  (cardboard,  plastic,  metal,  etc.).  In  this  way, metallic waste, which represents over 70% 25 of the total production  waste,  is  almost  100%  recycled.  Paper, cardboard  and  plastics  are  also  systematically  sorted for recycling. However,  beyond  these  'traditional' recyclable waste categories, some more complex types of waste that may initially appear of no value can also be recycled  through  incorporation  in  the  composition  of new  materials.  In  2022,  the  Group  exceeded  its  2023 target of reducing non-recycled waste per vehicle 26 . The resumption of production and the improved performance  of  several  high-impact  sites  led  to  this strong improvement.\n- \u25cf recover energetically:\n- \u25cf by using waste as an alternative fuel: as an example, the site at Flins, since 2017, has been sending part of its hazardous  waste  to  a  facility  for  the  preparation  of substitute solid fuel (SSF) supplied to cement works as an alternative to fuel oil for the combustion units;\n- \u25cf or  by  recovering  energy  from  its  incineration  to produce electricity or steam; this in turn can be used to replace natural gas for heating paint drying ovens, as is  the case at the Sandouville plant in France and the Busan plant in South Korea;\n- \u25cf dispose by  burning  waste  (without  energy  recovery)  in incineration facilities or burying it in landfills.  Renault is seeking to minimize the use of this waste management method.  Based  on  a  like-for-like  scope  of  operations, Renault  reduced  the  amount  of  manufacturing  waste sent to landfill (except demolition and foundry waste) by 75% from 2022 to 2023). Between 2013 and 2021, this rate was -67%.\n\nTo ensure consistency at a Group-wide level, Renault has drafted a waste table (a codified list of waste produced by sites). This makes it possible to standardize the approach to hazardous and non-hazardous waste internationally.",

Collect, sort, dismantle, direct\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCollection is an essential step in the recycling of end-oflife  products.  In  addition  to  its  regulatory  obligations, Renault has chosen to invest directly in the collection and processing  networks  for  ELVs  (end-of-life  vehicles)  in France (45% of the Group's European end-of-life vehicles are located here due to Renault's long-term establishment in the country) in order to retain economic and technical control of material flows.\n\nIn 2022, Renault created 'THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL,' which aims  to  bring  together  all  the  existing  expertise  of  the Group  and  its  partners  in  this  activity.  This  new  entity offers  short-loop  recycling  solutions  at  every  stage  of  a vehicle's life: supply of parts and  raw  materials, production, use, and end of life, with the ambition of taking recycling  into  a  new  era  and  becoming  the  European leader in the automotive circular economy.\n\nIn  concrete  terms,  THE  FUTURE  IS  NEUTRAL  relies  on  its subsidiary  Gaia,  whose  activities  in  battery  repair, collection  and  reuse  of  parts,  and  recycling  of  materials from end-of-life vehicles (ELV) are based in Flins, but also on INDRA and BOONE COMENOR, experts in the recycling of metal scraps from the industry.\n\nSince 2008, together with its key partner Suez, Renault has held  a  50%  stake  in  INDRA,  the  leading  ELV  processing company in France, which has a network of 380 approved ELV centers.\n\nINDRA  has  been  active  in  automotive  dismantling  for more than 30 years and is now fully aligned with this new era,  working  at  all  levels  of  automotive  dismantling through four complementary areas of activity:\n\n- \u25cf engineering:  INDRA  designs,  develops,  produces  and markets  innovative  tools,  equipment  and  processes (refined  and  tested  at  their  own  dismantling  site  in Romorantin)  that  deal  with  ELV  decontamination, dismantling and recycling. These tools and methods are intended  to  be  widely  disseminated  within  INDRA's network  of  ELV  Centers,  but  also  internationally  INDRA develops  and  delivers  training  programs  through  its AURECA  Training  Centre  created  in  2021  (nearly 1,000 people trained by 2022);\n- \u25cf management/distribution  of  ELV  for  manufacturers, insurers,  governments  and  even  individuals  through  its 380 authorized ELV centers (+7 between 2021 and 2022);\n- \u25cf dismantling/recycling in its own dismantling centers;\n- \u25cf sale of refurbished parts under warranty: Indra distributes  certified,  reusable  parts  dismantled  at  its sites through its network.\n\nAccording  to  data  available  at  the  date  of  publication, around  450,000  end-of-life  vehicles  were  processed  in 2022 by Indra's network of authorized ELV Centers or by its own dismantling sites, including more than 25,000 via the goodbye-car.com  website,  which  offers  a  'turnkey'  ELV collection service aimed at retail customers.\n\nRenault  Group's  investment  in  these  activities  through 'THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL' has four objectives:\n\n- \u25cf to  meet  Renault's  regulatory  requirements  concerning ELV collection and processing in France;\n- \u25cf to improve the technical and economic performance of the  network,  thereby  achieving  in  a  cost-efficient manner the European goal of 95% vehicle recycling and recovery rate, through the development  of  new dismantling tools and processes for ELVs, and supporting  and  training  its  automotive  dismantling network;\n- \u25cf to  feed  recycling  closed  loops  (see  the  'Recycling' paragraph below) in order to reduce dependence on and consumption of virgin raw materials;\n- \u25cf THE  FUTURE  IS  NEUTRAL  also  aims  to  become  a European  leader  in  short-loop  battery  recycling,  in  line with regulations, and  attractive to other vehicle manufacturers  through  the  operation  of  a  first-class industrial  process  in  terms  of  efficiency  and  purity  to ensure  the  required  level  of  recycled  content  in  their batteries  at  the  best  cost.  To  develop  Europe's  first short-loop battery recycling offer, the entity relies on the largest  fleet  of  electric  vehicles  and  high-content chemistry and capitalizes on INDRA's expanding network  to  help  with  battery  recycling  and  Gaia's expertise for their diagnostics.\n\n## 2.3.2.2.4. Reuse\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  subsidiary  Gaia  collects  unused  parts  in  the  sales network as well as at  the  plants  and  suppliers'  facilities, sorts  them  and,  depending  on  their  condition,  directs them to reuse, remanufacturing or, failing that, to the most appropriate recycling system.\n\nIn  France,  Renault  has  offered  used  body  parts  (including hoods, wings, headlamp units, etc.) collected and selected from Indra's network of dismantlers since 2012.\n\nTo  facilitate  access  to  refurbished  parts,  Indra  has  also developed the PRECIS system, in partnership with Sidexa. This was put into service in France in 2014 and enables a pooled inventory of premium quality refurbished parts for repairers  to  be  created,  supplied  by  the  Indra  network demolishers. When pricing the repairs to be carried out on vehicles,  repairers  are  automatically  informed  by  the PRECIS module of Sidexa's Pacte Office software (market leader  in  calculation  software)  of  the  existence  of refurbished  parts  available  in  the  pooled  inventory.  This reduces  the  cost  of  repair  while  maintaining  the  same level  of  guarantees.  This  offer  allows  the  restoration  of vehicles at a lower cost, including those for which repair would not have otherwise been economically viable using new parts alone, thus extending the vehicle life while very significantly reducing the environmental footprint associated with the repairs.\n\nThe deployment of PRECIS continued to progress, with all 140 dealers in the Indra network connected.

This  activity  still  has  significant  potential  for growth, given the continued low penetration of used parts in the repair market.\n\nLastly,  Renault  Group  also  gives  a  second  life  to  the batteries  of  its  electric  vehicles,  which  can  be  reused  at the end of their first life on the vehicle and before they are recycled: the subsidiary Mobilize develops and implements  with  its  partners  numerous  non-automotive energy storage applications (see section 2.4.1.1.A).\n\n## 2.3.2.2.5. Remanufacturing and reconditioning\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more than 70 years, Renault has been remanufacturing: the refurbishment of mechanical parts. Used parts are collected in the sales network, sorted and refurbished.  Between  1949  and  2022,  the  renovation  of engines  and  manual  gearboxes  was  carried  out  at  the Choisy-le-Roi (France) factory. In the first half of 2022, the Choisy-le-Roi factory's activities were integrated into the Flins Refactory.\n\nThis  activity  adheres  to  a  strict  industrial  process: involving complete dismantling, cleaning, sorting, refurbishment  and  replacement  of  faulty  or  worn  parts, reassembly and inspection. Parts that cannot be reused during  renovation  undergo  closed-loop  recycling  in Renault Group foundries.\n\nThese renovated 'Standard Exchange' parts are sold to Renault  and  Dacia  vehicle  owners  at  a  price  that  is,  on average,  30 %  lower  than  that  of  a  new  part,  while satisfying the same quality requirements. Far from being marginal,  the  standard  exchange  parts  offering  covers powertrain parts mechanical parts, and electronics and is regularly extended to cover new parts categories.\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nSustainable development\n\n## 2.3.2.2.6.

The  challenge  is  to  maintain  the technical  qualities  and  economic  value  of  materials during recycling.\n\nAt end-2022, the short-loop recycling networks set up by Renault included:\n\n- \u25cf recycling  of  copper:  the  wire  bought  back  from  the dismantlers of end-of-life vehicles by GAIA is processed to recover the copper. The copper is then resold either to the  Fonderie  de  Bretagne  (Renault  Group)  for  the production  of  pearlitic  cast  iron  or  to  auto  industry suppliers for aluminum processing. The copper recycled by  GAIA  is  of  a  high-quality,  enabling  it  to  meet demanding  technical  specifications  and  to  replace virgin or post-industrial material;\n- \u25cf recycling  of  polypropylene  (plastic  material):  GAIA collects  bumpers  from  dismantlers  and  garages  and ensures  that  they  are  processed  in  order  to  meet  the Renault-Nissan Alliance's technical specifications. Seven  grades  of  polypropylene  provided  by  this recycling  network  have  been  listed  with  the  Renault Materials  Panel,  of  which  three  are  used  for  mass production applications and four are currently awaiting approval for new vehicle projects;\n- \u25cf recycling  of  metallic  waste  from  manufacturing  (sheet metal,  shavings  from  machining).  Loops  between  Renault plants  or  between  Renault  plants  and  suppliers  of  metal parts have been set up in France, Spain and Brazil;\n- \u25cf recycling of platinum-group  metals.  Gaia  collects catalytic  converters  from  end-of-life  vehicles  from dismantlers,  from  which  it  extracts  the  platinum-group metals. These recycled metals are then sold to an auto industry  supplier  to  be  re-used  in  the  manufacturing  of catalytic converters.\n\nThese  closed  loops  contribute  to  the  achievement  of Renault's  objectives  for  the  use  of  recycled  materials  in new  vehicles.  The  collection  and  transportation  of materials during the recycling process are also optimized to  achieve  the  greatest  reduction  in  the  environmental footprint of the recycled materials.\n\nThe  Group  regularly  develops  new  ways  of  reusing materials  from  end-of-life  vehicles,  notably  through collaborative research projects bringing together manufacturers,  local  authorities,  public  players  and universities (see DECORE Project box below for example).\n\nI\n\n02",

Air quality\n\n## 2.3.2.3.1.1. Manufacturing\n\n## Volatile organic compounds (VOC)\n\nEmissions from volatile organic compounds are monitored, and an action plan to reduce them is in place. This plan involves:\n\n- \u25cf disseminating  the  Group's  best  practices  on  the reduction in the consumption of solvent paint products and the associated emissions, led by the Group's Paint Engineering Department;\n- \u25cf implementing  or  replacing  VOC-processing  incineration facilities where necessary.\n\nIn  2022,  the  continuation  of  the  electronic  components crisis  weighed  on  the  VOC  indicator,  with  a  negative effect  due  to  two  main  causes:  the  non-proportionality between  the  drop  in  production  volumes  and  solvent consumption  and  the  successive  shutdowns/restarts requiring  the  use  of  solvents  for  cleaning  and  purging facilities. Despite this deterioration in production conditions,  the  reduction  actions  made  it  possible  to achieve  the  expected  target.  The  actions  to  reduce  VOC emissions in the Group's plants during 2022 included:\n\n- \u25cf installation  of  robotic  equipment  for  certain  bodywork paint  and  coating  tasks,  which  enables  much  finer optimization of the quantities of products used;\n- \u25cf introduction  of  indicators  at  certain  sites  to  optimize sealant  and  paint  consumption  and  therefore  reduce emissions  at  source  (continuation  of  the  deployment initiated in 2021, with, for example, the optimization of the paint application rate in Cordoba);\n- \u25cf perpetuation  of  actions  undertaken  to  improve  the recovery  rate  of  used  solvents  (cleaning  and  purging solvents)  at  all  sites  (e.g.  installation  of  manual  purge boxes at the Busan site this year).\n\nAll  of  these  actions  made  it  possible  to  achieve  a  Group emission level of 31.84 g/m\u00b2 (for a target of 32 g/m\u00b2). At end2022, more than 80% of vehicles produced were painted with water-soluble base (i.e. the solvent in the paint mainly consists of water) 27 .\n\n## Renault Group VOC emissions (\u221a)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope: all body assembly and mixed Renault Group manufacturing sites (reporting scope described in appendix 2.6.1.3). The emissions measured are those of the vehicle body paint workshops (excluding paint for parts such as bumpers made of plastic materials and accessories).\n\n(\u221a) Indicators audited by the independent third party at a reasonable level of assurance for the 2022 financial year.\n\n## SO2 and NOx emissions from combustion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring the 2000s, Renault Group completed a large-scale program to replace fuel oil with natural gas in the thermal power  stations  of  its  sites  to  cut  emissions  of  sulfur dioxide  (SO2),  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx)  and  carbon  dioxide (CO2).  In  addition,  from  the  2010s  onwards,  investments were also made to replace the high-power boilers at the sites  with  decentralized  low-power  boilers,  close  to  the production facilities, thereby optimizing the power output and  limiting  heat  losses  in  the  networks.  Currently,  the main focus is on the modernization of gas boilers and the installation  of  low  NOx-emissions  burners.  SO2  emissions decreased from 36 metric tons in 2010 to 4.1 metric tons in 2022.  NOx  emissions  decreased  from  597  metric  tons  in 2010 to 333.8 metric tons in 2022. 28\n\nI",

Vehicle use\n\n## Reduction of pollutant emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll vehicles  sold  by  Renault  Group  worldwide  have received appropriate approval from the relevant authorities in accordance with all regulations in force.\n\nFollowing  the  widespread  deployment  of  particulate filters  for  diesel  vehicles,  as  imposed  by  the  Euro  5 standard,  the  Euro  6x  standards  lowered  the  authorized particulate emissions levels for all engines while reducing by more than half, compared with Euro 5, the authorized limits of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions during laboratory testing for the approval of diesel vehicles (from 180 to 80 mg/km for diesel), bringing them closer to those allowed  for  petrol  vehicles  (60  mg/km).  (see  appendix 2.6.1.7 for details of thresholds for the various standards)\n\nSuch a reduction was made possible by the implementation of post-treatment systems such as NOx traps or SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction). The NOx trap is  a  chemical  system  that  traps  nitrogen  oxides  to  allow them to be reduced to neutral gases. It has been fitted to certain  diesel  passenger  cars  sold  by  Renault  Group  in Europe  since  September  2015.  The  SCR  (Selective Catalytic Reduction) technology works to reduce nitrogen oxides into water and nitrogen by injecting urea.\n\nAt the  same  time,  the  identification  of  significant differences between emissions measured in real use and in the laboratory or approval led the European Commission to define a real-use test protocol, introduced with  the  Euro  6d-temp  standard  (RDE,  Real  Driving Emissions  protocol).  Without  waiting  for  these  new standards, Renault Group had, starting in July 2015, studied the implementation of improvements on all of its Euro 6b diesel  production  aiming  to  further  limit  emissions  in customer use. These improvements were gradually rolled out from August 2016 on the diesel vehicles in the range.\n\nThe roll-out of Euro 6 standards is a major step forward in the reduction  of  pollutant  emissions  from  internal combustion  engine  vehicles.  As  mentioned  above,  these standards have introduced measurements under real and variable driving conditions (RDE protocol) of the emissions  of  pollutants  such  as  nitrogen  oxides  or particles  in  addition  to  the  measurements  made  in  the laboratory  based  on  the  standardized  test  cycle.  By nature,  these  cannot  cover  the  very  wide  variety  of customer usage: driving  and  weather  conditions,  driving style,  vehicle  load,  etc.  This  is  why  Renault,  for  several years,  has  supported  the  European  approach  aiming  at implementing measurements under real driving conditions (RDE protocol) in addition to implementing the\n\nnew WLTP laboratory test procedure, more representative of  average  customer  use  and  the  diversity  of  vehicle equipment than the NEDC cycle.\n\nThe  adaptation  of  Renault  Group  vehicles  to  these  new standards required an ambitious program of investments and development.\n\nThe  Euro  6d  temp  phase  has  been  applicable  since September  2017  for  new  models  (new  types)  and  since September  2019  for  all  new  vehicles  (all  types)  (see Appendix 2.6.1.7). The European Commission simultaneously  introduced  the  new  laboratory  test procedure,  WLTP,  which  has  been  applicable  since September  2017  for  new  models  and  since  September 2018 for all new vehicles.\n\nThe final Euro 6d stage came into force between January 2020  (new  types)  and  January  2021  (all  types)  for passenger  vehicles  and  in  January  2022  for  commercial vehicles.\n\nIn order to meet Euro 6d temp and Euro6 d final standards, SCR  technology,  which  Renault  has  used  on  its  TRAFIC and  MASTER  commercial  vehicles  since  the  Euro  6b standards,  has  been  fitted  to  the  entire  range  of  diesel passenger  cars  in  Europe.  This  SCR  technology,  more constraining in use, with the installation on the vehicle of a urea tank to be refilled regularly, can nevertheless reduce nitrogen  oxides  with  increased  effectiveness  over  an extended  engine  operating  range.  For  the  final  Euro6d stage, the diesel emission treatment  system  was enhanced  with  a  second  SCR  system  to  improve  NOx treatment  efficiency  even  more  across  all  engine operating ranges.\n\nFor  the  petrol  engines  in  the  range,  the  tri-functional catalysis  system  simultaneously  treats  the  oxidation  of unburnt  hydrocarbons  (HC)  and  carbon  monoxide  (CO) and the reduction of nitrogen oxides. The various stages of Eurox standards have been achieved by improving the engine  settings  and  the  load  of  precious  metals  in catalysts.  From  the  Euro  6d-temp  stage  onwards,  direct fuel injection engines have been fitted with a particulate filter. As with diesel, this filter allows a drastic reduction in the  number  of  particles  emitted  by  vehicles.  With  the Euro6D final stage, all petrol engines have been fitted with a particulate filter.\n\nIn other markets, Renault adapts the technical definitions of its powertrains to fit local specifics (fuel quality, climate, dust,  etc.)  in  such  a  way  as  to  ensure  each  vehicle's compliance with applicable regulations in the country in which it is sold. In addition to strict regulatory compliance, the Group capitalizes on lessons learned in Europe to fulfill the  growing  expectations  throughout  the  world,  that pollutant emissions during customer use are better taken into account and controlled.",

Once  they reach a significant proportion of all vehicles on the road, they  will  contribute  to  improving  air  quality  in  urban\n\nSCR: Selective Catalytic Reduction\n\nPC: Passenger Car\n\nLCV: Light Commercial Vehicle\n\nWLTP: Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure\n\nareas 29 because  they  do  not  generate  emissions  during use.  The  Renault  brand  plans  to  electrify  100%  of  new vehicle  models  by  2025.  The  action  plan  to  achieve  this ambition is detailed in part 2.3.2.1.2.\n\n## Cabin air quality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir in the cabin is a complex blend of air drawn from outside the vehicle, which supplies the heating and air conditioning systems,  and  emissions  from  materials  within  the  cabin. Renault Group takes these two components into consideration when designing its vehicles in order to control their  impact on the quality of cabin air and to maintain the health and comfort of passengers.\n\n## Treatment of external air drawn into the cabin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen driving, the main influence on the quality of cabin air is  that  of  external  air,  given  the  fast  air  renewal  flow required  for  passenger  comfort  (200  m 3 /h  on  average). Therefore,  as  soon  as  it  designs  its  vehicles,  Renault ensures  that  the  architecture  enables  an  air  treatment system to be fitted. Two types of technical solutions are implemented:\n\n- 1. cabin particle filter (also known as a pollen filter): made of non-woven  fibers,  it  is  designed  to  trap  the  smallest particles,  with  an  effectiveness  of  over  85%  efficiency from 2.5 \u03bc m in diameter and 95% for particles above 10 \u03bc m;\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n02",

In  addition  to  particles,  the  activated  charcoal  traps gases,  including  aromatic  compounds  and  nitrogen dioxide.  These  filters  are  sized  to  trap  an  average  of more  than  85%  of  these  compounds  on  the  Renault vehicles on which they are fitted.\n\nThe  technical  solutions  applied  to  each  vehicle  are  the result of a compromise between a number of requirements (treatment efficiency, defogging, noise and energy  consumption),  and  vary  according  to  range  and equipment level. All passenger cars worldwide sold under the  Renault,  Dacia,  Alpine  and  Renault  Samsung  Motors brands  are  fitted  with  a  cabin  particulate  filter  as standard.  Most  of  the  latest  passenger  car  models marketed  under  the  Renault  brand  in  Europe  come  with combination filters as standard on all versions.\n\nHowever, any Renault, Dacia or Renault Samsung Motors customer  whose  vehicle  is  not  initially  fitted  with  a technical  air  treatment  solution  from  the  outset  and requiring  such  a  solution  will  be  able  to  obtain  this equipment through additional Renault after-sales service.\n\n## Emissions from materials within the cabin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen  the  vehicle  is  stationary  and  exposed  to  sunlight, the  presence  of  volatile  chemical  substance  emissions from  materials  in  the  cabin  may  become  overbearing when compared with the quality of the air outside. Renault has  therefore  set  itself  the  objective  of  managing  these emissions in order to minimize their impact on passenger health and comfort.\n\nThus,  since  2009,  all  materials  within  all  internal  vehicle parts  (cabin  and  trunk)  whose  total  weight  within  the vehicle  is  over  100  g  have  been  subject  to  specifications deployed to all relevant suppliers, in an effort to manage emissions  levels  from  the  main  categories  of  volatile organic compounds.\n\nRenault also ensures that any odors caused by the main contributors to the vehicle's atmosphere are limited. This is  assessed  by  a  panel  of  experts  who  are  specifically trained  in  Renault's  own  methods,  based  on  olfactory descriptors and an understanding of odor levels as set out by  the  methods  of  IAP-Sentic \u00ae , a consultancy  firm specializing  in  odors  (and  a  subsidiary  of  the  Burgeap group).\n\n## 2.3.2.3.2. Substance risk management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis  year,  Renault  Group  achieved  its  objective  of reducing  the  number  of  hazardous  chemicals 30 used  on Group sites by 20% over six years (2016-2022) (and by 68% between 2010 and 2022). The Group has therefore set itself a new target: a 50% reduction between 2021 31 and 2030.\n\nProtecting the health of workers and consumers as well as ecosystems  led  legislators  to  impose  restrictions  on  the use  of  hazardous  substances  in  the  workplace  and  in products.  Starting  in  2003,  the  European  automotive industry has largely eliminated the use of heavy metals as a result of the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive (2000/53/EC). In the European Union, the introduction of the Registration,  Evaluation,  Authorization  and  Restriction  of Chemicals (REACH 1907/2006) regulation in 2007 heightened  awareness  of  chemical  risks  and  prompted an  increase  in  the  number  of  restrictions  and  utilization precautions. Many countries around the world follow the EU  with  similar  regulations.  Efforts  to  improve  the protection of human health and the environment are also being promoted at the global level by the United Nations, in particular in connection with the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) and the International  Panel  on  Chemical  Pollution  (IPCP).  Other regulations that are less relevant to the automotive sector are  also  emerging,  for  example  in  relation  to  biocides  or cosmetics.\n\nRenault  Group  has  an  organization  dedicated  to  the management  of  dangerous  substances,  capable  of taking into account regulations on substances as well as proactive anticipation policies. The three divisions devoted to this activity support the roll-out of initiatives in Renault Group's day-to-day processes:\n\n- \u25cf in  collaboration  with  the  departments  responsible  for occupational health and working conditions, the Industrial Hygiene and Chemical Risks Division manages  workers'  exposure  to  chemical  risks  at  all Renault  Group  production,  engineering  and  logistics sites around the world. It monitors the chemicals present in  the  formulations  delivered  to  Renault  Group  and verifies  the  classification  and  labeling  of  the  chemical products used on site and also ensures compliance with the Product Safety Data Sheets provided by suppliers. It provides  an  initial  assessment  of  the  chemical  risk  in accordance  with  generic  use  conditions.  In  addition,  it alerts and coordinates the engineering centers and the sites  if  products  containing  priority  risk  substances  are used  so  that  they  can  look  for  technical  solutions  to eliminate them. Finally, it carries out monitoring work on chemicals within the environment through the collection of samples and the analysis of the pollutants present at workstations.  This  expert  division  was  created  in the 1960s;\n\n- 31 February 2021",

It  monitors  substances contained in vehicles based on information declared by suppliers  using  the  IMDS  (International  Material  Data System) system, shared with 35 international carmakers. It  enables  Renault  Group  to  meet  the  information  and transparency obligations under regulations (REACH, the European  directive  on  waste,  and  now  the  financial directives). It steers the search for alternative technical solutions enabling  the  elimination  of  priority risk substances  by  relying  on  relays  within  each  branch  of engineering (vehicle, mechanics, after-sales), and reinforces  this  approach  with  its  counterparts  both within and outside the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance. It defines and steers compliance actions in the concerned entities, anticipates default risks upstream of the  supply  chains  and  designs  ways  to  transform regulatory  constraints  into  economic  and  competitive opportunities;\n- \u25cf the After-sales Regulatory Compliance Division checks with suppliers that parts, accessories and  other products sold by after-sale teams comply with applicable  regulations  and  make  any  substitutions,  if required.\n\nAs part of a preventive and pre-emptive approach, since the 1960s, Renault Group has been replacing substances identified  as  toxic  and  hazardous  to  the  environment found  in  the  chemicals  used  at  its  plants  and,  since  the early  2000s,  those  found  in  materials  used.  Renault  has drawn up two lists of substances prioritized for replacement, for chemicals and materials respectively, which comprise, in particular,  CMR  (carcinogenic,  mutagenic  and  reprotoxic) substances, substances of very high concern and subject to prior authorization (appendix XIV of the REACH regulations), as  well  as  substances  whose  use  is  not  yet  restricted,  but which  Renault  Group  would  like  to  see  banned  at  a  global level.\n\nThese  two  lists  are  respectively  described  in  two separate standards: Renault Group's standard 00-10-050 'Substances' for chemical products and standard RNESB-0027  common  to  Renault  and  Nissan  for  automotive parts. These  standards  ban  the  use  of  hazardous substances  and  substances  of  concern,  list  substances for which substitution is a priority, and require suppliers to declare the substances used in their parts and preparations. In calls for tenders, Renault Group explicitly asks  suppliers  to  comply  with  these  standards.  Their application  is  enforced  by  each  of  the  three  competent divisions.\n\nIn  line  with  regulations,  Renault  adheres  to  a  policy  of transparency toward its professional and private customers.\n\nIn addition  to  standard  substances  and  those  with identified risks, Renault Group pays close attention to the potential  health  effects  of  innovative  materials,  such  as nanomaterials.\n\nInformation about\n\nthe company,\n\nthe capital and\n\nthe share ownership\n\nFinancial statements\n\n## 2.3.2.3.3. Noise\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Sustainable development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNoise is a complex subject that involves a wide range of factors  such  as  type  and  power  of  noise  sources  by octave band, directivity, the impact of buildings, topography of locations, weather, etc. For the comfort of residents living near its production facilities, Renault takes noise  measurements  at  the  property  line  that  exceed regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Group makes active efforts to limit and reduce noise pollution from its activities by working to control 'noise' at existing and new facilities, right from the project phases, regardless of whether they are linked to a new vehicle or a new  building.  The  Group  aims  to  do  this  by  conducting extensive studies on the impact of noise (3D  modeling),  by  selecting  high-performance  materials with this goal in mind, and by implementing soundproofing measures. These measures are focused on all types of extraction chimneys, boilers, metal drops and logistics-related activities, which generally constitute the main sources of external noise across our industrial sites.\n\n## Vehicle use\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll  vehicles  marketed  by  Renault  in  Europe  in  2022  have road noise emissions of 72 dB(A) or less 32 ,  in  accordance with  European  regulation  540/2014/EC.  The  vast  majority also comply with the 70 dB(A) by the second phase of this regulation,  applicable  to  all  vehicles  produced  since  July 2022. The Group is already preparing for the third phase, which will lower the permissible level for most passenger cars  to  68  dB(A)  in  July  2024.  This  includes  work  on improving  tire  noise,  engine  acoustic  radiation  and insulation and exhaust system attenuation.\n\nWith  a  certified  noise  level  well  below  68  dB(A)  Renault electric  vehicles  already  meet  the  limits  applicable starting  in  July  2024  nearly  two  years  in  advance,  thus contributing  to  the  reduction  of  ambient  noise  and  the quality  of  life  in  urban  areas.  In  addition,  they  produce  a net  improvement  in  users'  comfort:  the  noise  inside  an electric vehicle is approximately 10 dB lower than that of an internal combustion engine vehicle.\n\nAt  the  international  level,  the  regulations  concerning vehicle noise are most  often  based  on  European regulations,  possibly  adopted  a  few  years  later.  The vehicles  marketed  by  Renault  Group  outside  Europe, which  have  noise  levels  comparable  to  their  European versions,  therefore  often  anticipate  locally  applicable regulations by several years.\n\nI\n\n02",

Biodiversity EFPD13\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe 2019 IPBES 33 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity  and  Ecosystem  Services  warned  of  an unprecedented and increasing rate of species extinction. This report identified and ranked the five direct drivers of change in nature with the largest relative global impacts: (1)  changes  in  land  and  sea  use;  (2)  direct  exploitation  of natural  resources;  (3)  climate  change;  (4)  pollution  and (5) invasive alien species.\n\n## Study of dependencies and impacts\n\nBased  on  the  method  of  a  specialized  consulting  firm, Renault Group conducted an analysis of the dependencies and impacts of its activities on biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nDependencies: Renault Group identified dependencies of its  activities  on  ecosystem  services  throughout  its  value chain. The main ecosystem services needed for Renault's business model are the following:\n\n- \u25cf water,  mineral  and  biotic  and  abiotic  energy  supply services;\n- \u25cf climate regulation, water and waste treatment services;\n- \u25cf cultural services.\n\nImpacts: Through its own activities, its value chain and the use  of  its  products,  Renault  Group  contributes,  to  a greater  or  lesser  extent,  to  the  5  pressures  on  global biodiversity identified by the IPBES.\n\nIn addition to this first study, in order to better understand the  impact  of  its  own  activities  on  biodiversity  and ecosystems, the Group set in 2021 the target of having 20 preliminary biodiversity assessments conducted by 2023. These analyses will be entrusted to specialized consulting firms.  As  of  the  end  of  2022,  this  target  was  exceeded:  a total of 21 preliminary assessments had been conducted at the sites with the greatest perceived stakes (prioritization of sites located close to natural sites and/or with  a  large  proportion  of  natural  surface  within  its  land area). This work highlighted the ecological sensitivities of each site and identified actions to encourage biodiversity at our sites.\n\nOf  these  21  preliminary  assessments,  5  highlighted important  issues,  including  the  presence  of  protected species such as the amphibian vole, the marsh epipactis and the brown howler monkey.\n\n## Commitments and actions\n\nRenault  Group  joined  the  act4nature  initiative  in  2018  to contribute to the protection, enhancement and restoration of biodiversity. The Group is thus committed to avoiding,  reducing  and  offsetting  its  impacts,  aiming  for no net loss or a net gain of biodiversity.\n\nIn 2021, Renault  Group  prepared  a  positive  initial assessment of the progress of its initiatives and stepped up  its  actions  in  favor  of  biodiversity.  These  new  public commitments are S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Additional, Realistic and Time-bound) and are recognized by  the  act4nature  steering  committee  of  companies, business  networks,  environmental  NGOs  and  scientific bodies.",

For example, in 2022, as part of a project to extend  the  car  park  at  the  Maubeuge  site  (France),  a characterization and  delimitation  of wetlands  was launched  to  assess  the  feasibility of the project. Biodiversity  issues  are  therefore  taken  into  account  in projects,  and  the  Group  has  integrated  biodiversity protection  into  its  internal  environmental  guidelines applicable to all sites, regardless of local regulations.\n\nAt the Curitiba site in Brazil, Renault devotes 37% of its space (2.5 million m 2 ) to protecting a primary forest area. This virgin forest, made up mainly of araucaria trees, a species of pine threatened  with  extinction  and  protected  under  Brazilian law, is home to more than 170 species of animal.\n\nRegarding  the  industrial  and  tertiary  sites,  the  HSEE Department produced guides containing actions that can be  deployed  at  all  the  sites  to  protect  biodiversity.  They are based on lessons learned from preliminary assessments. Roll-out is underway.\n\nIn 2022, 15 of the Biodiversity project pilots completed the 'Fresque de la biodiversit\u00e9' training.\n\n## Outside our own operations:\n\n- \u25cf Natural rubber: Since 2019, Renault has been a member of  the Global  Platform  for  Sustainable  Natural  Rubber (GPSNR), an initiative aiming to improve the environmental and socioeconomic performance of the natural rubber sector , which notably includes actions to fight against deforestation. In 2022, Renault Group:\n- \u25cf published  its  Sustainable  Natural  Rubber  Policy,  a  set  of commitments aligned with the objectives of the GPSNR;\n- \u25cf gained a seat on the platform's executive committee;\n- \u25cf finances, alongside Michelin, an 'Agroforestry Capacity Building Thailand' project. This field project aims  to  engage,  by  2025,  1,000  smallholder  farmers producing  natural  rubber  in  southern  Thailand.  The objective  is  to  reduce  the  environmental  impacts  of plantations while increasing the economic resilience of farmers, notably improving their food security.\n- \u25cf Biobased materials: In 2022, Renault Group has adopted a  Biobased  Materials  Strategy  to  ensure  that  the expected gains  in  terms  of  carbon  footprint  reduction do  not  lead  to  undesirable  effects  on  humans  and ecosystems, such as competition with food, deforestation, loss of marine and terrestrial biodiversity, and pollution. We  require potential suppliers to demonstrate that risks  have  been  identified,  assessed and  controlled.  Each  proposed  material  must  now  be approved by a dedicated internal committee.\n- \u25cf Strategic ores: In 2022, Renault Group joined a group of NGOs,  scientists,  and  companies  calling  for  a global moratorium on deep-sea mining until  it  is  scientifically proven  that  it  can  be  done  in  a  sustainable  way. The oceans and  their  ecosystems  play  a  crucial role  both  in  climate  regulation  and  in  generating livelihoods for women and men, (Details: https://www.noseabedmining.org/).\n- \u25cf Occasional tree-planting  actions.  For  example,  in  2022 in  Spain,  the  Renault  Foundation collaborated with the Natural  Heritage  of  the  Castilla  y  Le\u00f3n  Region  to organize the planting of more than 2,000 trees near the Valladolid  factory.  The  factory's  employees  and  their families (about 200 people) took part in this reforestation.  This  action  will  help  to  improve  the region's  plant  biodiversity  and  thus  strengthen  the existing  animal  species.  In  Colombia,  efforts  are  being made to reforest the Salto de Tequendam forests. The 'El  Granja  El  Porvenir'  project  entrusts  this  task  to women  from  the  communities  around  the  sites.  By creating  a  new  source  of  income,  the  project  helps  to build  the  economic  resilience  of  the  participants  and enables them to acquire new skills while contributing to a local environmental issue.\n\nI",

Renault's continuous efforts to prevent and mitigate the environmental impact of its activities  and  products  help to combat ecosystem depletion in this way.\n\n## 2.3.2.4.2. Water consumption and quality EFPD8a EFPD11a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPreserving  water  resources  is  an  ongoing  concern  for Renault, both to ensure long-term supply and to reduce its impact on ecosystems. For this reason, the Group has set a  goal  of  minimizing  the  impact  of  its  activities  on  this precious  resource  through  the  implementation  of  the following five objectives:\n\n- \u25cf reduce water  consumption  at  source  as  well  as  the quantities of wastewater through well-designed processes  and  optimized  management.  For  example,  in vehicle  surface  treatment,  which  is  one  of  the  major causes of water consumption in an automotive plant, the principle of reverse-cascade rinsing of baths and stopping the  rinse  water  flow  between  each  body  (which  limits contamination  from  one  bath  to  the  next  by  carryover) enable a reduction at the source of the quantities of water used as well as the waste to be treated;\n- \u25cf reuse water where possible for the same use: cooling in a closed circuit, increasing the lifespan of baths (to reduce the draining frequency), etc.;\n- \u25cf recycle water for other compatible uses, with or without additional  treatment.  For  example,  the  Sofasa  plant (Colombia)  recycles  saline  concentrates  from  reverse osmosis  water  to  the  flushing  of  toilets  and  the  water curtains (air cleaners) of paint pits, which facilitates the reduction of the quantity of water consumed as well as that of waste discharged;\n- \u25cf minimize the impact of residual waste on the environment  through  efficient  and  strictly  controlled treatment processes;\n- \u25cf control the risk of  accidental  pollution  of  surface  water by  installing  the  means  needed  to  confine  water  from accidental spillages and that used for firefighting. Since late  2015,  the  Tangier  plant,  designed  not  to  discharge any  industrial  waste,  has  accordingly  had  a  basin  that enables it to confine any accidental pollution and avoid\n\nits discharge into the environment and to treat rainwater drained on the site by decantation.\n\n## Reducing industrial effluents\n\nAmong measures used to meet its objectives of reducing water abstraction and the discharge of pollutants into the environment, Renault places a particularly strong emphasis  on  the  recycling  of  industrial  effluents:  the wastewater  generated  by  the  manufacturing  process  is treated  in  a  manner  that  allows  this  same  water  to  be transformed  into  a  resource  of  sufficient  quality  to  be re-used in the same process.\n\nIn the powertrain plants,  the  recycling  of  industrial effluents consists in separating the distillate that can then be  reintroduced  into  the  process,  from  the  concentrate (loaded  with  oil)  that  will  be  directed  to  the  appropriate waste treatment channel.\n\nIn  the body assembly plants,  the  recycling  technology  is more complex because the water used in the manufacturing process (surface treatment and electrocoating) must be of very high quality. The treated waste  is  subjected  to  a  reverse  osmosis  process (a  membrane-based  water  demineralization  process), then an evapo-concentration process (high concentration of effluent through different evaporation stages), allowing  most  of  the  water  to  be  reused  in  industrial processes  and  minimizing  the  quantities  of  waste generated.\n\nThe Tangier body assembly plant in Morocco is equipped with  the  most  advanced  technologies  available  for recycling  wastewater  from  the  manufacturing  process. Following  the  additional  investments  made  in  2015  to increase  the  volume  of  industrial  effluents  recycled  and thus keep pace with the increase in the site's production rate,  the  volume  of  water  saved  amounted  to  nearly 280,000  m 3 per  year  on  average.  The  Tangier  site  is  the plant with the lowest external water supply ratio (at 1.5 m 3 per  vehicle  produced  in  2020)  in  accordance  with  the target assigned when it was founded.\n\nAnother lever that has been implemented in the bodywork factories is the modification of vehicle surface treatments  in  the  paint  departments.  It  consists  of replacing  the  products  used  with  products  containing fewer  toxic  metals  (removal  of  nickel).  This  change  has environmental benefits: reduction of Nickel flows discharged  outside  our  sites  and  reduction  of  water consumption in the surface treatment process.\n\nSince  2021,  two  factories  have  already  implemented  this change, and a third is planned for 2023.",

The frequent, and sometimes prolonged,  breaks  in  production  activity  once  again impacted  the  operation  of  industrial  processes  (such  as surface  treatment  and  cataphoresis  lines),  generating  a large  number  of  treatment  bath  emptyings,  as  well  as more frequent cleaning/disinfection of sensitive equipment  (air  cooling  towers,  domestic  hot  water circuits) from a health risk point of view (legionella). With a still significant \"heel\" effect due to the overcapacity of the Group's  industrial  sites  compared  with  the  volumes produced in 2022, the external water supply indicator per vehicle produced remains at a high level at 4.7 m 3 /vehicle.\n\nFor the second year, the discharges of toxic metals from the  Group's  industrial  activity  are  monitored  by  the indicator  summing  the  quantities  of  Zinc  and  Nickel reported to the vehicle produced. These two substances are  the  main  metals  emitted  during  surface  treatment activities aimed  at  the  anti-corrosion  treatment  of vehicles. On  all industrial vehicle production  sites, physicochemical treatment methods are implemented in order  to  reduce  the  quantities  of  metals  released.  The purification performance  of  these  water  treatment facilities  is  regularly  monitored.  The  change  in  process mentioned above (modification of the surface treatment) will also contribute to reducing nickel emissions at source.\n\n## Breakdown of water supplies by source\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfrom external network\n\nScope: all manufacturing plants and the main Renault Group tertiary, logistics and engineering sites, excluding establishments in the RRG commercial network (reporting scope described in appendix 2.6.1.3).\n\n## External water supply (\u221a)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(\u221a) Indicators verified by the independent third-party organization at a reasonable level of assurance over fiscal year 2022.\n\nExternal\n\nwater\n\nsupply\n\nincludes\n\ndrinking\n\nwater,\n\nindustrial\n\nwater,\n\ngroundwater,\n\nsurface\n\nwater\n\nand\n\nrainwater\n\nnetworks.\n\nI\n\n02",

This  policy  is  applied  to  all  Group  facilities  presenting  a potential pollution risk, i.e. operational industrial facilities, former industrial facilities converted to other uses, as well as  the  Renault  Retail  Group  (RRG)  commercial  network. Renault  aims  to  maintain  in-house  skills  in  prevention  of soil pollution and remediation.\n\nIn  2022,  the  manufacturing  sites,  as  well  as  the  main engineering,  logistics  and  head  office  sites  of  Renault Group 34 represented  a  total  area  of  3,848  hectares,  of which  48.8%  are  impervious  areas  such  as  buildings, parking lots, roads and paths. Total surface area and the proportion  of  impervious  surfaces  did  not  change significantly from the previous year, at constant scope.\n\n## Prevention\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  prevention  policy  at industrial  sites is based  on  three  key  tools.  A  risk-rating  grid  is used to assess the level of pollution prevention and  reinforce  it  if  necessary  by  prioritizing required rehabilitation work.\n\nIn the  case  of  new  production  facilities,  the  soil prevention  guide  describes  the  best  techniques  to implement in each type of facility. Both of these tools are in  use  across  all  Renault  industrial  sites  worldwide.  The prevention  policy  ultimately  relies  on  monitoring  of  the quality of groundwater. This monitoring, which is carried out  systematically  when  regulations  so  require  (all industrial sites in France), is also carried out voluntarily by Renault when  potential sources of pollution are identified,  to  spot  any  movement  of  pollutants  to sensitive  areas  and  to  take  appropriate  measures  as early as possible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor several years, all sites in the RRG commercial network (France and Europe) have been equipped with pollution prevention tools, and oil and fuel are now stored above ground or in  double-wall  tanks  fitted  with  alarms  and retention tanks.\n\n## Remediation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  management  of  past  subsoil  pollution hinges  on  a  risk  assessment  based  on  the source-vector-target  concept  and  aims  to ensure  the  suitability  of  the  subsoil  for  the planned or identified uses.\n\nThere  are  several  stages  to  the  pollution  management system:\n\n- \u25cf a historic and documentary study, including an analysis of the site's vulnerability, was conducted for operational industrial sites, former industrial sites converted to other uses and the RRG commercial network.

Carmakers  alone  cannot redefine  and  shape  tomorrow's  mobility.  This  is  why Renault Group works closely with various players who also take  on  the  subject:  local  and  regional  authorities,  startups, companies, universities, etc.\n\nObjective:  to  offer  solutions  tailored  to  each  individual's needs.\n\n## 2.4.1.1. A 'Made in Renault' and ecosystem innovation for sustainable mobility EFPD14a\n\nRenault Group has been committed to the development of large-scale  electric  mobility  for  more  than  10  years.  A pioneer in Europe, it announced the launch of a complete range  of  four  affordable  100%  electric  vehicles  in  2009. Promise kept from 2011. Since then, it has been renewing and  expanding  its  offering  with  electrified  models whether hybrids, plug-in hybrids or 100% electric. All new models launched in 2022 are either electrically powered or equipped with an electrified (hybrid) engine.\n\nThe Group's objective is simple: to make electric mobility accessible to all by meeting everyone's needs.\n\nElectric mobility is the best immediately  available response to accelerate the energy transition, fight against climate change and improve air quality in cities.\n\n## A. More than 10 billion 'e-kilometers' already traveled\n\nRenault  and  electric  vehicles  represent  more  than  10 years of unparalleled experience and expertise, validated by  more  than  10  billion  'e-kilometers'  already  covered. Renault Group, EV pioneer, currently stands as one of the market leaders in Europe. Today, it is a revolution that is picking  up  pace.  Renault  is  ready  to  take  part,  not  only because of its experience in this field, but also as a 'longestablished  vehicle  manufacturer.'  Its  know-how  in  the design and start of sales of vehicles, the experience and density of its network to market with the best advice and to  maintain  and  repair  these  vehicles,  combined  with  its electrical know-how is a unique blend of the past and the future  that  allows  us  to  support  this  acceleration  with confidence.\n\nThe  Renault  brand  thus  offers  a  complete  range  of electric  vehicles.  Renault  offers  four  passenger  cars  in Europe  with  E-Tech  Electric  technology:  Twingo,  Zoe, Kangoo and Megane. Driving New Megane E-Tech Electric means  benefiting  from  a  reinvented  experience  where, thanks  to  an  agile  platform  dedicated  solely  to  electric power  (the  Alliance's  CMF-EV  platform),  a  dynamic powertrain (new powertrain offering up to 160 kW of power and 300 Nm of torque). Driving pleasure is omnipresent,  in  perfect  alchemy  with  comfort.  Without compromising  safety,  range  (up  to  470  km  range according to the WLTP standard) and charging performance  thanks  to  innovative  solutions  applied  to both  the  40  and  60  kWh  battery  packs.  Renault  Megane E-Tech  Electric  has  had  a  promising  commercial  start, with  more  than  40,000  orders  already  placed  since  its launch,  75%  of  which  are  for  premium  versions  and  85% for the most powerful engine. The Renault brand's range of electric vehicles will be strengthened in the B segment. The  Renault  5  Prototype  is  a  forerunner  of  a  B-segment saloon,  which  will  be  launched  in  2024.  4EVER  trophy, revealed at the 2022 Paris Motor Show, is a forerunner of the B-segment SUV, planned for 2025. These two vehicles will  be  based  on  the  unprecedented  CMF-BEV  platform and will enable Renault Group to offer affordable electric vehicles.\n\nIn  terms  of  commercial  vehicles,  Renault  also  offers  a wide  range  with  the  Kangoo  van  and  the  Trafic  and Master vans.\n\nIn  line  with  its  ambitions  to  achieve  a  mix  of  more  than 65% electrified vehicles in the sales mix by 2025, Renault is\n\nI",

The  E-Tech  range  (electric  and  hybrid)  now represents  39%  of  Renault  passenger  vehicle  sales  in Europe in 2022, while the market average is around 31%\n\nLaunched in spring 2021, Dacia SPRING, the Dacia brand's first  electric  vehicle,  brought  in  almost  100,000  orders. Dacia Spring was the 3 rd -most sold 100% electric model in Europe over the first three quarters of 2022.\n\nFor Renault Group, the electric vision goes far beyond the car, which is why it created a fourth brand in January 2021: Mobilize .\n\nMobilize's ambition, through  a  very  comprehensive integrated offering, is to contribute to a sustainable world by providing financial services, mobility services,  as  well as services related to energy and data .\n\nBuilding on partner ecosystems that are complementary to our own, the brand wants to provide concrete solutions to promote  ecological  transition  and  develop  more accessible  mobility  for  people  and  goods,  whether  in complex, congested urban environments or in rural areas.\n\nMobilize's  strength  lies  in  its  comprehensive  offering  of mobility, energy and data. Knowing how to deal with these three  subjects  means  optimizing  technological  solutions and therefore costs... toward zero carbon.\n\nWith Mobilize, Renault Group is positioning itself in the new world  of  mobility  and  is  committed  to  achieving  carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040.\n\n## Examples of Mobilize's contributions:\n\nIn the field of mobility ,  Mobilize encourages the transition from ownership to use.\n\nMobilize is developing two car-sharing solutions with this in mind: Zity by Mobilize and Mobilize Share .\n\nZity  by  Mobilize is  a  'free  floating'  carpooling  solution (no need to return to the starting point)\n\nThe vehicle fleet is 100% electric.\n\nAn  app  allows  you  to  locate,  unlock,  and  drop  off  the vehicle and, of course, pay for the rental.\n\nZity  by  Mobilize  is  present  in  cities  with  more  than 500,000  inhabitants  (currently  Madrid,  Paris,  Lyon,  and Milan)  and  is  aimed  at  people  who  have  an  immediate need  for  transport  for  a  short  journey  (a  few  minutes/ kilometers).\n\nMobilize Share is  complementary to Zity by Mobilize and addresses  different  uses  that  can  last  longer  (up  to  one month).\n\nMobilize Share can cover:\n\n- \u25cf all  the  mobility  needs  in  the  dealership:  replacement vehicles, test drives, short-term rental, etc.\n- \u25cf non-concession mobility solutions, such as car-sharing in the city, with a partner or directly within a company.\n\nThis  car-sharing  service  is  a  closed-loop  service  (the starting  and  ending  points  are  the  same)  for  small  and medium-sized  cities.  It  can  start  with  only  two  or  three vehicles.\n\nMobilize Share relies on its partner Glide, a start-up in the Mobilize ecosystem providing:\n\n- \u25cf on-board technology (car-sharing box);\n- \u25cf off-board technology (app and back office);\n\nand  an  operational  team  that  supports  professionals  in the deployment of this activity.\n\nThe  'Mobility  360'  project,  created  with  Uber,  RATP  and BlaBlaCar, brings together experts who intend to use their complementary expertise and coordinate their approach to  propose  simpler,  greener,  sustainable  and  shared mobility solutions for cities and citizens.\n\n- \u25cf In the field of energy , the ambition is to make the electric vehicle part of everyday life.\n\nAn  electric  vehicle  can  be  charged  intelligently  when electricity  is  cheapest  and  least  carbon-intensive,  and  it can also become an energy source. This is the 'vehicle-togrid' (V2G) system.\n\nThe energy stored in the car's battery is fed back to the grid when there is a surplus. For example, a vehicle could supply energy to the city grid when the need for electricity is greater than the supply and eventually supply the house with energy.\n\nMobilize also develops innovative solutions to extend the life of electric vehicle batteries.\n\nMobilize has entered into an agreement with Betteries, a German start-up with a strong commitment to the circular economy,  to  develop  and  assemble  a  mobile,  modular, multi-use  energy  system  consisting  of  battery  modules from electric vehicles. Easily transportable, this system is made up of one to four elements (betterPacks) of 2.3 kWh and can thus reach a capacity of 9.2  kWh,  equivalent  to the  average  consumption  of  a  household  over  a  day.  It offers  the  advantage  of  being  zero-emission  and  silent and  points  to  the  energy  transition  from  transportable electric generators to clean and mobile electric systems.\n\nThere  are  multiple  uses  and  applications  of  this  system when connection to the electricity grid is impossible, such as  construction  sites,  food  trucks,  solar  energy  storage, filming  and  events.  The  manufacture  of  this  innovative storage system began in 2022 at the Flins Refactory.\n\nThis plant is where Mobilize is primarily developing energy storage  solutions  with  the  Advanced  Battery  Storage project. It is the largest stationary energy storage device. Ultimately, the project is set to reach a capacity of 70 MWh across France and Germany.\n\nAfter the plant in Douai (North of France) and Elverlingsen (Germany),  Mobilize  has  chosen  to  install  480  unused Renault  Zoe  batteries  at  the  Refactory  in  Flins  (Yvelines, France) for an additional capacity of 15 MWh.\n\nThe Group has also formed a partnership with Compagnie Seine Alliance and the integrator GreenVision to electrify a fleet of boats on the Seine using second-life batteries of Renault electric vehicles.\n\nAs  a  pioneer  in  the  development  of  'Smart  Islands', Mobilize  innovates  to  provide  territories  with  a  range  of solutions and achieve carbon neutrality.",

With  electric  cars, charging stations powered by solar panels, and a way for excess  energy  to  be  sent  back  to  the  grid,  Mobilize  has implemented  an  energy  management  system  designed to preserve nature and help the local community.\n\n## B. Innovation developed through our strategic partnerships\n\nThe  automotive  industry  is  undergoing  fundamental changes.  Customers  are  moving  away  from  owning  a vehicle  to  using  mobility  services.  Territories  are  taking the  initiative  to  develop  new  modes  of  mobility  that  are environmentally friendly, efficient and inclusive. Vehicles are increasingly electrified, which creates new needs and constraints  for  their  users.  With  the  creation  of  the Mobilize  brand,  Renault  Group  is  fully  committed  to supporting these changes, with the ambition of simplifying the lives of users of mobility services and being a leading partner for the territories.\n\nAccording  to  the  UN,  in  2050,  the  global  population  will reach  9.8  billion  people,  with  almost  70%  living  in  urban areas compared with 55% today, representing 2.5 billion additional city dwellers. This forecast gives an indication of the immense challenges to be faced in terms of quality of  life,  inclusion,  urbanization,  housing,  transport  and healthcare in cities, as well as accessibility to these new forms of mobility outside of cities.\n\nIn  terms  of  mobility,  new  uses  and  new  technologies  are spreading, questioning the place and status of individual cars ownership. The market  is increasingly being structured  according  to  uses  of  consumers,  who  are looking  less  for  ownership  of  a  vehicle,  than  for  a multimodal, innovative, connected, more  ecological offering suited to the diversity of their needs.\n\nThe city of the future will be smarter, more inclusive, more connected  and  more  collaborative.  Vehicles  that  are clean,  silent  and  shared  will  travel  through  it.  Personal vehicles will share the road in the cities, as well as in rural areas,  with  new  forms  of  services  based  on  usage: carsharing, carpooling, on-demand vehicles (private-hire vehicles, taxis, etc.) as well as robot vehicles.\n\nToday in Europe, several car-sharing services operated by Group  partners  use  Renault  electric  vehicles.  Renault Group is the leader in electric car-sharing in Europe. More than  12,000  electric  vehicles  are  available  to  carsharing users  in  most  European  capitals  as  well  as  in  sparsely populated suburban and rural areas. The Group adapts its offering to the context and offers both free-floating and closed-loop solutions.\n\nThe  car  is  already  electric  and  connected:  tomorrow  it could also be autonomous, with the benefits of smoother, more fluid traffic and improved safety. The development of  autonomous  cars  and  shuttles  will  accelerate  the growth  of  electric,  autonomous  and  shared  mobility services.  They  will  promote  complementarity  between modes of  transport,  multimodality  and  make  the  overall\n\nsystem  cleaner,  safer,  more  accessible,  more  effective and more efficient.\n\nSince  2017,  Renault  Group  has  been  working  with  both public  and  private  partners  to  experiment  with  Renault Zoe Cab prototypes for on-demand, electric, autonomous, and  shared  mobility  services.  The  objective  of  these programs  is  to  learn  the  needs  of  users  and  territories within an ecosystem of mobility services. They are part of France's  national  SAM  project  (Safety  and  Acceptability of  Autonomous  Driving  and  Mobility)  responding  to  the EVRA  (Experimentation  of  Autonomous  Road  Vehicles) call  for  projects  from  the  ADEME  (French  Agency  for Ecological Transition) in connection with the Investing in the Future (PIA) program.\n\nFollowing a first phase of lessons learned led by Mobilize and the Research Department, the Paris-Saclay Autonomous Lab experimentation program underwent its second  phase  in  2022  with  an  extension  of  their  field  of experimentation  and  an  opening  up  to  new  uses  with optimized Renault Zoe Cabs. User-panelists were able to register,  take  advantage  of  this  experimentation  and share  their  feedback  through  a  set  of  evaluations included in the national SAM (Safety and Acceptability of Autonomous Driving and Mobility) program.\n\n## C. An innovation designed with public players\n\nThe  city  of  tomorrow  will  be  innovative  and  adaptable while being respectful of the environment. The growth of the  urban  population  comes  with  countless  challenges: developing urban mobility while limiting pollution, providing  solutions  to  climate  change  and  for  society's ecological transition, optimizing water and  energy management,  improving  the  quality  of  life  of  people, contributing  to  social  cohesion,  designing,  building  and renovating buildings and neighborhoods.\n\nRenault  Group  contributes  to  collective  thinking  on sustainable mobility systems in cities and particularly on mobility ecosystems.\n\nLed by the Research Department in cooperation with greater Rouen, the EV4all project aims to offer a package of solutions (existing  and/or  innovative)  to  decarbonize  the  everyday mobility of modest households living in rural areas.\n\nThe  detailed  analysis  of  these  populations  led  to  the conclusion that  a  small  electric  vehicle,  equipped  with  a 20-kWh battery, would cover their daily needs, especially since  rural  housing  allows  easy  access  to  an  electrical outlet.\n\nBeyond  technical  sizing  limited  to  what  is  strictly necessary,  the  challenge  is  also  to  devise  financial solutions  for  access  to  these  vehicles  without  any  initial contribution  by  proving  their  economic  interest  for  the households  concerned  and  for  the  'operator'.    Various schemes  involving  greater  Rouen,  employers  and  the combination of new and second-hand vehicles are being evaluated. The goal is to build attractive proposals before the  forthcoming  widespread  implementation  of  lowemission zones (ZFE) in French cities.\n\nI",

Each of these prestigious schools contributes the skills of their laboratories and research teams.\n\nThe annual budget granted to the IMD by Renault allows theses in four thematic areas to be funded:\n\n- \u25cf organization of mobility:\n- \u25cf understanding interactions between territories, infrastructures, and the various modes of transport;\n- \u25cf identifying emerging systems with high potential;\n- \u25cf analyzing frugal solutions for essential mobility services.\n- \u25cf mobility business models:\n- \u25cf specifying the viable economic models in the making (including  cohabitation  with  the  current  models  and all types of transport);\n- \u25cf snalyzing the evolution of the automotive sector and its  governance  Innovating  within  wider  ecosystems effectively;\n- \u25cf innovating within wider ecosystems effectively.\n- \u25cf environment: Industrial, energy, and materials sectors:\n- \u25cf identifying the international conditions for transforming  the  current  automotive  value  chain towards alternative energy vehicles and new mobilities;\n- \u25cf evaluating  the  impacts  of  the  development  of  the sectors  (including  Hydrogen)  on  the  environment (climate, resources) via life-cycle analysis;\n- \u25cf reinforcing exchanges with partners, communicating, and positioning.\n- \u25cf disruptive technologies:\n- \u25cf identifying  the  disruptions  linked  to  technologies (electrification, electricity storage, driving assistance, etc.) and resulting from the requirements of sustainable, responsible, and inclusive development;\n- \u25cf highlighting how  technological  developments  in infrastructure (physical and internet) can impact the mobility ecosystem.\n\nThe  IMD's  research  areas  are  defined  jointly  by  Renault engineers and researchers from the various laboratories in the academic network.\n\nThe  research  work  can  take  various  forms:  bilateral contract  between  Renault  and  a  laboratory,  doctoral\n\ntheses, end-of-study internships (Master's degree, engineer), etc.\n\nRenault's  long-term  commitment  allows  it  to  undertake multi-year research programs, some of which capitalize on real  expertise  over  very  long  periods.  One  example  is  the mobility observatory, which, year after year, accumulates a wealth of information on mobility in major cities around the world.  This  means  that  around  100  major  cities  and thousands of factual data points can be used as a basis for studies on optimizing urban mobility.\n\nIn addition to the ongoing studies, here are some concrete examples of studies discussed in 2022:\n\n- \u25cf EV scale-up comparison: Norway/China;\n- \u25cf European experimental & innovation policies;\n- \u25cf ecosystem  learning  about  mobility/energy,  circular economy in Europe;\n- \u25cf conditions for monetizing data with third parties?\n- \u25cf linking the service/hardware/SW cycles to maximize the value/cost ratio for Renault and the company;\n- \u25cf dynamic of spreading innovation, factors of exuberance and enthusiasm in mobility services;\n- \u25cf efficiency of mobility modes: which areas are relevant for cars?\n- \u25cf air quality: supporting local mobility policies;\n- \u25cf EV services and impacts Life Cycle Assessment (LCA);\n- \u25cf simplified LCA tool;\n- \u25cf ESG materials and technology choices;\n- \u25cf improved recharging performance and, in particular, in the  case  of  long  distances  (technology  and  user experience).\n\nSome  of  these  studies  have  already  been  launched. Others will be launched in 2023.\n\nWhile IMD has produced many results since its creation, it has  also  allowed  the  recruitment  of  excellent  engineers, thus contributing to the transformation of Renault around two strong objectives:\n\n- 1. from the car to mobility services;\n- 2. towards  sustainable  and  responsible  mobility  within the territories in our various markets.\n\n## VeDeCom Institute - Zero-carbon communicating vehicles\n\nRenault is one of the founding members and an associate donor of VeDeCom, one of the IETs (Institutes for Energy Transition)  set  up  as  part  of  the  French  government's Investment  Plan  for  the  Future  (Plan  d'investissement d'avenir).  It  is  supported  by  the  NextMove  and  several local  authorities  (Yvelines  Departmental Council and the Versailles Grand Parc and Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines city authorities).\n\nVeDeCom  is  an  institute  for  shared  and  co-located research  into electric, autonomous  and  connected vehicles and the mobility ecosystem built on infrastructures  and  services  addressing  new  uses  for shared mobility and energy.\n\nI",

Innovation and commitment to road safety\n\nRoad  safety  has  become  one  of  the  three  pillars  of  the sustainable development strategy and feeds into Renault Group's long-term commitment to responsible mobility.\n\nReducing  the  number  of  accidents  and  casualties  on Europe's  roads  and  prioritizing  the  safety  of  road  users are among our commitments.\n\nThe Group's international expansion must be accompanied  by  the  design  of vehicles meeting regulations and security requirements in its new markets. Because the causes of accidents and injuries in these new regions  differ  from  the  traditional  European  market, Renault Group is expanding its accident research beyond Europe,  transferring  its  own  know-how  and  gaining expertise from local laboratories and universities as well as other key players in road safety.\n\nIn order to fully assume its responsibilities, Renault Group has made a two-fold commitment:\n\n- \u25cf through its products. Based on an analysis of observed risks, it incorporates solutions and innovations into all its design,  manufacturing  and  marketing  processes  in order to protect vehicle occupants and others exposed to road risks (pedestrians, 2-wheeler, etc.);\n- \u25cf in society. It participates actively with governments and civil  society  throughout  the  world  to  help  improve  road safety.  Both  alone  and  in  collaboration  with  other organizations, Renault Group works to raise awareness of  road  safety  and  facilitate  transfer  of  skills  among road users and road safety stakeholders.",

        "page_content": "Sustainable development\n\nCorporate governance\n\nRisk and control\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nSustainable development\n\nRenault Group's road safety policy and actions are based on four main focuses (prevent, correct, protect, and rescue) that allow us to take action before, during, and after an accident:\n\nPREVENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCORRECT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPROTECT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRESCUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PREVENT\n\nPrevention involves helping drivers to anticipate risks. Part of the solution consists of helping the driver by assisting with the driving task (driving aids). The remainder lies in encouraging more responsible driving. Drivers need to understand the limits  beyond  which  they  will  be  incapable  of  controlling  their  vehicles,  and  the  situations  in  which  they  are  putting themselves at risk.\n\n## CORRECT\n\nThe quality of road handling and braking constitutes the fundamental dynamics of the vehicle. They are fundamental to avoiding accidents. Nevertheless, there are situations where technology should intervene to compensate for driver error. This is the purpose of these active safety systems. They intervene in difficult or emergency conditions; however, they do not do entirely replace the driver.\n\n## PROTECT\n\nA  top  priority  of  Renault  Group's  road  safety  strategy  is  to  protect  the  car's  occupants  according  to  the  nature  and severity of the impact, regardless of their age, size or location in the vehicle, in small and large cars alike. Renault thus equips both the front and rear seats of its vehicles with systems to provide optimal passenger protection. The protection of other road users (pedestrians, cyclists, etc.) is also taken into account.\n\n## ASSIST\n\nRenault Group collaborates with French and foreign emergency services to optimize help for accident casualties. These services  receive  guides  and  attend  information  sessions  explaining  how  to  perform  rescue  operations  on  each  new Renault vehicle. They are also provided with late-model vehicles on which they can practice victim extraction methods. Innovative modifications are applied to the brand's vehicles to ensure that emergency firefighter interventions are safer and more effective.\n\n## 2.4.1.2.1. The Renault Group policy for road safety  EFPD16a\n\nRenault Group is committed to safer mobility, both for the occupants  of  its  vehicles  and  for  all  road  users (pedestrians,  cyclists,  etc.).  Renault  Group  relies  on  the research of the LAB (laboratory for accident research and biomechanics) to constantly and concretely improve the safety  of  its  products  and  services.  For  more  than  50 years,  the  LAB  has  provided  world-renowned  scientific expertise to observe, analyze and anticipate.\n\nFounded in 1969 as an EIG (economic interest grouping) by the two French manufacturers PSA SA and Renault Group,\n\nthe LAB  is the laboratory for accident research, biomechanics and human behavior studies.\n\nIts strength is based on varied, complementary skills in the service of safety: engineers, data scientists, biomechanics experts, physicians, engineering psychology experts and field accident investigators.\n\nIn 2022, LAB  experts  participated in a European collaborative project Horizon 2021 (V4SAFETY), management of a European industrial project (ENOP), and participation  in  two  projects  of  the  Interministerial Delegation for Road  Safety (DISR) (USCOMA  and THORAX).\n\nThe EU-funded (1) V4SAFETY ( Vehicles and VRU Virtual eValuation of Road Safety ) project will provide a framework for managing safety measures - from in-vehicle safety technologies, new vehicle types and infrastructure solutions to regulations that influence the behavior of road users. The framework will include methods for projecting results into future scenarios and across EU regions aimed at policy makers, authorities and consumer organizations.\n\nThe ENOP ( Enable New Occupant seating Position in automated vehicles) project involves 10 industrial and academic partners (Renault, Stellantis, Toyota, Cellbond, Faurecia Automotive Seating, Autoliv Development AB Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Stra\u00dfenwesen (BASt), CEESAR, ICAI-Comillas Pontifical University, LBMC-Gustave Eiffel University). Its purpose is to better understand and model the biomechanical constraints of the occupants, in unusual positions that could be adopted in highly automated vehicles.\n\nI",

The first is a study of the use of smartphones while driving based on the  naturalistic  database  UDrive.  The  second  aims  to  integrate  age-related  changes  in  bone  mineralization  into digital models, based on medical imaging. These projects are carried out with academic partners and French startups.\n\n(1) https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101075068\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PREVENT with the Renault Safety Coach\n\nPREVENT\n\nFirst detect: Following the model of the eco-score already introduced in our range, the new Renault vehicles will offer a Safety  Score to  analyze  driving  habits  and  provide driving advice adapted to each individual. The principle is simple: based on data from the vehicle's sensors driving criteria that are easily understandable because they are based  on  rules  from  the  traffic  regulations  will  be developed  in  order  to  establish  a  driving  score  from  the point  of  view  of  safety  and  behavior.  Designed  in partnership  with  the  Ecole  de  Conduite  Fran\u00e7aise  and soon to be offered on our new vehicles, the safety score will  have  the  advantage  of  enabling  drivers  to  identify areas  for  improvement  to  help  them  adopt  a  more preventive  driving  style  and  thus  act  to  reduce  driving risks  and,  as  a  result,  contribute  to  the  improvement  of road accident research.\n\nThen guide:  in  real  time,  data  from  the  vehicle's  sensors and connected systems will alert and advise the driver by signaling surrounding or upcoming risks on the on-board screens (dashboard and multimedia screen). The combination of the navigation system and maps allow the driver to be informed in real time when approaching risk areas  to  encourage  more  careful  driving  as  they  move closer  to  them.  All  of  these  functionalities,  grouped together in the safety coach ,  are  designed  to  advise  the driver for safer driving.\n\nUnder  certain  conditions,  we  will  also  take  action  on speed,  which  accounts  for  more  than  one  third  of  fatal accidents. Safe Guardian adapts the vehicle to anticipate and prevent dangers.\n\nAll  new  models  approved  between  mid-2022  and  mid2024 (passenger vehicles and small commercial vehicles) are equipped the following as standard equipment:\n\n- \u25cf an  AEB  (Advanced  Emergency  Braking)  system  to reduce the risk of a rear-end collision;\n- \u25cf an Emergency Lane Keeping system to alert and correct for unintentional lane departure;\n- \u25cf an  Intelligent  Speed  Assist  system  to  alert  the  driver  if the legal speed limit is exceeded;\n- \u25cf a  Driver  Drowsiness  &  Attention  Warning  system  to detect  decreased  alertness  and  warn  the  driver  based on an analysis of actions;\n- \u25cf a Reversing Detection system to detect the presence of an object in the rear field of the vehicle.\n\nThe maximum speed of the vehicles will also be limited to 180 km/h.\n\n## Prevent, correct, protect\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPREVENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPROTECT\n\nCORRECT\n\nThe commitment to automotive safety has resulted in the achievement, 26 times, of the maximum rating of 5 stars in Euro  NCAP  tests,  after  having  been  the  first  vehicle manufacturer to do so in 2001 on the D segment (Laguna II in  2001),  then  on  the  C-segment  (Megane  II  in  2002)  and lastly  on  the  B-segment  (Modus  in  2004).  This  crossdisciplinary  approach  has  been  enriched  by  taking  into account  new  issues  related  to  the  compatibility  of vehicles in frontal impact and the phenomenon known as submarining, which is now taken into account in certain new NCAP protocols. This year, two new models, Megane E Tech and Austral, were awarded five stars.\n\nThe effort in the field of passive safety will continue over the  coming  years,  particularly  supporting  the  tightening of rules for consumer testing around the world.\n\nWhile  efforts  in  passive  safety  undertaken  by  the  entire automotive  industry  have  enabled  extremely  significant improvements to be achieved in terms of reducing the road death toll, recent technological advances, complementing public policy, have heralded a new and very promising area of progress, meaning that it is no longer a case of limiting the  consequences  of  an  accident,  but  rather,  of  reducing their severity, or even, avoiding them altogether.\n\nThis  is  where  primary  road  safety  comes  into  play,  with ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems). These ADAS can  alert  the  driver  to  danger,  assist  with  corrective maneuvers or brake when collision is imminent, supporting the driver if he or she has failed to react. These systems, the most  typical today  being  Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), will be able to act on one of the recognized causes of accidents to reduce their occurrence and severity: the driver's delayed reaction due to a lack of attention or anticipation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  preparation  of  new  systems  is underway, benefiting from the very rapid progress in the development  of  sensors  and  embedded  electronics.  In 2016,  SCENIC  unveiled  a  new  generation  of  even  more powerful ADAS systems, including Automatic Emergency Braking with pedestrian detection, which is found on most of our products.\n\nRenault Group makes a total of 13,150 educational videos (17 languages and 22 countries) presenting the functionalities  and  technologies  of  Dacia  and  Alpine brand  vehicles,  including  ADAS,  available  to  customers. This  total  includes  the  5,900  online  ADAS  tutorial  videos (Renault and Dacia BUs), i.e. around 45%.\n\nThe website https://www.e-guide.Renault.com/portail/ has received 3.5 million visits since 2017 and the tutorials, available in 17 languages and 22 countries, have been seen nearly 17 million times. Renault is innovating in the way it communicates about ADAS by offering immersive virtual reality tools to explain how research works for the benefit of safety.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROTECT with the LAB's expertise\n\nPROTECT\n\nSince  1969,  PSA  and  Renault  Group  have  been  advancing road safety with the LAB. It is a major contributor of scientific publications in its field. It has made major advances in road safety - knowledge of human behavior and tolerance levels of all sorts of people (age, size, gender, position, etc.) - and is helping  manufacturers  to  design  future  technologies  to increase safety for road users.\n\n## Thanks to the LAB, Renault has:\n\n- \u25cf Reinforced  front  impact  structures  and  integrated  pretensioning  systems  that  have  made  it  possible  to  lower shoulder  belt  tension  and  improve  the  complementary relationship between the belt and airbags to reduce injury risks.  Plastic  parts  that  may  be  in  contact  with  the occupant have been designed to limit the applied forces;\n- \u25cf Reinforced  side  impact  structures  and  integrated  side airbags protecting the chest and head. Plastic parts that may  be  in  contact  with  the  occupant  have  been designed to limit the applied forces;\n- \u25cf Enhanced  seat  and  headrest  behavior  to  prevent whiplash in a rear impact;\n- \u25cf Improved  child  protection  with  Isofix  attachments  to properly position dedicated child seats;\n- \u25cf Modified  the  design  of  the  front  of  vehicles  to  improve pedestrian protection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nSustainable development\n\nRESCUE with the Rescue Code, Rescue Sheet and Fireman Access\n\nRESCUE\n\n'In a violent accident  with  severe  trauma  to  the passengers, the 'golden hour' is the critical time after the impact.  Every  minute  counts.  Our  primary  objective  as firefighters is to save  time  in  all phases  of  our interventions.' explained Christophe Lenglos.\n\nFormalizing  a  long-standing  relationship  with  the  fire brigade  (2010),  Renault  Group  works  regularly  at  the national  level  with  the  Department  of  Civil  Security  and Crisis Management  (DGSCGC)  and  with  the  French National Federation of Fire Fighters (FNSPF).  As the only manufacturer  to  be  a  member  of  the  World  Rescue Organisation  (WRO),  a  committed  partner  of  the  NGO Pompiers  de  l'Urgence  Internationale  (PUI)  and  involved on  a  daily  basis  with  the  fire  brigade  in  12  European countries to better understand their needs and facilitate their  work  in  the  field,  Renault  Group  has  built  a  unique collaboration.  It  can  be  seen  in,  in  addition  to  other actions,  the  donation  of  several  hundred  overhauled vehicles  per  year  dedicated  to  road  rescue  training  and the  creation  of  the  position  of  a  lieutenant-colonel  of firefighters  integrated  within  our  staff  to  support  the project teams and to provide dedicated training to fellow firefighters.  Renault  Group contributed to the drafting of the national road rescue intervention doctrine document.\n\nFireman  Access makes  it  easier  for  firefighters  to  deal with  battery  fires  in  electric  and  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles. The battery fire is extinguished after five minutes instead of  nearly  two  hours  on  a  high-voltage  battery  not equipped with it. Fireman Access is  a  heat-meltable part placed  on  the  chassis  of  an  electric  vehicle  that,  in  the event  of  a  malicious  vehicle  fire,  allows  the  jet  from  the fireman's hose to access the 400-volt battery underneath, which itself  is  equipped  with  fireman  access  next  to  the chassis fireman access. The aim is to drown the battery by filling  it  with  water,  which  is  the  only  way  to  turn  off  a lithium-ion battery on fire quickly and permanently.\n\n## Renault Group is currently the only carmaker to offer this technical solution to firefighters.\n\nThe traction battery  disconnection  system (HV) is positioned  directly  on  the  battery  in  order  to  guarantee complete electrical safety for all those involved, including the emergency services.\n\nThe Rescue Code on  the  windscreen and rear window of our vehicles allows firefighters to immediately identify the model a vehicle involved in an impact at the accident site thanks to a QR code that gives access to the rescue sheet providing  useful  information  on  the  architecture  and systems that can impact them in their efforts. In the event of a serious accident, this speeds  up  passenger assistance  by  nearly  15  minutes  and  increases  the chances of survival of victims by 50%.\n\nI",

Emergency service needs are taken into account from the  design  stage  of  vehicles.  For  example,  fireman access  is  already  integrated  into  all  our  electric  and plug-in  hybrid  vehicles:    Zoe,  Zoe  Long  Range,  Kangoo Z.E Long Range and Master Z.E, Twingo Electric, Megane Electric  and  Spring  Electric,  Captur  plug-in  hybrid  and Megane plug-in hybrid;\n- \u25cf systematic  installation  in  the  factory  of  the  Rescue Code on new Renault 2022 models;\n- \u25cf monitoring and ensuring that the Engineering Department takes into account the first rules of design relating  to  emergency  firefighter  interventions  on  our hybrid and electric vehicles;\n- \u25cf systematic verification of the appropriate performance of our electric and hybrid vehicles in the event of fire;\n- \u25cf organization  of  free  training  sessions  to  share  our knowledge  of  alternative  energy  vehicles  with  the rescue  community;  13  training  sessions  took  place  in 2022, including 6 for foreign firefighters, some with the strong  support  of  the  countries'  subsidiaries.  In  2022, 880  firefighter  trainers  benefited  from  this  sharing  of information,  which  then  could  then  pass  on  to  their colleagues;\n- \u25cf organization of a seminar on electric vehicles dedicated to  firefighters,  bringing  together  300  rescue  workers and some 20 engineering specialists to share the latest technical information;\n- \u25cf active participation in the Euro NCAP's consideration of firefighter interventions following accidents in order to define the future Rescue protocol for 2026;\n- \u25cf donation of more than 400 latest-generation vehicles to the firefighter services of France and Europe in 2021 to help improve their road rescue training;\n- \u25cf rescue  sheets  for  each  of  the  Group's  new  models,  in partnership with the road rescue advising firefighters of the  Ile-de-France  regional  group.  This  unique  method ensures that the content of our sheets perfectly meets the needs of emergency services;\n- \u25cf contribution  to  the  organization  of  the  World  Rescue Challenge by providing the competing teams with newgeneration vehicles.\n\n## All vehicles comply with the regulations in force in Europe and outside Europe.\n\n## Europe :\n\n- \u25cf all  new  passenger  car  models  are  equipped  with  six airbags,  seatbelt  pretension/restraint  in  front  seats/ central  rear  seats  and  at  least  two  Isofix  cables  in  the rear. There are also seatbelt reminders for every seat in the 1 st and 2 nd rows;\n- \u25cf already in place on our fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles,  Fireman  Access  will  continue  to  be  deployed\n\non  all  future  electric  and  electrified  models  to  allow firefighters to extinguish a burning EV as quickly as an ICE vehicle (the only OEM to allow this performance);\n\n- \u25cf rescue Sheet: technical guide for rescue teams; Renault was  the  first  manufacturer  to  adopt  the  standardized format for these documents in 2014.\n\n## Outside Europe:\n\n- \u25cf the deployment of standard passive safety elements is underway in line with the renewal of local range plans;\n- \u25cf in  terms  of  active  safety,  in  addition  to  passive  safety devices,  we  intend  to  deploy  and  adapt  systems  that have already been tried and tested and are recognized for  their  effectiveness,  such  as  emergency  braking assistance,  overspeed  warning  and  lane  departure warning.\n\n## 2.4.1.2.2. Integrating new technologies\n\nThe vehicle of the future will be zero emission, communicative  and  driverless. The communicating vehicle is connected to other vehicles, to the road and to the  environment.  The  vehicles  exchange  information about  their  location,  speed,  planned  route,  etc.  They  will also  act  as  sensors  for  other  vehicles,  indicating  traffic, road  issues,  etc.  The  information  obtained  will  be  used first  and  foremost  to  provide  safety  services  (incident warnings  for  onward  route,  roads  or  areas  with  specific hazards,  etc.)  as  well  as  traffic  services  (congestion, alternative real-time itineraries, etc.).\n\nVehicle autonomy is being phased in, starting with partial or conditional  autonomy  depending  on  the  driving situations envisaged.\n\nClearly one of the main challenges is to ensure the safety of all users on roads that are increasingly connected and automated. Renault Group therefore collaborates with the scientific  community,  industrial  partners,  and  public authorities on all aspects of safety:\n\n- \u25cf dependability;\n- \u25cf general product safety;\n- \u25cf regulatory compliance (technical and Highway code);\n- \u25cf compliance with the European Statement of Principles on Human-Machine Interface;\n- \u25cf development of international norms and standards;\n- \u25cf definition of possible applications for connectivity and automation  services  compatible  with  planned  or foreseeable usage, including any potential distractions;\n- \u25cf compliance with the laws on personal data records.\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate this safety through six types of testing, to test and validate the performance and safety of the services and associated technical solutions:\n\n- \u25cf basic operational tests using test facilities and simulations;\n- \u25cf operational tests on test tracks;\n- \u25cf operational tests on open roads with escort vehicles;",

This program is in response to the EVRA (Experimentation  of  Autonomous  Road  Vehicles)  call  for projects  launched  by  the  ADEME  (French  Agency  for Ecological Transition) in connection with the Investing in the  Future  (PIA)  program  in  June  2018.  The  three-year project began in July 2019.\n\nThis  program  enables  autonomous  vehicle  experiments to  be  carried  out  and  contributes  to  the  creation  of  a common  asset  for  capitalizing  on  the  driving  scenarios necessary for their validation.\n\n## 2.4.1.2.3. General product safety\n\nIn  terms  of  general  product  safety,  Renault  Group  has defined a general policy to be followed based on:\n\n- \u25cf A  reference  database  of  undesirable  customer  events considered potentially safety-related by the company. These  events  are  systematically  taken  into  account throughout  the  life  cycle  of  the  car.  Operational dependability  is  taken  into  account  in  every  project. Technical  reviews  and  audits  are  organized  to  ensure the  achievement  of  the  target  as  recommended  in ISO  26262.  The  new  ISO  21448  published  in  2022  is currently being deployed with the ADAS scope;\n- \u25cf The creation of safety documentation for each project (called  risk  and  security  control  digital  mock-ups), covering  engineering,  manufacture,  sales  and  aftersales.  It  is  created  and  validated  according  to  specific rules and processes and signed by the Chief Engineer of the project in question. In 2022, 215 FMRS were signed;\n- \u25cf Managers  who,  within  the  main  functions  concerned (engineering,  manufacturing,  quality),  are  responsible for  ensuring  the  compliance  of  projects  in  terms  of safety;\n- \u25cf Crisis  management  training  sessions  are  offered  to those  involved  within  Renault  Group  in  the  tool Learning@Alliance.  In  2022, 550 employees  were trained, 40% of whom were outside France.\n\nFeedback  is  provided  on  customer  vehicles.  If  there  are incidents or failures, an incidentology process is applied. It may lead to recall campaigns.\n\nOur  experts  are  internationally  recognized  and  actively participate in the drafting of ISO 26262 and ISO 21448.\n\n## 2.4.1.3. Making mobility as widely accessible as possible\n\n## 2.4.1.3.1. Affordability and physical accessibility\n\n## Widely accessible spare parts\n\nWith regard to service, Renault Group developed a more affordable  range  of  spare  parts  to  make  mobility accessible to the greatest number of people.\n\nStarting  in  1998,  Renault  offered  a  full  range  of  parts equivalent  in  terms  of  safety  and  functionality  to  the original vehicle parts, whatever the brand. Since then, the offering  has  evolved  to  better  meet  the  expectations  of customers  and  markets.    Renault  offers  an  alternative service for its models over 4 years old in its network under the VALUE+ brand. This offering, exclusively dedicated to Renault and Dacia vehicles, is the best alternative to the original part with all carmaker services and warranties. As for  the  Motrio  brand,  it  is  adapted  to  the  needs  of  all makes of  vehicles  over  four  years  old  and  currently  has 8,500  references  divided  into  70  different  product families.\n\nThis range is compatible with 50 automotive brands and more than 500 vehicle models.\n\nCurrently,  Motrio  is  present  in  around  50  countries worldwide  and  the  brand  even  has  its  own  multi-brand garage chain. Building on this success, Motrio is naturally continuing  its  international  growth,  and  has  committed itself  to  the  crucial  digital  and  e-commerce  channels for closer contact with its customers.\n\nFor  many  years,  Renault  has  also  been  developing alternatives  to  new  parts.  In  2012,  Renault  created  an after-sales refurbished parts service. In anticipation of the requirements of the Royal law on the use of parts from the circular economy in automotive repairs (which came into force  in  2017),  Renault's  sales  network  offers  used  body parts (hoods, fenders, headlamp units, etc.) in France and mechanical parts in France that have been collected and selected  in  Indra's  approved  network  of  ELV  (end-of-life vehicle)  centers.  This  service  is  particularly  of  interest  to customers whose vehicles are not economically repairable using only new parts.\n\nI",

This  new business  area  is  a  major  development  area  for  the standard exchange  service. The refurbishment of electronic  parts  has  been  a  natural  addition  to  the refurbishment activities and is in line with both technological  developments  and  customer  needs.  The used parts are collected in the distribution network, sorted and  refurbished  according  to  a  rigorous  industrial process.  These  renovated  ('standard  exchange')  parts are  sold  to  Renault  vehicle  owners  at  a  lower  price  than new parts while satisfying the same quality requirements (see paragraph 2.3.2.2.4).\n\nRenault  pays  particular  attention  to  adapting  its  spare parts  pricing  to  the  change  in  the  residual  value  of  its vehicles  in  order  to  optimize  their  reparability.  Renault initially  focused  its  efforts  on  the  bodywork  segment. The cost of repair is an essential criterion for insurers to avoid  premature  scrapping.  Thus,  between  three  and six years after the date of launch, depending on the range, Renault concentrates its price reduction efforts on parts related  to  passive  safety  (airbags,  seatbelts,  dashboard, etc.). Likewise,  from  the  cessation  of  marketing  of vehicles,  the  price  of  bodywork  parts  (bumpers,  doors, wings, etc.)  and  glazing  is  adjusted  each  year.  Renault  is going  further  by  adopting  the  same  approach  for mechanical parts. The ambition is the same: to promote repairs  by  fully  integrating  the  residual  value  of  vehicles into the pricing of parts.\n\n## Qstomize:  providing  custom  automotive  solutions  for everyone\n\nCreated  in  2009,  Renault  Tech  changed  its  name  to Qstomize  in  2022:  a  name  that  evokes  its  core  business, namely the customization and transformation of vehicles, with a scope of action beyond the Renault brand and even the Group. At the same time, Qstomize presented its new strategy 'Qstomize 2025: new ambitions, together,' which focuses on two main areas: the expansion of the product range and the geographical scope.\n\nThe  Qstomize  Business  Unit  designs,  produces  and markets  conversions  for  Renault  Group,  Alliance  and partner  vehicles,  for  both  professional  and  private customers,  in  compliance  with  Renault  Group  quality\n\nstandards. Qstomize is an integral part of Renault Group's After-Sales Business Unit.\n\nFor  more  than  12  years,  Qstomize  has  made  people  with reduced  mobility  a  core  focus  of  its  concerns,  offering them a complete range of adaptations to Renault vehicles and  enabling  them  to  travel  in  complete  autonomy  and safety whether  for  business  or  pleasure. Through Qstomize, Renault Group is the only European manufacturer  engaged  in  the  design,  manufacture  and start of sales of vehicles dedicated to transporting people with reduced mobility. Renault has also been a partner of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise Handisport (the French disability  sports  federation)  for  almost  20  years.  https:// professionnels.Renault.fr/mobilite-reduite.html\n\nQstomize  is  also  developing  a  complete  range  of conversions  for  passenger  cars  (special  series,  driving school vehicles, etc.) and for commercial vehicles (interior arrangements, vehicle protection, equipment kits, etc.). In addition,  there  are  custom  fittings  for  corporate  fleets, specifically adapted to the needs of the customer.\n\nAll  of  these  conversions  are  carried  out  at  13  sites  near Renault Group factories in France, Spain, Slovenia, Turkey, Romania and Morocco.\n\n## 2.4.1.3.2. A committed, socially responsible player\n\nAlthough  mobility  is  a  key  element  for  the  social  and professional inclusion of people, millions of them nevertheless  remain  limited  every  day  in  their  travel. Penalized by financial, geographical and social hindrances,  too  many  people  have  to  give  up  a  job  or  a training  course  quite  simply  because  they  cannot  get there. According to a 2019 report by the court of auditors, 'The  main  difficulties  encountered  by  beneficiaries  in accessing employment stem from the insufficient supply of  jobs  in  the  professional  sector,  a  level  of  qualification that is too low (in almost half of the cases), the lack of a driving license or vehicle (42%) , discrimination in accessing employment, and their financial situations...'\n\nIn France, among individuals living in a household earning less  than  \u20ac1,000  per  month,  54%  report  that  they  had given  up  a  job  because  they  had  no  means  to  travel (source:  'Mobility  and  access  to  employment'  survey  January 18, 2017).\n\nAs  a  major  player  in  mobility,  Renault  Group  therefore decided to act for more inclusive and socially responsible mobility by setting up a social business program that aims to favor the mobility of the most vulnerable.",

Develop specific offers intended for people in uncertain situations\n\nThis concerns the development, with a viable entrepreneurial approach, of projects that have meaning for  the  employees  of  the  Group,  its  customers  and  its partners,  maximizing  the  social  impact  rather  than  the profit.\n\n## Caremakers:  an  inclusive  mobility  solution  through  a micro-loan offering\n\nIn  France,  the  Caremakers  Inclusive  Mobility  offerings enable  economically  vulnerable  people  to  access  or remain  in  the  job  market  by  providing  new  vehicles  and after-sales  services  (repair  and  maintenance)  at  special prices.\n\nFor  example,  Dacia  Sandero  Essentiel  is  available  from \u20ac45/month for a resident of the Greater Paris metropolis with  the  conversion  premium  (or  \u20ac110/month  without  the premium) through a lease-to-own arrangement incorporating  a  micro-loan  taken  out  with  one  of  our partners.  In  2022,  we  opened  our  offerings  to  the  Dacia Spring, accessible from \u20ac40/month (all combined) or \u20ac130/ month.  The  Dacia  Spring  offers  a  100%  electric  driving experience.\n\nThese  offers  are  accessible  either  through  a  network  of influencers (organizations, mobility platforms, social organizations,  employment  players)  or  directly  on  our website:\n\n## https://www.caremakersmobility.com/fr\n\nThey  are  valid  in  the  network  of  Dacia  and  Renault 'Garages Solidaires,' which are voluntary members of this program.\n\nIn 2022, between 700 and 800 vehicles were ordered and financed under the Caremakers program. On the strength of the satisfaction rate of this program and the initial very positive  results  of  its  impact  on  the  improvement  of  the professional situation of its beneficiaries, Renault Group is committed  to  developing  these  offers  in  France  and  in other  countries  and  is  aiming  for  4,000  LOAs  in  2025,  a tenfold increase in volumes in five years.\n\n## 2. Financial investment in social businesses\n\nCaremakers Invest  S.A.S.  has  been  offering  funding  and support since 2012 to innovative entrepreneurs developing  mobility  solutions  for  people  in  difficulty. Renault Group contributed \u20ac5m to this company's capital.\n\nCaremakers  Invest  is  a  certified  Solidarity  and  Social Utility Enterprise company (ESUS). The capital provided by Renault is increased by contributions from the employee savings  funds  through  the Renault  Caremakers  Solid'air employee mutual fund.\n\nThe Management and Investment Committee (CDI) is the central  governance  body  of  Caremakers  Invest  S.A.S., newly  chaired  by  Philippe  Buros,  Senior  Vice  President, Sales and Marketing. The CDI is composed of 6 members, including  an  employee  representative  and  an  outside specialist in investment and social business.\n\nIn ten  years,  Caremakers  Invest  S.A.S.  has  already provided  funding  (capital  or  debt)  for  16  projects, appointing Renault employees as mentors. The details of the supported companies can be found online at https:// www.renaultgroup.com/nos-engagements/notrestrategie-environnementale-et-societale/\n\nThe  companies  supported  by  Caremakers  Invest  are asked  to  measure  the  social  impact  of  their  respective activities. A common framework of nine result and activity indicators, put together with HEC, was deployed in 2018.\n\nAccording to the impact survey conducted in 2022, thanks to  the  products  and  services  offered  by  the  companies supported by Caremakers Invest:\n\n- \u25cf more  than  95,000  people,  including  more  than  34,000 people in vulnerable situations, have had better access to mobility;\n- \u25cf more  than  5,700  people  in  a  fragile  financial  situation were able to find or keep their jobs.\n\nAll companies are participating in the scheme in this way:\n\n- \u25cf France Active Investissement is an investment company  that  finances  the  social  and  solidarity economy in  France.  With  its  40  territorial  associations and its network of economic and social players, France Active  supports  entrepreneurs  who  wish  to  invest  in  a project  with  a  positive  impact  in  order  to  create  an activity by committing themselves to a territory.\n- \u25cf Responsage innovates in the social support of employees  on  very  concrete  issues  such  as  housing, budgeting, health, disability or help for elderly relatives. A  lack  of  mobility  can  aggravate  already  fragile situations.  Responsage  has  thus  become  a  prescriber for  the  'Garages  Renault  solidaires'  and  seeks  to strengthen synergies with Renault Group.\n\nI",

Participate in the influence and development of social business within the Company and outside\n\nRenault Group contributes to the HEC Chair, which aims to promote  the  inclusive  economy  by  supporting  research and teaching and by developing concrete projects having an impact on the reduction of poverty.\n\n## A Social Business SAE (strategic area of expertise)\n\nIn  October  2018,  the  Group  created  a  Social  Business Strategic  Area  of  Expertise  (SAE)  under  the  Sustainable Development  Department  with  a  view  to  embedding social business into the Company's strategy for the long term  alongside  other  traditional  core  business  areas. Since  2018,  training  in  inclusive  business  has  been organized and completed by the Group's employees.\n\n## Flins inclusive campus:\n\nThe  Flins  Refactory  project  has  a  training  campus  for circular economy professions designed to meet the skills needs  of  Renault  and,  more  broadly,  of  all  companies developing circular economy activities. Renault Group, an inclusive  company,  is  committed  to  making  the  campus accessible  to  people  with  reduced  mobility  or  with disabilities, to promoting gender parity in its recruitment, and  to  opening  up  training  to  migrants  from  the  labor pool, who are trained in French as a foreign language (FLE) and business skills, within a system specifically built with\n\nour partners in the territory, P\u00f4le Emploi and GRETA. This 'Ecole des savoirs' (School of Knowledge) has allowed 25 migrants to be trained. Some  have  even  found employment through partnerships with temporary employment agencies.\n\nRenault Group also collaborates with the 'Entreprise and pauvret\u00e9'  action  tank,  chaired  by  Martin  Hirsch  (CEO  of AP-HP  Assistance  Publique  des  H\u00f4pitaux  de  Paris) and Emmanuel  Faber  to  share  existing  knowledge  about social  business,  hold  discussions  with  other  businesses committed  to  this  approach  and  benefit  from  expert support  and  advice  with  the  aim  of  ramping  up  the project.\n\n' Collectif  des  entreprises  engag\u00e9es ': a prescription banking platform\n\nIn  February  2019,  Renault  Group  joined  the  ' Collectif  des entreprises engag\u00e9es '  a  coalition  of  companies  created at  the  end  of  2018.  Thomas  Bubberl,  CEO  of  AXA,  and Sophie Boissard, CEO of Korian, lead this collective.\n\nBNP  Paribas  launched  a  platform  facilitating  access  to goods for its most vulnerable customers, including access to inclusive mobility offers by Caremakers, notably leaseto-own arrangements for a new car.",

A whistleblowing tool (2.2.6.1).\n\n## 2.4.2.2. Promoting diversity, development and employee commitment\n\nIn 2022,  Renault  Group's  human  capital  comprised 105,812 women and men in the 121 entities and 35 countries in which it operates. Each and every one of them uses their commitment and skills to make mobility sustainable and accessible  to  all  worldwide.  Renault  Group  is  committed to sustainable and responsible growth and implements a global,  fair  and  competitive  HR  policy.  HR  principles, standards  and  processes  provide  a  shared  frame  of reference, which ensures fairness and transparency for all employees. To continue to adapt to transformed roles in the  automotive  sector  and  to  shape  future  mobility,  the Group has introduced an HR policy with a global vision to ensure that Renault Group as a Company is fast-moving, innovative,  effective  and  eager  to  learn.  This  policy  is based  on  high-quality  social  dialog  at  both  local  and global levels, and is focused on five priorities:\n\n- \u25cf be sustainably competitive, while complying with codes of  ethics  and  regulations  to  maintain  employee  health and safety;\n- \u25cf attract and develop all talent;\n- \u25cf implement  management  approaches  that  empower their teams;\n- \u25cf promote an inclusive culture;\n- \u25cf engage  our  employees  and  enhance  their  employee experience.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.1. Ensuring the necessary resources and skills\n\nAt a time of digital revolution and the emergence of disruptive technologies  at  an  increasing  pace,  the  skills  set  needed  by the  company  is  changing.  All  levels  of  qualification  are affected by these transformations. Moreover, identification of talent  is  taking  place  in  an  increasingly  competitive  market not  confined  to  the  automotive  sector.  To  anticipate  and adapt  to  these  rapid  changes,  Renault  Group  recruits employees with a wide range of profiles  and  expertise  in  all the markets where it operates.\n\nI",

Optimizing the allocation of resources\n\n2022 was marked by a reduction in the Group's workforce throughout the world.

Preparing the skills of today and tomorrow\n\n## Development of ReKnow University.\n\nThe  automotive  sector  is  changing,  and  skills  in  data analysis  and  handling,  cyber  security,  electrification, maintenance  and  recycling  of  vehicles  have  become essential.\n\nTo  support  this  transformation,  we  created  ReKnow University in 2021.\n\nThis new company university supports the transformation of mobility professions by ensuring the link between initial training  and  lifelong  learning  and  by  bringing  together various  players  (industrial,  academic,  institutional)  to design and disseminate innovative training courses.\n\nStructured around five themes (electrical, circular economy, data, software and cybersecurity), this university trains for the mobility professions of the future. Dedicated  initially  to  Group  employees  in  France,  it already  trained  more  than  10,000  people  since  2021.  Our ambition is to train nearly 15,000 employees by 2025. The university's  activities  are  being  gradually  extended  to industrial partners in the sector with whom we share the design and delivery of professional training courses.\n\nFor  example,  by  actively  participating  in  the  creation  of the E-Mobility Industry Academy in France, Renault Group is investing in the development of the skills of its industrial teams  through  the  design  of  training  modules  that  will enable it to train the people who will work on the electric motor production lines of tomorrow.\n\nReKnow University works closely with renowned academic  partners on  the  co-development  of  training courses for certification and diplomas to prepare for the future  of  mobility  and  our  industry.  A  new  campus  for professions  and  qualifications,  totally  dedicated  to  the circular mobility industry, was inaugurated in 2022 at the Refactory site  in  Flins,  which  will  enable  its  stakeholders and  ReKnow  University  to  develop  the  skills  required  to address the new challenges associated with the circular economy.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.2. Ensuring the engagement and development of all talents\n\n## A. Supporting employees in their career and development\n\nSupporting and developing employees is part of Renault Group's  DNA.  To  this  end,  the  Group  offers  a  variety  of career  and  development  opportunities  for  all  so  that everyone, depending on their wishes and the evolution of the company needs, can grow and develop through their experiences  and  their  possibilities  for  exposure  and/or education/training (70/20/10).\n\n## a)  An  annual  exchange  between  employees  and  their manager: the Career and Development interview\n\nEach  year,  all  employees  are  encouraged  to  reflect  on their  career  development  wishes  and  their  individual development plan,  which  they  share  with  their  manager as  part  of  the  Career  and  Development  conversation. These items are formalized in the People@RenaultGroup tool.\n\nCareer development and individual development are also discussed  by  the  HR  function  and  managers,  during  HR committees  and  at  least  once  a  year  in  the  People  and Talent  Review.    The  purpose  of  these  committees  is  to strengthen the support of employees in their development.\n\n## b) Internal mobility: a key lever for development\n\nAt Renault Group, the diversity of experience is considered a key lever for development, which is why the internal  mobility  policy  aims  to  place  employees  at  the wheel  of  their  career  and  development  and  give  them autonomy  in  management.  of  their  mobility  and  their career at Renault.\n\nCompliance with the key principles of this policy, such as a transparent  internal  job  market,  optimized  job  change times  and  management  involved  from  the  definition  of the  job  to  the  selection  of  the  final  candidate,  is  the guarantee of mobility. agile, streamlined internal organization that embodies diversity and inclusion:\n\n- \u25cf search  for  diversity  and  complementarity  of  profiles and personalities within the teams and\n\nI",

It can also be an opportunity to test a new career direction before possibly proceeding with a mobility.\n\n## c) Grow@RenaultGroup  to  guide  employees  in  their career and development\n\nIn  2022,  Renault  was  launching  a  new  digital  platform 'Grow@RenaultGroup' to guide employees in their career and  development.  In  a  single  space,  the  employee  can find  advice,  tools,  resources  to  get  to  know  themselves better,  think  about  their  future,  build  their  development plan and thus prepare their exchange with their manager. This platform also offers activities and concrete ideas for developing through experience, through others or through access to more formal training (digital modules, articles, books).\n\n## d) Digital solutions to support employees in their careers and development: \"People@RenaultGroup\" and \"Learning@Alliance\"\n\nSince  2019,  the  Group  has  deployed  a  digital  solution called People@Renault (Workday) which offers feedback tools  and functionalities to enhance its career, skills and formalize its professional aspirations.\n\nLearning@Alliance is the Group's digital training platform that  allows  employees  to  develop  thanks  to  the  training modules and e-learning it provides.\n\n## B. Training to support skills development EFPD5\n\nRenault  Group  supports  the  skills  development  of  its employees  to  meet  its  sustainable  growth  and  social responsibility targets. The priorities of the training teams for 2022 mainly focused on:\n\n- \u25cf Continuously  adapting  training  courses  to  operational needs;\n- \u25cf Increasing the accessibility of our offered training and improving the learner experience;\n- \u25cf Developing  new  uses  in  training  and  continuing  the digitalization of the offered training;\n- \u25cf Strengthening the Learning & Development community (composed  of  our  functional  academies,  country  and Corporate L&D teams).\n\n## a) Increasing access to training and improving the learner experience\n\nNumerous  training  initiatives  have  been  taken  in  the countries where the Group operates to develop skills and talents, in an uncertain economic and health context. The sustainable  increase  in  the  rate  of  access  to  training  is one of the key indicators that is monitored monthly.\n\nFor  example,  DACIA  in  Romania  has  launched  a  major digital training program for industrial teams as part of an initiative supported by European funds.\n\nIn  Brazil,  the  HR  team  deployed  a  remote  induction program for newcomers to prepare for the integration of employees  before  their  arrival  in  the  Group  ('preonboarding program').\n\nIn addition, the commitment of the community of internal trainers  and  our  function  experts  enabled  us  to  deliver more  than  941,000  hours  of  training  to  our  teams, representing  more  than  51,6%  of  the  training  hours delivered in 2022 (and tracked in Learning@Alliance).\n\nAt the same time, Renault Group continued to develop its training  management  system  (Learning@Alliance)  by making it easier to understand the training offer through rapid  access  to  targeted  training  on  important  themes issues (such as managing a team remotely and improving language skills) while allowing individualized paths with a choice of training subjects preferred by the employee in question.\n\nOur  function  academies  are  strongly  involved  in  the development of quality training content for the benefit of as many people as possible. For example, the Manufacturing  Academy  has  developed  a  new  virtual reality  training  program  for  painters,  'Eye  Paint,'  which has  been  deployed  at  the  Group's  industrial  sites  in France.\n\n## b)  Developing  new  uses  in  training  and  the  learning experience\n\n2022 was a year of diversity and inclusion. Renault Group specifically aims to support women at key points in their careers and to become the employer of choice for women in the automotive industry by 2025.\n\nTo  support  this  ambition,  a  new  training  program ('W-journey')  was  designed  in  collaboration  by  the Group's  Talent  Management  and  Training  teams  with SKEMA Business School to help talented women take on greater responsibilities. This six-month online development  program  covers  topics  such  as  women's leadership, understanding business issues and image and communication management. Group work on an innovative project and collective mentoring round out this ambitious  program.  This  program  started  in  September 2021 has already trained 134 participants from 19 countries and all functions.\n\nDigital  training  also  continued  to  grow  in  2022  thanks  to the integration of new autonomous and distance training practices  with  a  major campaign  to  promote  distance language  training  and  the  creation  of  an  end-of-year calendar to discover one's learning style.",

Preparing  and  developing  our  talent  and  leaders  of tomorrow\n\n## a)  an  international  approach  to  identifying,  developing, and retaining talent\n\nTo support the Renaulution strategic plan and in a highly competitive  labor  market,  Renault  Group  is  adapting  its Human  Resources  policies to identify key talent, accelerate their development and preparation, and retain them for the Group.  The Group has an approach, 'Talent Accelerator,' deployed in all its countries to:\n\n- \u25cf take  more  risk  to  reveal  more  talent  earlier  with  a greater  variety  of  profiles  in  line  with  the  Group's strategic challenges;\n- \u25cf involve  and  empower  managers  in  identifying  and developing talent;\n- \u25cf better address new business needs.\n\nIn 2022, more than 5,000 talents identified worldwide, for whom development actions were defined.\n\nTo support the development of these talents, in addition to  the  levers  and  tools  available  to  all,  these  employees can  benefit  from  complementary  actions  locally  or globally:\n\n- \u25cf tools  to  have  a  better  knowledge  of  oneself,  become aware of one's strengths and boost one's development and impact in the Group;\n- \u25cf participation in cross-functional actions;\n- \u25cf mentoring;\n- \u25cf coaching;\n- \u25cf training in leadership, communication;\n- \u25cf international transfers.\n\n## b)  A  commitment  to  the  advancement  of  women  at  all levels of the organization\n\nThe Group aims to be an employer of choice for women. To  achieve  this,  Renault  has  undertaken  actions  which have made it possible to:\n\n- \u25cf increase the presence of women in the Group's highest management  bodies  (BoM,  CMC,  BMC).  This  share  fell from 22.1% at the end of December 2021 to 28.8% at the end  of  2022  thanks  to  the  management  of  internal appointments  and  a  proactive  policy  of  recruiting women (at least 1 out of 2 recruitments in 2022 of senior executives was a female). The objective is to reach 30% by the end of 2025 and 40% by the end of 2028;\n- \u25cf recruit more women in the Group: overall the Group aims to have 50% of women among all of its recruitments. At least  one  female  candidate  must  be  proposed  for  any position open to external recruitment;\n- \u25cf reveal  more  female  talent  through  the  new  internal talent identification approach.  The  proportion  of women among the talents identified by the Group, who will  be  supported  and  developed  to  enable  them  to access positions of responsibility in the Group, increased from 26% in 2019 to 32% in 2022;\n- \u25cf support the development of female talents:\n- -the  Group  offers  at  Corporate  level  but  also  at local country level, courses dedicated to women to support their development. At Corporate level, 2 flagship programs are offered each year, made up of a mix of face-to-face sessions, intersessional work, personal development modules, workshops and mentoring;\n- -W-Journey: is  a  program,  organized  with  the collaboration  of  SKEMA  Business  School,  which supports our female talents over 6 months for a transition  from  manager  to  leader.  134  talented women have benefited from this program since it was  set  up  in  2021.  In  2022,  this  program received the \"Digital Learning Excellence",

In this  context,  they  benefit  from  mentoring  with one  of  the  members  of  the  Group's  highest management  bodies.  70  female  leaders  have benefited from this program since its creation.\n\n## D. Assess individual performance\n\n## a) From the focus on results to the inclusion of behaviors\n\nThe Renaulution strategy aims to transform the Group to become  a  technology  and  services  company,  which means transforming the managerial culture and strengthening the collective and collaboration.\n\nThus, professional behaviors become as important as the results  obtained  because they are key to working better together and improving and strengthening the sustainable performance of the company.\n\nThe  performance  appraisal  was  reviewed  in  2021.  It  is based on three principles: collegiality, shared criteria, and dialogue and feedback throughout the year.\n\n## b)  Individual  contribution:  a  combination  of  WHAT  and HOW\n\nFor  Renault,  performance  and  individual  contribution result from the combination of the following two criteria:\n\n- \u25cf the WHAT or the individual objectives , i.e. the evaluation of the achievement of the objectives set in the year;\n- \u25cf the HOW or Professional Behaviors , i.e. the evaluation of how the results were obtained.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerformance evaluation is conducted by the manager. It is  systematically  enriched  by  a  collegial  assessment,  to guarantee  greater  consistency  and  fairness  within  the company during the annual 'People Review.' It is also fed by  the  self-assessment  that  the  employee  had  the opportunity to share before the People Reviews.\n\nIn addition, the assessment is based on the exchange and dialogue between manager and employee, during annual interviews  on  the  one  hand,  but  also  through  regular feedback  throughout  the  year.  The  annual  performance and development review is the opportunity to look at the results  of  the  past  year  and  discuss  the  employee's contribution to the team's performance. Regular feedback  will  allow  the  manager  and  the  employees  to discuss the progress of the objectives and the professional behaviors observed.\n\nIf  results fall short of expectations, an improvement plan is implemented by the manager and employee to restore a dynamic to individual performance.\n\n## c) Feedback as a development tool\n\nRenault wishes to encourage the culture of feedback as a key practice for individual development and the improvement of community performance.\n\nGathering  feedback  from  peers,  functional  managers and/or team members allows for better visibility into what is  going  well  and  what  can  be  improved.    Feedback  is  a useful tool for any employee in his personal development as  well  as  managerial  support  to  stimulate  teams  and cross-collaboration.\n\nTo  facilitate  the  request  and  collection  of  feedback , Renault uses the functionalities of the People@RenaultGroup tool.\n\nI",

Recognizing individual  contribution  and  engagement EFPD1g\n\nThe compensation of 'white-collar' employees is based on:\n\n- \u25cf the  level  of  responsibility . Positions  are  assessed according to their level of responsibility based on a work analysis  method.  This  method  has  the  advantage  of allowing Renault to compare its employee pay with the market  to  better  manage  competitiveness  and  the attractiveness of the compensation policy. The aim is to be able to recruit key skills and pay Renault employees at the right level;\n- \u25cf the level of individual  contribution  made  to  the company , assessed through the degree of achievement of the objectives set and the behaviors implemented to achieve these objectives;\n\nThe  variable  portion  of  the  compensation,  intended  for managers and executives, is built around a single scheme recognizing the performance of the employee, their area of activity, and the Group in a spirit of solidarity;\n\nNumerical  indicators  are  used  to  reflect  the  levels  of achievement set at the collective level.\n\nFor  2022,  the  Group  implemented  pay  increase  budgets reflecting some wage moderation in several countries.\n\nHowever, specific budgets are systematically maintained to reduce the gender pay gap in the countries concerned.\n\nThe  compensation  of  senior  executives  is  discussed  in chapter 3.2.\n\n## B. Sharing collective results and contributing to Renault's development\n\n## EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDING\n\nIn 2022, Renault launched Renaulution Shareplan, a largescale  employee  shareholding  operation.  The  aim  was  to involve all employees in the Renaulution strategy and the future performance of the Group.\n\nBy  making  its  Revolution  and  projecting  itself  into  the future, Renault is not forgetting its roots: on the contrary, it is  continuing  the  social  laboratory  tradition  that  has made it a unique company but bringing this tradition up to date.\n\nThis unprecedented operation offered each eligible Group employee:\n\n- \u25cf the allocation of 6 bonus Renault shares (offer rolled out in 29 countries), and\n- \u25cf the possibility of acquiring Renault shares on preferential terms (offer rolled out in 21 countries).\n\nUnder the subscription  offer,  eligible  employees  had  the opportunity  to  subscribe  for  shares  at  a  30%  discount from  the  average  of  the  20  closing  stock  market  prices preceding the date on which the Chief Executive Officer set  the  subscription  price.  The  subscription  price  was \u20ac22.02.  In  addition  to  this  30%  discount,  Renault  Group added  an  additional  300%  contribution,  capped  at 6 bonus shares.\n\nRenaulution Shareplan 2022 was a great success with the Group's employees: 95,396 employees benefited from the allocation  of  6  bonus  shares,  and  40,307  subscriptions were  recorded,  i.e.  a  subscription  rate  of  over  36%  at Group level.\n\nThe  details  of  Renaulution  Shareplan  are  discussed  in chapter 3.2.5.3.\n\n## INCENTIVE POLICY\n\nIn addition, for employees in France in particular, Renault applies an incentive policy that includes the redistribution of  Renault  Group  profits  as  well  as  bonus  payments  for contributions to site performance.\n\nThe agreement of April 14, 2022, signed for 2022 and paid to  employees  in  March  2023,  includes,  as  for  previous agreements, two components:\n\n- \u25cf profit-sharing  linked  to  the  Group's  operating  margin results;\n- \u25cf profit-sharing  scheme  based  on  the  performance  of each establishment.\n\nOver the past three years, profit-sharing and performance-related bonuses at Renault s.a.s. totaled the following amounts:\n\n| Year        | Aggregate amount: financial incentive +   |\n|-------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| (\u20ac million) | performance-related bonuses               |\n| 2020        | 121.5                                     |\n| 2021        | 122.4                                     |\n| 2022        | 149.9                                     |\n\n## C. Control of personnel costs\n\nThe  Group's  personnel  costs  totaled  \u20ac5,661m  in  2022,  of which \u20ac5,313m was for the Automotive Division. They are up by 3% compared with 2021. This variation is explained by  the  Group's  actions  to  adapt  to  the  crisis  in  the automotive markets, the control of our salary policy and the  implementation  of  an  employee  shareholding  plan. The \"10 largest countries\" (Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Spain, France, India, Morocco, Romania, Slovenia, Turkey) represent 87% of the Group's personnel costs.",

They exclude Russia and the Avtovaz Group\n\n## 2.4.2.2.4. A stimulating work environment that promotes diversity\n\n## A. A flexible organization of work EFPD2a\n\nBeginning  in  2021,  Renault  Group  voluntarily  deployed  a hybrid  work  organization  that  is  both  flexible  and innovative  and  now  concerns  most  of  the  white-collar workers. As such, employees around the world are offered the  possibility  of  adopting  an  arrangement  combining  a minimum  of  2  days  per  week  of  remote  work  and  a minimum of 20 % of working time on site. The principles of hybrid work were materialized by the unanimous signing on April 26, 2021, of an addendum to the Global Framework Agreement of July 9, 2019.\n\nThis agreement is gradually being rolled out worldwide. It provides  the  general  framework  and  allows  for  local adaptations to take into account specific aspects related to the activity or culture of the country.\n\nThe  first  step  in  implementing  the  principles  of  the  2021 agreement is to determine eligibility for hybrid work on the basis of objective criteria. Participation in the new hybrid organization is voluntary. For eligible employee categories,  the  principle  is  a  minimum  of  two  days  of teleworking per week and a minimum of in-person work of 20% of monthly working time to maintain and develop the social  connection  with  both  the  team  members  and  the rest of the company.\n\nOn this flexible, simple basis, a very rich social dialog has taken  place  all  over  the  world  and  has  led  to  local agreements (e.g. in France, Romania, and Germany) or the publication of new human resources policies (e.g. in India, the United Kingdom, and Brazil).\n\nIn  2022,  nearly 67  %  of  eligible  employees ,  or more  than 26,000 worldwide , voluntarily adopted a hybrid organization  of  work . This  profound  change  in  the organization  of  work  has  been  accompanied  by  equally important changes in the way people work.\n\nRenault Group also welcomes the fact that meetings have become  more  efficient  and  that  time  is  freed  up  for oneself and for more concentrated work. Finally, there are positive  side  effects  of  the  hybrid  mode  on  inclusion, particularly  for  international  teams  who  have  learned  to work better together in hybrid mode.\n\nRenault  Group's  pragmatic  approach  to  hybrid  work organization,  based  on  trust  and  accountability,  has become  an  important  element  of  attractiveness  in  its employer promise around the world.\n\nIn  parallel  with  the  roll-out  of  hybrid  working,  the  Group has  put  in  place  a  strategy  to  deploy  new  Renault workspaces.  The  aim  is  to  create  a  unique  workspace experience within the Group across all of its tertiary sites.\n\nThis experience is based on 5 pillars:\n\n- \u25cf a corporate strategy serving as a lever of transformation for the Group;\n- \u25cf collective intelligence to strengthen synergies;\n- \u25cf continuous improvement to increase operational excellence;\n- \u25cf financial performance to optimize our resources;\n- \u25cf business experience to develop our attractiveness and support innovation.\n\nThese  new  working  environments  are  intended  to  be deployed progressively as real estate opportunities arise and are currently deployed in 20% of the target scope.\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  agreement  in France has resulted  in  joint  discussions  with  the  social  partners (3 meetings) and negotiations, which led to the signing of an agreement on new working methods on June 10, 2021. This agreement sets out the main principles of the global addendum mentioned above. It defines a standard hybrid organization  of  work  formula  with  two  to  three  days  of telework  per  week.  Furthermore,  it  establishes  the principle  of  the  evolution  of  tertiary  sites  by  gradually putting in place new dynamic workspaces.\n\nImplemented in 2021, the new organization of work will be evaluated both in terms of employee satisfaction and in terms  of  improved  team  efficiency.  It  also  opens  up opportunities in terms of the real estate footprint and the possibility  of  redesigning  less  busy  workplaces  to  make them even more dynamic and collaborative.\n\nRenault  Group  complies  with  the  legal  obligations  and collective  agreements  in  terms  of  working  hours  of  the countries where it has operations.\n\nTo preserve jobs and adapt to fluctuations in automotive markets, Renault has instituted a system of flexible work time. It aims to find the best possible balance between the\n\nI",

The measures  focus  in  particular  on  the  conditions  for reorganizing  work  time,  such  as  by  adding  mandatory shifts to meet heavy demand or reducing work time when demand falls, notably by using individual or collective rest days.\n\nAt sites in France, for example, the average working week is 35 hours. In the factories, the principle is two alternating eight-hour shifts with, in the event of spiking demand, the possibility to add a fixed night shift team.\n\n## B. A company that promotes diversity and inclusion\n\n## a) An approach that fosters community spirit\n\nThe  Group's  diversity  and  inclusion  policy  is  designed  to enable all its employees, regardless of their differences or specific  characteristics,  to  interact  and  work  under  the best  possible  conditions.  On  July  2,  2013,  Renault  Group\n\nsigned  a  Global  Framework  Agreement,  'Committing together  for  sustainable  growth  and  development,' demonstrating its commitment to promoting all forms of diversity and eliminating discrimination. On July 9, 2019, an additional  agreement  was  signed:  'Working  together  to build a Renault Group working environment' (see chapter 2.4.2.2.6).\n\nRenault  Group's  Diversity  and  Inclusion  policy  is  now steered  by  a  newly  created  department,  the  Diversity  & Inclusion  Department,  which  reports  directly  to  the Group's Director, Human Resources. It works closely with all  the  countries,  functions,  and  entities  of  the  Group  to steer the diversity and inclusion roadmap and ensure its proper implementation.\n\n## b) Gender diversity within the Company  EFPD6a\n\nThe proportion of women in the Group's total workforce is 20.8%  as  of  December  31,  2022,  an  increase  of  0.5% compared with 2021 (2018 to 2021 are restated, excluding Russia and the Avtovaz Group).\n\n## Breakdown of women/men in the workforce over five years  EFPD1b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Breakdown of women/men by country\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMen\n\nWomen",

We  rely  on  several  levers,  in  particular  external recruitment  and  internal  mobility  and  promotion.  All specific HR processes are adapted to help us achieve our objectives,  and  each  country,  function  and  entity  has clear  objectives,  for  example,  regarding  the  recruitment of  women  or  the  percentage  of  women  among  trainees and apprentices.\n\nIn December 2022, we had 25.5% women in management positions.\n\nIn order to ensure, or even accelerate, their ability to move into  these positions, all HR processes aim to ensure they are identified and trained. On this point, the Group offers women a range of tools to assist with their development (mentoring,  coaching  and  specific  training  schemes), enabling  them  to  fulfill  their  potential  and  demonstrate their leadership.\n\nThe  Group  thus  offers  various  development  programs dedicated to women (see 2.4.2.2.2.C.b).\n\n## c) Anti-discrimination EFPD6c\n\nThe  Group  has  a  proactive  anti-discrimination  policy: zero-discrimination  policy,  review  of  whistleblowing  and investigation procedures, common system for monitoring whistleblowing reports, global internal anti-sexism campaign, awareness-raising and engagement mechanism  at  each  site,  and  implementation  of  zerodiscrimination advisers at each site.\n\nIn addition, Renault Group has signed external commitments:\n\n- \u25cf the  #StOpE  (Stop  Ordinary  Sexism  in  the  Workplace) Charter in 2020;\n- \u25cf the UN Women's Empowerment Principles in 2022;\n- \u25cf UN  Free  &  Equal  standards  against  discrimination  of LGBT+  people  (2020)  and,  in  France,  the  Charte  de l'Autre Cercle (2020) for the inclusion of LGBT+ people in the workplace (2020);\n- \u25cf in  France,  the  #ManifestInclusion  Charter  to  promote the inclusion of individuals with disabilities in economic life (2021);\n- \u25cf in  France,  the  Charte  des  50+  for  the  promotion  of employees over 50 (2022);\n- \u25cf the  International  Labour  Organization's  Business  and Disability Charter (2022).\n\n## d) Promoting talent at all ages  EFPD1c\n\nRecruitment  plans  have  made  it  possible  to  limit  the ageing  of  the  workforce  and  maintain  a  balanced distribution  by  age  group:  13.1%  are  under  age  30,  29.9% are between 30 and 39, 33.4% are between 40 and 49, and 23.7% are over 50 years old.\n\n## Breakdown of workforce by age group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe breakdown by age group is calculated on the global scope as of December 31, 2022.\n\nRenault  seeks  to  develop  its  employees  at  all  ages, notably  helping  young  people  enter  the  world  of  work through numerous initiatives  (see  chapter  2.4.3),  while  at the same time drawing on the experience of seniors.\n\n## e)  Integration  of  individuals  with  disabilities  into  the workforce EFPD6d\n\nThe Company  has embarked on the worldwide coordination  of  its  disability  policy,  creating  a  link between  all  country  initiatives.  The  purpose  of  this  is  to encourage the professional integration of individuals with disabilities,  to  improve  their  employability  (recruitment and  retention),  challenge  preconceptions  of  disability, ensure greater accessibility, and provide training to raise awareness among employees and managers.\n\nThe employment rate for individuals with disabilities was 3.01% in 2022, stable compared with 3.10% in 2021 (the 2021 figure  is  restated  and  excludes  Russia  and  the  Avtovaz Group).\n\n## 2.4.2.2.5. Promote the practice of physical and sports activities\n\nRenault Group affirms its commitment to sporting values and  associates  itself  with  national  and  international sporting  events.  Some  examples  in  2022:  Mobilize,  the Renault Group brand dedicated to new forms of mobility, becomes  a  partner  of  women's  rugby  and  the  main partner  of  the  women's  XV  de  France.  On  April  28,  2022, Renault becomes a Premium Partner of Roland-Garros for an initial period of 5 years (2022 to 2026 editions).\n\nI",

Sports halls and changing rooms also allow the practice of activities in the workplace, as in the Paris region  on  the  sites  of  Lardy,  Aubevoye,  Villiers-SaintFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, Guyancourt (Technocentre) or Boulogne, but also in the industrial sites, in France and abroad.\n\nFinally,  by  launching  sporting  challenges  (Call  &  Care challenge),  by  participating  via  the  Entente  Sportive  in solidarity  events  such  as  the  Course  du  c\u0153ur,  or  by sponsoring the company's participants during local foot races or races by bike, Renault is committed to supporting its employees in practicing physical activity.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.6. Social dialog\n\n- \u25cf Year after year, Renault Group confirms its determination  to  use  social  dialog  to  build  a  world  of work  in  a  constantly  shifting  environment,  be  it  at  the global or local level.\n- \u25cf This  determination  is  reflected  in  particular  in  the signature of Global Framework Agreements that make it  possible  to  reconcile  the  interests  of  both  the  Group and its employees.\n- \u25cf The Group's first Global Framework Agreement 'Committing  together  for  sustainable  growth  and development' dates back to July 2, 2013. This agreement between  the  Management  of  Renault  Group,  the members of  the  Group  Works  Council  and  IndustriALL Global Union sets out the social, societal and environmental responsibility of the Group. The signatories  have  committed  themselves  to  five  major lines of action:\n- \u25cf respect for employees' fundamental rights;\n- \u25cf social responsibility toward employees;\n- \u25cf corporate  social  responsibility  in  the  areas  where Renault Group operates;\n- \u25cf purchasing  and  relationships  with  suppliers  and subcontractors;\n- \u25cf preservation  of  the  planet  through  the  reduction  of the environmental footprint.\n- \u25cf The  Group's  second  Global  Framework  Agreement, 'Working  together  to  build  a  Renault  Group  working environment,'  was  entered  into  on  July  9,  2019,  between Renault  Group's  Management,  IndustriALL  Global  Union, the  French  trade  union  federations  and  the  other  trade union  federations  or  unions  represented  on  the  Group Works Council. This agreement, of which the Group Works Council  is  a  stakeholder,  and  which  in  October  2019 received  the  first  prize  for  the  most  innovative  collective agreement awarded by the Assises du Droit Social (ADS), aims  to  better  prepare  for  and  cope  with  permanent changes  in  the  automotive  industry  that  have  a  major impact on the labor market, based on five levers:\n- \u25cf an interaction on the changing working environment;\n- \u25cf a collaborative management system;\n- \u25cf a lasting commitment to inclusion;\n- \u25cf a work/life balance;\n- \u25cf adaptation of the working environment.\n- \u25cf An addendum to this 2019 Global Framework Agreement specifying the conditions for teleworking for Renault Group employees was signed on April 26, 2021, by Mr. de Meo for Renault Group, the Global Group Works Council  and  IndustriALL  Global  Union  to  provide  a framework for the transformation of working methods worldwide.  It also responds  to  the  expectations expressed  by  employees,  reinforced  since  the  health crisis,  on  the  possibility  of  mixing  face-to-face  and teleworking  to  improve  the  balance  between  private and  professional  life.  This  new  hybrid  organization  of work at Renault Group aims to get the best out of faceto-face  and  teleworking  activities  and  operates  on  a voluntary basis. It is based on the following principles:\n- \u25cf more  flexibility  in  personal  organization  of  work: organization of the week between telework and faceto-face  work  around  a  minimum  of  two  days  of telework  per  week  and  maintaining  at  least  20%  of monthly work time in face-to-face work;\n- \u25cf empowerment  and  autonomy:  based  on  individual objectives, free organization of work between individual,  collaborative  and  face-to-face  meetings with the team;\n- \u25cf respect for work/life balance: respect for the company's  working  hours  as  well  as  for  break  and holiday times (right to disconnect).\n\nThese  two  Global  Framework  Agreements  and  the addendum constitute structuring social dialog themes.\n\n## A. The  Worldwide  Group  Works  Council,  a  forum  for responsible social dialog EFPD4a\n\nThe Worldwide Group Works Council has 40 members:\n\n- \u25cf European Economic Area: 31 members;\n- \u25cf other countries: 9 members.\n\nIt is the essential  forum  for  social  dialog  at  the international  level:  its  members  regularly  discuss  major changes in the Group and its strategic priorities with the Group's  top  management and operational departments. When an exceptional proposed decision has transnational  consequences  likely  to  significantly  affect the  interests  of  employees,  the  Group  Works  Council meets as a European Works Council.\n\n2022 was marked by an unfavorable environment due to the various crises faced (COVID-19 pandemic, shortage of semi-conductors, rising raw materials costs, energy crisis, Ukraine-Russia conflict, inflation, etc.).\n\nIn  this  context,  maintaining  ongoing  social  dialog  was essential to provide employees with appropriate support.\n\nThe Group Works Council met 45 times in 2022: 8 internal meetings, 21 meetings of the Select Group Works Council, 5 extraordinary information and consultation sessions, in European formation, concerning the project to outsource certain activities as part of the global project to transform the Human Resources function, the project to change the RRG scope in Europe in 2022 and 2023, the project to sell RRG Belgium and RRG Luxembourg, the project to create a",

The agenda was established in line with the Group's current organization around the Brands (Renault, Mobilize,  Dacia)  and  functions  (engineering,  industry, human  resources,  and  P&L  statement).  The  plenary session  was  also  supplemented  by  3  presentations related  to  the  monitoring  of  the  Global  Framework Agreements  on  Ethics  and  Compliance,  Health,  Safety, Environment and Ergonomics, and Diversity and Inclusion.\n\n'In 2022, the Renault Global Group Works Council made a significant  contribution  to  the  transformation  of  Renault Group. In addition to the 2022 plenary session, the Renault Group  Works  Council  was  asked  for  information  and consultation  on  5  occasions  by  the  company  on  the transformation  of  the  Human  Resources  function,  the change in the European scope of Retail Renault Group, the sale  of  the  Belgium  and  Luxembourg  branches,  the creation  of  the  Horse  entity  and  the  creation  of  the Ampere entity.\n\nThe Renault Group Works Council was able to review the implementation of the 2013 global framework agreement 3 times in 2022 and the 2019 Global Framework Agreement 5 times.\n\nThe Renault Group Works Council was regularly informed of  the  situation  in  Ukraine  and  immediately  informed  of the end of Renault's activities in Russia.\n\nThe  Group  Works  Council  was  regularly  informed  of  the progress  of  the  Horse  and  Ampere  projects  through  no fewer than 7 meetings between February and November 2022.\n\nThe Group Works Council was involved in the deployment of the Renault Group Vigilance Plan through presentations and discussions.\n\nAlso,  the  Select  Committee  of  the  Group  Works  Council was  able  to  meet  in  person  again  twice  in  the  fourth quarter of 2022, including once with CEO Luca de Meo.\n\n'Through  these  extensive,  frequent  discussions,  the Renault Group Works Council's activity once again shows that social dialog is key to Renault Group's performance.'\n\n\u00c9ric  Vidal,  Secretary  of  the  Worldwide  Group  Works Council.\n\n## B. Long-term convergence between Group performance and employee quality of life in the workplace\n\nRenault  Group  endeavors  to  offer  all  its  employees  an environment and working relationships that are favorable to their individual development and improve their quality of life at work.\n\nWorking  environments  are  gradually  becoming  more flexible  and,  by  improving  quality  of  life,  enhance  the performance of the Company.\n\nEmployee  feedback  is  one  of  the  key  elements  in identifying  the  focus  for  improving  the  quality  of  life  at work. In 2022, Renault Group adopted a new digital tool to collect employee  feedback  in  a  faster  and  more comprehensive way. With simple interfaces, the platform makes  it  easy  for  employees  to  participate  in  surveys while protecting the confidentiality of responses. Advanced functionalities  on  the  analysis  of  quantitative and qualitative results allow managers and the HR teams to  quickly  focus  on  the  issues  that  need  attention,  track results,  and  cross-reference  data  between  the  various surveys  via  the  same  system.  In  June  and  July  2022,  a global survey on diversity and inclusion was launched via this  new  platform.  The  psychological  health  survey  and the  Group  employee  survey  are  also  planned  to  be deployed with the help of the tool.\n\nThe prevention of psychosocial risks and the promotion of psychological health remain a priority for Renault Group. To provide  the  best  possible  support  to  employees  in  the context of the health crisis, a support system has been put in  place.  In  France,  this  relies  on  occupational  health services, facilitators and coaches within the company, and aims  to  help  employees  and  managers  live  and  organize work as efficiently as possible in this new context.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  a  health  survey  was  sent  to  all employees.  It  was  constructed  based  on  the  COPSOQ (Copenhagen  Psychosocial Questionnaire), aimed to identify  risk  and  protection  factors  within  the  company. The  analysis  of  the  results  led  to  the  implementation  of appropriate action plans within the various business lines. In  addition,  the  skills  transformation  agreement,  CAR  22, which includes a psychosocial risk support and prevention mechanism,  has  enabled  the  deployment  of  tools  in  this area, aimed at developing primary, secondary and tertiary risk prevention. In the area of primary prevention, extensive communication  has  been  deployed  as  well  as  e-learning training  for  everyone  on  awareness  of  psychosocial  risks. With  regard  to  secondary  prevention,  several  training sessions  were  held  for  all  stakeholders,  employees, managers and staff representatives. Lastly, to strengthen tertiary prevention, the support measures were enhanced through  an  increased  use  of  psychologists  as  well  as  the reaffirmed role of our internal facilitators. To measure the effect of all these actions, a flash barometer, partly based on  the  health  survey  questionnaire  (12  questions),  was conducted  on  the  scope  of  the  agreement  (3  Flash Barometers over 2022).\n\nI",

Ongoing local social dialog  EFPD4b    EFPD4c\n\nThe social  dialog  at  Renault in France in  2022  was structured around three main topics:\n\n- \u25cf deployment of the Renouveau France 2025 agreement signed on December 14, 2021;\n- \u25cf consideration of the new metallurgy collective bargaining agreement;\n- \u25cf preparation and anticipation of the Group's organizational changes, in particular with the creation of two separate entities: Horse and Ampere.\n\nThese  last  two  issues  led  to  a  discussion  to  define  the content, scope and timing of a common social foundation for all Group entities in France.\n\n## Signing  and  deployment  of  the  Renouveau  France  2025 agreement\n\nAfter  several  months  of  negotiations,  the  representative trade  unions  CFE-CGC,  CFDT  and  FO  (75.8%  trade  union representation) and the Management signed a three-year social  agreement  entitled  Re-Nouveau  France  2025  on December 14.  The  social  partners  hailed  the  ambition  of the text and the associated measures, which will make it possible to guide the employment and skills of employees towards  value-creating  activities  of  the  future  while supporting  Renault  Group's  activity  and  sustainable performance in France.\n\nThe Re-Nouveau France 2025 agreement places France at the  heart  of  the  Group's  industrial  and  research  and development activities by situating future value-creating technologies  in  France.  Renault  Group  confirms  its commitment to allocate the manufacture of 9 new models to French factories and will make France the center of its engineering  for  decarbonized,  connected,  intelligent vehicle technologies.\n\nTo meet the mobility requirements of tomorrow, the roup must acquire new expertise. It is therefore committed to recruiting  2,500  new  employees  as  well  as  providing 10,000  training  and  retraining  courses  across  all  the business  lines,  in  particular  via  Re-Know  University.  The company will also continue to adapt its workforce and will proceed with 1,700 departures in engineering and support functions  by  the  end  of  the  agreement.  To  adapt  skills dynamically  over  the  duration  of  the  agreement,  the company  is  implementing  an  Employment  and  Career Management system (GEPP), which will be reviewed each year.\n\nA  1 st assessment  of  this  agreement  was  carried  out  in October  2022  and  showed  that  all  the  commitments made,  particularly  in  terms  of  employment  and  activity allocation, were being met.\n\n## Implementation of the common social foundation\n\n2 major events occurred in 2022:\n\nFirst,  the  Group  announced  that  it  was  considering  the creation  of  two  separate  entities:  one  dedicated  to electric vehicles and software based in France (Ampere) and the other to combustion and hybrid engines (Horse).\n\nAt  the  same  time,  after  six  years  of  negotiations,  the professional  sector  of  almost  all  the  Group's  French\n\nentities, metallurgy, entered into an agreement that shook up the social standard applied in the company.\n\nThis new  national  metallurgy  collective  bargaining agreement  (CCN)  was  signed  on  February  7,  2022,  by CFDT, CFE-CGC, FO, and UIMM.\n\nIt comes into force on January 1, 2024, except for the social protection  theme,  which  comes  into  force  on  January  1, 2023.\n\nThe changes that we need to make and that are the most formative  for  our  organization  are  those  relating  to classification.\n\nDuring  this  transitional  period,  the  companies  must deploy the new classification system.\n\nIn the framework of the Re-Nouveau agreement, entered into  on  December  14,  2021,  it  was  agreed  to  initiate  joint discussions  on  the  calendar  and  arrangements  for implementing  the  new  classification.  These  exchanges were  also  an  opportunity  to  define  the  involvement  and contribution of the central and local OSRs at key stages of the project.\n\nSeveral  consultation  meetings  in  April  2022  made  it possible to share with the trade unions the methodology that  would  be  used  for  job  scoring.  This  methodology, which allowed for the involvement of all the players in the business lines, HR, and the trade unions, was welcomed by all.\n\nThe changes in the Group's organization, coupled with the implementation  of  the  new  collective  agreement,  led  to the  signing  of  a  method  agreement  providing  the structure for the themes and scope of the future common social foundation on July 27, 2022.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  process  of  informing  and  consulting the  bodies  took  place  throughout  the  year  with  regular updates  on  the  reorganization  project  status.  Six  ESCC meetings  were  held  between  February  and  November 2022 to inform the elected representatives on this project. A  key  step  in  the  process  will  be  the  consultation  of  the central body on this issue on December 2.\n\nThree major negotiations were also held in the context of the implementation of this common social foundation\n\n- \u25cf To cope with the historical context in terms of inflation, the  signing  of  a  Purchasing  Power  Agreement  on October 11, 2022;\n- \u25cf The implementation of a complementary  health insurance  agreement,  allowing  all  French  entities  to benefit  from  the  same  health  cover.  This  agreement, signed  by  all  the  trade  unions,  will  come  into  force  on January 1, 2023;\n- \u25cf The  proposal  for  a  common  pension  scheme,  with negotiations to be completed by December 2023.\n\nInternationally , exchanges with local social partners were intensified, particularly in connection with the Horse and Ampere  projects  and  on  purchasing  power  due  to inflation.  Several  countries  (France,  Romania,  Spain,  etc.) have entered into agreements with specific measures on this subject.",

Contributing to the development and vitality of the territories EFPD14c\n\nRenault  Group  is  a  major  player  in  the  economic  and social  development  of  the  territories  in  which  it  works. Present in 38 countries, the Company considers that it has a responsibility to make sure that its impact on the regions where  it  is  located  is  positive  and  to  contribute  to  their sustainable  development.  The  Group's  ambition  is  to create  shared  value  for  the  mutual  benefit  of  the Company  and  all  of  its  stakeholders.  It  therefore  takes care to identify the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders that surround it (see 2.1.4) and to respond to them  as  far  as  possible  through  its  core  business  and setting up innovative solutions.\n\n## 2.4.3.2. An active participant through its core business activities  EFPD14b\n\nIt  is  difficult  to  truly  isolate  the  Company's  contributions within  a  complex  and  interdependent  socioeconomic fabric.  Beyond  direct  employment  generated  and  the taxes paid by the Company, the other direct and indirect contributions and  benefits  are  shared  among  the members of a network.\n\nAccording  to  the  figures  published  by  the  ACEA,  the association  of  European  automotive  manufacturers, 13.0  million  people  (representing  7.0%  of  the  active population)  work  in  the  European  automotive  sector (direct and indirect jobs - 2020 figures).\n\nThe number of direct jobs totaled 2.5 million (2020 figures). This includes automotive manufacturing, equipment and accessories,  and  coachbuilders.  Indirect  employment includes  other  manufacturing  fields,  vehicle  sales,  parts and accessories, maintenance, fuel, leasing and transportation, as well as construction and road maintenance and associated activities.\n\n## Retail Renault Group\n\nThe  Humanitarian  and  Social  Aid  Fund  (FASH)  was created  by  Renault  Retail  Group  in  2003:  it  arose  from  a collective agreement signed with the representative labor unions within RRG.\n\nThe  purpose  of  this  fund  is  to  grant  financial  aid  to  the employees  of  RRG  and  also  to  humanitarian  action associations.\n\nThe  FASH  continues  to  provide  help  and  support  for education,  health,  emergency  food  aid,  aid  to  regain mobility, disability and the environment.\n\n## 2.4.3.3. Societal actions supported by a global network\n\nThe Sustainable Development Department leads, coordinates and relies on a network of ESG correspondents in the main countries where the Group operates as well as on a newly created dedicated committee.\n\nSince  July  2022,  the  country  correspondents  have  met every two months to share local initiatives and maximize their contributions to the Group's sustainable development strategy.\n\nThe Group Sustainable Development Committee consists of  representatives  from  each  of  the  corporate  functions and  each  of  the  Renault  Group  brands.  Meeting  on  a monthly  basis,  this  group  of  Sustainable  Development correspondents aims to monitor and deploy the Group's environmental, social, societal and governance commitments.\n\n## Breakdown of social and societal investments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI",

Passing along knowledge for the future\n\nEducation  is  a  top  priority  within  Renault  Group.  Renault Group recognizes that providing training on the careers of the  future  and  giving  the  neediest  access  to  knowledge are  key  to  the  development  of  society  and  also  of  the Company.  Renault  therefore  continues  to  deepen  its commitments in this area.\n\n## 2.4.3.5. Bringing schools into the corporate world\n\nRenault Group  is committed  to  developing  talent throughout  life,  especially  among  young  people,  by helping them find their place in the world of work. Renault Group  develops  programs  and  initiatives  to  forge  links between the worlds of education and employment, and to professionalize  and  develop  their  employability,  with  a particular  focus  on  the  promotion  of  diversity  and  equal opportunities.\n\n## A. In France...\n\nIn  2022,  Renault  maintained  its  links  with  schools  and young people, in particular:\n\n- \u25cf as of the end of December, around 1,230 young people were  on  work-study  programs  in  France  (including 1,170  apprenticeship  contracts  and  57  CIFRE  training through  research  contracts).  As  part  of  the  '1  young person,  1  solution'  plan  and  its  commitment  to  young people,  Renault  Group  maintained  its  commitment  to take  on  5%  of  work-study  students  by  the  end  of December.  Of  the  1,170  apprentices  present,  663  were recruited in 2022;\n- \u25cf by hosting 624 young people on work placements;\n- \u25cf some  fifty  events  such  as  conferences,  talks,  school forums, coaching sessions and round tables took place in person  or  virtually this year, led by Renault recruitment officers or ambassadors;\n- \u25cf by  participating  in  the  'FIRST  -  Femmes  Ing\u00e9nieurs' event,  a  day  during  which  several  women  engineers from the company went to meet secondary school girls to  create  motivation  for  vocations  and  attract  young girls to scientific training;\n- \u25cf around  twenty  vehicles  or  parts  were  given  to vocational schools in France so that their students could be trained on recent vehicles;\n- \u25cf by  providing  financial  support  to  115  educational institutions  and  approved  organizations  through  the apprenticeship tax.\n\n## B. ...but  also  in  other  countries  where  Renault  Group operates  EFPD14d\n\nMany employees spend some of their work time teaching classes  at  different  schools/universities.  These  activities are  organized  either  through  official  partnerships  or  at schools and universities in countries where Renault Group operates.\n\nIn partnership with the local university, Renault Romania is developing  workshops,  run  by  company  employees  and aimed  at  young  people  to  them  enter  professional  life. These  workshops  help  them  prepare  for  job  interviews, look  for  a  job,  etc.  In  2022,  more  than  80  people participated in 8 workshops.",

In 2022, more  than 3,000  students  benefited  from  training  or  mentoring related to this initiative.\n\nSince 2014,  the  subsidiary  has  also  supported  vocational training  and  has  been  involved  in  the  development  of future  generations  of  automotive  specialists.  368  young people  from  technological  high  schools  in  Mioveni benefited from the 'dual education' initiative.\n\nRenault  Foundation  Spain has  also  signed  several agreements and is involved in various activities. Through its  'Renault  Graduates'  program,  Renault  Spain  is  a partner  of  universities  in  the  Castilla  y  Le\u00f3n  region  and offers  training  and  internships  to  20  young  graduates, 50% of whom are women. 75% of program beneficiaries are recruited.\n\nRenault Spain rewarded 7 projects related to sustainable mobility (2 proposed  by  students,  2  by  academic institutions, 2 by companies  and  1  by  the  public administration).\n\nWell  aware  that  knowledge  is  acquired  by  the  practical application of academic knowledge, Renault Group made numerous  gifts  of  vehicles  and  tools  to  schools  for educational purposes:\n\n- \u25cf in France , many  sites  make  such  donations  for educational  purposes  to  high  school  students  in  the areas where they are located;\n- \u25cf in Argentina , Renault  Group  donates  test  vehicles  to technical institutions to be used for student training. In 2022,  20  vehicles  were  donated  to  institutions  in  the provinces of Buenos Aires and Cordoba. This action has a triple impact: economic, environmental and social;\n- \u25cf in Spain , Renault  Group  regularly  donates  engines, gearboxes  and  vehicles  to  educational  centers.  This year,  the  company  donated  120  computers  to  the Government of Castilla y Leon for distribution to schools and  training centers in the region, as well as 14 computers to the Mornese Foundation. The subsidiary also donated 18 machines from their engine factory to the Cristo Rey technical school;\n- \u25cf in Brazil , Renault  Group  gives  access  to  Masters  to 4  NGOs  -  Casa  do  Zezinho,  Lar  M\u00e3e  Maria,  ADFP,  and Borda  Viva  Association  -  to  facilitate  the  mobility  of young people and students.\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nSustainable development\n\n## 2.4.3.6. Supporting access to education throughout the world EFPD14d\n\nRenault Group carries out numerous actions intended to promote  inclusion,  access  to  education  and  the  fight against dropping out of school:\n\nRenault  ElectriCity  is  planning  to  recruit  700  permanent employees by the end of 2024, as part of a joint initiative with local employment agencies, the P\u00f4le Emploi and all local stakeholders.\n\nFactory  visits  are  also  organized  with  the  national education  system  to  develop  school/company  relations. In 2022, the three Hauts-de-France sites hosted more than 300  students  of  all  profiles  (secondary  school  students, general and vocational high school students, engineering students, etc.). Unprecedented visits to the Maubeuge and Douai  factories  organized  for  the  families  of  employees by  small  electric  train  were  opened  to  local  secondary school  students.  The  Douai  director  sponsored  the  INSA Hauts de France (engineering school) class of 2021.\n\nWith CORIF (an association with strong roots in the north of France that has been working for 40 years to promote professional equality and gender diversity and to combat stereotypes  and  sexist  representations),  ElectriCity  is increasing the number of actions and visits to its sites for the  benefit  of  women  seeking  employment.  For  the second consecutive year, ElectriCity continues to invest in DuoDay  to  raise  awareness  among  managers  and  all employees of the diversity of disability situations at work, but also to give individuals with disabilities the opportunity  to  discover  the  industry's  professions  and enjoy a new experience. This year, six duos were trained in our factories.\n\nTogether with the UIMM de Sambre-Avesnois (Union des Industries et des M\u00e9tiers de la M\u00e9tallurgie), ElectriCity is a partner  of  the  EDIVAL  association,  which  aims  to  bring industry  and  the  educational  world  closer  together through  personalized  educational  visits  to  industrial companies. In this context, the ElectriCity communication team  has  worked  with  teachers  to  develop  educational materials  for  classroom  visits  (comics,  safety  animation, and presentation of professions). ElectriCity also supports the  Emergence  program,  the  objective  of  which  is  to enable talented young people from modest backgrounds to  pursue  the  studies  they  want  (which  are  often  long, selective  and/or  expensive)  and  to  build  a  professional future  that  matches  their  potential  and  ambition:  at  this stage,  two  pairs  (therefore  two  young  people)  are  being sponsored  for  \u20ac4,000  over  five  years.  Thanks  to  the participation  and  involvement  of  more  than  a  hundred employees  in  the  'Call  &  Care'  sports  and  solidarity challenge in June 2022, ElectriCity is supporting the Article 1  association  (\u20ac5,000  donation),  which  aims  to  prevent individuals aged 16 to 25 from working-class backgrounds in  the  Nord  department  from  dropping  out  of  school through  guidance,  success  in  higher  education,  and development  of  career  paths  for  better  professional integration.\n\nI",

This competition gives students (high  school  students,  apprentices,  higher  technician students or professional qualifications, etc.) in the vehicle mechanics engineering  section  from  all  over  France  the opportunity to showcase their skills and know-how and to promote  the  vehicle  mechanics  engineering  sector  by positioning  it  as  a  sector  of  excellence  open  to  all.  With 1,111 entries in the first edition, the competition highlighted the  interest  of  young  mechanics  in  participating  in  such an event. In addition to the experience gained through the trials and the opportunity to work in unique situations and on  unique  mechanical  parts,  the  moments  of  exchange with the team's motorists during the regional trials or the finals  allowed  the  candidates  to  perfect  their  know-how but also open up their personal and professional outlooks.\n\nFor its part, Renault Argentina supported the 'Neighbors Barrio Reno'  community  program  in  2022  to  help 98  beneficiaries  from  an  underprivileged  neighborhood near  the  factory.  The  aim  is  to  allow  these  individuals develop  their  own  businesses.  Partnerships  with  local authorities  and  NGOs  such  as  'Las  Omas'  and  'Innovar Sustentabilidad'  are  in  place  to  train  people  in  sewing, cooking and carpentry.\n\nFuture Generation  is another  important  vocational training  program  targeting  young  people  in  socially vulnerable situations in Brazil . This free six-month training course, intended for young people aged 15 to 24 who are still  enrolled in secondary school or who have completed their schooling, is designed to prepare them for entry into the labor market. It includes courses in computer science, management, citizenship, behavior and civics.  This  year, 80 young people finished the program.\n\nRenault  Foundation  Morocco contributes  to  improving school  conditions  in  the  regions  where  the  Group operates.  It  encourages  the  schooling  of  children,  in particular girls,  and  is  fighting  to  reduce  school  drop-out rates in rural areas through the supply of school buses. In 2022,  2,100  pupils  benefited  from  the  school  transport service every day.\n\nThe Foundation is renovating a school in a rural area. This year, the school is located in the Tangier region.\n\nSince  its  launch  in  2019,  the  BIBLIOBUS  initiative  has established  itself  in  the  rural  and  suburban  school\n\nenvironment of the regions of Tangier and Casablanca as an  essential  educational  event  to  support  reading  and cultural  learning.  The  project  was  also  selected  as  a benchmark by the Moroccan national education authorities for its high-impact pedagogical approach with a  view  to  deploying  similar  initiatives  in  other  regions  of the Kingdom.\n\nIn  partnership  with  the  organization  'AlJisr,'  30  young people over 18 are now being supported in the framework of a program  for  IT  training  and  integration  into employment in companies.\n\nThe Renault Foundation Morocco is  also  very  involved  in the  prevention  of  road  risks.  With  the  Tkayes  school initiative,  more  than  10,000  children  and  their  families benefited  from  the  road  safety  education  program  in 2022.\n\nThe Renault  Foundation  Romania offered  15  'Constantin Stroe' scholarships for the 2022 school year. Through the NGO  'Salvati  Copiii,' it helped 102 children from disadvantaged backgrounds to continue their education.\n\nThe  Foundation  launched  the  website  kilometrulbine.ro containing environmental education material, developed in partnership with the NGO Viitor plus.\n\nTraining and skills management are the essential drivers for  supporting  the  Group  in  achieving  its  objectives.  The Company  has  two  main  objectives:  on  the  one  hand,  to adapt its skills to develop its competitive advantage and still  better  serve  its  customers,  and  on  the  other,  to promote development through training in new technologies, notably digital.\n\nFinally,  to  support  the  transformation  of  the  automotive sector, in 2021 we created the ReKnow University. This new company  university  supports  the  transformation  of mobility  professions  by  ensuring  the  link  between  initial training  and  lifelong  learning  and  by  bringing  together various  players  (industrial,  academic,  institutional)  to design and disseminate innovative training courses. (see 2.4.2.2.1.B).\n\n## 2.4.3.7. Plants in transition\n\nWith 34 plants worldwide, Renault Group has an industrial system resolutely focused on the future, ready to meet the new challenges of the automotive sector and to customer expectations.  New  occupations,  new  know-how,  new tools\u2026  the  industrial  metaverse  is  the  driver  for  a connected,  agile  and  competitive  factory,  which  places humans,  i.e.  all  company  employees,  at  the  heart  of  the system.

More agile, more reactive and trained in new technologies,  employees  focus  on  the  highest-valueadded  interventions  and  take  advantage  of  these innovations to be relieved of certain operations. They are performing fewer and fewer arduous tasks.\n\nThe  automotive  sector  is  undergoing  rapid  change  with the ramp-up  of  electrified vehicles, customization, increasingly  connected  vehicles,  etc.  To  meet  this revolution, the automotive industry must adapt to ensure the  reliability  and  full  traceability  of  its  production  to ensure its competitiveness.\n\nRenault Group chose to digitalize its industrial system to support all employees, manufacture connected, customized vehicles and reinforce the customer's place in the  plant.  Through  this  approach,  the  Company  has  two aims: guarantee vehicle quality and the competitiveness of its factories.\n\nIn  October  2022,  Renault  Group  took  a  new  step  in  its digital transformation by launching the first ever industrial  Metaverse .  It  is  built  around  four  dimensions: bulk data collection, digital process twins, connecting the supply chain ecosystem,  and  a  set  of  advanced technologies. By 2025, the Metaverse will deliver \u20ac320  million  in  savings,  plus  \u20ac260  million  in  inventory savings, a 60% reduction in vehicle delivery time, a 50 % reduction in the carbon footprint of vehicle manufacturing, and a contribution to the Group's target of 60% reduction in warranty costs.\n\nThe supervision offered by the Metaverse through better visibility of the working environment allows the players to gain agility and autonomy in decision-making. Technologies  from  the  gaming  world  are  making  user experiences more immersive. This is the case for virtualreality painting training. AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms facilitate employees' ability to anticipate, such as optimization and flow management functionalities for supply chain experts.\n\n## Transforming our ecosystem to generate value creation\n\nSeveral  major  strategic  projects  are  at  the  heart  of industrial Renaulution:\n\n## Refactory: an unprecedented activity in industry\n\nIn November 2020, the Group announced the transformation of its site in Flins to create the Refactory, Europe's  first  circular  economy  factory  dedicated  to mobility,  with  the  target  of  a  negative  CO2  balance  by 2030.  Since  then,  this  transformation  plan  has  been gradually rolled out and will continue until 2024. The site is organized around four areas of activity, each with its own specialty: ReTrofit, ReEnergy, ReCycle  and  ReStart (see details in 2.3.2.2 'Resources and circular economy').\n\nThe Flins Refactory enables Renault Group to benefit from a  rapidly  growing  source  of  value  while  reaffirming  its industrial  footprint  in  France.  Its  aim  is  to  encourage initiatives,  develop  innovation  for  the  circular  economy\n\nand  contribute  to  Renault  Group's  ambition  to  achieve carbon neutrality at its industrial sites in Europe by 2040. A long-lasting, responsible reconversion, both environmentally  and  socially,  based  on  the  many  assets of the site and its employees.\n\nIn 2022, the Flins Refactory accommodated  the renovation activities of Choisy-le-Roi. Support and training  measures for employees at Flins and Choisy-LeRoi were put in place.\n\nRefactory  is  at  the  heart  of  the  Group's  sustainable development.  This  activity  is  intended  to  be  deployed more  widely,  as  with  the  Seville  factory  in  Spain,  which was inaugurated on December 2, 2022.\n\n## Renault  ElectriCity,  the  industrial  hub  and  leader  in northern France\n\nThis  major industrial project, Renault ElectriCity, not only aims  to  produce  480,000  electric  vehicles  per  year  by 2025, but also to bring together a complete ecosystem of suppliers  and  enable  Renault  Group  and  its  brands  to innovate and reduce many costs for greater competitiveness.\n\n## Accelerate  the  decarbonization  plan  for  its  industrial sites\n\nAs  part  of  its  Renaulution  strategy,  Renault  Group announced on November 24, 2022, an acceleration of the decarbonization  plan  for  its  industrial  sites  with  three strategic and unprecedented partnerships to achieve its energy transition objectives. This new  stage  was materialized with Voltalia for the largest green electricity supply  contract  in  France,  for  the  Group's  French factories: in Douai, with ENGIE  for  the  first  deep geothermal  energy  project  at  a  European  industrial  site, and  with  Dalkia  and  EDF  Group  for  the  installation  of  a biomass boiler in Maubeuge.\n\n## 2.4.3.8. Fondation d'entreprise Renault Group  EFPD14d\n\n## Promote  Renault  Group  as  a  player  in  the  field  of integration and commitment of employees\n\nThrough its philanthropic activity, Renault Group supports projects  for  the  common  good  linked  to  integration through  employment  for  the  most  disadvantaged,  in particular through the action of its Corporate Foundation and  its  foundations  in  the  countries  (Argentina,  Brazil, Colombia, Morocco, Romania and Spain).\n\nLaunched  in  2001,  the  Fondation  d'entreprise  Renault Group  supports  initiatives to promote  professional integration, focusing on Renault Group employment areas in  France  and  giving  employees  the  opportunity  to  get involved.  Its  projects,  with  its  partners,  aim  to  restore equal  opportunities,  to  advise  and  support  vulnerable people in their efforts to access or return to employment. Since  2021,  the  Corporate  Foundation  and  the  World Foundations have supported 15,231 people.\n\nI",

The measure was maintained in 2022.\n\nThe Fondation Renault is committed to supporting them by matching 100 % of their donations.\n\nIt also proposed that its employees become involved with the Secours Populaire 'Les P\u00e8res No\u00ebl Verts' operation in\n\nDecember  2022  by  allowing  them  to  contribute  to  a Christmas solidarity fund matched by the Foundation.\n\nEmployees  began  to  get  involved  with  some  of  the Foundation's  partner  organizations  (such  as  Solidarit\u00e9s Nouvelles face au ch\u00f4mage).\n\n## Art collection\n\nThe Renault Group Art Collection is under the supervision of its Corporate Foundation, whose mission is to promote the Group's Art Collection (more than 500 works by some thirty major artists) and to make it accessible to as many people as possible.\n\nIn  2022,  the  collection  was  showcased  during  three events:\n\n- \u25cf works by Victor Vasarely lent to the Fondation Vasarely in Aix-en-Provence;\n- \u25cf a work by Victor Vasarely and a work by Angela Palmer lent to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao;\n- \u25cf a  sketch  by  Victor  Vasarely  for  the  'L'occhio  in  gioco' exhibition in Padua.\n\n## Renault Group Foundations\n\nSix  of  the  Group's  countries  (Argentina,  Brazil,  Colombia, Morocco, Spain and Romania) run their own locally funded foundations.\n\nA strategic link of all the foundations around integration through employment began in 2021 under the leadership and  coordination  of  the  Fondation  d'entreprise  Renault Group.

This committee is responsible for validating,  evaluating  and  improving  the  effectiveness of the ethics and regulatory compliance mechanisms in place. It reinforces the protection of the company and its employees  in  all countries where  Renault  Group operates;\n- \u25cf the  Whistleblowing  Committee  (CTA)  composed  of seven  members and three  experts.  It  collectively  deals with whistleblowing received reports;\n- \u25cf the Country Ethics and Compliance Committees (CECP). Each  CECP  is  chaired  by  the  country  director  and coordinated by its ethics and compliance officer. It deals with  alerts  and  ensures  the  local  deployment  of  the ethics and compliance policy and measures.\n\n## 2.5.1.3. Highlights of 2022\n\nIn  2020,  Renault  Group  underwent an audit of its system for  preventing  and  detecting  corruption  and  influence peddling  by  the  French  Anti-Corruption  Agency  (AFA) under Article 17 of the 'Sapin II' law of December 9, 2016. The AFA sent its provisional report in the summer of 2021. Its receipt was followed by a procedure between the two parties,  at  the  end  of  which  Renault  Group  submitted  its written  observations,  which  were  analyzed  by  the  AFA before  the  release  of  its  final  report.  Renault  Group received  this  final  report  on  February  9,  2022,  and  has since implemented action plans to address the auditors' recommendations and observations.\n\nIn  November  2022,  the  Renault  Group  Code  of  Ethics  was updated  and  posted  online  at  Renault.com  and  the  Renault Group  intranet.  Widely  deployed  to  all  Renault  Group employees worldwide, through various forms of communication (kits, video, posters), it was drafted following some fifty interviews conducted with numerous organizational levels. It fuels Renault Group's raison d'\u00eatre and promotes  values  based  on  trust  and  respect  between employees, customers, suppliers, partners and shareholders.\n\nA  video  and  a  poster  on  the  whistleblowing  tool  were distributed to all  Renault  Group factories around the world, as  well  as  to  support  function  sites.  They  explain  how  to make a fully confidential whistleblowing report and refer to the WhistleB platform, Whistleblowing Centre via a dedicated QR Code easily downloaded using a smartphone.\n\nThe Anti-Corruption e-learning was updated in June 2022. Accessible to all Renault Group employees worldwide, it is posted  on  the  Ethics  and  Compliance  intranet  and  the\n\nLearning@Alliance  training  module.  All  Renault  Group employees throughout the world have been informed of it.\n\nIn  November  2022,  a  new  edition  of  the  'Inspiring  Ethics' seminar was held under the theme 'Good & Evil - two powerful testimonies.'  The  two  speakers  were:  writer  Laurence Devillairs, PhD, who spoke on 'What does it mean to be a good person  in  the  company?'  and  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Pierucci,  a  former ALSTOM  corporate  executive  accused  of  corruption  in  2013 who  shared  his  experience.  Organized  by  the  Ethics  and Compliance  Department,  the  event  was  broadcast  live  and offline  on  the  Renault  Group  intranet  homepage.  Held  every year,  it  is  part  of  a  process  to  raise  awareness  of  ethics  and compliance among all Group employees.\n\nInternal  tools  to  promote  and  share  the  ethics  and compliance  policy  (internal  kits,  videos,  posters)  are updated  regularly.  They  offer  clear  and  accessible information to Renault Group employees worldwide.\n\n## The ethics and compliance network\n\nThe ethics and compliance network was further strengthened.  It  is  composed  of  more  than  90  Renault Group  employees.  It  has  country  correspondents  whose scope of action covers the countries where the Group is present  as  well  as  function  and  brand  advisers.  The correspondents  and  advisers  may  be  assisted  by deployment leaders.\n\nThe  role  of  the  network  is  to  deploy  and  lead  the  ethics and compliance policy locally within the country and the business lines.\n\nThe Group Ethics and Compliance Department leads the network, in particular via e-conferences, newsletters and an annual seminar\n\n## Deployment of the prevention of corruption and influence-peddling plan  EFPD16b\n\nPursuant  to  the  'Sapin  II'  law  of  December  9,  2016,  on transparency,  the  fight  against  corruption  and  the modernization  of  economic  life,  the  Group  continues  to strengthen its overall system for preventing and detecting corruption and influence-peddling. The actions undertaken include but are not limited to:\n\n- 1. an update in 2022 of the Renault Ethics Charter, which concerns  every  employee  of  the  Group  and  commits the  top  management  to  the  fundamental  values  of integrity and respect;\n- 2. an  in-depth  review  of  the  methodology  for  mapping corruption risks, which takes into account the recommendations  of  the  French  Anti-Corruption Agency  within  a  scope  that  includes  the  countries, functions  and  Business  Units.  It  is  applied  to  these entities uniformly. In 2022, all the entities controlled by Renault  Group  were  mapped.  The  evaluation  of corruption  risks  was  formalized  in  127  maps  and  then consolidated into a single Renault Group map;\n- 3. the  Third-Party  Integrity  Management  Process  has been  rolled  out  in  the  Group's  main  subsidiaries.  The integration of this process into the DOA (Delegation Of Authority) approval circuit has enabled the inclusion of",

More than 36,005 employees have completed  this  training,  representing  94%  of  the registered population according to the position held in the company. The 'Ethics within Renault Group' online training was delivered to more than 28,882 employees, representing  93%  of  the  registered  population.  This training  rate  is  stable  compared  with  2021  (44,768 employees, representing 94%  of the registered population  according  to  the  position  held  in  the company). The 'conflicts of interest' e-learning course available  since  early  2021  was  taken  by  29,130 employees, representing 94%  of the registered population;\n- 5. the global whistleblowing system, available in 14  languages  and  operational  in  all  the  countries,  is supported by the local ethics and compliance officers. It  allows  current and former Group employees as well as external and occasional collaborators, suppliers, job applicants, and shareholders to submit alerts directly to  the  Group  Ethics  and  Compliance  function.  In particular, it is accessible confidentially at any time via an external site from a computer, tablet or smartphone, whether professional or personal. At the global  level,  460  new  alerts  were  sent  in  2022.  Of  the cases closed, after investigation, 33% were confirmed alerts, the main causes being unethical behavior, moral harassment and fraud;\n- 6. in 2022, the Group Compliance Department continued to carry  out  a  self-assessment  on  the  roll-out  of  the\n\ncorruption prevention system in the Group's entities and subsidiaries. This CCQ (Compliance Control Questionnaire)  received  input  from  29  subsidiaries excluding  France  corporate  entities  and  functions. Compliance tests were conducted on 9 entities to verify the quality of the responses and thus confirm the overall results. Eight audits including a review of local implementation  of  the  corruption  prevention  policy were conducted in 2022.\n\n## Compliance with laws, regulations and corporate rules\n\nCompliance with laws and regulations is a major objective of the Group. The Group  Ethics and  Compliance Committee  (CECG)  is  responsible  for  monitoring  these systems.\n\nThe Group  Ethics and  Compliance  Department  is responsible  for  overseeing  regulatory  compliance.  It  is responsible for ensuring that reliable systems are in place with the prescribing departments: Technical Regulations, Legal,  Environment,  etc.  The  Legal  Department  and  the Risk  Management  Department  provide  support  and assistance on this subject.\n\nThere  is  a  method  to  assess  existing  procedures, validated by the CECG. The Group Ethics and Compliance Department  applies  this  method  to  a  list  of  regulatory areas selected with the Legal Department. In parallel with this assessment, a rating of the seriousness of the risk of regulatory  non-compliance  is  established  with  each prescribing department (see 'Risk factors', chapter 4.2).\n\nThe  system  as  a  whole  is  managed  by  the  internal monitoring procedure for regulatory compliance.\n\nI",

Renault  Group  implements  a  responsible purchasing policy along its entire supply chain.\n\nWith  regard  to  suppliers  with  whom  the  Group  has  an established  commercial  relationship,  the  responsible purchasing  approach  is  detailed  in  Renault  Group's Vigilance Plan, set out in section 2.2 of this document.\n\n- 1. A  mapping  of  risks,  accompanied  by  methodology information;\n- 2. Procedures for regular assessment of the situation of suppliers  in  light  of  the  risk  mapping,  i.e.  audit campaigns and evaluations via an Internet platform;\n- 3. Actions to mitigate risks and prevent serious infringements:\n- \u25cf a  responsible  purchasing  policy  establishing  the principles  of  responsible  contractual  relations  with suppliers  and  covering  the  risks  identified  in  the mapping;\n- \u25cf a  decisive  criterion  when  choosing  suppliers  and subcontractors;\n- \u25cf Monitoring of corrective action plans following audits at supplier sites;\n- \u25cf an ESG-focused purchasing team;\n- 4. System for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness;\n- 5. A whistleblowing tool.\n\n## 2.5.2.1. Specific work in the cobalt/electric batteries sector\n\n## Mapping of minerals and materials risks\n\nRenault  Group  is  particularly  vigilant  as  regards  to  the origin  of  certain  minerals  and  materials,  for  which  risk mapping is also carried out.\n\nIn  the  light  of  Renault  Group's  commitment  to  human rights  and  fundamental  freedoms,  and  particularly  the fight  against  child  labor  in  its  supply  chains  of  minerals and  materials  from  high-risk  countries,  Renault  Group works in priority since 2017 with the cobalt sector, as this mineral is used in electric batteries.\n\nThe Group selected a specialist audit firm in this sector to fully  map  its  supply  chain  and  perform  on-site  audits  for the identified stakeholders.\n\n## Specific actions to mitigate risks and prevent claims\n\nIn  2019,  this  specialist  firm  carried  out  17  site  audits  for certain suppliers and subcontractors in the cobalt supply chain. Audits were conducted at each level of the supply chain,  starting  with  cathode  suppliers  and  even  down to some small-scale mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  (DRC).  No  critical  cases  of  non-compliance  were identified, and corrective action plans are being implemented.  In  2020,  the  monitoring  of  action  plans  by cathode suppliers and certain refiners continued.\n\nBased  on  the  lessons  learned  from  the  audit  campaign, Renault is updating its risk mapping starting from 2021.\n\nRenault  Group  is  also  reviewing  its  approach  to  risk management and audits, in particular to prepare for the European Battery Regulations that are being put in place. This  requires  an  evolution  of  the  organization  and associated governance, as well as continuous improvement in ESG assessments within the supply chain.\n\nAlongside  these  actions,  in  2021  Renault  Group  also initiated direct partnerships  with  key  raw  material suppliers in its battery supply chain.\n\nFollowing  the  partnership  with  VULCAN  Energy  set  up  in 2021 to source Lithium 35 , Renault Group  has  also implemented  agreements  with  TERRAFAME 36 for a sustainable  supply  in  nickel  and  MANAGEM  Group  for  a sustainable supply of cobalt 37 . These partnerships materialize  a  new  step  in  the  development  of  a  more sustainable and transparent battery value chain.\n\nFinally,  in  a  risk  anticipation  approach,  in  2022  Renault Group joined a group of NGOs, scientists and companies calling  for  a global moratorium on mining in the seabed , until it is not scientifically proven that this can be done in a sustainable  way.  The  seabed,  rich  in  minerals  necessary for  the  manufacture  of  batteries,  is  essential  in  climate regulation and for the generation of means of subsistence for women and men.",

Purchasing contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain\n\nSee section 2.3.2.1, 'Climate and energy efficiency'\n\n## 2.5.2.3. A local integration strategy  EFPD14a\n\nLocal  integration  is  a  major  element  of  Renault  Group's purchasing  policy  because  it  can  improve  the  Group's competitiveness, reduce its exposure to monetary fluctuations  and  contribute  to  the  development  of  the regions where it is located.\n\nA  local  approach  has  numerous  advantages  leading  to the reduction of costs. Thus, the local purchasing of parts can  reduce  transport  and  customs  costs.  This  proximity also  enables  the  Company  to  be  more  responsive,  to adapt  more  quickly  to  changes  in  demand  from  its customers  and  to  participate  in  local  development  and notably the local employment pool.\n\n## 2.5.3 Tax policy EFPD16c\n\n## 2.5.3.1. Applicable principles\n\n- 1. In  all  countries  where  it  is  established,  Renault  Group ensures  compliance  with  tax  rules  applicable  to  its activity,  in  accordance  with  international  conventions and local laws.\n- 2. In its relations with tax authorities, Renault Group aims at strictly complying with tax procedures and endeavors  to  maintain  good  relations  in  order  to maintain  its  reputation.  Renault  Group  endeavors  to create a lasting, transparent and professional relationship  of  trust  with  tax  authorities  of  different countries  and  opts  for  special  partnership  programs with the tax authorities whenever possible.\n- 3. Renault  Group  does  not  encourage  or  promote  tax evasion for itself or for its subsidiaries.\n\nTo promote local integration, Renault Group has created dedicated  teams  in  LATAM,  Morocco  and  India.  These teams, from purchasing, engineering, cost of goods sold and  logistics,  launch  local  calls  for  tenders  to  purchase parts that until then were imported.\n\nIn addition, Renault Group seeks to locate its suppliers as much as possible during the development phases of new projects.\n\nThe  localization  rate  is  intrinsically  connected  with  local regulations, currency exchange  rates, the Group's industrial  activity  (launching  of  new  projects)  and  may vary on a year-to-year basis.\n\n- 4. Renault  Group  applies  OECD  principles  for  transfer pricing,  and  intra-Group  transactions comply with the arm's-length  principle.  When  local  constraints  require deviation from  OECD  methodologies,  such  local constraints are documented.\n- 5. Renault Group is fully committed to the implementation of  regulations  aimed  at  ensuring  tax  transparency  at local, EU or international level.\n- 6. Given  the  complexity  of  tax  rules,  Renault  Group  may have  differences  of  interpretation  with  local  tax authorities.  It  then  reserves  the  right  to  contest  any adjustments that are deemed unfounded.\n\nI\n\n02",

Implementation of tax policy\n\nRenault  Group's  Tax  Department  is  responsible  for  the Group's tax policy worldwide, including the management of all tax-related risks.\n\nRenault  Group's  Tax  Department,  as  a  support  function attached to the Group Finance Department, is independent of the operational functions. It is supported by a local tax network in its mission.\n\nTax  risk  management  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Group's overall risk management process.\n\nThe Group Tax Department ensures the dissemination of tax compliance standards within the Group (Automotive, Sales  Financing  and  Mobility  Services)  through  internal communication channels.\n\nThe Group Tax Department takes a responsible approach to  managing  and  controlling  tax  matters,  based  on  the relevant  documentation  and  rigorous  internal  control  of tax processes.\n\n## 2.5.4 Cybersecurity and data protection\n\n## 2.5.4.1. Cybersecurity\n\nTo manage risks and protect its data, Renault Group has set  up  an  organization/governance  and  operational\n\nmeasures  in  matters  of  cybersecurity.  Details  of  these measures are given in Chapter 1.5.1.4. Cybersecurity.\n\n## 2.5.4.2. Personal data protection\n\nCompliance with personal data protection rules opens up a golden opportunity to strengthen trust between Renault s.a.s. and  its  stakeholders  (shareholders,  customers, suppliers  and  employees).  Trust  is  an  especially  strong value  for  Renault  s.a.s.,  and  personal  data  protection  is one of the main ethical bases for our actions.\n\nGiven  this  commitment,  Renault  designated  a  data protection  officer  (CIL)  in  2011  to  the  French  data protection  authority  (CNIL)  with  an  extended  scope. Subsequently,  the  Group  implemented  legal,  technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance with French  data  protection  law  No.  78-17  of  January  6,  1978. More  recently,  in  May  2018,  Renault  Group  appointed  a Data Protection Officer (DPO) in order to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since June  2019,  this  has  been  a  full-time  role  performed  by  a dedicated  expert  who  leads  and  coordinates  actions  to ensure that all of the Group's activities are compliant with these standards.\n\nThe Data Protection Officer relies (i) on a network of local DPOs, GDPR correspondents ('Privacy Ambassadors'), in each department who are responsible for managing the compliance  of  personal  data  processing  within  their scope, assisted by a network of Privacy Representatives within their department, and (ii) on a legal team dedicated to personal data protection. In addition, multidisciplinary working  groups  comprising  all  of  Renault's  function departments  and/or  the  IT  Department  and,  more specifically, the cybersecurity teams have been set up to intervene  both  periodically  on  governance  monitoring and  also  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  and  upstream  on  the implementation of new projects involving the processing of personal data.\n\nIn  order  to  make  all  Group  employees  aware  of  the protection of personal data, an e-learning training offer is offered to all employees. In order to optimize the time and\n\nthe comfort of the learners as well as the impact of these trainings, the e-learning is composed of:\n\n- \u25cf 3 fundamental modules lasting 25 minutes, intended for all employees;\n- \u25cf 8 targeted ten-minute modules for different businesses or regions (HR, IT, Marketing, Contractual relations, local specificities China & Korea, International data transfers, autonomous and connected vehicle, R&AE).\n\nThe  offer  is  deployed  in  11  languages and  the  different modules  are  assigned  to  employees  according  to  their profession  and  scope.  For  example,  three  targeted modules (Contractual Relations, International Data Transfers and Local Specificities) have been assigned to employees  of  the  Alliance  Purchasing  Organization)  in addition  to  the  fundamental  modules.  A  number  of documents,  frequently  asked  questions  and  guides  for implementing  personal  data  protection  from  the  design stage are available to the business teams to ensure that all projects  involving  personal  data  processing  are designed  in  compliance  with  the  applicable  regulations. Lastly,  model  appendices  relating  to  personal  data protection  and  security  are  made  available  to  all  Group lawyers and the various business lines to enable Renault Group to comply with regulations in its relations with third parties or even with other Group companies.\n\nIn order to monitor the Group's compliance with personal data regulations, performance indicators are established each month and on demand as required to continuously monitor compliance and its development on an ongoing basis.\n\nIn view of its digital transformation, the development of its activities  relating  to  connectivity  and  'data'  (mobility services, connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles) in order  to  comply  with  the  General  Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR), Renault Group launched a program to ensure the implementation of an organization,",

The  ambitions  of  this strategy take into account the requirements set by the UN Sustainable  Development  Goals  and  the  Paris  Climate Agreement, particularly in terms of combating greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn its Climate Report 38 ,  published for the first time in 2021, and in  its  first  Integrated  Report 39 ,  published  in  2022,  the Group  reaffirms  its  strong  commitments  to  sustainable mobility that respects its ecosystems.\n\nThe  Group's  ambition  is  to  achieve  carbon  neutrality  in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050.\n\nThe  Climate  Report  applies,  in  particular,  the  guidelines issued  by  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-Related  Financial Disclosures  (TCFD),  which  advises  companies  on  how  to evaluate  and  disclose  the  risks  and  opportunities  posed by  climate  change.  The  Group  has  supported  the  TCFD since  2019  and  considers  its  recommendations  to  be  a relevant  framework  for  communicating  to  stakeholders about on climate issues in the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nThe  Group's  lobbying  strategy  includes  a  continuous interaction  with  stakeholders  (civil  society,  NGOs  and public authorities). To this end, the Group's proposals take into  account  impact  studies  of  draft  regulations  or legislation  on  a  variety  of  subjects:  social,  taxes,  road safety,  and  the  environment  (including  the  fight  against climate change).\n\nIn particular, the Group's positions are conveyed to public decision-makers,  directly  or  through  associations  or unions, to answer their questions or propose adjustments, taking  into  account  the  interests  of  all  the  Group's stakeholders.\n\nThe  Group  is  not  politically  active  and  does  not  fund political  parties  as  part  of  its  public  representation.  In 2022, the Group was not involved in sponsoring any local, regional or national political campaigns.\n\nThe  Renault  Group  Anti-Corruption  Code  of  Practice 40 identifies  lobbying  activities  as  a  risk  situation  and,  as such,  provides  a  set  of  rules  to  be  respected  by  anyone who, in the course of their duties, is involved in a lobbying activity on behalf of Renault Group.\n\nAutomobile  Manufacturers'  Association  on  the  specific topic of connected services.\n\nRenault Group therefore takes all necessary precautions to ensure that personal data is processed securely and in compliance with regulations.\n\nThe  Group's  approach  to  lobbying  is  transparent  and precisely defined:\n\n- 1. By an internal system consisting of:\n- a. the  Renault  Group  Ethics  Charter 41 and  the  AntiCorruption  Code  of  Practice,  which  comprise  a  set  of principles and values that form the basis for the behavior of Group  employees,  both  inside  and  outside  the company;\n\nb.  the  Code  of  Ethics  dedicated  to  lobbying  activities, which constitutes a set of guiding principles based on the Ethical Charter  and  aimed  at  promoting  common references for anyone involved in these activities.\n\nAll lobbying activities are carried out in close coordination with the Public Affairs Department to ensure consistency of  approaches  in  keeping  with  legal  procedures  and ethical practices beyond reproach.\n\n## 2. By national regulations\n\nWith  regard  to  France,  in  compliance  with  the  applicable legal framework, in 2017 the Group was added to the register of lobbyists, which has since been made available online by the  High  Authority  for  Transparency  in  Public  Life  (HATVP) and  is  available  to  the  public 42 . In  accordance  with  the applicable regulations, the Group sends an annual summary of its lobbying activities and the resources devoted to these activities  to  the  HATVP.  In  2022,  without  prejudging  the declaration that will be made, the main positions defended by the Group through its lobbying activities in France, within the meaning of the HATVP guidelines, included:\n\n- \u25cf Support  for  the  development  of  carsharing  and  new forms of mobility;\n- \u25cf Promotion  of  incentives  and  binding  targets  for  the integration of clean vehicles into the fleets of entities;\n- \u25cf Promotion  of  a  balanced  ecological  tax  system  that supports the sale of electrified vehicles;\n- \u25cf Support for  measures for  the  decarbonization  of  sites, their conversion to the new value chains resulting from the  transformation  of  the  automotive  sector,  and  the resulting  transformation  of  skills  (within  the  company itself or within the sector);\n- \u25cf Issues related to the management and access to data, communication and connection of vehicles;\n- \u25cf Support  for  the  deployment  of  public  and  private charging stations.\n\nI",

Other Automotive services,  Sales  Financing and mobility services were not included;\n- \u25cf Investments  (Capex) :  all  acquisitions  of  intangible  and tangible fixed assets, as detailed respectively in Note 10-A1 and Note 10-B to the Consolidated Financial Statements are eligible  because  they  contribute  to  the design,  manufacture,  distribution  of  automotive  goods as well as their financing and rental of vehicles;\n- \u25cf Operational expenses (Opex) : non-capitalized Research and Development costs, as disclosed in Note 10-A2 to the Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  represent  the  bulk of  eligible  activities  in  addition  to,  for  much  smaller amounts,  variable, short-term or low-value rental expenses not restated under IFRS 16 Leases, as disclosed in Note 6-C to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Method used to determine the scope of activities  with  a substantial contribution\n\n## Turnover\n\nTo  determine  the  substantial  contribution  of  eligible vehicle-related activities, we analyzed sales figures based on  vehicle  model  and  powertrain  technology.  For  spare parts,  as  we  do  not  have  the  information  system  that would  allow  direct  identification  of  parts  fitted  to  lowemission vehicles, we estimated this turnover in\n\nproportion to  the  \"workshop\"  turnover  achieved  for  lowemission vehicles.\n\n## Investments\n\nTo  determine  the  substantial  contribution  of  eligible vehicle-related  activities,  we  analyzed  the  Capex  and capitalized R&D expenditure based on vehicle model and powertrain technology in the same way as for turnover. . These  investments  have  been  reserved  for  new  lowemission vehicle projects. Capital expenditure common to both  electric  and  internal-combustion  vehicles  (such  as for  equipment  fitted  on  multiple  models)  has  been prorated for sales of low-emission vehicles in the mediumterm sales plan.\n\n## Operational expenditure\n\nThe  allocation  of  operational  expenditure  to  economic activities followed the same logic as described for capital expenditure. Wherever possible, non-capitalized research and  development  costs  have  been  directly  allocated  to the  vehicles.  They  have  been  included  if  the  vehicles  in question  make  a  substantial  contribution  to  the  climate change mitigation  objective.  We  have  not  included  noncapitalized  research  and  development  costs  directly attributable  to  vehicles  that  do  not  meet  the  selection criteria. Non-capitalized research and development costs that  were  not  clearly  attributable  to  a  particular  vehicle project - notably upstream research projects - and other operating  costs  have  been  included  on  a  proportional basis  using  allocation  formulas  similar  to  those  used  for capital expenditure.\n\nI\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nSustainable development",

Therefore, the aligned turnover is declared zero.\n\n## Opex and Capex\n\nDNSH  criteria  for  pollution  prevention  and  control  can only be verified on\n\n- \u25cf Research and Development costs, excluding operations where  substances  of  concern  could  be  used,  such  as the manufacture of prototypes;\n- \u25cf Capex  relating  to  development  and  industrialization studies  carried  out  by  the  suppliers  appointed  for  the manufacture of parts and equipment.\n\n## Methods used for checking DNSH criteria\n\nThe  necessary  checks  were  carried  out  at  vehicle production sites where low-emission passenger cars and light  commercial vehicles offered by the Group's various brands are produced. outside China.\n\nThe planned in-depth investigations could not, to date, be carried  out  in  China  due  to  the  health  constraints  put  in place by the Chinese authorities.\n\n| Site       | Country   | Vehicles produced        |\n|------------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| Batilly    | France    | Master ZE                |\n| Douai      | France    | Megane 5 E-Tech Electric |\n| Flins      | France    | Zoe                      |\n| Maubeuge   | France    | Kangoo ZE                |\n| Novo Mesto | Slovenia  | Twingo ZE                |\n| Palencia   | Spain     | Megane 4 E-Tech (PHEV)   |\n| Valladolid | Spain     | Twizy                    |\n\n## Climate change adaptation\n\nUnder the  TCFD  (see  2.3.2.1.4.3),  we  carried  out  a  climate risk and vulnerability assessment to identify sites likely to be affected by physical climate risks. The physical climate risks  we identified were assessed on the basis of the life of the asset concerned.\n\n## Sustainable  use  and  protection  of  water  resources  and marine resources\n\nIn all of the Group's factories, the water resources needed for vehicle production are used with a view to sustainability and reducing the environmental footprint. In addition to complying with applicable regulations and the ban  on  using  any  non-renewable  water  source,  the factories  are  committed  to  reducing  the  quantities  of water  needed  to  produce  a  vehicle  (see  water  section) and  to  reducing  toxic  metal  emissions  that  can  impact water  resources  (target  of  35  %  reduction  in  Ni  and  Zn emissions  between  2013  and  2023).  Strong  actions  have been implemented, such as:\n\n- \u25cf in the Douai and Palencia factories, replacement of prepainting surface treatment technology with nickel-free technology;\n- \u25cf in the Maubeuge  or  Flins  factories:  recycling  of rainwater.\n\n## Transition to a circular economy\n\nThe  Group's  eco-design  standards  applied  to  vehicles and  batteries,  which  allow  for  the  frugal  use  of  rare materials,  the  integration  of  recycled  materials,  the predisposition of vehicles to their dismantling and end-oflife recycling (see 2.3.2.2).\n\n95% of the  mass  of  Group  vehicles  sold  worldwide  have been recyclable or recoverable (see 2.3.2.2.1) since 2007. All the low-emission vehicles that the Group finances, leases or operates were put on the road after this date.\n\nAt the end of the life of the electric vehicles marketed by the  Group,  their  battery  is  collected  and  directed  to  a second life or recycled following a diagnosis of its state of health (see 2.3.2.2).\n\nWith  regard  to  waste  management,  Renault  Group  and the  Group's  European  factories  producing  low-emission vehicles  prioritize  recycling  by  aiming  to  minimize  any landfill and have set ambitious targets for 2023 (base year 2013):\n\n- \u25cf reduce  the  amount  of  non-recycled  waste  per  vehicle produced by 30%;\n- \u25cf reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated per vehicle produced by 19%;\n- \u25cf reduce  the  amount  of  mixed  non-hazardous  waste generated by 26%;\n- \u25cf achieve 87% waste recovery.",

Thus,  between  2010 and  2022,  the  Group  reduced  the  number  of  hazardous chemicals used on Group sites by 68% (see 2.3.2.3).\n\nAll  substances  listed  in  Annexes  I  and  II  of  the  POP (Persistent  Organic  Pollutants)  Regulation  are  banned from  use  in  the  Group  (classified  as  black  in  internal standard  00-10-050).  Our  substance  standards  require that parts do not contain mercury or mercury compounds above  the  threshold  of  0.1%  m/m,  or  substances  that deplete  the  ozone  layer.    The  other  REACH  hazardous substances used are declared on www.Renault.com and in the SCIP database.\n\nThe Group is proactive in banning \"SVHC\" substances in new vehicle projects when an alternative solution exists. Renault voluntarily agrees not to use \"SVHC\" substances 7  years  ahead  of  their  regulatory  ban  on  average,  by contracting the RNES-B-0027 standard with its suppliers. For example, Renault is taking the initiative to replace UV absorbers  that  have  been  used  to  protect  plastics  from aging in the sun (such as UV 320, 327, 328, 350 benzotriazoles) by banning them now.\n\nBy  definition,  low-emission  vehicles  meet  the  emission thresholds for clean light-duty vehicles set out in Table 2 of  the  Annex  to  Directive  2009/33/EC  of  the  European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n## Specific criteria for activity 6.5 \"Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles\"\n\nThe low-emission vehicles that the Group finances, leases or  operates  are  all  equipped  with  tires  in  external  road noise  and  resistance  classes  that  comply  with  the European requirements set out in EC Regulation 661/2009. In 2022, 40 different tire references could be fitted to the electric vehicles produced by the Group: 80% of them are both  energy  class  A  or  B  and  noise  class  A  or  B,  which places them, according to these criteria, in the 7.6% best tire references recorded in the EPREL database. However, the Group does not currently have information relating to the  references  of  the  tires  currently  fitted  to  the  fleet  of financed and leased vehicles, and therefore cannot make a  robust  estimate  of  the  turnover  corresponding  to  this criteria.\n\nWith  a  certified  noise  level  well  below  68  dBA,  Renault electric  vehicles  have  met,  since  2021,  the  external  noise limits applicable starting in 2024, thus contributing to the reduction of ambient noise and the quality of life in urban areas.  All  vehicles  placed  on  the  market  by  Renault  in Europe in 2021 therefore comply with European regulation 540/2014/EC  applicable  to  vehicles  certified  since  July 2016, which require a maximum of 72 dBA (see 2.3.2.3.3)\n\n## Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nIn addition to the environmental impact studies conducted  in  accordance  with  national  and  European regulations,  Renault  Group  is  proactive  in  its  defense  of biodiversity and ecosystems. (see 2.3.2.4.1).\n\n## Verification of Minimum Social Safeguards\n\nIn  application  of  Article  18  of  the  European  Taxonomy, Renault  Group  considers  that  the  minimum  safeguards are defined by:\n\n- \u25cf UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights;\n- \u25cf Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO);\n- \u25cf OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and\n- \u25cf Fundamental Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights.\n\nAll  these  initiatives  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  Renault Group  meets  the  requirements  of  the  minimum  social safeguards.\n\n## UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\n\nRenault Group adheres to the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact (see 2.1.3).\n\n## Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization\n\nRenault  Group  signed  the  global  framework  agreement on social, societal and environmental responsibility of July 2,  2013,  which is  a  measure included in the vigilance plan (see 2.2.1).\n\n## OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises -Fundamental Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights\n\nThe  Group's  alignment  with  these  principles  is  assessed through the following initiatives:\n\n- \u25cf Group Ethics Charter and its variations, approved by the Renault  Board  of  Directors  on  October  3,  2012,  and which is part of the ethics and compliance system (see 2.5.1.1);\n- \u25cf Vigilance  plan,  covering  the  activities  of  Renault  S.A. and those of companies controlled directly or indirectly, as  well  as  the  activities  of  subcontractors  or  suppliers with  whom  an  established  commercial  relationship  is maintained (see 2.2);\n- \u25cf Second Global Framework Agreement 'Working together to build a Renault Group working environment' of July 9, 2019;\n- \u25cf Addendum to the  2019  Framework  Agreement  of  April 26, 2021;\n- \u25cf Renault Group Declaration of Employees' Fundamental Rights  of  October  12,  2004,  which  was  enriched  by  the framework agreement mentioned above;\n- \u25cf World Group Committee (see 2.4.2.2.6);\n- \u25cf Group Ethics and Compliance Committee (CECG) (which is a vigilance measure of the Renault Vigilance Plan);\n\nI",

Having  noted certain discrepancies between the English version and its translation into French, Renault Group has chosen to refer only  to  the  original  English  version  of  the  Taxonomy regulation, which is the most widely used in our industry, in order to favor the comparability of performance indicators.\n\n## 2.6.1.2. Methodological comments on a selection of environmental indicators\n\n## A. Lifecycle Assessment\n\nRenault Group conducts lifecycle assessments in accordance  with  ISO  14040  and  ISO  14044.  Renault  uses the GaBi LCA (PE International) software and databases.\n\nThe lifecycle inventory describes all the elements that are taken  into  account  in  the  lifecycle  assessment  of  a vehicle.  These  data  are  related  to  lifecycle  stages,  from the vehicle's manufacturing to its recycling, and including its usage phase:\n\n- \u25cf raw  materials  and  manufacturing:  thanks  to  Renault's internal databases, each vehicle is described in terms of the raw materials it contains. These data, coupled with those  in  the  GaBi  database,  allow  all  phases  of  the extraction  and  processing  of  raw  materials  to  be incorporated in the inventory. The data on the manufacturing  of  vehicles  integrated  in  the  lifecycle inventory comes  from  the  annual  environmental reporting  for  the  industrial  sites,  which  is  subjected  to verification by an Independent Third Party;\n- \u25cf usage  and  maintenance  phase:  the  usage  phase  is calculated  over  10  years  and  150,000  km.  The  certified emissions  for  the  regulatory  cycle  are  taken  into consideration.  Moreover,  the  impacts  associated  with the  energy  consumption of vehicles (diesel,  gasoline  or electricity)  are  calculated  from  'well  to  wheel',  i.e.,  the emissions associated with the production and transport of the energy used are taken into account. In the usage phase, the maintenance activities performed throughout  the  life  of  the  vehicle  (tire  changes,  oil changes, brake fluid, etc.) are taken into account;\n- \u25cf end-of-life: emissions related to recycling processes are accounted for. The recycling of materials from vehicles enables  the  use  of  virgin  material  and  associated emissions to  be  avoided.  The  emissions  avoided  in  this way are deducted from the carbon footprint.\n\nAll potential impacts are calculated using the GaBi software.\n\n## B. Carbon footprint\n\nThe purpose of determining Renault's carbon footprint is to  measure  and  propel  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas\n\nemissions in Renault Group. The following methodologies have accordingly been chosen:\n\n- \u25cf the  carbon  footprint  is  compared  with  the  number  of vehicles sold;\n- \u25cf in the event of sales or acquisitions, the reference value (2010)  is  corrected  to  take  into  account  or  subtract  the site's  emissions  at  that  date  in  order  to  measure changes  in  the  Group's  carbon  footprint  in  relation  to 2010 on a comparable scope of activity;\n- \u25cf if there is an update to the model in the GaBi tool used to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the materials and parts purchased (see above), the 2010 reference value is recalculated with the new database in order  to  measure  the  changes  to  the  indicator  on  a comparable  basis.  This  happened  in  2015  and  2018.  In addition, to factor in the environmental performance of suppliers  between  model  updates  in  the  GaBi  tool,  a carbon performance factor of -2% per year is applied;\n- \u25cf the carbon footprint is calculated for a constant scope of emissions.  When  the  scope  is  amended,  the  2010 benchmark value is recalculated. In 2017, the calculation scope  was  extended  to  include:  RRG,  vehicles  bought from  and  sold  to  partners,  filling  of  air-conditioning systems (for premises and vehicles), vehicle and engine testing and indirect emissions linked to purchase thermal energy.  In  2018  two  foundries  were  integrated  into  the scope  without  recalculating  the  2010  benchmark  value, this being a capacity extension rather than an integration  of  a  pre-existing  entity.  In  2020,  vehicle  airconditioning maintenance was taken into account, with a recalculation of the 2010 reference value. The conversion factors between certification cycles were also updated.\n\nThe  carbon  footprint  for  Renault  does  not  include  a prospective dimension. The value retained for the carbon intensity  of  fuel  and  industrial  processes  is  that  of  the vehicle release year and does not vary during the lifecycle of the vehicle (10 years, 150,000 km).\n\nThe  table  on  the  next  page  indicates  the  scope  of emissions  covered  by  the  Renault  carbon  footprint indicator as well as the origin of the data used and the level of external verification applied. To facilitate understanding, the categories  of  the  Renault  carbon  footprint  are matched to those of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.",

Revenues from circular economy activities\n\nThis  indicator  is  calculated  by  totaling  2022  revenues regardless of Renault Group's stake in the capital of each entity.\n\n- \u25ba turnover from the used vehicle reconditioning activity of the Flins Refactory (UV Factory);\n- \u25ba revenue related to sales of remanufactured components ('standard exchange' range);\n- \u25ba turnover  of  the  Gaia,  INDRA  and  Boone  Comenor Metalimpex subsidiaries);\n- \u25ba turnover of the Mobilize subsidiary linked to second-life or  dynamic  storage  applications  (Advanced  Battery Storage) for electric vehicle batteries.\n\nThis  indicator  is  published  on  the  basis  of  constant material  prices  to  ensure  continuity  in  the  monitoring  of performance. 2019, the year considered representative of the  \"average\"  prices  of  the  main  materials  taken  into account in the indicator (steel, copper, platinum, rhodium, palladium  and  polypropylenes)  was  chosen  as  the reference year. As 2022 saw a sharp rise in material prices, the  indicator  stands  at  \u20ac972m  before  correction  for  the price  effect,  and  \u20ac651m  after  correction  based  on  2019 material prices.\n\n## 2.6.1.3. Methodological comments on the table 'Site environmental indicators for 2022'\n\nReporting for the environmental indicators was conducted in accordance with the stipulations of the 2022 Environmental Protocol for Renault Sites. The following is an explanation of the main methodological choices of the Protocol.  This  Protocol  is  available  on  request  from  the Environment  Department  of  the  Group's  Health,  Safety, Environment and Ergonomics Division (DHSEE).\n\n## Scope\n\nThe  'scope'  of  the  reported  data  covers  the  industrial subsidiaries  (body  assembly,  final  assembly,  powertrain and foundry) and the support sites (product and process design,  logistics)  in  the  Renault  Group  financial  scope  of consolidation.\n\nCompared with the 2021 scope, the following entities have left the reporting scope:\n\n- \u25cf Togliatti, Izhevsk and Moscow following the sale of the sites on May 16, 2022;\n- \u25cf Choisy:  transfer  of  activity  to  the  Flins  Refactory between November 2021 and June 2022;\n- \u25cf ACI Villeurbanne: transfer of activity to the Meyzieu site, ceasing operations on February 28, 2022.\n\nNote:  the  AlpineF1  Team  sites  in  Viry-Ch\u00e2tillon  and Enstone  are  excluded  from  the  scope  of  environmental reporting, as the former produces engines exclusively for competition  vehicles  (Formula  1),  and  the  latter  designs and assembles these vehicles. These two sites represent less than 1% of the Group's production and workforce.\n\nImpacts of suppliers or third parties present on site are not included,  with  the  exception  of  the  sites  listed  under  the 'Site environmental indicators in 2022' table. All impacts arising  from  employee  catering  facilities,  CSR  activities and social  partner  activities  are  included  in  the  data  for the Renault sites.\n\nThe  data  for  sites  included  in  the  scope  of  reporting  in year Y are consolidated with those of other sites only from year Y+1. As such, the information on the Puiseaux site is consolidated for this exercise.\n\nData from Gaia are taken into account at sites where Gaia operates, except the Flins site (France), where Gaia waste is covered by a specific contract. The waste generated by Gaia at the Flins site represents less than 1% of the total waste generated by the Group.\n\nThe  drinking  water  production  and  Davidesti  waste storage  activity  at  the  Pitesti  site  (Dacia)  were  removed from the reporting scope. For the drinking water activity, consumption  is  not  related  to  the  site  activity  and represents 2% of the Group total for external water supply and  less  than  1%  for  all  other  indicators.  For  landfill,  the quantities represent less than 1% of the Group total.\n\n## Data control and consolidation procedures\n\nSpecialized  experts  from  the  Group  DHSEE  check  the consistency  of  data  at  each  site.  These  checks  include  a comparison with data from previous years and an analysis of the impact of events occurring on site during the year.\n\nThe  environmental  data  presented  in  the  Universal Registration  Document  have  also  been  subjected  to external  verification  by  the  independent  third  party, KPMG.  Their  conclusions  are  set  out  in  the  report  in section 2.6.6.\n\n## Vehicle production\n\nThe vehicles counted are those that have gone through the fall-off  mechanical  line  manufacturing  stage,  which  is standard  for  all  bodywork/assembly  plants.  From  this counting point,  the  vehicles  leave  the  assembly  line.  They can  be  driven  and  are  considered  to  be  manufactured, even if they have to be reworked and/or tested afterwards.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nWater  consumption  is  expressed  in  thousands  of  cubic meters (m 3 ).\n\nMeasured  volumes  include  water  obtained  by  pumping (underground and surface water) and/or external networks  (drinking  water,  industrial  water).  Collected rainwater  (Aveiro,  Giheung,  Guyancourt,  Flins,  Maubeuge and Medellin) is also included.",

Discharges  from  some  plants  may  subsequently  be treated  in  municipal  treatment  plants  (see  plant  codes 2.6.1.4).\n\nUnder the Reporting Protocol, the frequency of discharge analysis  must  comply  with  the  regulations  applicable  to the Renault sites.\n\nThe quantity of COD  (Chemical  Oxygen  Demand) represents the flow of organic pollutants discharged. This quantity is expressed in metric tons per year.\n\nThe  Zn+Ni  quantity  represents  the  sum  of  the  zinc  and nickel  flows  discharged.  This  quantity  is  expressed  in metric tons per year.\n\nThe  data  presented  only  take  into  account  the  discharges relating  to  metals  and  Chemical  Oxygen  Demand (COD), for which concentration and flow must be measured by law, and the  discharges  from  the  plants  in  Bursa  (Turkey),  Curitiba (Brazil), Santa Isabel de Cordoba (Argentina) and Casablanca (Morocco), for which voluntary controls are taken into account in  light  of  the  significant  contribution  of  these  discharges  to the Group's impacts.\n\nThe Moscow, Santa Isabel de Cordoba, Curitiba, Casablanca  (SOMACA)  and  Batilly  (Sovab)  sites  are subject  to  specific  regulatory  requirements  and  receive an  exemption  on  the  calculation  methodology  of  the specific flows.\n\nFor sites that are not subject to a regulatory requirement to  measure  pollutant  flows  or  to  consolidate  voluntary controls at the Group level, the reported value is noted as 'NC'.  Black  water  discharges,  for  which  there  is  no regulatory measurement and/or reporting obligation, are not included in the water discharges. This concerns 39% of manufacturing sites (one of which is covered in a partial statement) and 69% of engineering, logistics and support sites.\n\n## Air emissions\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) discharges include the direct and indirect GHG emissions and are expressed in metric tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e).\n\nDirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are derived from an  inventory  of  GHG  sources  conducted  in  2004  and updated in part  in  2021.  Following  this  inventory,  Renault modified its guidelines to better reflect the total emissions of Renault Group and to comply with the recommendations of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) and the French protocol developed by Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EPE).\n\nEmissions from the following sources were included:\n\n- \u25cf combustion of fossil energies transported to the site and those transformed by the site for third parties;\n- \u25cf coolant  fill-up  of  the  air-conditioning  systems  fitted  in vehicles produced by the plant. Only HFC 134a fill-up is taken  into  account.  It  is  not  considered  pertinent  to\n\ndeclare HFO1234yf use under French legislation (Article R. 543-75 of the French Environment Code excludes this gas  from  coolant  fluids)  and  in  view  of  its  negligible impact on fuel combustion emissions during testing of engines,  gearboxes,  endurance  vehicles  and  on  roller benches;\n\n- \u25cf forklift trucks using compressed natural gas or propane;\n- \u25cf fuel consumption relating to Renault's company vehicles (taxi pools, shuttles, service vehicles, handling equipment, etc.);\n- \u25cf coolant  leaks  from  fixed  air  conditioning  systems  for premises  and  processes  with  a  nominal  load  of  more than 5 teqCO2;\n- \u25cf the  oxidation  of  carbon  entering  the  melting  furnaces that  is  not  found  in  the  outgoing  cast  iron  and  is therefore released during melting;\n- \u25cf the  oxidation  of  VOCs  incinerated  by  incinerators  and resulting in CO2 emissions.\n\nThese  emissions  make  up  more  than  95%  of  the  direct GHG emissions produced by Renault Group.\n\nThe following emission sources have been excluded from the  reporting  scope,  since  the  corresponding  emissions are  not  significant  (less  than  1%  of  total  direct  GHG emissions).\n\nIt is not yet possible to correctly assess certain emissions, so the following are not included in the reporting scope:\n\n- \u25cf emissions associated with transport on sites not listed above  among  the  emissions  counted  (particularly  the delivery by a road haulier external to Renault Group);\n- \u25cf fugitive emissions occurring when tanks of coolant (for vehicle air conditioning systems) are filled and emptied;\n- \u25cf emissions linked to SF6-type circuit breaker facilities.\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) indirect discharges are related to purchased electricity, steam and hot water. The emission factors used for the 2022 reporting are:\n\n- \u25cf for electricity, those published directly by suppliers or, if these  are  not  available,  those  published  by  the  IEA (International  Energy  Agency)  in  its  publication  IEA (2022), Emission Factors;\n- \u25cf for steam and hot water, data calculated on the basis of information provided by suppliers.\n\nEmissions factors used in the calculations of SO2, NOx and GHG  emissions  are  taken  from  the  CITEPA's  OMINEA National  Inventory  Report  (updated  in  March  2022)  or Regulation  (EU)  2018/2066  and  are  consistent  with  the recommendations  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nThe emission factor from fixed combustion facilities of lowNOx natural gas burners was calculated in 2011, based on an internal  study  of  88%  of  sites  in  the  scope  having  low-NOx burners. The factor thus obtained (0.0266kg/MWh LHV) is the average of the factors obtained at each site weighted by the power of the facilities.\n\nThe  air  emissions  of  SO2  and  NOx  counted  represent  the emissions from the combustion of fossil energies in fixed combustion  facilities  at  all sites, excluding  on-site transport.\n\nI",

The application  of  paint  on  bumpers  and  on  parts  and accessories is not taken into account.\n\nThe  indicator  shown  corresponds  to  the  metric  tons  of VOC emissions and the ratio of VOC emissions per m 2 of painted  vehicle  surface.  The  consolidated  ratio  for  the Group corresponds to the total VOC emissions generated by  the  body  assembly  plants  divided  by  the  total  of  the painted surfaces.\n\n## Waste\n\nThe  waste  reported  is  the  waste  that  leaves  the  site's geographical  scope;  the  quantities  are  expressed  in metric tons.\n\nConstruction  waste  from  Renault  sites  is  not  reported unless  a  contractual  clause  explicitly  states  that  the construction company is not responsible for it.\n\nThe waste reported includes hazardous waste (HW), nonhazardous waste (NHW), and construction site waste.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, non-hazardous waste is presented in two subcategories:\n\n- \u25cf metallic waste  from  production  processes  (scrap metals, machining chips, etc.);\n- \u25cf non-metallic waste (mixed ordinary waste, for example).\n\nFoundry waste is waste specifically related to the foundry process.  As  such,  mixed  non-hazardous  waste  produced by a foundry is not considered foundry waste.\n\nNon-recycled  waste  is  waste  for  which  the  treatment network is designated by European treatment codes D or R1 (energy recovery).\n\nRecovered  waste  is  all  waste  that  is  recycled  (material recovery)  or  incinerated  with  energy  recovery  (energy recovery, treatment code R1).\n\n## Energy Consumption\n\nThis metric represents the quantity of gas, heating oil, LPG (excluding vehicles), biomass, steam, hot water, electricity and  solar  thermal  energy  consumed  at  Renault  sites, expressed  in  MWh  LHV  (Lower  Heating  Value).  However, the data indicated does not include the propane used by forklift trucks or the fuel consumed by the site (engine and gearbox testing, company vehicles).\n\nThe primary or converted energy supplied to third parties is  not  included.  The  purpose  of  the  energy  consumption indicators  is  to  reflect  the  energy  performance  of  the Group's manufacturing processes.\n\nThe LHVs are consistent with Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 on the monitoring and reporting of carbon dioxide emissions, with the exception of LHV of natural gas from the Spanish plants from the March 2022 (Spanish) national greenhouse gas inventory report. The LHVs are consistent with  the  emissions  reported  in  the  EU  Emissions  Trading Scheme.",

It collects part of the data for the entire  scope  and  ensures  the  overall  consistency  of results;\n- \u25cf a questionnaire is sent to the Clusters. This questionnaire includes  a  number  of  indicators:  headcount  by  gender and  age,  number  of  recruitment  and  redundancies, absenteeism  rate,  number  and  subjects  of  major collective agreements signed during the year, number of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement  and  selected  at  corporate  level  from  the most  relevant  agreements,  total  cumulative  training hours in the year, training access rate, average training rate  per  employee  and  percentage  of  employees  with disabilities.  Each  indicator  has  a  specific  definition  and calculation  method  that  is  shared  with  each  of  the Clusters.  This  questionnaire  also  enables  data  to  be cross-referenced  with  last  year's  figures  to  monitor developments;\n- \u25cf for  the  data  specific  to  health  and  safety  (number  of occupational  accidents,  commuting  accidents  and occupational illnesses), a reporting process with monthly consolidation is put in place with the Group entities. Each month, the data is checked at the corporate level, using the protocol, to ensure the quality of their classification. A\n\ndigital  reporting  tool  is  being  rolled  out,  contributing  to improving the reliability of data.\n\nA  continuous  improvement  process  for  these  collection methods is in place, taking into account the recommendations of the statutory auditors.\n\n## Definitions and calculation methods for labor-related indicators\n\nTotal  workforce: number  of  employees  holding  an employment contract with the entity (permanent or fixedterm). Every employee on the payroll is counted as 'one' regardless  of  his  or  her  contractual  working  time (or activity rate). All employees on the payroll are counted, even if they are sent to another entity.\n\nAverage  Group  workforce  = (Group workforce at December  31  of  the  previous  year  +  Group  workforce  at December 31 of the current year)/2.\n\nAverage  country  workforce  = (country  workforce  at December 31 of the previous year + country workforce at December 31 of the current year)/2.\n\nAverage active workforce: the average active workforce is  equal  to  the  total  registered  workforce  for  the  entity concerned,  excluding  'inactive'  employees.  The  active workforce is measured every month. The average active workforce  is  equal  to  the  average  calculated  over 12 months.",

This category consists mainly of unworked  notice  periods,  leave  of  absence  unpaid  for various reasons including long-term parental leave, sabbatical leave, end of professional career leave including exemptions  from  activity  in  France,  leave  for  business creation, parental educational leave, absence due to longterm illness or accident after using up the amount of leave paid  by  the  Company  (amount  linked  to  the  current  work absence),  and  military  service.  Persons  on  sick  leave (excluding long-term) and on maternity or paternity leave are not considered as 'inactive' employees.\n\nNumber of Group redundancies: termination of permanent contract or early termination of fixed-term contract by the employer  for  one  or  more  reasons  that  may  or  may  not relate  personally  to  the  employee  in  question,  and  which may  be  either  collective  or  individual.  Conventional severance, voluntary departure plans, non-continuation at the end of a trial period, and abandonment of post are not considered as redundancy.\n\nNumber  of  Group  recruitments: hiring  on  permanent contract and fixed-term contracts.\n\nTop governing bodies: positions comprising members of the BoM (Board of Management), CMC (Corporate Management Committee) and BMC (Brand Management Committee).\n\nSenior  Management  Positions:  Positions  of  responsibility: positions reaching a certain level of responsibility according to the Korn  Ferry job evaluation methodology.  This represents 4,000 positions, within the scope deployed in the People@Renault tool (excluding Avtovaz and RRG).\n\nManagement Positions: positions of responsibility: positions reaching  a  certain  level  of  responsibility according to the Korn Ferry job evaluation methodology. This represents 10% of the Group's positions in the scope defined  in  the  People@Renault  tool  (excluding  Avtovaz and RRG), i.e. 11,000 positions.\n\nNumber of hours of training :  cumulative number of training hours delivered,  whether the training  is  provided  on  site  by internal/external trainers, outside the company by a training organization, or followed remotely. This indicator measures the overall training effort.\n\nTraining  access  rate: number  of  employees  trained  at least once during the year who are still with the Company at  the  end  of  the  year  as  a  percentage  of  the  active workforce at year-end.\n\nAverage  training  hours  per  employee: total hours  of employee training carried out during the year for employees present at the end of the year, as a percentage of the active workforce at the end of the year.\n\nEmployment rate of people with disabilities: percentage of employees with disabilities in the total workforce as of December 31. It should be noted however, that it is difficult to prepare statistics that accurately reflect the number of disabled  employees,  given  the  different  regulations  and\n\nthe  lack  of  legal  reporting  requirements  in  numerous countries.\n\nAbsenteeism  (absence  due  to  unforeseen  circumstances): the  absenteeism  rate  is  expressed  as  a  percentage  and  is calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  average  active  workforce (permanent  +  fixed-term  contracts)  and  the  theoretical yearly number of working days.\n\nThe  number  of  days  of  absence  is  expressed  in  working days,  excluding  days  of  furloughs,  layoffs,  strikes,  training and leave (including maternity and paternity leave).\n\nFormula:  number  of  absence  days  per  year/(active workforce x number of theoretical days per year) \u00d7 100.\n\nThe  choice  of  assumptions  for  the  calculation  of theoretical  days  number  is  left  up  to  the  entities,  since local factors may result in minor differences.\n\n## Health and safety indicators:\n\nFR1  rate: frequency  rate  of  occupational  accidents requiring  more  significant  medical  treatment  than  first aid  for  Renault  and  temporary  employees.  This  rate corresponds  to  a  list  of  injuries  of  injuries  that  reach  or exceed a certain severity threshold and on which Renault Group intends to prioritize its actions.\n\nFR2  rate: frequency  rate  of  occupational  accidents  with sick  leave  involving  Renault  and  temporary  employees (several additional exclusions compared with F2).\n\nThe  FR1  and  FR2  rates  correspond  to  the  incident  rates divided by 1,000,000 hours worked.\n\nExample:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccidents  of  temporary  workers  are  included  in  the  FR1 and FR2 indicators from 2018.\n\nG1 severity rate: [Number of days of sick leave during the year  due  to  occupational  accidents  that  year  or  in previous  years  -  number  of  days  of  sick  leave  due  to accidents  that  were  contested  or  where  a  dispute  was won] x 1,000/number of hours of exposure to occupational risks during the year.\n\nOccupational  illnesses: rate  of  occupational  illnesses contracted  by  Renault  employees  following  prolonged exposure to an occupational risk (noise, chemicals, posture, etc.), reported as such to an external body if the regulations in force  in  the  country  so  provide.  Rate  of  reported occupational  illness  per  1,000  employees  to  end-2016. Occupational  illness  rate  reported  per  million  hours  of exposure to occupational risks from 2017 onwards. This rate includes  occupational  illnesses,  reported  with  or  without sick leave.\n\nAccidents  on  public  roads: accidents  involving  Renault employees  on  public  roads  while  commuting  to  work  or traveling on business.\n\nI",

Methodological comments on key societal reporting figures\n\nThe information included in the comprehensive reporting of  societal  initiatives  is  collected  from  a  network  of correspondents  covering  all  countries  in  which  Renault operates. This information includes:\n\n- \u25cf actions  which  are  divided  into  four  main  areas: education, road safety, integration through employment and  \"others\"  (grouping  communication  around  ESG, humanitarian aid, culture, sport, health, etc.);\n- \u25cf the  purpose  of  each  initiative  determines  the  category to which it is assigned. For example, donating a vehicle for  transporting  children  to  school  would  be  classified under 'education';\n- \u25cf actions  stemming  from  Renault  S.LA.S.  philanthropy (see 2.4.3.8).\n\nThe  various  CSR  initiatives  undertaken  internally  by Renault Group employees (disability awareness, etc.) are included in societal investments.\n\nHowever,  donations  in  kind  (donations  and  loans  of vehicles  in  particular)  and  the  provision  of  employees (hourly  cost)  are  not  counted  in  societal  investments. However,  we  can  indicate  for  information  that  the 465 vehicles donated  in  2022  by  the  Engineering Department to firefighters in France and Europe, as well as  to  the  GIGN  and  RAID  give  rise  to  a  tax  receipt  of \u20ac2.294m.\n\n## 2.6.3.2.

It defines material standards for reporting on sustainable  development  by  industrial  sector  mainly  for investors  (i.e.  topics  reasonably  likely  to  have  a  material impact on financial performance).\n\nThe  SASB  has  developed  a  comprehensive  set  of 77 industry manufacturing standards that were published in November  2018.  They  identify  a  minimum  set  of sustainable development themes and associated indicators  that  a  company  characteristic  of  an  industry segment should publish because of their materiality.\n\n| Topic                                                | Accounting measure

This rates the Company not only on its financial performance but  also  on  its  attitude  toward  the  environment,  respect for  social  values,  societal  commitment  and  corporate governance.\n\nEach area analyzed produces a rating based on different criteria  (transparency,  innovation,  communication,  etc.) and is weighted to obtain a final rating. This serves as a reference  for  fund  managers  and  investors  who  wish  to invest  in  companies  that  perform  well  in  terms  of governance and environmental and social responsibility. Some of these rating  agencies  have  developed,  most  of the  time  in  partnership  with  providers  of  equity  indexes, some indexes composed of the top-rated companies for environmental, social or governance (ESG) aspects.\n\nRenault  Group  is  evaluated  each  year  by  the  main international extra-financial rating agencies on the basis of its public and declarative information.

The  potential  recommendations from this code which have not been followed are shown in a  section  (see  chapter  3.1.8  of  the  Universal  registration document).\n\nThe AFEP-MEDEF Code is available for consultation on the Company's website.\n\n## 3.1 Composition, preparation and organization of the Board of Directors\n\nThis  chapter  describes  the  method  for  managing  and directing Renault SA as a listed company and the parent company of Renault Group.

The Board  of  Directors  considers  that  this  governance structure remains appropriate to Renault's challenges. It enables the Company  to  benefit from both the Chairman's stature and expertise in corporate governance and the managerial background and industrial and automotive expertise of the Chief Executive Officer, in charge of the management  and  the implementation of the Company's mid-term plan.\n\nThe  office  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  was entrusted  to  Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Senard  on  January  24, 2019, following his appointment as a Director (1) pursuant to the  provisions  of  Article  L.  225-17  par.  3  of  the  French Commercial Code.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  on  January  28, 2020,  appointed  Mr.  Luca  de  Meo  as  Chief  Executive Officer  of  Renault  SA  and  Chairman  of  Renault  s.a.s, effective July 1, 2020.",

It  shall  also  take  into account the Company's purpose (raison d'\u00eatre).\n\nIn addition, the Board Charter limits the powers of the Chief Executive Officer as follows:\n\n## Excerpt of the Board Charter provisions governing the limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer must obtain the authorization of the Board of Directors for any external growth transaction and any acquisition  or  disposal  of  any  ownership  in  any  company, whether  existing  or  to  be  created,  where  the  amount  exceeds \u20ac250 million.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer must inform the Board of Directors of any external growth transaction and any acquisition or disposal of any ownership in any company, whether existing or to be created, where the amount exceeds \u20ac60 million.\n\nThe Board of Directors shall determine every year the total amount of sureties (cautions), endorsements  (avals)  or guarantees (garanties), which the Chief Executive Officer may provide without requesting the Board's specific authorization.\n\n## Chief Executive Officer's obligation to hold shares\n\nPursuant  to  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors decided at its meeting on July 29, 2020, to set the minimum number of registered shares to  be  held  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  until  the  end  of his term of office at 5,000 shares.\n\nThis minimum  holding  obligation  complements  the obligation  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  to  retain,  until the end of his term of office, 25% of the shares resulting\n\nfrom the free allocation of shares (for more details on the retention  obligation,  see  chapter  3.2.4.2  of  the  Universal registration document).\n\nThe  minimum  holding  requirement  ensures  that  a  Chief Executive Officer who does not yet own shares resulting from  free  allocations  of  shares  is  aligned  with  the interests of shareholders upon taking office.,\n\n## 3.1.2 Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the  Annual  General  Meeting,  with  the  exception  of  the Director  designated  by  the  French  State  pursuant  to Article 4 of French Order No. 2014-948 of August 20, 2014, on  corporate  governance  and  equity  transactions  in companies  with  public  shareholding  and  the  Directors representing the employees.\n\nThe term of office for Directors is four years. Pursuant to the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  these terms  of  office  are  staggered,  to  avoid  them  all  ending and coming up for renewal at the same time.\n\n## Excerpt of the Board Charter provisions governing the composition of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  determines  and  regularly  reviews  the desirable  balance  of  its  composition,  particularly  in  terms  of diversity  (representation  of  women  and  men,  nationalities, age, qualifications and professional experiences.",

The  Governance  and  Compensation Committee  appoints  a  recruitment  firm  to  assist  it with  the  process  of  selecting  future  independent directors.\n\nThe  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee selects the candidates with the help of the appointed recruitment  firm  on  the  basis  of  criteria  relating  to their  professional  experience,  skills,  independence and  ethics,  while  maintaining  a  gender  balance between men and women and diversity in recruitment  in  accordance  with  the  international dimension of the Group.\n\nThe Governance and Compensation Committee then presents  the  selected  candidate(s)  to  the  Board  of Directors and recommends that the Board co-opt or, as  the  case  may  be,  propose  to  the  Annual  General Meeting that the candidates be appointed.\n\nThe Board of Directors co-opts or, as the case may be, proposes  that  the  Annual  General  Meeting  appoint the selected candidate(s) as independent director(s).\n\n## \u25cf Appointment of directors proposed by Nissan\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Restated Alliance Master Agreement ('RAMA'), which governs the  ownership  relationship  between  Renault  and Nissan and regulates the governance of the Alliance, two of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company are directors proposed by Nissan.\n\nThe  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee,  on the  proposal of Nissan, recommends that the Board of  Directors  co-opt  or,  as  the  case  may  be,  propose the appointment of the directors representing Nissan to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company co-opts or, as the  case  may  be,  proposes  that  the  Annual  General Meeting appoint the director(s) proposed by Nissan.\n\n## \u25cf Appointment of the director proposed by the French State\n\nPursuant to the provisions of French Order 2014-948 of August  20,  2014,  on  the  governance  and  capital transactions of companies with public shareholding, as  amended,  one  of  the  members  of  the  Board  of Directors of the Company is a director nominated by the French State.\n\nThe  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee,  on the  proposal  of  the  French  State,  recommends  that the Board of Directors co-opt or, as the case may be, propose the appointment of said director representing the French State to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company co-opts or, as the  case  may  be,  proposes  that  the  Annual  General Meeting appoint the director proposed by the French State.\n\n## \u25cf 1 director appointed by the French State\n\nPursuant to the provisions of French Order No. 2014-948 of August 20, 2014, on the governance  and  capital transactions  of  companies  with  public  shareholding,  as amended, the French State may appoint a representative to  the  board  of  directors  of  companies  in  which  it  alone directly  holds  more  than  10%  of  the  share  capital.  This director is appointed by the Minister for the Economy.\n\n## \u25cf 3 directors elected by the employees\n\nPursuant to the Company's articles of association, three directors  are  elected  directly  by  the  employees  of  the French  subsidiaries,  divided  into  different  electorates. One seat is allocated to the 'Engineers - Executives and Similar' electorate and two seats to the 'Other Employees' electorate.\n\nThe  candidates  or  candidate  lists  may  be  presented either  by  one  or  more  representative  organizations  as defined by the applicable regulations, or by 100 voters.\n\nTo  be  considered  eligible,  candidates  must  have  an employment contract with, and be actively employed by, the  Company or  one  of  its  direct  or  indirect  subsidiaries whose  registered  office  is  located  in  France  for  at  least two years prior to the effective date of the term of office of the position for which the election is being held.\n\nThe number, place and composition of the polling stations are  determined  by  the  Company's  establishments  and subsidiaries  concerned  thereby,  in  accordance  with current practices for the election of employee representatives.\n\nI",

As  part  of  this program,  new  directors  are  given  a  presentation  of  the Group,  its  governance  and  its  various  activities  during meetings  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Chief Financial  Officer,  the  Chief  Executive  Officers  of  the Group's brands (Renault, Dacia and Alpine, Mobilize), the managers of the business lines (engineering, manufacturing,  quality,  legal  affairs,  human  resources, financial services and banking), and the Alliance General Secretary. In addition, the new directors take part in visits to Group sites and factories.\n\nThe  three  directors  representing  employees  and  the director  representing  employee  shareholders  benefit from  in-house  training  provided  by  Renault  Group employees and training provided by external organizations.  This  training  helps  them  to  fully  exercise their office by rapidly acquiring the specific skills required of a company director.\n\n## Diversity policy applied to the Board of Directors\n\nPursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-10  of  the  French  Commercial Code, the Board, of Directors has defined a diversity policy based on its past practices.\n\n## Policy criteria\n\nThe composition of the Board of Directors seeks a balance notably  in  terms  of  diversity  (representation  of  women and men, nationalities, age, qualifications and professional experience). More specifically:\n\n- \u25cf regarding the size of the Board of Directors, the number of  Board  of  Directors  members  must  be  such  as  to enable  reconciliation  of  the  skills,  independence  and specificities of Renault's shareholding;\n- \u25cf the  Board  of  Directors,  while  complying  at  least  with legal  requirements  and  the  recommendations  of  the AFEP-MEDEF Code in terms of gender balance, considers that  it  benefits  from  being  diverse  in  its  composition (gender, nationality, culture);\n- \u25cf in  terms  of  skills,  the  Company  seeks  above  all  the complementarity of  skills,  profiles  and  experiences  but also  their  relevance  to  the  Company's  strategy  and  to the challenges it faces;\n- \u25cf in  terms  of  seniority,  the  Company  seeks  a  balance between  experience  within  the  Board  of  Directors  and progressive renewal of its composition;\n- \u25cf the Board  of  Directors  expects  a  high  level  of commitment and ethics from each of its members.\n\n## Policy implementation\n\nTo implement this diversity policy, the Board of Directors uses  annual  evaluations  of  its  work  (for  more  details  on the  Board's  evaluation,  see  section  3.1.7  of  the  Universal registration  document).  The  progressive  and  planned renewal  of  the  terms  of  offices  makes  it  possible  to anticipate the skills to be renewed or to evolve according to  the  evolution  of  the  industry  and  of  the  markets  in which the Company operates.\n\nImplementation of the diversity policy in 2022:\n\n- \u25cf the Board of Directors currently includes 16 Directors. This number  remains  higher  than  the  average  for  CAC  40 companies, but is explained by the level of representation of  the  employees  and  of  the  reference  shareholders  in accordance  with  the  law,  the  articles  of  association  or agreements  entered  into  with  Nissan,  and  the  desire  to ensure  the  presence  of  a  majority  of  Independent Directors. As such, the independence rate of the Board of Directors as of December 31, 2022, was 66.7% 2\n- \u25cf the  number  of  women  on  the  Board  of  Directors  as  of December 31, 2022, stands at five, i.e. a feminization rate of 41.7% 2 . Moreover,  one  of  the  Board  of  Directors'  three committees is chaired by a woman;",

In  addition,  their  professional  background as well as their trade union activity within Renault Group gives them a solid knowledge of the Group's organization and activities;\n- \u25cf the  changes in the composition of the Board and of its committees are  part  of  the  continuing  implementation of this diversity policy of the Board of Directors.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  the  Directors  appointed  on  the proposal  of  Nissan  and  the  Directors  designated  by  the French  State,  no  contracts  or  agreements  have  been concluded  with  the  shareholders,  clients,  suppliers,  or other parties allowing any of these persons or one of their representatives to be selected as a member of the Board or  other  Senior  Management body in the Company, thus mitigating potential or actual conflicts of interest.\n\n## Diversity policy applied to Senior Management\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  oversees  the  deployment  of the  Group's  diversity  policy  by  Senior  Management.  In light  of  this,  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Strategy  and Sustainability  Committee  annually  review  the  Group's diversity  and  inclusion  policy,  and  more  specifically  the policy on the balanced representation of women and men on the governing bodies.\n\nAt its meeting on February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors, on  the  proposal  of  the  Executive  Management,  set  a target  of  30%  representation  of  women  in  2030,  35%  in 2035  and  50%  in  2050  in  the  management  bodies, including the Leadership Team and the Brand Management  Committees,  on  the  one  hand,  and  for employees in management positions, on the other.\n\nAt its meeting on February 15, 2023, the Board of Directors was  informed  of  the  results  achieved  during  the  2022 financial year and the procedures that the Company has put in place to achieve these objectives.\n\nIn  addition,  to  take  into  account  the  new  objectives introduced  by  the  \"Rixain  Law\"  (Law  no.  2021-1774  of December 24, 2021, aimed at accelerating economic and professional  equality),  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the proposal  of  the  Executive  Management,  increased  the gender diversity objective within the management bodies to 30% of women by 2025.\n\nI",

Rights and obligations of the directors\n\nThe Board Charter specifies the rights and obligations of the Company directors with respect to:\n\n- \u25cf the  rules  governing  the  operation  of  the  Board  of Directors and its committees;\n- \u25cf the duty of confidentiality;\n- \u25cf the independence and the duty of expression;\n- \u25cf the management of conflicts of interest;\n- \u25cf ethical  requirements  with  respect  to  financial  market transactions and\n- \u25cf holding  shares  in  the  Company.  Pursuant  to  the  AFEPMEDEF Code, the Board of Directors' Charter recommends  that  the  directors  hold  a  significant number  of  shares  in  registered  form  in  a  personal capacity  in  relation  to  the  compensation  received, except  for  directors  who  do  not  personally  receive compensation. In this respect, the directors representing the  employees  and  employee  shareholders  do  not personally receive compensation (which is passed on to their  respective  trade  unions);  they  are  therefore  not required  to  hold  a  significant  number  of  shares  in  the Company.  Furthermore,  legislation  prohibits  directors designated by the French State from personally owning shares.\n\nFor  the  retention  obligation  applicable  to  the  Chief Executive  Officer,  see  chapter  3.2  of  the  Universal registration document.\n\n## 3.1.4.2. No convictions\n\nTo  the  best  of  the  Company's  knowledge,  none  of  its current corporate officers has, over the last five years:\n\n- \u25cf been convicted of fraud;\n- \u25cf taken  part  as  a  corporate  officer,  general  partner  or founder  in  bankruptcy,  receivership,  or  liquidation proceedings;\n- \u25cf been  the  subject  of  any  charge  and/or  official  public sanction  pronounced  by  a  statutory  or  regulatory authority; or\n- \u25cf been prevented by a court from acting as a member of an administrative, management, or supervisory body of an issuer, or from taking part in managing or conducting the business of an issuer.\n\n## 3.1.4.3. No potential or actual conflicts of interest\n\nTo  the  best  of  the  Company's  knowledge,  there  is  no potential or actual conflict of interest between any of the private  interests  of  the  Company  directors  and  their duties towards the Company.\n\nThere  are  no  family  ties  between  the  members  of  the Board of Directors.\n\nThe corporate officers are not bound to the Company or any of its subsidiaries by a service contract providing for any form of benefit to be granted.",

Conversely,  the  Board  may consider that a director who does not meet the aforementioned criteria should nevertheless be considered as independent.\n\nPursuant  to  the  Board  Charter,  the  Board  of  Directors refers to the criteria set forth in the AFEP-MEDEF Code to identify  situations  that  may  compromise  the  exercise  of freedom of judgment by directors.\n\nIn any event, it is recalled that, pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code  and  in  accordance  with  the  Board  Charter,  every director  is  under  an  obligation  to  inform  the  Board  of Directors of any potential conflict of interest situation and to refrain from attending the debate and from participating in the vote of the corresponding deliberation.\n\nEach  year,  the  Company  sends  a  questionnaire  to  each director  in  order  to  assess  his  or  her  independence  in accordance with the criteria of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nThe Governance and Compensation Committee and the Board  of  Directors  shall  also  review  the  classification  of each  director  as  independent  in  light  of  these  same criteria.\n\nEach year, the Governance and Compensation Committee shall discuss  for  each  director,  whether  such  director  should  be considered  as  independent,  and  the  independence  of  each director shall be examined on a case-by-case basis by the Board of  Directors  in  light  of  the  criteria  set  forth  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code.  Upon  appointment  of  a  new  director  or  renewal  of  the terms of office a director, the question of whether such director may be considered as independent should also be discussed.\n\nAs part of this review, the Governance and Compensation Committee  and  the  Board  of  Directors  pays  particular attention  to  the  assessment  of  the  materiality  of  the business  relationships  between  the  directors  and  the Company, both from the standpoint of the Group and of the relevant director. This assessment shall be carried out in the light of qualitative criteria, such as the nature of the business  relationships,  and  quantitative  criteria,  such  as the amounts committed under these relationships.\n\nAccordingly,  to  qualify  as  independent,  the  Board  of Directors  ensures  that  there  were  no  significant  cash flows between the Company and any company of which Company's directors are directors or Executive Officers, in particular  by  examining  the  share  these  companies account for in the Company's revenue.\n\nI\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nCorporate governance",

Senard with regard to criterion no. 1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, given his capacity  as  director  of  Nissan  and  Chairman  of  Renault s.a.s. for the period from October 11, 2019, to June 30, 2020.\n\nThe AFEP-MEDEF Code states that one of the criteria that the  Board  of  Directors  must  assess  to  possibly  exclude someone from the status of independent director is that of  'not  being  or  not  having  been,  during  the  past  five years,  an  employee,  executive  offer,  or  director  of  a company that the company consolidates.' According to the AFEP-MEDEF  Code  implementation  guide, this recommendation also applies when a director holds 'an office  in  a  company  in  which  the  first  company  holds  a non-controlling  but  significant  stake,  or  in  a  sister company'.\n\nIt is recalled  that  Nissan  is  not  a  company  fully consolidated by Renault. Renault has significant influence over  Nissan  and  therefore  accounts  for  its  interest  in Nissan  using  the  equity  method  (for  more  details  on Renault's  shareholding  in  Nissan,  see  note  12  in  chapter 5.2.2.6.2 of the Universal registration document).\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  upon  recommendation  of  the Governance and Compensation Committee, held that the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Renault to the Board of Directors of Nissan, with a view to developing  and  strengthening  cooperation  between  the Boards of Directors of the two Alliance partners was not such as to call into question Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard's freedom of judgement and independence with respect to Renault.\n\nFurthermore,  should  such  a  situation  give  rise  to  any conflict  of  interest,  the  provisions  of  the  Board  Charter requiring  the  director  in  question  to  abstain  from participating in the deliberations and votes of the Board of Directors would apply.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, considered  that  the  performance  by  Mr.  Jean-Dominique Senard  of  the  duties  of  Chairman  of  Renault  s.a.s.  from October 11, 2019, to June 30, 2020, was of an exceptional and purely  temporary  nature,  during  the  time  required  for  the Board of Directors to conduct the succession process for the Chief  Executive  Officer  and  until  the  arrival  of  Mr.  Luca  de Meo  on  July  1,  2020.  The  Board  of  Directors  therefore considered that this exceptional situation was not such as to call  into  question  the  independence  of  Mr.  Jean-Dominique Senard at the end of this temporary term of office.\n\nAt its meeting of February 15, 2023, the Board of Directors also reviewed Mr. Pierre Fleuriot's situation with regard to criterion  no.  1  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  in  view  of  his capacity as director of Nissan.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  upon  recommendation  of  the Governance and Compensation Committee, held that the appointment of the Lead Independent Director of Renault to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Nissan,  with  a  view  to developing  and  strengthening  cooperation  between  the Boards of Directors of the two Alliance partners was not such as to call into question Mr. Pierre Fleuriot's freedom of judgment and independence with respect to Renault.",

The Board members were also able to test drive  the  Megane  E-Tech,  as  well  as  the  Group's  other new  2022  models,  the  Dacia  Jogger  and  the  Renault Austral.\n- \u25cf The Board of Directors also spent a day discovering the future  vehicles  of  the  Renault  Group  (line-up  of  the Renault,  Dacia  and  Alpine  brands).  The  Board  first attended an in-depth presentation at the Design Centre (Technocentre  in  Guyancourt)  of  the  vehicle  ranges scheduled for launch in the 2023-2025 period, and then visited  the  various  stands  at  the  Pre-Show  organised ahead  of  the  Paris  Motor  Show  to  present  the  new vehicles and concepts to the international press.",

The conclusions  of  the  evaluation  were  presented  at  the Governance  and  Compensation  Committee  meeting  on February  9,  2023,  and  then  at  the  Board  of  Directors meeting on February 15, 2023.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  questionnaire  and  of  the  interviews with  the  members  of  the  Board  was  to  evaluate  the following themes:\n\n- \u25cf the composition, role, structure, missions and operation of the Board of Directors and its Committees;\n- \u25cf the  relationships  between  the  Board  of  Directors  and Senior Management;\n- \u25cf the directors' contribution and collective efficiency;\n- \u25cf the follow-up on the points for improvement identified in the previous evaluation.\n\nThe evaluation provided an opportunity to learn from the experience of recent events, and to reassess the ways in which the Board of Directors and its Committees operate.\n\nIn  2022,  the  evaluation  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its Committees highlighted the following positive items:\n\n- \u25cf the strengthening of the bond and the better cohesion of Board members;\n- \u25cf a  better  understanding  of  the  Renault  Group's  activities and  a  strengthening  of  the  dialogue  between  Directors outside of Board meetings thanks notably to the  site visits;\n- \u25cf a  trust-based  relationship  between  the  Board  and  the Executive Management;\n- \u25cf the  time  dedicated  to  dealing  with  material  matters during the Committee's meeting;\n\nThis  evaluation  identified  recommendations  and  areas for improvement, such as:\n\n- \u25cf a  deeper  information  on  the  market  evolution  and  the competitive environment as well as an in-depth analysis of the Group's main competitors strategy;\n- \u25cf a  better  understanding  of  opportunities  and  risks analysis at Board meeting;\n- \u25cf a strengthening of the balance of skills on the Board by seeking  profiles  with  CSR/sustainability,  new  mobility and new technologies and software expertises;\n- \u25cf the  wish  to  spend  more  time  on  certain  specific substantive and strategic matters.\n\n## 3.1.8 Implementation of the 'comply or explain' rule\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code, the Company refers to the AFEP-MEDEF Code, and follow its recommendations.\n\nPursuant to the 'comply or explain' rule in Article 28.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the provisions of Article L. 22-10-10 of the  French  Commercial  Code,  the  recommendations  of  that  Code  that  have  not  been  followed  and  the  related explanations are summarized in the table below:",

It  also recalls the legal related-party control procedures.\n\nThis internal procedure is assessed on an annual basis by the  Company's  Board  of  Directors,  after  having  been reviewed by the Governance and Compensation Committee,  in  order,  notably,  to  take  into  account  any legislative  or  regulatory  amendments,  changes  in  best practices and any implementation difficulties during the financial year.\n\nAt its meeting of February 15, 2023, the Board of Directors examined  the  internal  procedure  for  evaluating  current agreements  concluded  under  arm's  length  conditions and,  upon  recommendation  of  the  Governance  and Compensation Committee, concluded that this procedure complies with the legal provisions and that no modification was necessary.\n\n## 3.1.10 Procedures for shareholders' participation in the Annual General Meeting\n\nArticle 21 of the Company's articles of association specifies the procedures for shareholders' participation in the Annual General Meeting.

In  its  recommendations,  the  Governance  and Compensation  Committee  takes  into  account  the balance  of  the  different  components  of  the  corporate officers' compensation.\n\nThe compensation policy for the non-executive corporate officer  is  based  on  a  fixed  compensation  and  does  not include  any  variable  or  exceptional  cash  compensation, nor compensation for directorship.\n\nThe compensation policy for the executive corporate officer is based on six simple, stable, transparent practices:\n\n- 1. Closely linked to the Company's strategy\n- 2. Performance-oriented\n- 3. Focus on long-term performance\n- 4. Close alignment with shareholders\n- 5. Competitive compensation\n- 6. Compensation which does not encourage excessive risk-taking\n- \u25cf The  setting  of  performance  targets,  a  sufficiently  long  evaluation  period,  and compensation capping allow excessive short-term risk-taking to be avoided.\n\nThese  principles  are  established  in  compliance  with  the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code to which the Company refers pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 2210-10 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nMore  generally,  the  Governance  and  Compensation Committee  regularly  ensures  that  corporate  officers' compensation  complies  with  all  applicable  laws  and recommendations in terms of corporate governance.\n\nI\n\n- \u25cf The  compensation  is  closely  linked  to  the  implementation  and  results  of  the strategy.\n- \u25cf The  variable  component  of  the  executive  officer's  compensation  represents  a fraction  of  the  total  compensation  that  is  consistent  with  market  practice  and ensures  the  interests  of  the  executive  officer  are  aligned  with  the  Company's performance.\n- \u25cf A significant part of the executive officers' compensation depends on multi-year targets being achieved.\n- \u25cf The number of performance shares allocated to the executive officer is expressed as an absolute number, rather than a percentage of the salary, so that upward and downward fluctuations in the share price affect the corresponding total value.\n- \u25cf The  executive  officer  must  retain  25%  of  the  shares  vested  pursuant  to performance share plans until the end of his term of office.\n- \u25cf Competition between corporate officers in the automotive market is intense. It is therefore  of  prime  importance  to  ensure  that  the  overall  compensation  of  the executive  officer  is  competitive  compared  to  the  practices  of  comparable companies in the Automotive sector in Europe and worldwide.",

This analysis  is  based  on  the  practices  of  comparable multinational  organizations  in  the  Automotive  sector (Stellantis,  General  Motors,  Ford,  Honda,  Daimler,  BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo and Toyota).\n\nThe  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee  also takes into  account the expectations voiced by Renault's shareholders by way of regular meetings.\n\n## Compensation structure for the executive corporate officer\n\nThe  compensation  policy  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer consists of:\n\n- \u25cf a fixed portion ,  corresponding to a fixed compensation in cash  determined  in  line  with  the  role,  level  of responsibility, and experience of the executive corporate officer;\n- \u25cf a portion subject to performance conditions , comprising two distinct sub-components:\n- \u25cf annual  variable  compensation : this  aims  to  ensure that  part  of  the  compensation  of  the  executive corporate  officer  depends  on  the  Company's  main\n- \u25cf Pay  for  failure:  pay  variable  components  in  the  event  of  poor performance of the Group\n- \u25cf Place a disproportionate weight on short-term variable compensation versus long-term variable compensation\n- \u25cf Overly weight  qualitative criteria in the annual  variable compensation\n- \u25cf Reward excessive or inappropriate risk-taking\n- \u25cf Have extraordinary severance payments in addition to the twoyear non-compete indemnity\n- \u25cf Provide  excessive  severance  or  sign-on  arrangements  to  our executives\n\noperational,  financial,  and  managerial  objectives being achieved during the year;\n\n- \u25cf long-term compensation : this consists of performance  shares,  designed  to  strengthen  the alignment of the interests of the executive corporate officer  with  those  of  shareholders  by  making  their vesting  subject  to  the  achievement  of  performance criteria  assessed  over  a  period  of  three  years.  In addition  to  the  performance  criteria,  the  vesting  of shares  is  subject  to  a  presence  condition  of  three years  following  the  allocation  of  the  performance shares;\n- \u25cf a co-investment plan based on voluntary investment in  Renault  shares,  with  the  benefit  of  a  matching contribution  of  maximum  100%  in  the  form  of performance  shares,  the  acquisition  of  which  is subject  to  the  achievement  of  performance  criteria assessed  over  a  cumulative  period  of  3  years  and  a 3-year presence condition.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Chief  Executive Officer may benefit from top-up  pension  schemes,  a  termination  benefit  in  the event of dismissal, a non-compete agreement as well as benefits in kind that are customary for this type of position (company cars, health and life insurance schemes, etc.).\n\nPursuant  to  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code and the recommendations of the French Financial Market Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers, AMF), the Chief Executive Officer does not hold an employment contract with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.",

This  indicator  corresponds  to  the proportion  of  invoicing  in  relation  to  revenues.  This  percentage  is  set  by  the Alliance's exchange committees.\n\nIn 2022, Renault's invoicing targets with the Alliance were exceeded.\n\n- \u25cf Alignment of the 2026+ product line-up with the Group's 2030 ambitions:\n\nThe internal milestones for the development of the product range to achieve the Group's 2030 objectives (\"Line-up 26+\") have been passed in accordance with the  expected schedule.

This level has been achieved.\n\n- \u25cf Launch of the \"ReKnow\" University (target of  3,000 people trained in 2022): 7,659 people trained in the ReKnow University in 2022.\n- Target of 30,000 used vehicles refurbished in Flins in 2022:\n- \u25cf 30,684 vehicles were refurbished in Flins in 2022.\n- \u25cf Development of the circular economy business:\n\nOn October 13 th , 2022, Renault Group announced the creation of THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL,  the  first  company  operating  across  the  entire  automotive  circular economy  value  chain,  aiming  at  moving  the  automotive  industry  towards resource neutrality. Bringing together all the existing expertise of the Group and its partners in this activity, this new entity offers closed-loop recycling solutions at each stage of a vehicle's life: supply of parts and raw materials, production, use and end of life.\n\n## c) Customer satisfaction / Quality : 10% (out of a maximum of 10%)\n\nThe three indicators of this performance criterion refer to qualitatve targets.\n\nUpon  recommendation  of  the  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee,  the Board of Directors noted that these three indicators were met or exceeded.\n\n- \u25cf Reduction of the incident rate (number of incidents on vehicles under warranty after 3 months on the road)\n\nThis  indicator,  called  the  \"GMF  3MIS  WORLD\",  measures  the  number  of incidents on vehicles after three months on the road. The objective of reducing this rate was achieved, with a 15.6% reduction compared to the previous year, for a reduction target of 12.5%.\n\nThe level reached in 2022 is historic for the Group thanks to significant progress on the vehicles produced in series and a launch at the highest level for Megane E-tech Electric.\n\n- \u25cf Customer satisfaction level\n\nIn  2022,  the  level  of  customer  satisfaction  is  measured  by  the  \"dealer  ereputation\" indicator, i.e. the reputation of dealers on the internet. The target for this indicator was a significant improvement in 26 out of 35 countries. This target was achieved.\n\n- \u25cf Launch of the \"Safety Coach\" program:\n\nThe  \"Safety  Coach\"  is  a  system  combining  driver  detection  and  guidance features for safer driving. Integration of the Safety Coach in new Renault Group vehicles is part of the \"Safety\" pillar of the Group's ESG strategy.\n\nThe Safety Coach has been integrated into Megane E-Tech Electric launched in 2022.\n\nAccordingly, the Board of Directors noted that the total achievement rate of the performance  criteria  was  150%  for  the  2022  financial  year  and  consequently decided to set Mr. Luca de Meo's variable compensation for that financial year at a gross amount of \u20ac1,950,000.\n\nI",

The gross annual compensation used for this calculation will be the one paid during the twelve months preceding the date of termination of the corporate office.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendation of the AFEP-MEDEF Code at the time of Mr.  Luca  de  Meo's  departure,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  will  decide whether  to  apply  this  non-compete  agreement  and  may  unilaterally  waive  it. Furthermore, no compensation will be due in the event of retirement or if Mr. Luca de Meo has reached the age of 65.\n\nI",

Therefore, the calculation of the FCF criterion for the Chief  Executive  Officer's  2020  performance  share  plan relates only to the years 2021 and 2022 and the number of performance  shares  in  the  course  of  vesting  has  been reduced  by  10%  (i.e.  1/3  of  the  30%  weighting  of  this criterion) to a maximum of 67,500 shares.\n\nOn  February  15 th ,  2023,  upon  the  recommendation  of  the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors  noted  the  following  achievement  rates  for  the performance criteria of the performance shares granted to the CEO for 2020:\n\n| Criteria                                                                                 | Weighting   | Payout rates  (as % of allocation)                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Achievement rate                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Total Shareholder Return  (TSR)                                                          | 20%         | \u25cf 0% if TSR < benchmark. \u25cf 9% if TSR = benchmark.  \u25cf 20% if TSR \u2265 benchmark +10%.

However, as Renault SA does not have any employees, the indicators were calculated based on the compensation of the France-based employees of five companies, all being wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of  Renault  SA.  These  are Renault  s.a.s,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  de  Transmissions  Automatiques (STA), Sofrastock, RCI Banque SA and Renault Retail Group (RRG France).\n\nThe  33,253  individuals  who  were  employed  in  2022  by these  five  companies  represent  87%  of  the  Renault Group's workforce in France as of December 31, 2022.\n\nCompensation  presented  in  the  table  includes  the following components:\n\n- \u25cf fixed  compensation paid during the indicated financial year;\n- \u25cf variable compensation  paid  during  the  indicated financial year;\n- \u25cf compensation for directorship, if applicable, paid during the indicated financial year;\n- \u25cf book  value  of  the  benefits  in  kind  paid  during  the indicated financial year;\n- \u25cf performance  shares  allocated  during  the  indicated financial year (at IFRS value);\n- \u25cf profit-sharing  and  incentive  bonuses  paid  during  the indicated financial year.\n\nCompensation for both employees and corporate officers of  Renault s.a.s, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Transmissions Automatiques, Sofrastock,  RCI  Banque  SA  and  RRG  France  has  been annualized.\n\nThe  relevant  corporate  officers  for  this  comparison  are the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the latter function having existed within the Group up to January 2019.\n\nThe  compensation  presented  is  related  to  the  function and  not  to  the  person,  so  that  a  change  in  executive corporate officer for a same function does not impact the presentation of the information over the five-year period.",

Compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer for the 2023 financial year\n\nResolution  submitted  to  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of May 11, 2023, pursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 II. of the French Commercial Code\n\n## Thirteenth  resolution  -  Approval  of  the  compensation  policy for the Chief Executive Officer for the 2023 financial year\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting,  voting  under  the  conditions  of quorum and majority required for ordinary general meetings, having reviewed the report on corporate governance referred to  in  Article  L.  225-37  of  the  French  Commercial  Code describing the components of the compensation policy for the directors and corporate officers set by the Board of Directors, approves,  pursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-8  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  the  compensation  policy  of  the  Chief Executive  Officer  for  the  2023  financial  year,  as  set  out  in chapter  3.2.4.2  of  the  Company's  2022  Universal  registration document.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer's compensation is determined on  consideration  of  the  responsibilities  and  missions assumed and attached to his corporate office, as well as the level of his skills, his experience and his track record in this  position,  while  taking  into  account  the  competitive environment in which the Company operates.\n\nThus,  the  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee takes into account the median of the total compensation within  the  Company's  main  international  automotive competitors (Stellantis, Volkswagen, Daimler, BMW, Volvo, Toyota, Honda, Ford and General Motors) to determine the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe automotive and mobility industry is currently facing a profound  transformation  due  to  the  emergence  of  new value chains such as electric vehicles (EVs), software, new mobility services and circular economy, in addition to ICE and  hybrid  vehicles.  In  this  highly  consolidated  sector, with  a  global  reach,  there  is  a  strong  competition  to attract talented executives with a strategic vision for the future  of  the  industry  and  the  required  leadership  to implement it in the long run.\n\nThe  'Renaulution'  strategy  launched  by  the  Chief Executive  Officer,  Luca  de  Meo,  in  January  2021  aims  to transform the Group to benefit from the opportunities of the transformation of the automotive sector.\n\nThe deployment of 'Resurrection', the first  phase  of  the strategic  plan,  which  was  completed  3  years  ahead  of schedule,  is  already  bearing  fruit  with  results  above  the initial objectives and market expectations:\n\n- \u25cf Significant improvement  in  profitability: operating margin at 5.6% in 2022 versus a guidance above 5%, up \u20ac1.4 billion compared to 2021 3 (+2.8 points);\n- \u25cf Automotive  operating  margin  per  vehicle  at  a  record level;\n- \u25cf Record  free  cash  flow:  \u20ac2.1  billion  versus  a  guidance above \u20ac1.5 billion (+\u20ac1.2 billion compared to 2021);\n- \u25cf Strengthening  of  the  financial  structure:  return  to  net cash financial position of +\u20ac549 million on December 31, 2022 (+\u20ac1.6 billion compared to 2021).\n\nThis performance is even more remarkable that the Group has  faced  headwinds  due  to  the  disposal  of  its  Russian industrial  activities,  the  semiconductor  crisis  and  cost inflation.  The  Group's  fundamentals  have  been  fully restored, as highlighted by the 2023 financial outlook.\n\nIn addition to this performance in 2022, Renault Group also announced on November 8 th ,  2022,  the third phase of the 'Renaulution' strategic plan and launched its 'Revolution' with the ambition of becoming a \"Next Gen\" automotive company.\n\nThis  third  phase  enables  the  Group  to  announce  solid financial outlook for 2025-2030:\n\n- \u25cf Operating margin: above 8% in 2025 and above 10% in 2030; and\n- \u25cf Free  cash  flow:  above  \u20ac2  billion  per  year  on  average over  2023-2025,  and  above  \u20ac3  billion  per  year  on average over 2026-2030.\n\nI",

In addition, over 40,000 employees  purchased  shares  with  a  30%  discount. The employee shareholding rate was thus increased to  4.7%  of  the  share  capital  at  the  end  of  this transaction,  compared  with  3.79%  at  December  31 st , 2022.  A  new  employee  shareholding  plan  will  be implemented in 2023 in line with the ambition to reach 10% of employee shareholders by 2030.\n- \u25cf Renault Group also continues to share the fruits of the Group's  results  with  its  employees  and  to  recognise collective performance through profit-sharing agreements.  In  France,  for  example,  profit-sharing amounts to 8.75% of the total wages for all employees covered by the Collective Agreement for Metalworkers.\n- \u25cf In 2023, the Group is pursuing a global wage policy to support the purchasing power of all its employees, in line  with  the  level  of  inflation  in  each  country.  In France, for example, the budget for overall increases in  2023  is  7.5%  of  total  wages,  including  salary increases and specific bonuses to support purchasing power.\n- \u25cf The shareholders:\n- \u25cf The Board of Directors has proposed the payment of a  \u20ac0.25  dividend  to  the  shareholders  in  2023  in respect of the 2022 financial year.\n- \u25cf The  return  of  dividend  payment  in  2023  symbolizes this  new  era  and  the  payout  ratio  will  gradually increase,  in  a  disciplined  manner,  up  to  35%  of  the Group consolidated net income - parent share, in the mid-term.  To  do  so,  the  Group  shall  achieve  its  first priority,  which  is  to  return  to  an  'investment  grade' credit rating.\n\nIn view of all these elements, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, has proposed to raise by 30% the performance  shares  granted  to  the  Chief  Executive Officer  and  to  the  senior  executives  who  contribute,  by their high level of personal commitment, to the successful creation  of  this  new  organisation.  This  allocation  will  be made after confirmation of the effective implementation of  the  steps  of  the  Group's  reorganisation  scheduled  for 2023, a source of value creation for all stakeholders.  With this  30%  increase  in  performance  shares,  the  total compensation  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  would remain below the median of the benchmark used by the Company.\n\n## Annual fixed compensation\n\nThe  annual  fixed  compensation  of  the  Chief  Executive Officer  remains  unchanged  since  July  2020,  at  a  gross annual amount of \u20ac1,300,000, payable in twelve monthly instalments.\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nThe amount of annual variable compensation may reach 150%  of  the  fixed  compensation  paid  if  all  performance criteria are fully achieved. The annual variable compensation will be fully paid in cash.\n\nFor  the  2023  financial  year,  the  performance  criteria  set by  the  Board  of  Directors  include  four  financial  criteria and three strategic and sustainability criteria. The Board of  Directors  considered  that  these  are  key  indicators  of the performance of the Renault Group and in particular in the implementation of the Renaulution strategic plan.\n\nThe  criteria  and  their  weighting  are  shown  in  the  tables below.",

To ensure a close link with the Group's strategy and in line with the 2022 compensation policy, the following four financial criteria are maintained:\n\n- \u25cf the Group Operating Margin (Group OM);\n- \u25cf the Free Cash Flow (FCF);\n- \u25cf the Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), and\n- \u25cf the Fixed Costs (FC).\n\nChange of reference in the scale of payout rates\n\nIn a context of market volatility (geopolitics, raw material prices, energy prices, semiconductor crisis, logistics strains and overall cost inflation), a reference to a budget set at the beginning of the year is no longer adapted to the way business are conducted and to the need for the company to adapt quickly and agilely over the course of the year to market conditions and  various  contingencies.  Indeed,  Renault  Group  wants  to  manage  its  performance  in  a  demanding  manner  and  as closely as possible to the operational reality. To do so, it needs  to rely on updated rolling forecasts throughout the year without this impacting the objectives linked to compensation. Consequently, upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors decided to establish a payout scale based on threshold, upper and maximum bounds, which is consistent with market practices. The various objectives are still set in a consistent manner with  both  the  budget  and  the  financial  outlook  communicated  to  the  market,  with  a  level  of  requirement  that  will  be assessable ex-post.\n\nThese financial criteria are all quantifiable criteria.\n\n|                                                        | Group Operating Margin  (Group OM)                                                                                                                                                                      | Free Cash Flow (FCF)                                                                                                                                                                    | Return On Capital  Employed (ROCE)                                                                                                                                      | Fixed Costs (FC)                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Targets                                                | \u25cf The operating margin is the  key indicator of the  Company's profitability.                                                                                                                           | \u25cf A high level of free cash flow  demonstrates the use of  strict financial discipline  within the Company, allowing growth to be funded and the  possibility of dividend  payments.    | \u25cf ROCE measures the  profitability of capital  invested.

The  number  of  performance shares  allocated  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  is expressed  as  an  absolute  number,  rather  than  as  a percentage  of  the  salary,  so  that  both  upward  and downward fluctuations  in  the  share  price  will  affect  the total value of such long-term compensation.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer receives performance shares under  the  same  criteria  as  the  other  executives  in  the Group,  subject  to  an  additional  performance  criterion (Total  Shareholder  Return  -  TSR)  applied  to  him  in  his capacity as executive corporate officer.\n\nUpon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  of February  15 th , 2023,  decided  that  75,000  performance shares would be allocated to the Chief Executive Officer in respect of the 2023 financial year.\n\nIn  addition,  based  on  the  considerations  outlined  in  the introduction, a second allocation of 30% of performance shares may be made in 2023, once it has been established that the steps of the Group's reorganisation scheduled for 2023 have been effectively implemented. This allocation will correspond to:\n\n- \u25cf 22,500 Renault performance shares; or\n- \u25cf Ampere  shares  for  a  value  equivalent  to  these  22,500 Renault  shares,  should  Ampere  be  listed  in  2023  and subject to the decision of the board of directors and the shareholders' meeting of Ampere.\n\n## Renault performance shares\n\nFor Renault performance shares, performance criteria will be  measured  over  a  cumulative  three-year  period  (2023, 2024 and 2025).\n\nVesting of these performance shares is also subject to an over three-year presence condition starting from the date of the allocation by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe number of shares fully vested by the Chief Executive Officer out of the Renault performance shares allocated to  him  will  depend  on  the  achievement  of  the  following performance criteria.\n\nI",

In order to meet investors' expectations, the Board of Directors decided, upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, to use two distinct criteria: the free cash flow for the  annual  variable  compensation  and  the  Automotive  net  financial  position  for  the  long-term  compensation.  This approach  provides  two  different  but  complementary  ways  of  assessing  the  Group's  ability  to  generate  cash  and  to manage its net financial position in an agile manner over the long term.\n\nThe Automotive net financial position at the end of the year (net debt or net cash) is one of the three main criteria, together with  profitability  and  cash  generation  (FCF),  followed  by  the  credit  rating  agencies  in  assessing  the  Company.  This indicator allows the rating agencies to ascertain the Company's capacity to invest for the future and to pay dividends to shareholders.\n\nAs a reminder, the return to an \"investment grade\" credit rating is one of the Group's priorities and is closely linked to the dividend  policy,  which  is  to  progressively  increase,  in  a  disciplined  manner,  the  payout  rate  up  to  35%  of  the  Group consolidated net income - parent share, in the mid-term.\n\nAlignment of the scale of payout rates for the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) criterion to the other criteria\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  consistency  between  all  the  criteria  and  to  maintain  the  incentive  nature  o  the  TSR  criterion  while remaining  in  line  with  the  demanding  practices  of  the  market,  the  Board  of  Directors,  upon  recommendation  of  the Governance and Compensation Committee, decided to align the scale of payout rates for the TSR criterion with the other criteria: 0% below the benchmark, 70% at the benchmark, 100% at the benchmark +10%.\n\n|        | Total Shareholder Return  (TSR)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Automotive net                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Increase  in the net revenue  per vehicle                                                   | Sales mix of electrified  passenger cars  in Europe                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Target | \u25cf TSR is the market criterion  which reflects variations in  share prices, and dividends  paid.

This  policy involves  regular  implementation  of  various  employee shareholding mechanisms, such as:\n\n- \u25cf free  and  collective  allocations  of  shares,  without performance conditions,\n- \u25cf collective  offers  to  purchase  shares  under  the  Group savings plan,\n- \u25cf annual performance share plans, subject to demanding performance conditions,\n- \u25cf co-investment  plan  in  Renault  shares  offered  to  key Group managers.\n\nDetails of the employee shareholding policy are set out in chapter 3.2.5 of the Company's 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  will  be  eligible  for  the  coinvestment plan which will be offered again in 2023 to the Group's senior executives pursuant to the same terms and conditions summarized below:\n\n- \u25cf subject to voluntary investment in Renault shares up to a limit of 25% of cash compensation (annual gross fixed + variable  compensation)  allocated  for  the  2022 financial year;\n- \u25cf benefiting  from  a  maximum  matching  contribution  of 100% in the form of performance shares, the acquisition of which is subject to the achievement of performance criteria  assessed  over  a  cumulative  period  of  3  years (2024, 2025 and 2026) and to a condition of presence of at least 3 years from the date of allocation;\n- \u25cf with  an  obligation  to  retain  the  shares  for  at  least  a 5-year period from the date of the plan's implementation.\n\nIn  preparation  for  the  2022  Annual  General  Meeting,  the Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Lead Independent  Director  held  a  dialogue  with  certain investors to discuss, among other topics, the introduction of  the  co-investment plan in the compensation of Group executives.  Following  this  dialogue  and  after  having analysed  the  results  of  the  votes  at  the  last  Annual General  Meeting,  in  particular  the  level  of  shareholder support  for  the  approval  of  the  compensation  policy  for the Chief Executive Officer for the 2022 financial year, the Board  of  Directors  considers  that  the  Chief  Executive Officer's  eligibility to the  co-investment  plan  is  an",

He  also  benefits from  an  international  healthcare  cover  and  from  the same  life  insurance  and  supplementary  healthcare schemes as for the employees working in France.\n\n## Service provision agreement\n\nNo  service  provision  agreement  will  be  entered  into between the Company and the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## Sign-on bonus\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer does not receive any sign-on bonus.\n\n## Termination benefit\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  entitled  to  a  severance payment equal to the average of the last two years' gross fixed and variable annual paid compensation, payable in one instalment within six months of the departure, in the event  of  dismissal  at  the  initiative  of  the  Board  of Directors and subject to the achievement of performance conditions set by the Board of Directors.\n\nThis  termination  benefit  will  not  be  paid  in  the  event  of dismissal for serious or gross misconduct.\n\nThe total termination benefit and non-compete indemnity, in the event of the implementation of the noncompete  agreement  (see  below),  may  not  exceed  two years of annual fixed and variable compensation.\n\nAt  its  meeting  held  on  February  13,  2020,  the  Board  of Directors set the performance conditions for payment of the termination benefit. In order to receive this benefit, the following  cumulative  conditions  should  be  met  over  the last two financial years preceding the departure:\n\n- \u25cf a  minimum  total  achievement  rate  of  80%  of  the performance criteria for the annual variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u25cf achievement of the Group's free cash flow target.\n\n## Non-compete indemnity\n\nAt  its  meeting  held  on  February  13,  2020,  the  Board  of Directors  authorized  the  conclusion  of  a  non-compete agreement with Mr. Luca de Meo.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  considered  that  it  is  in  Renault's interest to enter into this non-compete agreement which protects  Renault  Group's  legitimate  interests,  given  the particularly competitive nature of the automotive market, the importance of the functions and the recognized skills of Mr. Luca de Meo in this market, the means available to him, and the sensitive information he holds and to which he can have access.\n\nUnder this agreement, Mr. Luca de Meo commits, as of the end of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer, not to engage, directly or indirectly, in an activity that competes with  those  of  the  Group,  on  his  own  behalf,  on  behalf  of companies  in  the  automotive  design,  construction  and marketing  sectors  (mainly  passenger  cars  and  light commercial  vehicles), or on behalf of automotive suppliers.\n\nApplication of this clause is limited to:\n\n- \u25cf a  period  of  twelve  (12)  months  following  the  date  on which Mr. Luca de Meo effectively ceases to exercise his term of office;\n- \u25cf the countries of the European continent and in Japan, as well  as  European  and  Japanese  car  and  equipment manufacturers.\n\nAs consideration for his non-compete obligation, Mr. Luca de Meo will receive from the Company, during the period of  application  of  the  agreement  (twelve  months)  and subject to there being no breach of this agreement, gross financial  compensation  corresponding  to  one  year  of gross  annual  compensation  (fixed  compensation  and annual  variable  compensation  paid  in  cash),  payable  in twelve monthly instalments. The gross annual compensation  used  for  this  calculation  will  be  the  one paid  during  the  twelve  months  preceding  the  date  of termination of the corporate office.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  recommendation  of  the  AFEPMEDEF Code at the time of Mr. Luca de Meo's departure, the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  will  decide whether to apply this non-compete agreement, and may unilaterally waive it. Furthermore, no compensation will be due in  the  event  of  retirement  or  if  Mr.  Luca  de  Meo  has reached the age of 65.\n\n## Top-up pension scheme\n\nDuring  its  meeting  on  February  13,  2020,  the  Board  of Directors  authorized  a  top-up  pension  scheme  for Mr. Luca de Meo.\n\nThe Board of Directors considered that implementing this scheme  to  the  benefit  of  Mr.  Luca  de  Meo  allows  the Company  to  retain  and  to  promote  the  Chief  Executive Officer's loyalty.\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer's  top-up  pension  scheme  is identical  to  that  available  to  members  of  the  Group Executive Committee (the so-called 'Article 83' plan and 'Article 82' plan).",

For  this reason,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  will  receive  a  lumpsum  indemnity  equal  to  the  amount  of  the  contribution paid  on  his  behalf  to  the  insurer.  Payment  of  this indemnity  will  be  concomitant  to  the  payment  of  the contribution to the insurer.\n\nThe  contributions  and  lump-sum  indemnity  amounts  will be dependent on the Company's performance insofar as the calculation basis includes the variable portion of the compensation which is related to the Group's results.\n\n## Adjustment clause in case of exceptional circumstances\n\nOn an exceptional basis, the Board of Directors shall have the  power  to  modify  one  or  more  of  the  performance criteria related to the annual variable compensation and/ or the long-term compensation (performance share plan and  co-investment  plan)  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer and/or  to  modify,  both  upwards  (within  the  limits  of  the caps  provided  for  in  the  compensation  policy)  and downwards,  one  or  more  of  the  criteria  underlying parameters  (weighting,  triggering  thresholds,  objectives, targets, etc.).\n\nThis option may be used by the Board of Directors only in the  event  that  special  and  exceptional  circumstances outside  Renault  have  material  consequences  on  the performance  of  the  Group,  which  could  not  have  been foreseen at the time the Board of Directors adopted this policy for presentation to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe purpose of these adjustments or modifications shall be to better reflect the effective performance of the Chief Executive Officer, taking into account the circumstances that  led  to  the  use  of  this  option,  when  applying  the compensation  policy.  In  this  context,  the  Board  of Directors  will  be  particularly  cautious  to  ensure  that  any changes made are correlated to the performance of the Group, in light of the circumstances, and to the situation of all  stakeholders.  The  Board  of  Directors  will  make  its decision on the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee and shall explain and justify its decision with regard to the circumstances that led to the use  of  this  option  and  the  alignment  with  shareholders' interests. Any use of this option will be communicated to the shareholders.\n\nI",

Legal framework\n\nIn  its  twenty-sixth  resolution,  the  Combined  General Meeting  held  on  May  25,  2022  authorized  the  Board  of Directors to proceed, on one or more occasions, with free allocations of existing Company shares and/or Company shares to be issued (so-called performance shares) for the benefit of members of staff and/or corporate officers of the Company and/or of French or non-French companies or  groups  directly  or  indirectly  related  to  it,  or  certain categories thereof, pursuant to the terms of Article L. 225197-2 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nPerformance  share  plans  are  decided  annually  by  the Board of Directors upon recommendation  of  the Governance and Compensation Committee.\n\nIn accordance with best market practices, the vesting of performance  shares  is  subject  to  (i) performance conditions set by the Board of Directors assessed over a minimum period of three years and (ii) a minimum vesting period of three years.\n\nThe  beneficiary  of  performance  shares  must  be  an employee or corporate officer within Renault Group at the vesting  date  of  the  shares.  In  case  of  departure  from Renault  Group  before  the  vesting  date,  the  beneficiary loses  his/her  entitlement  to  the  performance  shares granted  to  him/her,  except  in  the  case  of  compulsory  or voluntary early retirement.\n\nIn  the  event  of  the  death,  total  or  partial  invalidity,  or extended  sick  leave  of  the  beneficiary,  they  retain  the\n\nbenefit of the performance shares, and the performance conditions do not apply.\n\nPerformance  share  allocations  granted  pursuant  to  the aforementioned authorization are subject to the following caps being observed:\n\n- \u25cf the total number of performance shares allocated may not exceed 3% of the share capital over three years;\n- \u25cf the total number of performance shares allocated may not  exceed  10%  of  the  share  capital  on  the  date  on which the Board of Directors decides on their allocation;\n- \u25cf the number of performance shares allocated to senior executive  officers  may  not  exceed  15%  of  the  total number of shares allocated;\n- \u25cf the number  of  performance  shares  allocated  to members  of  the  executive  committee  (also  known  as Leadership  Team)  may  not  exceed  30%  of  the  total number  of  shares  allocated,  including  performance shares allocated to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nPursuant to the twenty-sixth resolution of the Combined General Meeting held on May 25, 2022, performance share allocations do not result in any dilution for the shareholders,  as  the  performance  shares  allocated  are treasury shares.\n\nThe authorization granted at the Annual General Meeting of  May  25,  2022  to  the  Board  of  Directors  to  allocate performance shares will expire in 2025.\n\n## 3.2.5.2. Allocation policy for the performance share plans\n\nThe Board of Directors approves the performance share plans  based  on  the  work  and  recommendations  of  the Governance and Compensation Committee. The committee examines the allocation proposals for certain Renault  Group  employees  presented  by  the  Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to the general scheme set by the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## The purpose of share allocations\n\nThe aim of performance share allocations is primarily to personally  associate  the  worldwide  management  of Renault Group, in particular the members of management bodies,  with  the  development  of  the  Group's  value  by allowing them to share ownership of the Company.\n\nIt also provides recognition of executives whose outstandingly positive  action  has  contributed  to  Renault Group's results.\n\nLastly, it helps to promote loyalty in executives who are of particular value to the Company, notably executives with a high potential for career development. The allocation of shares  increases  their  commitment  and  motivation  to implement growth in the Company.\n\nThis  scheme  has  proved  to  be  a  factor  in  strengthening the  role  of  responsibility  centers  throughout  Renault Group  worldwide,  more  particularly  in  the  Automotive sector, sales subsidiaries, vehicle and mechanical engineering,  bodywork and power train plant managers, industrial subsidiaries, as well as for all program managers and vehicles or components project managers. It  is  also  applied  in  sales  financing,  as  well  as  for  the managers of large support functions in Renault Group.\n\nI",

Employee shareholding policy\n\nIn  line  with  the  objective  of  significantly  increasing  the employee  shareholding  level  by  2030,  the  Board  of Directors of February 17, 2022 supported the principle of a strong  policy  of  developing  employee  shareholding  as part of the deployment of the Renaulution strategy.\n\nThis revival of employee shareholding within the Renault Group  is  included  in  certain  resolutions  submitted  to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 25, 2022. It forms part of the Renaulution plan  and  embodies    Renault  Group's  strategic  and managerial  commitment  to  give  all  Renault  Group employees a long-term opportunity to share in the fruits of future growth, starting with the strategy's second phase, 'Renovation'.\n\nIt will also strengthen collective commitment, thus fuelling the  success  of  the  new  strategy  and  aligning  the  longterm interests of Renault Group employees with those of shareholders,  whilst  also  contributing  to  the  stability  of Renault shareholding.\n\nThis policy is based on the following strategic orientations:\n\n- \u25cf Regular implementation of collective employee shareholding  offers,  which  could  take  the  form  of  an offer  to  acquire  shares  under  the  Group  Savings  Plan and the International Group Savings Plan, with employees  being  able  to  benefit  from  a  maximum discount  of  30%  on  the  stock  price  and  a  matching contribution,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the French Labor Code. In order to give all Group employees an opportunity to become shareholders, Renault could also make a collective free allocation of shares.\n- \u25cf Long-term  variable  compensation  through  annual allocation of performance shares, subject to a minimum three-year presence condition from the allocation date\n\nlevel  of  responsibility,  performance,  and  results.  Certain senior executives may not be beneficiaries.\n\n## Other beneficiary executives\n\nThe other beneficiaries are usually senior managers and managers with high professional or managerial development  potential  or  with  a  high  level  of  expertise. There are numerous complementary systems for assessing  and  selecting  these  beneficiaries  (level  of responsibility, annual appraisal interview, career committees, specific monitoring for high potential executives, etc.); these systems allow various observations  which  help  us  to  find  the  most  deserving candidates.\n\nOver the past five years, the total number of performance share beneficiaries has been:\n\n- \u25cf 1,123 under the 2018 plan,\n- \u25cf 1,322 under the 2019 plan,\n- \u25cf 1,421 under the 2020 plan,\n- \u25cf 2,015 under the 2021 plan, and\n- \u25cf 1,663 under the 2022 plan,\n\nand  demanding  performance  conditions,  assessed over at least three consecutive financial years.\n\n- \u25cf Implementation of a co-investment plan offered to the Group's  key  executives,  including  the  Chief  Executive Officer and the members of the Board of Management and  of  the  Corporate  Management  Committee,  based on each participant's voluntary, personal investment in Renault  shares  at  risk,  for  a  minimum  period  of  five years,  and  which  may  give  entitlement,  subject  to compliance  with  strict  attendance  and  performance conditions, to Renault performance  shares. This dynamic plan aims to promote the commitment of key executives to the Group's strategy.\n\nThe various mechanisms of this plan will be deployed in as many countries as possible, depending on regulatory and technical  constraints,  and  will  enable  employees  to acquire shares on preferential terms.\n\n## Employee share ownership operation Renaulution Shareplan 2022\n\nAs part of its new employee shareholding policy, Renault Group launched Renaulution Shareplan 2022, an extensive employee shareholding operation deployed in 29 countries and offered to over 110,000 employees.\n\nThe offer reserved for employees was carried out within the framework of Articles L. 3332-18 et seq. of the French Labour  Code,  as  well  as  the  savings  plans  of  Renault Group, DIAC and RRG. In some countries, due to local legal, tax and operational constraints, the offer was implemented outside this legal framework.",

The subscription price was EUR 22.02. In addition to this 30% discount, Renault Group added an additional contribution of 300%, capped at 6 free shares.\n\nThe  subscription  period  ran  from  November  24  to December  12,  2022  inclusive.  Delivery  of  the  shares subscribed  for  under  the  operation  took  place  on  7 February 2023. The shares acquired in that operation are held for 5 years (except in exceptional cases of early exit) through  a  company  mutual  fund  (FCPE)  or  in  some countries directly in a registered account.\n\nRenaulution  Shareplan  2022  was  a  great  success  with Group  employees:  95,396  employees  benefited  from  the free allocation of 6 shares and 40,307 subscriptions were recorded, representing a subscription rate of over 36% at Group level.\n\nThe contributions offered by Renault Group in the context of the operation (unilateral matching contribution equivalent to 6 shares and additional matching contribution  of  300%  capped  at  6  shares)  amounted  to more than \u20ac25,565,000.\n\nThe  total  investment  by  employees  was  more  than \u20ac41,520,000,  for  an  average  subscription  amount  per employee of \u20ac1,160.\n\nThe operation resulted in the transfer to Group employees of approximately 2,698,190 additional shares, representing 0.91% of Renault SA's share capital.\n\nThe success of the Renaulution Shareplan 2022 demonstrates  the  strong  commitment  of  the  Group's employees and their confidence in its strategic direction.\n\nIt  is  a  further  important  step  in  the  Group's  ambition  to reach 10% employee share ownership by 2030.\n\n## 2022 co-investment operation\n\nIn  line  with  its  employee  share  ownership  policy,  a  coinvestment  plan  was  offered  to  members  of  the Leadership  Team  (including  the  CEO)  and  to  nearly 450 key executives of the Renault Group.\n\nThe  operation  was  based  on  a  voluntary,  personal  and risky investment in Renault shares by each participant for a  minimum  period  of  five  years  and  gave  the  right  to  a matching contribution in the form of a free allocation of Renault performance shares.\n\nVesting  of  the  performance  shares  allocated  under  this operation will take place at the end of a three-year vesting period  and  subject  to  fulfillment  of  strict  presence  and performance conditions. Once vested, the shares will be subject to a two-year holding period.\n\nWith a 60% participation and nearly \u20ac7,000,000 invested in  Renault  shares,  the  co-investment  operation  was  very well received by eligible employees. On February 15, 2023, the  Board  of  Directors  allocated  199,660  performance shares to the 280 participants in the co-investment plan (excluding the CEO).\n\nThe  success  of  this  co-investment  operation  shows  the strong  commitment  of  Renault  Group's  key  executives who,  through  their  voluntary  investment  from  their  own funds, reiterate their trust in the Group's strategy and their commitment to achieving the Group's growth objectives.\n\nI",

The  risk  management  and internal control processes are implemented in all corporate functions and activities. The main objectives are:\n\n- \u25cf identify  and  manage  risks  to  which  the  company  is exposed;\n- \u25cf ensure compliance with rules, laws and regulations;\n- \u25cf control quality, cost and delivery times in its activities;\n- \u25cf ensure  that  financial,  accounting  and  management disclosures are reliable, relevant and of a high standard.\n\nThese structures and procedures cannot, however, offer an absolute  guarantee  that  the  company's  objectives  will  be achieved. In order to mediate between the opportunities and risks, Renault Group's global risk management system aims to reduce the impact and/or probability of events that may have a significant influence on the control of operations or the  fulfilment  of  objectives.  The  internal  control  and  risk management  systems  identify  and  assess  risks by measuring the level of risk factor control and the efficacy of management plans.\n\nThe  Group  comprises  the  following  operating  segments: Renault  Group's  Automotive  Division,  Mobility  Services, which include activities  related  to  new  forms  of  mobility (mainly  the  holding  company  Renault  MAI  and  its subsidiaries)  and  sales  financing,  Mobilize  Financial Services - Mobilize F.S. (trademark of RCI Banque S.A.).\n\nSince  2007,  Renault  Group  has  taken  into  account  the reference framework and implementation guidelines of the French  Financial  Markets  Authority  (AMF),  which  were updated in July 2010, and the recommendations of the Audit Committee  working  group  report  published  in  July  2010. This  framework  applies  to  the  Automotive  and  Mobility Services segments.\n\nSales financing, Mobilize Financial Services (Mobilize F.S.), has defined its own internal control and risk management framework,  which  is  described  in  chapter  4.1.6.  -  The specificities of Mobilize Financial Services, in accordance with  banking  and  financial  regulations.  Mobilize  F.S.  is subject  to  controls  by  the  French  Prudential  Supervisory Authority (ACPR) and the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\n## 4.1.1 Contributors to risk management\n\nSince 2021, Renault Group's Automotive Division has been structured around two main components:\n\n- \u25cf the  'Business  Units'  for  each  brand  are  responsible  for margins  and  customer  satisfaction.  They  drive  the organization towards targeted customers and markets;\n- \u25cf the  'Corporate  Functions'  include  all  other  business lines  of  the  company.  They  define  the  policies  and provide standards, methods and skills appropriate to the activities.  First,  engineering  is  directly  linked  to  the brands and bears full responsibility for the timing, costs and performance of product development.",

Operational  management  is responsible for identifying the risks associated with each activity and implementing actions to reduce their impact.\n\nEmployees  are  therefore  required  to  comply  with  the internal  control  system  defined  for  their  field  of  activity, the  Group's  code  of  ethics,  the  guide  for  preventing corruption  and  influence  peddling,  as  well  as  their  own dedicated  codes  of  ethics.  Operational  management  is responsible  in  particular  for  defining  and  monitoring  the implementation  of  action  plans  following  assignments conducted by the Internal Audit Department.\n\n## Second line of control: Risk Management, Internal Control, Performance and Control\n\nBeyond  their  role  as  the  first  line  of  control  via  their employees and managers, the 'Corporate' Functions also contribute as a second  line of control, as their management is responsible for:\n\n- \u25cf establishing  and  circulating  standards,  reference  texts and Group policies;\n- \u25cf regulatory monitoring;\n- \u25cf forming  and  coordinating  an  internal  and  external network of correspondents;\n- \u25cf ensuring  that  their  policies  and  standards  are  properly understood and applied;\n- \u25cf performing controls, when necessary, within the operational entities to check that they are being implemented.\n\n## They are supported in this process by:\n\n- \u25cf the Internal Control Department, which provides reasonable assurance on the level of internal control by assessing  its maturity  and  effectiveness.  For  this purpose,  it  circulates  self-assessment  questionnaires and  carries  out  compliance  tests.  It  also  ensures  that action  plans  are  identified  and  implemented  to  correct the shortcomings identified;\n- \u25cf the Risk Management Department, which is responsible for updating the mapping of the Group's major risks and monitoring action plans designed to reduce the impact or  probability  of  the  main  risks  identified  and  for providing  support  for  the  risk  mapping  of  operating entities, corporate functions and projects;\n- \u25cf the  Group  Performance  and  Control  Department,  with its  representatives  in  the  entities,  which  coordinates and  steers  the  process  in  the  field.  It  ensures  that  all personnel  comply  with  management  rules  and  assists operational staff in the coordination and monitoring of their action plans.\n\n## Third line of control: Internal Audit Department\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  Department  conducts  an  independent and objective assessment of the corporate governance, risk management and control  processes  as  defined  within  the Group.  The  mission,  role,  responsibilities  and  scope  of  the Internal Audit Department are laid down in an audit charter, the updated version of which was approved by the Audit and Risk  Committee  (CAR)  in  September  2022.  Through  its recommendations, Internal Audit contributes to the improvement of operational security and the optimization of the overall performance of the company. At the end of each assignment, Internal Audit issues a final report and summary note,  which  are  systematically  distributed  to  the  auditees, the functions/entities/projects concerned, the Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Chairman.  The  summary report  includes  an  opinion  issued  by  the  internal  audit department, which is intended to give an overall assessment of  the  level  of  control  of  the  audited  activities:  risk  under control  (green),  moderate  risk  (yellow),  significant  risk (orange), major risk (red).\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  Department  covers  all  entities  and activities  of  Renault  Group's  Automotive  branch  and Mobility Services.\n\nThe  finance  branch  (Mobilize  Financial  Services)  has  its own internal audit structure (see chapter 4.1.6.). The Internal Audit Department may also audit the functions converged with Nissan. For entities in partnership with Renault Group, the  intervention  of  the  internal  audit  can  be  done  after agreement of the partner. For activities entrusted to third parties,  the  intervention  of  internal  audit  is  possible  if  the audit clause in the contract so provides.\n\nI",

It  is  verified  by  Senior  Management  and approved by the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR). This audit plan  is  revised  as  necessary  to  take  into  account  additional requests or adjustments required.\n\nInternal Audit assignments make it possible to:\n\n- \u25cf assess the  compliance of  processes  and  their  application with the rules, standards, laws and regulations in force;\n- \u25cf assess the effectiveness of processes and the performance of transactions;\n- \u25cf verify  the  quality  of  the  controls  performed  by  the operational  departments  and  the  support  and  control functions;\n- \u25cf suggest areas for improvement or progress in the form of recommendations;\n- \u25cf fight against fraud and corruption;\n- \u25cf verify the effective implementation of the recommendations.\n\nFollowing  the  recommendations  made  in  each  audit report, an action plan defined by the auditees is validated by the internal audit. There are three levels of criticality for the  recommendations  (high,  medium,  low,  identified respectively as A, B and C). The Internal Audit Department ensures  that  the  recommendations  are  implemented. At least every six months, it prepares a status report on A and  B  recommendations  for  the  Leadership  Team (formerly BOM) and the CAR.\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  department  is  certified  by  the  French Institute of Audit and Internal Control (IFACI) 1 . This\n\ncertification,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  for  the professional practice of internal auditing (r\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel professionnel de l'audit interne - RAI), comprises 25 general requirements divided into 100 detailed requirements across five  categories:  positioning,  steering,  audit  processes,  GRC (governance,  risks  and  compliance)  assessment  program and professionalism.\n\n## Synchronization of activities\n\nIn  order  to  have  a  shared  vision  of  the  Group's  risks  and priority  issues,  to  define  a  consistent  approach,  and  to have  effective  follow-up  between  the  second  (Risk Management,  Internal  Control  and  Performance  and Control  Department)  and  third  (Internal  Audit)  lines  of control,  the  Risk  Management,  Internal  Control  and Internal Audit  departments  regularly  work  together closely. They synchronize their activities and ensure that their combined  actions  provide  reasonable  control of risks.\n\nThese actions were reinforced since 2021 with, for example, the systematic integration of the findings of internal audits and  the  annual  internal  control  campaign  into  the  risk management  of  the  Group,  operational  entities,  corporate functions and projects. Improvements to this synchronization were shared with the CAR.\n\nA joint mid-term Risk Management, Internal Control, Internal Audit  and  Quality  Department  project  was  initiated  at  the end of 2022 with the aim of acquiring a common tool with the best market standards in order to strengthen and optimise risk management within the Group.\n\n## 4.1.2 Governance of risk management\n\nThe first  two  lines  of  control  report  on  risk  management and  internal  control  to  the  Risk  and  Internal  Control Committee (CRCI), which is also responsible for validating and regularly assessing the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems.\n\nThis committee, chaired by the CFO of the Group, consists of 20 members representing the various corporate functions of the  company.  It  meets  six  times  a  year  and  examines,  in particular:\n\n- \u25cf the  mapping of the Group's major risks and, in each of these areas, the monitoring of treatment actions;\n- \u25cf the results of the annual internal control selfassessments conducted by the Internal Control Department and the monitoring of the associated action plans;\n- \u25cf proposals for improving the systems.\n\nFollowing this review, the CRCI may decide on corrective actions or request additional information.\n\nThe  first  two  lines  of  control  also  report  to  the  Board  of Management (BOM) on an ad hoc basis through thematic presentations.\n\nThe second and third lines of control present the results of their work to the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR), whose duties are defined in chapter 3.1.6.1.\n\nIn the course of their duties, the statutory auditors assess the  level  of  risk  management  and  internal  control  of  the preparation  and  processing  of  accounting  and  financial data as required and, when necessary, issue recommendations.\n\nIn the  operational  entities,  functions  and  projects,  the management committee meets regularly to, on the model of the Group CRCI, validate and assess the effectiveness of the control and risk management systems.",

The identification of risks is based on evaluations of  the  residual  impact  and  probability  of  occurrence (after  taking  into  account  the  treatment  plans),  the product  of  which  is  criticality.  This  method  is  applied  at Group level, at entity level, at global function level and at vehicle  project  level.  The  mapping  of  the  Group's  major risks (top-down and bottom-up approaches) is presented to the CRCI, Leadership Team and CAR, which validate it.\n\nThe major risk factors to which the Group is exposed are described in chapter 4.2.\n\nTo  carry  out  its  duties,  the  Risk  Management  Department (DMR) relies, in particular, on two networks:\n\n- \u25cf one comprising correspondents mainly from the performance  and  control  function  for  the  operating entities (countries, commercial and/or industrial subsidiaries) and the corporate functions, and from the quality  assurance  function  for  new  vehicle  projects. These  correspondents  are  known  as  Operational  Risk Managers (RMO). They work with the Risk Management Department  on  the  operational  implementation  of  risk management  processes  within  the  entities,  corporate functions and projects;\n- \u25cf the  other  made  up  of  experts  who  manage  a  specific area  of  risks.  These  may  be  risks  common  to  all companies  or  specific  to  one  of  Renault  Group's segments of activity. These experts are known as Expert Risk  Managers  (RME)  and  consult  on  the  standardized risk management plans in their area of expertise.\n\nTo draw up the audit plan for the company's major risks, which is validated by Senior Management and approved\n\n## 4.1.4 Internal control\n\nThe  internal  control  system  is  based  on  the  various guidelines and tools detailed below.\n\n## Group ethics and corporate function guidelines\n\nThe  'Corporate  Functions'  define  and  issue  the  policies and standards to be deployed, which are then rolled out as  procedures  and  operating  methods  to  ensure  that processes at the operational level function in accordance with the principles outlined in the Group's code of ethics, the guide  for preventing  corruption  and  influence peddling, and the dedicated codes of ethics.\n\nby the CAR, the Internal Audit Department uses risks map to  identify  the  most  pertinent  audit  themes  and  assess risk coverage. Through its auditing task, the Internal Audit Department provides the Risk Management Department with insight on the effective level of control of major risks.\n\nThe  risk  management  policy  is  applied  at  Group  level  for major  risks.  It  is  rolled  out  at  the  operating  entity  level (countries,  commercial  and/or  industrial  subsidiaries),  for Corporate Functions and for new vehicle projects.\n\nIn  2022,  the  Risk  Management  Department  focused  its activities on:\n\n- \u25cf updating  the  mapping  of  the  Group's  major  risks.  This exercise  took  a  top-down  approach  that  involved  the Group's 70 main executives, complemented by a bottomup approach based on the analysis of the risk maps of the entities,  corporate  functions  and  new  vehicle  projects performed at the end of 2021 and in 2022;\n- \u25cf consolidating treatment plans and processes to improve the control of the major risks;\n- \u25cf reinforcing  the  governance  of  major  risks  through regular sharing with the BOM and the CAR;\n- \u25cf assisting  the  operational  entities,  corporate  functions and new vehicle projects for the implementation of risk maps  produced  with  the  operational  risk  managers concerned and for the monitoring of treatment plans;\n- \u25cf leading  the  network  of  operational  risk  managers  and experts and the representatives of the performance and control,  internal  control  and  internal  audit  functions  in sharing best practices.\n\nIn addition, awareness-raising actions for Group employees about risk culture and the fundamentals of risk management  were  continued  by  the  Risk  Management Department  (communication  and  training,  in  particular through e-learning modules).\n\nThe  Internal  Control  Department  manages  internal control  issues  within  the  business  lines  through  a methodology that aims, in particular, to:\n\n- \u25cf work  with  the  business  lines  to  identify  the  main  risks relating  to  operational  processes  and  likely  to  have  a significant impact on the achievement of objectives;\n- \u25cf formalize the 'metarules' to be applied in the activities;\n- \u25cf identify  and  formalize  the  key  controls  aimed  at controlling the identified risks.\n\nThe  Risk  and  Internal  Control  Committee  validates  the metarules  and  key  controls  managed  by  the  business lines,  which are then included in the internal control selfassessment questionnaire.\n\nI\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nRisk and control",

It  provides  an  overview  of  the  internal  control system and is an entry point to the various business sites.\n\nThis internal control reference document is updated every year to take into account the evolution of identified risks and  organizational  changes.  Recommendations  made following  internal  audits  or  by  the  statutory  auditors  are taken into account during this update.\n\nThe  Internal  Control  Department  relies  on  a  network  of internal  control  correspondents  who  are  affiliated  with the Performance and Control function of the subsidiaries and  corporate  functions  and  are  the  key  contacts  for internal control issues. They  lead  and  ensure  the implementation of internal control objectives within their scope.\n\n## Control activity\n\nOnce  a  year, an internal control self-assessment campaign  (questionnaires  forms)  based  on  these  risk control factors is sent to the Group's main entities by the Internal  Control  Department.  The  CEOs  of  the  entities validate  these  self-assessments  and  commit  to  defining and  implementing  action  plans  to  remedy  any  internal control  shortcomings  identified.  These  action  plans  are subject  to  regular  monitoring  by  the  Internal  Control Department.\n\nThe  results  of  these  self-assessments  are  presented  to the  Risk  and  Internal  Control  Committee  (CRCI)  and  the CAR once a year.\n\nCompliance  tests  are  conducted  based  on  a  sample  of entities by the internal controllers of the Internal Control Department to verify the quality of the self-assessments. Any  significant  deviation  from  the  expectations  of  the reference  document  gives  rise  to  an  action  plan.  This internal  control  system  applies  to  the  parent  company and all  significant  entities,  fully  consolidated  companies in particular.\n\nEntities with lower risk levels (entities not fully consolidated  or  unconsolidated  entities)  are  subject  to separate  internal control systems. Newly  acquired companies are consolidated according to their potential risk impact in the various internal control systems, during the  first  campaign  following  their  integration.  In  the  first year of self-assessment, the results are not consolidated with the Group results, as the focus is on the action plans.\n\nThe  work  of  the  Internal  Control  Department  in  2022 included:\n\n- \u25cf continued  action  to  improve  the  corruption  prevention system and support for the operational staff concerned;\n- \u25cf updating of the \"risk control factors\" taken into account for the 2022 self-assessment campaign;\n- \u25cf the  creation  and  deployment  of  a  series  of  e-learning modules for internal control training;\n- \u25cf seven e-learning modules implemented (Introduction to Internal Control, Corporate Governance, Business Process Control,  Delegation  Of  Authority  (DOA),  Internal Control  System,  Segregation  of  Duties  and  Fraud)  in addition to traditional face-to-face training;\n- \u25cf the organization by the Group Internal Control department of quarterly webinars dedicated to leading the network of internal controllers;\n- \u25cf the  continuation  of  preventive  and  detection  controls based on a Data Analytics process.\n\nThe  \"tone  at  the  top\"  in  terms  of  internal  control  was reaffirmed by the circulation of an editorial written by the CFO  in  the  introduction  to  the  annual  self-assessment questionnaire, but also on the occasion of the release of the internal control e-book, the distribution of which was supported by editorials written by the CEO and the CFO of the Group.\n\nThese  internal  control  communication  and  coordination activities  will  be  continued  in  2023  in  the  context  of  the new  organization.  Governance  and  consideration  of  the internal control expectations in the new companies will be given priority in 2023.\n\n## Internal delegations and separation of offices\n\nIn addition to command-line structures, the Group has set up  a  staff  reporting  system  so  that  corporate  function managers  can  provide  leadership  for  their  function correspondents throughout the Group.\n\nThe  decision-making  process  is  based  on  a  system  of internal delegation that determines in which areas and at which levels operational managers may make decisions. All the rules for delegating decision-making authority are communicated  to  personnel  via  the  intranet.  Decision requests  are  tracked  in  a  workflow  that  implements  the rules specifying the persons to be involved, in accordance with  internal  control  procedures  or  documented  in  the minutes  of  the  committees  responsible  for  making  the decision.\n\nThe  principle  of  segregation  of  duties  and  tasks  is required at all hierarchical and functional levels within the Group  and  within  the  computer  systems  to  facilitate independent control and to separate tasks and functions corresponding  to  operations,  the  protection  of  property and their booking for accounting purposes.",

Group Management Control develops performance guidelines for each  of  the  operating  segments,  brands  and  functions. These  include  the  macroeconomic  assumptions  to  be taken into account (exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates,  commodity  prices,  etc.),  the  financial  and  nonfinancial  indicators  to  be  measured  in  the  following  year, the  timing  and  the  segmentation  of  the  scope  of  activity. Each brand is responsible for transmitting its instructions to the  subsidiaries  within  its  scope  after  having  completed them with the specificities of the function.\n\nThe  performance  and  control  function  is  responsible  for managing and measuring economic performance at the various  levels  of  the  organization  (group,  operating segments, brands, functions).\n\nManagement  control  is  carried  out  in  a  decentralized manner in order to take into account the specific aspects of each function. A framework is provided for its duties, in particular,  by  the  periodic  instructions  provided  by  the Group Performance and Control Department.\n\nUnder the Group's management plan, its role is to:\n\n- \u25cf set out the Group's economic objectives and budget;\n- \u25cf participate  in  the  implementation  of  the  internal  control system and Renault Group's risk management approach;\n- \u25cf coordinate the Group by measuring the performance of entities, operating segments, brands and functions and, in particular, by  monitoring  indicators  relating  to operating  margin  for  all  operating  segments  and  free cash flow for the Automotive operating segments;\n- \u25cf analyze  proposed  management  decisions  at  any  level from an economic perspective, check their consistency with standards, plans and budgets, judge their economic relevance  and  give  an  opinion  and  recommendation on them.\n\nFor the preparation of accounting and financial information,  the  Group  relies  on  management  reference guidelines  indicating  the  fundamental  management principles applicable to the company.\n\nThe internal control system for accounting and financial information is based on the AMF reference framework. It covers  not  only  the  processes  involved  in  preparing financial information, for closing the accounts, forecasting  phases  or  financial  communication  but  also\n\nthe upstream operational processes involved in producing this information.\n\nThe  Group  has  information  systems  that  allow  the simultaneous production of financial statements according  to  local  standards  and  Group  standards.  This mechanism thus guarantees the consistency of data in a context of centralization and consolidation of information within a short time frame. Under the functional authority of  the  VP,  Group  Accounting  (DCGr),  responsibility  for drawing  up  the  financial  statements  lies  with  the  Chief Financial  Officers  of  the  subsidiaries,  who  report  to  the Chairpersons and Chief Executive Officers of these same subsidiaries.\n\nA  manual  defines  the  Group's  shared  standards  of presentation and valuation. This manual, which is updated year  after  year,  is  made  available  to  all  entities  via  the Group's  portal  and  ensures  the  consistency  of  the reported financial information.\n\n## Principles applied in preparing the financial statements\n\nRenault  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements  are prepared  in  accordance  with  the  International  Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the adoption regulations of which were published in the Official Journal of the European Union as of the reporting date.\n\nThe  Group  Accounting  Department,  which  is  under  the direct authority of the Group's Chief Financial Officer, has an  'Accounting  Standards'  unit.  It  has  the  authority  to effectively  enforce  the  application  of  the  applicable accounting principles. Company employees are regularly informed of changes and updates to IFRS.\n\nRenault Group, which comprises three distinct operating segments,  prepares  consolidated  financial  statements using a single consolidation tool, structured according to a single chart  of  accounts  for  all  entities  in  the consolidation scope.\n\nIt  publishes  consolidated  half-yearly  and  annual  financial statements. These statements are prepared in advance on the  basis  of  two  pre-closing  dates:  31  May  for  the  June closing  and  31  October  31,  for  the  December  close. Summary  meetings  are  organized  with  the  statutory auditors  and  attended  by  Senior  Management  as  part  of their ongoing discussions. The CAR is involved at every key stage of the approval process for financial and accounting disclosures. Consolidated revenues are published quarterly.\n\nI",

In  particular,  the  definition  and monitoring of user profiles helps to ensure that the rules of task separation are respected.\n\nControl  of  basic  transactions  handled  by  operational systems,  where  the  initial  control  takes  place,  is  key  to ensuring that accounting and financial data are reliable. The  operational  systems  feed  data  to  the  auxiliary accounting systems through interfaces. These interfaces, which are continually monitored to ensure they capture all economic events for each upstream process, then rapidly and  regularly  send  these  data  to  the  centralized accounting system.\n\nThe accounting teams have worked with IT staff to develop a security process to protect the ERP in the event of a major malfunction. A business continuity plan has been prepared at  corporate  level.  It  is  deployed  in  those  subsidiaries  that use the ERP.\n\n## Statutory auditors' charter\n\nIn  connection  with  the  statutory  audit  of  its  accounts, Renault  Group  took  the  initiative  in  2004  of  drafting  a charter  concerning  the  tasks  and  independence  of  the statutory  auditors  and  signing  it  with  them.  This  charter governs  the  relationship  between  Renault  Group  (the parent company and the French and foreign subsidiaries) and  its  statutory  auditors.  The  charter  was  updated  in 2020 as part of the renewal of the Board of Auditors in 2019 to  take  into  account  regulatory  changes  relating  to statutory audits.\n\n## Financial communication\n\nRenault  Group  has  chosen  to  entrust  all  of  the  Group's financial communication to the Investor Relations Department within the Finance Department and to provide it with the functions necessary to accomplish this mission.\n\nThe Investor Relations Department is responsible for:\n\n- \u25cf communication with the financial markets;\n- \u25cf relations with investors and individual shareholders;\n- \u25cf relations with financial rating agencies;\n- \u25cf relations  with  analysts  and  investors  specialized  in socially responsible investments;\n- \u25cf relations with the regulatory authority (AMF);\n- \u25cf steering  the  preparation  of  the  annual  and  half-yearly earnings reports and quarterly information;\n- \u25cf filing the Universal Registration Document with the AMF, produced under the responsibility of the Internal Control Department.\n\n## 4.1.6 Specificities of Mobilize Financial Services\n\nMobilize  Financial  Services  (Mobilize  F.S.)  has  a  global internal  control  system  which  aims  to  identify,  analyze and  manage the main risks  identified  in  relation  to  the company's objectives. The Mobilize F.S. group's Internal Control Committee has validated the general framework for this system, which is described in the Internal Control Charter.\n\nThis  charter  defines  the  system  applicable  to  all  the French  and  foreign  companies  over  which  Mobilize  F.S. has effective control and specifies in particular:\n\n- \u25cf the general arrangements for managing internal control;\n- \u25cf the  local  arrangements  for  subsidiaries,  branches  and joint ventures;\n- \u25cf the special arrangements for various functional areas.\n\nRisk  control  at  Mobilize  Financial  Services  is  overseen  on three levels by separate functions:\n\nThe  first  line  of  defense is  exercised  by  the  operational functions  in  charge  of  day-to-day  risk  management  as part  of  the  activities  in  their  area  of  expertise.  These functions decide and are responsible for taking risks in the conducting  of  transactions  and  the  objectives  assigned to  them.  They  exercise  this  responsibility  in  accordance with the management rules and the risk limits defined by the Corporate functional departments.\n\nThe Corporate functional departments are in charge of risk definition, rules, management methods, measurement and monitoring at the corporate level.  Each  department,  in  its area  of  expertise, manages  and  oversees  the  risk management system via guidelines and country objectives. Risk is monitored by periodic dedicated committees both in the  subsidiaries  and  centrally.  These  departments  rely  on local  representatives  for  risk  measurement  and  exposure monitoring  and  ensure  that  limits  are  respected  at  the Group level.",

More  specifically,  they  verify  the relevance of the first line of defense;\n- \u25cf the Risk and Banking Regulations Department of the Risk Management Division,  which  oversees  the  deployment of  the  Group's  Risk  Governance  Policy,  verifies  the efficiency of risk management by the business divisions, as  well  as  compliance  with  the  limits  and  warning thresholds  set,  and  reports  any  overruns  to  the  Risk Committee of the Mobilize F.S. Board of Directors;\n- \u25cf the  Compliance  Department,  which  coordinates  the compliance measures and ensures their proper implementation throughout the Mobilize F.S..\n\nThe  third  line  of  defense is  the  internal  audit  function, which aims to provide assurance to Mobilize F.S. Board of Directors  and  Senior  Management  about  the  degree  of control over transactions and the oversight exercised by the first two lines.\n\nThe risk management system covers all the macroprocesses of Mobilize F.S. and includes the following tools:\n\n- \u25cf a  list  of  the  main  so-called  critical  and  significant  risks for  which  a  pilot,  appetite  level,  alert  thresholds  and limits  are  defined  (Risk  Appetite  Framework).  For  each risk,  a  detailed  analysis  is  performed,  identifying  the components  of  the  risk  and  the  management  and control principles that will enable the company to be in line  with  its  risk  appetite.  These  elements  are  reviewed at least once a year in line with the business model and strategy of Mobilize F.S. Group;\n- \u25cf he mapping of operational management rules contributes  to  risk  control;  it  is  deployed  in  all  the consolidated  subsidiaries  of  Mobilize  F.S.  Group.  This map  is  regularly  updated  by  the  central  business departments.  The  level  of  control  of  operational management  rules  is  assessed  annually  by  the designated process owners, who are responsible for risk management in their respective areas of competence in line with Group standards, for defining and updating the corresponding procedures and first-level controls;\n- \u25cf a  regulatory  monitoring  system  run  by  the  Risk  and Banking Regulations Department of the Risk Management  Division,  in  liaison  with  officers  in  the Corporate Divisions, with a view to monitoring, analysing and  informing  operational  staff  of  any  regulatory changes affecting Mobilize F.S.;\n- \u25cf the incident  collection  database,  which  makes  it possible  to  identify  malfunctions  corresponding  to predefined criteria and to implement the corrective and preventive  actions  necessary  to  control  risks.  This database  is  used  for  internal  and  regulatory  reporting purposes. The system sets thresholds requiring immediate  communication  of  incidents  to  the  Mobilize F.S.  Executive  Committee,  the  Mobilize  F.S.  Board  of Directors,  the  Renault  Group's  Ethics  and  Compliance Committee (ECC), the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel et de R\u00e9solution (ACPR) and the European Central Bank.\n\n## Bodies and actors involved in internal control and risk management within Mobilize F.S.\n\nThe  Mobilize  Financial  Services  Board  of  Directors,  as  a supervisory body, has the following responsibilities:\n\n- \u25cf it decides on the bank's business strategy and monitors the  implementation,  by  Executive  Directors  and  the Executive  Committee,  of  supervisory  procedures  to ensure effective and prudent management;\n- \u25cf it  approves and periodically reviews the strategies and policies  for  taking  on,  managing,  monitoring  and reducing ris;\n- \u25cf it examines the governance model, periodically assesses its effectiveness, and ensures that corrective action is taken to remedy any shortcomings;\n- \u25cf it oversees the publication and communication processes  and  checks  the  quality  and  reliability  of information  due  to  be  published  and  disclosed  by  the company.\n\nWithin  this  framework,  it  devotes  at  least  one  annual meeting  to  reviewing  the  internal  control  system  and validates the annual report on internal control sent to the ACPR.\n\nIn  carrying  out  its  tasks,  the  Board  of  Directors  relies  in particular on the work of four specialized committees of the Board:\n\n- \u25cf the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee meets four times a year.  It  is  responsible  for  preparing,  presenting  and monitoring  the  financial  statements,  overseeing  the statutory  audit  of  the  separate  and  consolidated financial  statements,  monitoring  the  independence  of the  statutory  auditors  and  the  definition  of  their  nonauditing  services,  recommending  the  appointment  of the  statutory  auditors  and  monitoring  their  rotation, verifying  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  and  risk management  systems,  reviewing the audit plan, analysing the audits carried out and reviewing investments in unconsolidated companies;\n- \u25cf the Risk Committee meets at least four times a year. Its tasks  include  examining  the  risk  maps  and  validating their  definition,  analysing  and  validating  risk  limits  at Mobilize F.S. level in line with the Board's risk appetite.

The risks presented in  chapter  2.1.5  'Extra-financial  performance'  of  this  Document  have  been  included  in  this  analysis.  Depending  on  their materiality,  they  fed  into  the  description  of  certain  risk  factors.  This  is  the  case,  for  example,  with  risks  related  to  global warming, the protection of personal data or supplier relations.\n\nHowever, it cannot be ruled out that other risk factors currently considered insignificant or not identified could adversely affect  Renault  Group  in  the  future.  Also,  possible  changes  in  the  Group's  medium-term  strategic  plan  could  result  in changes in the nature or relative importance of risk factors. It should be noted that the major risk mapping is updated every year, in close collaboration with the preparatory work and implementation of the strategic plan, so that the plan integrates the appropriate action plans designed to respond to the operational or strategic risks identified.\n\nThe major risk factors resulting from the Group's analysis for all of its operating segments are summarized in the following table  and  presented  below  with  their  own  level  of  criticality.  In  each  of  the  five  categories,  risk  factors  with  the  higher criticality levels are described at the beginning. These same major risk factors are then presented in a two-dimensional matrix  (impact  and  probability  of  occurrence).  The  thresholds  for  moving  from  one  impact  category  to  another  were revised in 2022 to allow for a better prioritisation of the risks in the matrix and in the table.\n\n## Renault Group risk factors\n\n|                    |                                                                           | CRITICALITY LEVEL   | CRITICALITY LEVEL   | CRITICALITY LEVEL   |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                    |                                                                           | LOW                 | MEDIUM              | HIGH                |\n| STRATEGY           | Global warming risks                                                      |                     |                     |                     |\n| STRATEGY           | Risk of insufficient response to disruption of existing activities        |                     |                     |                     |\n|                    | Risk of insufficient capacity to develop new businesses                   |                     |                     |                     |\n|                    | Risk of inadequate performance by the Alliance                            |                     |                     |                     |\n| OPERATIONS         | Risk of supply chain disruption                                           |                     |                     |                     |\n|                    | Risks related to geopolitical instability and economic conditions         |                     |                     |                     |\n|                    | Social risk                                                               |                     |                     |                     |\n|                    | Risk of natural, health or industrial disasters                           |                     |                     |                     |\n| PRODUCTS           | Risk of inadequate definition, product and service delivery or innovation |                     |                     |                     |\n| AND SERVICES       | Risk of product or service quality defects                                |                     |                     |                     |\n| CROSS-GROUP  RISKS | Risk of cyberattack and failure of information systems                    |                     |                     |                     |\n| CROSS-GROUP  RISKS | Risk of a lack of resources and talent                                    |                     |                     |                     |\n|                    | Risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations, including corruption    |                     |                     |                     |\n|                    | Legal risks                                                               |                     |                     |                     |\n| FINANCIAL          | Foreign exchange risk                                                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| RISKS              | Liquidity risk                                                            |                     |                     |                     |\n|                    | Customer and network credit risk                                          |                     |                     |                     |\n|                    | Risk of exposure to residual values                                       |                     |                     |                     |\n|                    | Interest rate risk                                                        |                     |                     |                     |\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## 4.2.1 Risks related to strategy\n\n## Global warning risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal warming risks are analyzed under two categories: transition  risks  and  physical  risks,  which  are  detailed  in section 2.3.2.1.4.1.\n\n## Transition risks\n\nThese risks are associated with developments towards a low-carbon  economy,  and  all  the  adaptations  that  this involves.\n\nThe  Group  is  subject  to  increasingly  stringent  and restrictive requirements concerning, on the one hand, the level of greenhouse gas emissions during the vehicle use phase: CAFE-type  regulations  or local or regional restrictions or bans on certain vehicles or engines, and on the other hand, the level of emissions from the supply and production chains.\n\nIn  addition,  as  part  of  its  Renaulution  strategic  plan,  the Group  has  made  a  commitment  to  achieve  carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050.\n\nIn this context, the risks for the Group are that it will not be able  to  comply  with  external  constraints  or  fulfil  its  own commitments  in  terms  of  decarbonization  or  that  the responses  provided,  particularly  with  regard  to  the introduction  of  electric  and  hybrid  technologies,  with varying  performance in terms of customer service costs and CO2 emissions, will prove to be imperfectly adapted to market  expectations  or  will  result  in  additional  costs incompatible with profitability requirements.\n\nThis risk is also assessed in terms of reputation: a mismatch between the Group's offering and its climate commitments  and  the  expectations  of  its  stakeholders could  damage  its  brand  image,  reducing  its  appeal  to customers, suppliers and employees.\n\nLastly, the accelerated pace of technological development  associated  with  this  energy  transition  will create a need to update know-how by investing in training and acquiring new skills.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group's Climate Strategy, published in April 2021, sets out  specific  targets  with  action  plans  and  monitoring indicators,  which  are  detailed  in  chapter  2.3.2.1  of  this Document.\n\nThis  strategy  is  based  on  nine  priority  actions,  covering both the vehicle use phase (scope 3 - Downstream), which accounts  for  almost  80%  of  the  Group's  emissions,  and the supply and manufacturing phases (scope 1, 2 and 3 Upstream).\n\nIt is accompanied by strengthened governance as part of the Group's overall Sustainable Development governance (see  chapter  2.3.1.2  of  this  Document),  involving  all  the departments  concerned  at  the  highest  level,  and  is\n\nsupported  by  the  implementation  of  proven  tools  and processes  such  as  the  'CAFE  Control  Tower'  set  up  in 2019,  which  is  responsible  for  steering  the  Group's  CAFE trajectories as well as the carbon footprint over the entire vehicle  life  cycle,  reporting  its  results  to  the  Leadership Team on a monthly basis.\n\nThe Group has also set up internal carbon pricing (ICP) to manage the reduction of its CO2 emissions by internalizing the  economic  cost  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  its various  areas:  new  vehicle  projects,  industrial  facilities and procurement of parts and raw materials (section 2.3.2.1.2.3).\n\nLastly,  the  management  of  these  transition  risks  is integrated  into  the  management  of  other  risk  factors, notably:\n\n- \u25cf risks  of  inadequate  definition,  product  and  service delivery or innovation;\n- \u25cf risk of insufficient capacity to develop new businesses;\n- \u25cf risks of supply chain disruption.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nThese  are  the  consequences  of  climate  change  on  the Group's activities.\n\nGiven  the  potential  impact  of  extreme  weather  events (hurricanes,  floods,  droughts)  on  the  Group's  industrial and  logistics  activities,  their  increased  frequency  or intensity, linked to global warming, combined with a rise in temperatures and sea levels, are aggravating factors for these  risks  and  could  lead  to  an  increase  in  prevention and maintenance costs and a rise in insurance premiums.\n\nSimilarly, the increasing scarcity of some  natural resources, such  as  water,  may  impact  production conditions  in  certain  countries.  The  increasing  use  of certain  raw  materials  necessary  for  the  production  of electric  vehicles,  such  as  cobalt  or  lithium,  may  also create tensions.\n\n## Risk management\n\nAs the physical risks associated with climate change are essentially  aggravating  factors  of  existing  risks,  their treatment is incorporated into the corresponding management systems:\n\n- \u25cf the  analysis  and  monitoring  of  the  risk  of  natural disasters and industrial accidents on our sites and supply chains are gradually incorporating the potential impacts of climate change. These risks are analyzed especially in the  context  of  investment  requests  and  the  building maintenance strategy;\n- \u25cf the  impact  of  global  warming  on  the  supply  and extraction  of  certain  raw  materials  is  also  integrated into the monitoring of the risk of supply chain disruption (see paragraph on raw materials);\n- \u25cf in  the longer term, climate change is also a component of  the  risks  associated  with  geopolitical  instability  and economic conditions.\n\nI\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nRisk and control",

Actions  are  implemented  across  the board,  such  as,  in  2022,  a  comprehensive  study  of  the vulnerability of our industrial and logistics sites to extreme climate  scenarios.  This  study  served  to  identify  the  sites that  could  be  the  most  affected  by  global  warming according to these scenarios, to better qualify and quantify these risks - particularly those that are much more severe compared  with  the  current  situation  -  with  a  view  to launching or reinforcing necessary preventive actions.\n\n## Risk of insufficient response to disruption of existing activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group's  activities  face  the  risk  of  major  disruptions, such as, for example, the development of digital resources that transform  commercial  activities  and  promote disintermediation  through  the  arrival  of  new  players. These  developments  pose  threats  in  particular  to  the Group's distribution strategy and after-sales activities.\n\n## Distribution strategy\n\nThe automotive distribution model faces several challenges that are also risks:\n\n- \u25cf changing  customer  needs  and  concerns,  with  growing environmental awareness and the need for the network to  contribute  to  the  marketing  of  new  personalised mobility offers;\n- \u25cf changes  to  regulations,  particularly  European  ones,  to take  account  of  the  changing  commercial  environment due to the development of online car sales;\n- \u25cf the  emergence  of  new  competitors  favouring  direct distribution  to  position  themselves  on  the  European market, and relying on high-performance digital tools;\n- \u25cf greater profitability and distribution cost-reduction constraints linked to the macro-economic environment.\n\n## Management system\n\nThe Group's distribution strategy is being transformed to meet these challenges, with the following aims:\n\n- \u25cf offer  the  customer  a  \"phygital\"  customer  journey  and develop e-commerce;\n- \u25cf manage  the  vehicle's  entire  life  cycle  to  secure  each activity, maximise profitability and strengthen customer loyalty;\n- \u25cf capitalise  on  the  growth  of  the  used-car  market  to improve brand and network performance.\n\nRenault Group has chosen to capitalise on its network by integrating it into the new value chains, while at the same time  developing  the  distribution  contract  to  tighten  the representation standards of the brands. The new Renault Group European distribution contract will come into force at the beginning of 2024. This contract places the Group's requirements  around  five  inseparable  activities:  new vehicles,  used-vehicle  sales  under  the  Renault  label, distribution of after-sales products, repair and\n\nmaintenance  services,  and  financing  services  and solutions.  This  flexible  contract  facilitates  the  pooling  of certain activities and back-office synergies, enabling the Group  to  strengthen  its  selectivity  criteria  and  optimise network costs.\n\n## After-sales activity\n\nThe  after-sales  activity,  which  is  essential  in  terms  of profit and  customer  satisfaction, is undergoing  a profound  transformation  with  the  arrival  of  new  players and new technologies. It faces three types of risks:\n\n- \u25cf the  increase  in  the  number  of  electric  vehicles  shall cause  the  average  cost  of  maintenance  and  servicing operations  to  fall  due  to  the  less  complex  nature  of electrical components, and it also favours the arrival of new players;\n- \u25cf connectivity  technology  opens  up  new  opportunities (remote  access  to  the  vehicle,  transformation  of customer  experience),  but  also  reduces  the  number  of accidents and therefore the number of workshop visits;\n- \u25cf the  independent  aftermarket  represents  a  significant and  growing  share  of  the  market,  and  is  giving  rise  to new players, who are focused on intermediation with a strong digital component.\n\n## Risk management\n\nTo meet after-sales challenges, the Group has implemented an after-sales strategy based on three avenues:\n\n- \u25cf deliver  a  best-in-class  customer  experience  in  line  with each brand's promises, while making use of common and modernised assets (logistics, digitalisation of the customer journey and network tools) to generate more value;\n- \u25cf deliver  offers  adapted  to  the  entire  life  cycle  of  the vehicle, in terms of repairs and customisation, in order to increase  customer  loyalty,  particularly  among  those who own an old vehicle;\n- \u25cf develop a relevant, qualitative independent aftermarket (IAM)  offer  based  on  the  manufacturer's  experience, both physical and digital, in order to win over new multibrand customers and win back customers who have left our networks. This offer is supported by the companies, Motrio, Kadensis and Fixter.\n\n## Risk of insufficient capacity to develop new businesses\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAgainst a background of deep and sustained transformation in demand and the mobility offerings, in line  with  societal  changes  and  environmental  and climate  issues,  Renault  Group  could  be  faced  with  an inadequate ability, within a given time frame, to change its business model, to anticipate and adapt to changes and possible disruptions of markets, mobility offers and related value chains, and thus to develop new business. This  could  lead  to  lower  revenues  than  the  objectives for  the  affected  portions  of  the  Group's  commercial offering,  as  a  result  of  a  lack  of  innovation  and inadequate  preparation  for  its  future,  beyond  the deadlines of the current strategic plan.",

These  innovative  service offerings  are  housed  within  the  automotive  brands,  the Mobilize  Business  Unit  created  in  2020  and  include  the following initiatives:\n\n- \u25cf in  May  2022,  on  the  occasion  of  a  capital  market  day, Mobilize presented  its  missions  which  are  to  find solutions  to  the  gap  between  the  use  and  the  cost  of vehicles, to respond to the problems of rapid decrease in values  and  goods,  and  participate  in  reducing  the environmental  impact  of  the  automobile,  accompanied by concrete projects and quantified objectives;\n- \u25cf the Refactory project  in  Flins,  Europe's  first  circulareconomy  plant  dedicated  to  mobility,  launched  on 25  November  2020,  is  another  example  of  the  ongoing move towards innovative offers. This concept has been developed in other Group entities, for example, in Seville, Spain (announcement of 5 November 2021;\n- \u25cf in  October  2022,  Renault  announced  the  creation  of  a new  entity, THE  FUTURE  IS  NEUTRAL , a  specialist  in closed-loop  recycling  that  is  reliant  on  the  Refactory. It  aims  to  help  the  entire  automotive  industry  move towards resource neutrality by increasing the proportion of recycled materials in the production of new vehicles;\n- \u25cf in  April  2021,  Renault  Group  joined  forces  with  Atos, Dassault  Syst\u00e8mes,  STMicroelectronics  and  Thales  to create  ' Software  R\u00e9publique ':  a  new  open  ecosystem for  intelligent  and  sustainable  mobility.  Its  aim  is  to jointly  develop  and  market  intelligent  mobility  systems, enabling  an  adapted  and  agile  mobility  offer.  In  2022, Software R\u00e9publique launched  an  incubator  and developed  projects  in  the  fields  of  cybersecurity,  data management  for  the  regions,  smart  charging  stations, and training.\n\n## Risk of inadequate performance by the Alliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault Group's  membership  in  the  Renault-NissanMitsubishi  Alliance  makes  a  major  contribution  to  the success of the Group and its strategic plan. In the market context of the health crisis and difficulties in the supply of semiconductors and in the deteriorated financial performance of its members, the Alliance companies have focused their strategy on efficiency and unit profitability of vehicles rather than on volumes. This situation could lead to a risk of underperformance due to a lack of prioritization of\n\nplatforms,  technologies  and,  more  generally,  of  the investments needed to develop product ranges, threatening  the  future  competitiveness  of  the  Group's offer, its revenues and its targeted profits. This risk can also be assessed in reputational terms: insufficient cooperation between the Alliance partners, given the market's potential and expectations, could result in a loss of confidence and a reduced  attractiveness  of  the  Group  to  some  of  its stakeholders, and negatively impact its development. The transition to the end of diesel and the product cycle could also lead to a decline in business volume between Nissan and Renault. Finally, Nissan's financial situation could limit the distribution of dividends to the Group for this year.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Alliance Operating Board (AOB), created on 12 March 2019, is responsible for operational coordination between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corporate and for new  initiatives creating value for their respective shareholders  and  employees.  On  May  27,  2020,  the Alliance announced the new 'leader/follower' cooperation  business  model  in  order  to  improve  the competitiveness  and  profitability  of  its  three  member companies. Alliance members ensure they are always at the forefront of the industry in terms of their performance, products,  technologies  and  markets,  while  continuing  to benefit  from  joint  purchasing  and  development.  In  mid2021, three 'Alliance Strategy Days' were organized within the  framework  of  the  AOB  meetings  to  take  stock  of ongoing projects, propose new opportunities and ensure the development of synergies.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the members of the Alliance announced their actions and projects to build their joint future by 2030, with a focus on the new mobility value chain.\n\nBy 2022, as an illustration of this joint work, Megane E-Tech was launched on the common CMF-EV platform also used by  Nissan  Ariya.  Megane  E-Tech  also  inaugurated  GAS (Google  Automotive  Services),  based  on  a  common electronic  architecture,  a  world  first  for  a  generalist carmaker, which will be extended more widely across all ranges  in  the  years  to  come.

Various components of  these  supply  chains  may  fail,  despite  the  existing control system, the characteristics of which are described below. These failures could lead to technical, planning or economic inefficiencies, or even interruptions in production,  transport  and/or  delivery  of  vehicles  to distribution  networks  and  end  customers,  with  negative consequences  for  sales,  revenues,  profits  and  customer satisfaction.  These  potential  failures  may  be  either internal -due in particular to the underlying interdependence  of  the  Group's  industrial  network  (see chapter 1.1.2 \"Strategy\" or 1.2.1.2 \"The business-to-business Powertrain  activity\"  of  this  document)  -  or  external,  as illustrated by the Covid-19 health crisis or the semiconductor  supply  crisis,  and  can  be  analyzed according to the following typology:\n\n- \u25cf supplier failure;\n- \u25cf disruption in supply or transport systems;\n- \u25cf disruption in supply of raw materials.\n\n## Supplier failure\n\nRenault  Group  relies  on  a  Tier  1  strategic  supplier  base comprising more than 800 parts supplier groups and more than  400  service  providers,  with  which  it  maintains significant  business  relationships.  These  suppliers  may present risks of disruption in the design and production of compliant  quality  parts,  in  meeting  delivery  deadlines,  in providing  the  necessary  production  capacity  and  in  the financial,  strategic,  industrial,  social  and  management, supply  chain,  sustainable  development  and  compliance fields.\n\nDue  to  the  semiconductor  crisis,  which  lasted  longer  than expected,  sharp  rise  in  the  energy  and  raw-material  costs, and the accelerating decline in internal-combustion engines, 2021 and 2022 saw a further weakening of the supplier base in  all  countries  where  Renault  Group  sources  its  supplies. These factors have contributed to the significant increase in the  number  of  suppliers  that  are  at  risk.  This  proportion, usually between 5% and 10%, was in the range of 20% to 25% at the end of 2022, with a significant proportion of suppliers potentially  defaulting  within  one  year  despite  a  vigorous remediation program put in place by Renault Group in 2022.\n\nThe elements of structural fragility of the supplier fabric already mentioned, accompanied by unfavorable economic  factors,  in  particular  the  rise  in  interest  rates, the  increased  volatility  of  exchange  rates  and  the increase  in  the  levels  of  public  and  private  debt,  lead  to think  that  the  number  of  business  failures  will  increase in 2023.\n\nIn addition, announcements  related  to  the  energy transition,  including  a  complete  halt  to  the  release  of internal  combustion  engine  vehicles  on  the  market  within the  European  Union  in  2035,  have  led  to  anticipatory behavior on the part of suppliers and their customers. This behavior  could  result  in  a  reduction  in  the  number  of suppliers  as  well  as  a  necessary  restructuring  of  those whose  trades  will  be  impacted  (especially  in  foundry, forging,  machining,  etc.).  It  is  therefore  the  entire  supplier base that must be considered carefully over the next years.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  Group  applies  a  comprehensive  risk  management system based on various measures:\n\n- \u25cf a prevention policy designed to make suppliers accountable  for  their  own  risks  and  in  particular  the compliance and robustness of their own supply chain;\n- \u25cf use  of  Alliance  standards  for  products  in  development by suppliers;\n- \u25cf an Alliance capacity reference system process aimed at controlling,  within  a  two-year  time  frame,  supply  risks not  covered  by  the  existence  of  available  industrial capacities;\n- \u25cf an  Alliance  process  for  detecting  non-compliance (quality, traceability) of parts delivered;\n- \u25cf monitoring  of  intrinsic  supplier  risks:  annual  multicriterion  ratings,  financial  and  default  risks  (Alliance grid);\n- \u25cf monitoring  of  the  risks  created  by  the  relationship between  Renault  Group  (or  other  customers)  and  its suppliers by analyzing indicators such as (i) the proportion represented  by  Renault  Group  or  the  main  customer  in revenues, (ii) the market share of the supplier in the Group's panel,  and  (iii)  the  range's  exposure  to  individual  failure. Vigilance is especially reinforced insofar as Renault Group does not have a systematic policy of multi-sourcing;\n- \u25cf implementation of action plans on the detection of noncompliance or supplier risk.\n\nThis  supplier  risk  prevention  and  management  system was strengthened in 2022 with, in particular:\n\n- \u25cf the  extension  of  the  visibility  given  to  suppliers  on  the order book to achieve twelve-month visibility;\n- \u25cf the development of risk control processes based on the good  practices  implemented  to  manage  the  Covid-19 and semiconductor crises, with, in particular, the start of a POC on the sharing of forecasts, and research to gain a better understanding of the supply chains (rank n);\n- \u25cf the  implementation  of  risk  control  measures  with  a greater degree of anticipation than in previous processes, which can be up to two years of anticipation;\n- \u25cf consideration of supplier risk on comprehensive parameters  from  the  outset  of  processing,  including industrial, engineering, financial, human, etc. aspects;\n- \u25cf the  launch  of  a  cyber-certification  project  for  suppliers (TISAX standard).",

Renault,  Nissan and  Mitsubishi  thus  have  a  business  continuity  plan program.\n\nIn addition, Renault Group has created, in association with The Adecco Group, the 1901 Auto ADE-RE association, the purpose  of  which  is  to  diagnose  needs  and  support suppliers and their employees in retraining operations in order  to  anticipate  and  best  manage  the  impact  of decisions related to the shutdown of internal combustion vehicles in 2035 in Europe.\n\n## Disruption of supply or transport systems\n\nThe  risks identified relate to planning, production, transport  or  delivery  interruptions  of  parts,  upstream  of vehicle production sites, or vehicles, downstream of these sites,  which  could  impact  sales,  revenues,  profits  of  the Group or customer satisfaction. Among these risks, we are seeing a steady increase in cybersecurity risk among our logistics suppliers.\n\nAmong  these  risks,  we  are  seeing  a  steady  increase  in cybersecurity  risk  among  our  logistics  suppliers.  In  2022, we also saw an increase in transport risks (capacity and cost)  due  to  the  shortage  of  drivers,  the  impact  of  new regulations  and  the  energy  crisis,  connected  to  the geopolitical context.\n\nThese risks, which are assessed in the dual context of the interdependence  of  the  Group's  industrial  network extended  to  its  global  suppliers  and  the  footprint  of  the distribution  network  (in  particular,  see  chapter  1.1.5.4  of this document), are subject to a comprehensive prevention  and  protection  system  whose  robustness  is constantly being strengthened.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  Covid-19  and  electronic-component  crises  have demonstrated the ability of the supply chain to operate in a  short  loop  to  be  more  responsive  to  fluctuations  in  the environment.  The  \"commercial  demand  vs  industrial response\"  balancing  process  was  able  to  operate effectively  on  a  weekly  basis  instead  of  monthly.  This experience has made  it possible to validate the effectiveness  of  our  digital  tools,  to  improve  their  scope and to build new  ones. The supply chain crisis management  system,  deployed  for  many  years,  is  the central  tool  for  responding  to  occasional  crises  and hazards  (border  blockages,  blockage  of  the  Suez  Canal, meteorological  crises,  shortage  of  means  of  transport, cybersecurity  \u2026).  The  supply  chain  has  also  actively contributed to multi-business groups for risk assessment and resolution during crises related to electronic components, plastics, steel, etc.\n\nIn this context, the supply chain has developed a \"Control Tower\" program, which is now in the operational start-up phase  for  upstream  logistics.  Through  the  roll-out  of digital processes and with an end-to-end vision, it aims to manage risks at the appropriate levels of the organizations and to apply consistent methods between the  Group's  various  regions  and  business  lines.  The program, which covers the risks of supplier failures as well as the risks of the supply and transport system, aims to:\n\n- \u25cf detect  demand  through  an  integrated  sales  and operational  planning  process  and  measure  the  impact of supplier disruption on vehicle diversity;\n- \u25cf manage supply capacity and supplier failures ;\n- \u25cf manage  the  logistics capacities of transporters, warehouses  and  fleets  :  deployment  of  the  parts  flow traceability project;\n- \u25cf anticipate risks and manage them operationally.\n\nA  cybersecurity  audit  of  supply  systems  carried  out  in 2022 made it possible to strengthen the system.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Renault Group\n\nRisk and control\n\n## Disruption in supply of raw materials\n\nThe risks identified relate to potential supply restrictions (imbalance  between  supply  and  demand,  sourcing difficulties,  geopolitical  disturbances  in  particular),  raw material prices, the variations of which may be significant and sudden, as well as non-compliance with ESG criteria (Environment, Social, Governance). Raw materials represent around a third of the total value of the Group's purchases. Three-quarters of raw material purchases are considered  strategic  because  they  are  likely  to  have  a significant  impact  on  production  conditions  or  present significant imbalances between supply and demand.\n\nIn  2022,  the  sharp  rise  in  energy  costs  disrupted  the production of certain energy-intensive raw materials and created  strong  tensions  on  supplies  in  a  context  of demand made very volatile by the semiconductor crisis. The  geopolitical  context  and  the  regionalization  of markets  has  also  disrupted  existing  supply/demand balances,  as  has  the  gradual  transition  to  carbon-free materials.\n\n## Risk management\n\nAgainst a backdrop of highly volatile raw material prices and  changes  in  energy  mixes  (petrol,  diesel,  electrified vehicles), Renault Group is supplementing its purchasing, technical,  monitoring  and  hedging  policies  in  order  to identify and limit supply and cost overrun risks.\n\nFor  purchasing  policies,  Renault  Group  continues  to develop multi-sourcing for materials such as steel or cast aluminum so as to optimize costs while securing supplies. The  Group  is  also  reinforcing  the  control  of  materials contained  in  parts  and  components  through  a  panel  of approved  materials  and  the  performance  of  detailed analysis of material prices in the costing of parts.\n\nIn terms of technical policies, the Group is actively working to  reduce  the  use  of,  or  to  substitute,  sensitive  materials (e.g.  palladium,  rhodium  and  rare  earths).  It  continues  to also  develop  the  use  of  recycled  materials  (precious metals  in  particular)  and  the  recycling  of  end-of-life vehicles. The launch of the Refactory in Flins in 2020 and the creation in October 2022 of \"THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL\", the  new  entity  dedicated  to  the  circular  economy,  are further steps in this direction.\n\nWith regard to strategic materials for batteries, the Group wants to secure the supply of responsible materials and share  control  of  the  value  chain  with  the  players  in  the chain. As a result, agreements for the supply of lithium or low-carbon  nickel  were  signed  in  2021  and  2022,  and Renault Group plans to extend this type of agreement to materials other than those specific to batteries.\n\nIn  a  forward-looking  approach,  the  Group  reassesses  its forecasts on a bi-monthly basis for the main indexed and non-indexed items. At the same time, it ensures ongoing monitoring of critical materials markets and suppliers.\n\nFinally,  to  reduce  risks  and  limit  exposure  to  market fluctuations, Renault Group  negotiates  annual  raw materials supply contracts whenever  possible  and appropriate. A systematic hedging policy has been put in place for the main indexed commodities.\n\n## Risks related to geopolitical instability and economic conditions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault Group has industrial and commercial operations in a large number of countries (see chapters 1.1.5 and 1.2.1.4 of this  document).  Some  of  these  countries  may  present specific  risks  that  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the Group's  industrial  and  commercial  operations,  sales, revenues,  income  statement  or  balance  sheet,  despite  a geographical spread of sales that limits the overall impact of  regional  contingencies  while  taking  advantage  of opportunities. These risks and opportunities may relate to the  changing  economic  related  situations,  political  or regulatory instability, social unrest, protectionism, nationalizations,  fluctuating  interest  rates  and  exchange rates, lack of foreign currency liquidity or foreign exchange control measures.\n\nSince  2021,  automotive  markets  were  impacted  by disruptions  in  the  supply  of  electronic  components  and raw  materials  as  well  as  insufficient  maritime  transport from plants.\n\nThis  components  crisis  continued  into  2022,  and  was accompanied by an energy and raw materials crisis linked to the war in Ukraine, leading to the return or acceleration of  inflation  in  most  countries  and  increased  volatility  of interest rates and exchange rates.\n\nAll  of  these elements contributed to weaken the sector's economic situation.  These  disruptions  were  experienced in all markets by most automotive industry actors.\n\n## Specific risks\n\nThe  Group's  activities  remain  heavily  dependent  on  the European  market,  which  in  2022  represents  two-third (64%)  of  the  Group's  sales  (see  the  Group's  worldwide sales in chapter 1.2.1.1 of this document and the breakdown of sales by country).\n\nOutside  Europe,  the  countries  or  areas  that  expose  the Group  most  by  their  weight  in  sales  and/or  total production are Russia, Morocco, Turkey and the Americas. The  respective  weights  in  the  Group's  vehicle  sales  and production  are  as  follows  for  each  of  these  countries  or areas  (see  chapters  1.2.1.1  and  1.2.1.3  of  this  document  for sales and production figures for 2021): Morocco (3%, 15%), Turkey (7%, 11%) and the Americas (14%, 13%). Despite their limited weight in the Group's vehicle sales and production, China and the Asia-Pacific region occupy a crucial place in the battery and electric-vehicle value chain.",

As a result,  the  market  is  highly  volatile,  leading  the  Group  to implement  a  risk  management  policy,  currently  under development, aimed at combining the short-term adaptability of its production system and the preparation of alternative solutions for the main logistics flows. Major political  events  in  2023  (presidential  and  parliamentary elections  in  June,  centenary  of  the  Republic  of  Turkey  in October) will receive special attention.\n\nIn  Morocco , the  exposure  to  risk  of  non-transfer  on imports is limited by the exported production. The  potential  impact  of  regional  tensions  remains  to  be monitored.\n\nLatin  America is gradually  returning  to  pre-COVID-19 levels of GDP and employment, although the repercussions of the health crisis and the war in Ukraine are  expected  to  have  lasting  consequences  for  the economies  of  the  region  (inflation  record  of  94.8%  in Argentina for the year 2022).\n\nIn  a  context  marked  by  recent  electoral  alternations (Brazil, Colombia) , the strong political polarization in most Latin American countries remains a source of tension and instability. Latin America is also exposed to a wide range of  natural  hazards  and  is  expected  to  be  one  of  the regions  in  the  world  where  the  effects  and  impacts  of climate  change,  such  as  extreme  weather  events,  fires and droughts, and the fall in agricultural yields will be the most intense.\n\nIn Asia, strategic competition between the US and China intensified  in  2022,  and  is  expected  to  continue  over  the long  term.  In  addition  to  technological  and  commercial rivalry,  geopolitical  tension  between  the  two  countries  is centred  around  Taiwan.  Battery  and  electric-vehicle supply  chains  -  of  all manufacturers  -  would  be particularly exposed in the event of a conflict in the AsiaPacific region.\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn terms of industrial location, Renault Group's geographical  choices  are  made  taking  into  account  the risks of instability built into a global industrial approach in order to ensure risk diversification. Manufacturing investments  represent  a  major  part  of  the  Group's exposure  to  political  risks.  Country  risk  related  to manufacturing and financial investment is in principle not hedged, but the risk of non-achievement of objectives is included in the expected profitability calculation. From an operational standpoint, the Group continuously increases the level of local integration in order to reduce the impact of  political  and  foreign  exchange  risks  and  make  its products more competitive.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  hedges  against  the  risk  of  nonpayment  for  most  payments  originating  from  high-risk countries.  The  main  exceptions  relate  to  intra-Group sales,  sales  to  industrial  partners  and  to  countries  for which there is no possible hedging. Residual country risk is regularly monitored.\n\nIn order to centrally manage the risk of non-payment and put in place hedges on competitive terms, the Group has designed a 'hub and spoke' invoicing system. Manufacturing subsidiaries sell their exported production to Renault  S.A.S.,  which  sells  it  on  to  commercial subsidiaries  and  independent  importers,  granting  them supplier  credit.  The  associated  risk  is  managed  by  the parent company. Some sales between countries covered by customs agreements do not use this system, however.\n\nIn  the  light  of  the  economic  situation  resulting  from  the Covid-19  pandemic  and  the  geopolitical  context  and inflationary  shocks,  in  2022  the  Renault  Group  continued to  manage  the  reactions  to  be  implemented  within  the company, with  suppliers  upstream  and  the  network  and customers downstream, in a coordinated manner and as close  to  the  ground  as  possible,  using  a  multi-business approach.  In  addition,  in  2021  and  2022,  Renault  Group continued to reduce fixed costs and restructure industrial capacity  to  lower  the  company's  breakeven  point, eliminating unprofitable sales and working on net pricing to offset most  of  the  exogenous  impacts.  These developments have been an essential asset in managing market  and  production  changes  linked  to  supply disruptions  and  will  be  capitalized  on  for  the  future.  In addition, the global inflationary context is well integrated into  the  Group's  budgetary  assumptions  and  market forecasts,  including  in  the  form  of  a  more  or  less deteriorated scenario. This flexibility, which is as close as possible  to  market  trends,  is  at  the  heart  of  the  Renault Group's  efforts  to  protect  employees,  optimize  financial performance and seize every possible opportunity.\n\nAs  from  February  2022,  the  conflict  in  Ukraine  and  its consequences for the Group's activity have been continuously  monitored  with  all  the  teams  concerned, primarily  to  ensure  the  physical  integrity  and  safety  of employees. As soon as they were published, Renault Group analysed the consequences of the economic and financial sanctions  and  counter-sanctions  that  were  progressively decided; the Group ensures that they are strictly respected in  the  context  of  its  activities.  On  16  May  2022,  Renault Group's  Board  of  Directors  unanimously  approved  the signing  of  agreements  to  sell  100%  of  Renault  Group's shares  in  Renault  Russia  to  the  city  of  Moscow  and  its 67.69% stake in Avtovaz to NAMI (the Central research and development automobile and engine institute).\n\nI",

In  this  situation,  the  Renaulution strategic plan entails a transformation that will lead to changes in the organization and new business models, in  particular  through  the  creation  of  new  entities  and partnerships. Energy transition issues and aggravating external  factors  such  as  the  shortage  of  electronic components  and  rising  prices  of  raw  materials  could lead  the  Group  to  take  measures  relating  to  the employment  conditions  of  its  people.  In  addition,  an increase  in  inflation  in  countries  where  Renault  Group has  significant  operations  could  lead  to  pressure  on costs at the local level.\n\nIn  this  environment,  the  Group  runs  the  risk  of  being confronted with social movements in the countries where it operates, which could disrupt its activities.\n\n## Management system\n\nBuilding on its global framework agreements of 2013 and 2019, Renault Group has a dynamic of social dialogue both at the global level through its Group Works Council and at the  local  level  with  employee  representative  bodies. Renault  Group  is  committed  to  dealing  with  these changes  and  the  associated  risks  through  regular, qualitative  social  dialogue,  allowing  global  and/or  local agreements to be reached and to change these bodies if necessary\n\n## Risk of natural, health or industrial disasters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe group's operating sites, whether manufacturing sites, engineering and testing centers, logistics platforms or even commercial  sites  are  exposed  to  the  risk  of  industrial accidents,  fires,  explosions  and  machine  breakdowns.  In addition, some facilities (see in particular chapter 1.2.1.3. of this  document  presenting  the  main  industrial  sites)  are subject  to  the  risk  of  natural  disasters:  earthquakes (particularly  in  Chile,  Turkey,  Romania,  Colombia,  Slovenia and Morocco), as well as floods or submersions (particularly in France and Korea). With the latter risks being increased by the higher frequency of external climate events related to global warming.\n\nThe occurrence of any of these risks, despite the prevention and resilience policies presented below, could harm people,\n\nthe  environment  or  the  sites  concerned  and  lead  to significant disruptions in the ability to operate affected sites -  potentially  damaging  the  Group's  assets  and/or  overall performance (sales, revenues, income statement or balance sheet), particularly through industrial interdependencies.\n\nA global pandemic, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, can  result  in  significant  and  shifting  health  threats  in countries  where  the  group  operates.  Such  situations  may be accompanied by measures imposing restrictions on the free  movement  of  people  and  goods,  disrupting  the opening  of  sales  or  after-sales  outlets  in  distribution networks  and  the  smooth  running  of  industrial  sites. The main impacts of such situations would be on the health and availability of the Group's personnel and its suppliers, as  well  as  on  financial  performance  (revenues,  cash  flow and  cash)  and,  potentially,  the  value  of  certain  balance sheet assets. In addition to the direct impact on people and business,  the  pandemic  has  collateral  effects  on  the organization of logistics flows and supplies worldwide.\n\n## Risk management\n\nOver the past 30 years, Renault Group has been committed to implementing and developing an ambitious and rigorous prevention  policy  (safety  of  people,  property  and  business continuity). More  than  94%  of  the  assets  (industry, engineering and logistics) covered by the 'property damage and business interruption' insurance program were awarded  the  international  'Highly  Protected  Risk  (HPR)' label  in  2021,  which  reflects  a  level  of  prevention  and protection approved by insurance companies.\n\nIn addition, the Group as a whole is working to increase its resilience to natural disasters. In particular, the treatment of seismic risk at the most at-risk sites has been completed in Chile and Turkey, and is being pursued in Romania under a  specific  multi-year  plan:  reinforcement  of  buildings  and facilities, staff training, specific communications resources, crisis management systems, business continuity and an appropriate insurance program.\n\nWith regard to the health crisis, Renault Group has put in place  permanent  measures  to  protect  the  health  of  its employees,  in  conjunction  with  the  public  authorities,  to preserve its assets and its ability to operate and to adapt to changing situations in the various countries. An ongoing monitoring system makes it possible to track the  evolution  of  the  situation  and  to  mobilize  the  crisis mechanism if  necessary.  The  provisions  mainly  concern specific work organization, management  of  work interruptions and resumptions in line with local measures and commercial demand.",

In particular,  the  choice  of  hybridization  technology, which is particularly sensitive to costs and also offers differentiated  customer  and  CO2  performance,  could turn out to be imperfectly adapted  or  paced, depending  on  the  products  and  markets,  thus potentially going against the overall technological and financial  optimization  defined  by  the  group  for  its CAFE trajectory;\n- \u25cf preserving the profitability of Renault Group's investments in the context in which the group intends to\n\nmaintain its R&D investments within a range of 8% to 9% of revenues  between  2021  and  2025;  this  being compared to approximately 10% of revenues in previous years. This necessity could increase the risk weighing on the choices made about innovations and the chances of seeing  those  innovations  match  real  expectations  of customers and therefore generate returns on investment.\n\nShould  the  reference  assumptions  used  in  the  Group's product  development  decisions  be  strongly  called  into question, the Group may have to recognize impairment on fixed  assets  (investment  and  capitalized  development expenses, depreciated over the life of the vehicle) or book a  provision  to  cover  the  contractual  indemnities  to  be paid, if any, due to the failure to meet a minimum purchase volume.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe definition of the group's future products is based on customer studies and analyses of automotive competitors, so that market expectations and developments and industry trends can be identified. It is also increasingly informed, on a global scale, by anticipatory  technology  watch  by  all  of  the  group's development  stakeholders,  of  the  automotive  industry and  beyond.  The  development  of  new  models  or components is decided on the basis of this work and an evaluation of the anticipated profitability, calculated over the projected life cycle.\n\nRenault  Group  has  redefined  its  entire  product  and technology  development  portfolio  from  July  2020  under the leadership of its new CEO. A new brand organization has been set up in early 2021 to ensure that it is as close as possible to  consumer expectations. Brand markers have been defined to ensure that product and service content is  consistent  with  the  relative  positioning  of  each  brand. These  brands  are  able  to  make  the  most  appropriate choices  and  trade-offs  in  order  to  strengthen  their specific  identities,  and  can  draw  on  the  expertise  of  the core  businesses  and  on  the  bodies  and  technologies developed at Alliance level or with partners (e.g. Google, see below).\n\nThe  group  can  thus  develop  products  that  will  offer  all types  of  engines  (petrol,  diesel,  electric  and  electrified, LPG, hydrogen), increased connectivity for its vehicles and the driving aids expected by its customers. For example:\n\n- \u25cf at  the  end  of  2020,  the  company  launched  a  major innovation on the hybridization market  with  the E-Tech  hybrid  and  plug-in  hybrid  engines,  which,  in addition to the electric range, make it possible to meet CAFE regulatory requirements;\n- \u25cf Megane E-Tech, launched in 2022, is the first consumer vehicle to integrate the Google automotive platform;\n- \u25cf in  the  key  area  of  battery  technologies,  the  roadmap presented during the 'Renault E-Ways' event on 30 June 2021 highlighted the desire to locate battery sourcing as close  as  possible  to  plants,  the  choice  of  a  dual  offer\n\nI",

The upstream phases are thus now more robust  due  to  their  level  of  detail,  their  360\u00b0  business vision  and  a  handover  from  the  'Concept  Freeze' milestone to the company's brands and downstream.\n\n## Risk of product or service quality defects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  quality  of  Renault  Group's  products  and  services could be considered insufficiently competitive by potential customers in the face of the competition, which would adversely affect the satisfaction of its customers or partners,  and  negatively  affect  its  sales,  revenues,  costs or reputation.\n\nThis  risk  is  specifically  considered  within  the  stringent environment  of  major  changes  in  the  automotive technologies  implemented  by  the  group  as  part  of  its strategic  plan  (for  current  models,  see  chapter  1.1.5.1., 'Automotive:  brands  and  ranges'  or  1.3.3  'Innovations  in new vehicle and service projects in 2021 for developments'  of  this  Document  as  well  as  the  chapter 1.3.1 mentionning 'Technologies of tomorrow').\n\n## Risk management\n\nControl of this risk has been  reinforced by the implementation  of  a  specific  Quality  plan.  It  relies  in particular  on  quality  assurance  systems  implemented within  the  Group's  operating  activities  as  well  as  on functional safety organization and activities and general product safety, aiming to protect against the risks related to  the  physical  integrity  of  people  involved  in  road  use, starting  with  the  users  of  the  Group's  products  and services.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  set  up  a  market  monitoring  system that  allows  it  to  become  aware  of  sources  of  customer dissatisfaction very quickly and to act accordingly. This is done,  in  particular,  through  a  process  for  correcting quality  issues,  which  has  been  strengthened,  including  a recall process for, as a matter of priority, those problems that  could  have  regulatory  or  potentially  safety-related consequences.",

Developments in the group's strategy and its new challenges (cloud strategy, digitization, Industry 4.0, development  of  connected  services  or strengthening of the cybersecurity regulatory environment in particular) are tending to increase its exposure to threats and making cybersecurity a major challenge.\n\nThe  main  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  the  Group's activities are related to:\n\n- \u25cf cybercrime:  global  computerized  attacks  or  attacks targeting the Group's interests or, as a side effect, national interests.  These  attacks,  in  a  context  of  strong  growth, may  aim  to  access  sensitive  data  (strategic,  product, service  or  personal  data),  to  steal  or  alter  them,  to  block services or even all of the Group's information systems;\n- \u25cf incidents  that  could  affect  the  continuity  of  services hosted in  our  infrastructures  and  those  of  our  partners and suppliers;\n- \u25cf non-compliance with IT standards or practices required by  legislation,  external  authorities  or  contracts  with suppliers or the state of the art.\n\nThe materialization of these risks, despite the continuous strengthening  of  systems  aimed  at  controlling  them, could  have  major  financial  impacts  related  to  the temporary  suspension  of  the  Group's  activities  -  of  all types - (revenues, earnings), to penalties or to increased insurance premiums. There could also be adverse impacts on the Group's image and the confidence of third parties and customers in the Group and its brands.\n\nIn addition,  Renault  Group's  increased  marketing  of connected  vehicles  and  services  (in  particular,  see chapters 1.3.1 and 1.3.2) is accompanied by the emergence of  risks  of  a  comparable  nature,  for  which  insufficiently robust  and  sustainable  management  could  lead  to adverse  impacts  on  safety  and  the  reliability  of  data, services or vehicles.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe general control of these risks is currently provided at the operational level via:\n\n- \u25cf the  deployment  of  security  policies  (e.g.  controlling information, information system security, vehicle cybersecurity  management  system,  IT  charter  and  IT code  of  conduct)  and  the  continuous  enhancement  of the process of defining security requirements according to  the  level  of  criticality  of  the  applications  and  data handled;\n- \u25cf the translation of policies into operational procedures;\n- \u25cf the  deployment  of  an  evolving  action  plan  based  on  a security  Master  plan  and  annual  risk  mapping.  The\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nRisk and control\n\nsecurity  Master  plan  is  updated  and  presented  on  a regular basis to the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR).\n\nAt the organizational and governance level, it is provided in particular by:\n\n- \u25cf global cybersecurity organization across the company;\n- \u25cf the Risk and Internal Control Committee;\n- \u25cf governance committees monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness  of  information  security  processes  and measures.\n\nIn view  of  the  Group's  key  strategic  priorities,  its digitalization  and  the  evolution  of  threats,  the  major actions  to  optimize  risk  management  are  currently focused on the following areas:\n\n- \u25cf monitoring  by  reviewing  performance  indicators  (e.g. average resolution time for major and critical incidents, Bitsight rating and indicators regarding key obligations under the GDPR);\n- \u25cf a  major  program  to  strengthen  security  at  the  Group's various plants;\n- \u25cf development  of  vehicle  cybersecurity  and  associated services in connection with the need to comply with the new  regulations  (UNECE  R155  &  R156)  on  vehicle cybersecurity.  In  early  2022,  Renault  Group  obtained official certification from UTAC for the management of its cybersecurity (CSMS);\n- \u25cf enhanced  supervision  (Security  Operations  Centre  SOC) of systems in all the Group's domains (in particular IS/IT,  vehicles,  connected  services,  cloud  infrastructure and plants);\n- \u25cf strengthening of awareness, training and skills regarding cybersecurity;\n- \u25cf strengthening of the protection of the Group's systems/ infrastructures (including those that use cloud hosting);\n- \u25cf participation  in  international  and  national  ecosystem interest  groups  (e.g.  PFA,  Cyber  Campus,  ACEA).  PFA, Cyber Campus, ACE).\n\n## Risk of ineffective digital transformation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2016,  the  Group  initiated  a  digital  transformation  that, led  by  the  IT  function,  aims  to  allow  all  the  Functions  to improve their productivity, reduce their costs and create new  sources  of  value.  This  transformation  involves  both organizational  and  technical  changes,  including  poor governance  that  could  lead  to  a  loss  of  efficiency  and competitiveness of the Group.\n\n## Management system\n\nSince  2016,  digital  transformation  has  been  governed  by each  function  and  the  Renault  Digital  subsidiary  is accelerating  this  transformation.  In  2022,  the  Group specified its five-year, medium-term digital plan. A total of eight  business  areas  have  been  defined  as  new  value\n\nI",

Governance  of  the  digital  project  portfolio  is  in place  in  the  form  of  a  Control  Tower  in  the  functions. For each of the projects, a joint business/IT steering team has  been  created  with  the  aim  of  meeting  the  digital challenges that will enable the expected business results to  be  achieved,  with  particular  attention  given  to  the resources required and to the correct architecture of the data and digital solutions. Such governance is associated with the steering of projects and the value they generate at Board of Management level. The IT director is a member of  the  Group's  Board  of  Management,  which  enables steering to take place at the highest level.\n\n## Risk of a lack of resources and talent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  light  of  the  digital  revolution,  rapid  technological breakthroughs  and  new  needs  in  terms  of  mobility services, the Group's aim is to turn itself into a competitive technology  and  services  company.  As  a  result,  its  skills requirements  are  evolving  at  all  qualification  levels,  and the Group must ensure that it has the best professionals in its  class.  The  company  must  meet  the  challenge  of attracting,  retaining  and  developing  talent.  Thus,  in  a highly  competitive  labour  market,  which  is  no  longer limited to the automotive sector, the risk for the company is  that  it  will  not  be  able  to  attract  or  retain  the  talent needed  to  fulfil its strategic ambitions  or  for  its transformation.\n\n## Management system\n\nTo constantly adapt  to  transformed  roles  in  the automotive sector and to shape future mobility, the Group has  introduced  a  HR  policy  to  make  it  fast-moving, innovative,  effective  and  eager  to  learn,  and  to  support the commitment and motivation of its employees on the basis of the following actions:\n\n- \u25cf recruitment  of  staff  with  a  very  wide  range  of  profiles and  expertise  in  all  the  countries  in  which  the  Group operates;\n- \u25cf promotion  of  diversity  and  inclusion,  in  particular  by strengthening the Group's ambition to be a leader in the automotive sector, and by boosting the growing share of women in management positions;\n- \u25cf employee development and training through an adapted,  personalised  and  modernised  training  offer, supported by an extended community (ReKnow University, Learning & Development);\n- \u25cf a  competitive  compensation  policy,  combined  with enhanced performance monitoring and appraisal;\n- \u25cf a  solid,  international  and  cross-functional  approach  to identify, develop and retain talent.\n\n## Risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations, including corruption\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs  a  result  of  its  international  activities,  Renault  Group is  subject  to  increasingly  numerous,  complex  and  shifting laws and regulations, particularly in the areas of automotive manufacturing,  the  environment,  competition,  labor  law, new  technologies  and  cybersecurity  (in  particular,  see chapter 1.5 'Regulatory environment' of this document).\n\nThe group could therefore find itself exposed to a change in laws or regulations that were insufficiently anticipated or incorrectly taken  into account  by  the  existing management  system  described  below.  Moreover,  the authorities or courts may also change the application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations at any time.\n\nThese  differences  in  anticipation  or  failure  to  account  for such  changes  in  laws  or  regulations  could  result,  for  the group  and  its  senior  executives,  in  possible  criminal, administrative or financial penalties, that could also lead, for the  group,  to  a  change  in  its  capacity  to  carry  out  its operating activities, its revenues, its profits or its image.\n\n## Risk management\n\nConcerning  such  legal  and  regulatory  changes,  Renault Group  requires  its  subsidiaries  to  comply  with  the regulations  of  the  countries  in  which  the  company conducts  its business  and  takes  part  in  ongoing discussions  with  the  national  or  regional  authorities  in charge  of  the  specific  regulation  of  the  products  in  the automotive  sector,  in  order  to  anticipate  changes  and guarantee  compliance  of  the  Group  with  laws  and regulations.\n\nRenault  Group  also  uses  a  structured  approach  to  analyse and ensure the robustness of  its  regulatory  compliance  in  a sustainable  and  proactive  manner,  within  a  scope  of  major regulated domains including: \"competition\", \"anticorruption\", \"environment\",  \"health  safety -working environment\", \"technical regulations\" and \"data protection\".\n\nThis approach is managed by the Ethics and Compliance Department, working closely with the Legal Department, under  the  supervision  of  the  Ethics  and  Compliance Committee  (CEC). The maturity of the regulatory compliance systems is measured quarterly by an index, a summary of which is presented to the CEC.\n\n## Legal risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault Group is exposed to a legal risk, the assessment and potential  impacts  of  which  are  detailed  below.

In this case, these proceedings could also have an effect on the  group's  reputation  among  consumers  and  indirectly reduce the attractiveness of the vehicles that it markets.\n\n## Market monitoring\n\nLike  any  manufacturer,  Renault  Group  is  exposed  to  the risk of non-compliance of the products that it markets and their  withdrawal  from  the  market.  In  a  context  of particular sensitivity to ecological issues, case-law developments and the tightening of applicable regulations,  this  risk  appears  to  be  higher  for  internalcombustion engine vehicles marketed by the Group.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nRenault Group's industrial know-how, innovations resulting  from  research  and  the  products  marketed  are the  subject  of  patents,  trademarks,  designs  and  models filed to protect the group's intellectual property. As such, Renault  Group  files  a  significant  number  of  patents, trademarks,  designs  and  models  in  its  area  of  activity each  year  (see  chapter  1.3  of  this  document).  The  major risk facing Renault Group in terms of intellectual property is the risk of counterfeiting, whether  innocent  or deliberate.\n\nCounterfeiting may be committed by third parties against the  products,  industrial  processes,  brands,  designs  and models protected by Renault Group. From a technological standpoint,  given  Renault  Group's  reputation,  particularly in the field of hybrid and electric vehicles, the Group could become  a  prime  target  for  such  counterfeiting.  Renault Group's  E-Tech  technology  is  a  significant  example.  As regards  trademarks,  designs  and  models,  repercussions can be felt in particular in the replacement market. Renault\n\nGroup's existing reputation is a key factor in increasing the risk of counterfeiting.\n\nAny  such  actions  could  have  an  immediate  unfavorable impact  on  the  group's  revenues  and  earnings,  and  may harm the reputation and quality image of the technologies and products concerned. Patents, trademarks,  designs  and  models  registered  by  Renault Group in the Group's main automotive markets provide it with an effective weapon in the fight against counterfeiting. In addition, with regard to trademarks, the establishment of customs monitoring in various countries allows  the  reporting  of  dubious  products,  both  imports and exports.\n\nSo-called deliberate counterfeiting could be an involuntary act by Renault Group, given the risk associated with the period during which patent applications  are  not  made  public.  Patent  applications filed  by  third  parties  and  known  only  at  the  time  of publication could force Renault Group to modify a product under  development,  increasing  the  project's  Research and Development costs, or to negotiate rights to use the patented item. In either case, the project's margin would be affected. This risk is particularly present in the context of connectivity and standard essential patents.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  control  of  legal  risks  is  in  particular  based  on  an internal  control  system  organized  around  three  guiding principles:\n\n- \u25cf Management  of  the  group's  legal  function,  which  is organized  around  a  central  function  and  employees  in the group's main countries. These employees report on a hierarchical and/or functional basis;\n- \u25cf Employees  of  the  legal  function  are  proactive  in anticipating  legal  risks  upstream  and  adapting  the corresponding procedures (advisory consultations, information from the central legal function, etc.);\n- \u25cf Regulatory  monitoring  by  Renault  Group  in  collaboration with the different countries concerned.\n\nI",

This  risk  is related to the fluctuation of the various currencies against the  euro  and  mainly  impacts the  Group's  Automotive activity .\n\nThe Automotive segment is exposed to foreign exchange risk mainly in terms of its operating margin, and the Group may hedge some of its exposures from time to time. Based on the structure of its earnings and operating cash flows for 2022, a 1% rise in the euro against all currencies would have  an  unfavorable  impact  of  11  million  euros  on  the annual operating margin of the Automotive segment after hedging  (see  note  25-B2  to  the  consolidated  financial statements for details of the impact by currency).\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  the  Group,  its  share  in  the profit or loss of associates, its shareholders' equity and its net liquidity position may also be affected by fluctuations in  exchange  rates  against  the  euro.  In  particular,  the Group has a 43.4% interest in Nissan, and therefore holds net yen assets whose fluctuations impact the value of the shares  in  assets  and  the  Group's  translation  reserves  in liabilities. For fiscal year 2022, the impact of a 1% rise in the euro  against  the  yen  would  result  in  a  decrease  in Nissan's  contribution  to  Group  shareholders'  equity  of 167 million euros and to Group income from associates of 5 million euros  (see  notes  12-C  and  25-B2  to  the consolidated financial statements). In addition, the Group partially  hedges  the  foreign  exchange  risk  associated with  its  investment  in  Nissan  by  borrowing  in  yen,  which impacts  its  net  liquidity  position.  A  1%  rise  in  the  euro against  the  yen  would  increase  the  net  liquidity  position by 14 million euros.\n\nThe Sales Financing segment is exposed to a more limited extent  to  the  risk  of  exchange  rate  fluctuations,  which may nevertheless have a negative impact on its financial position.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  foreign  exchange  risk  management  policy  for  the Automotive  segment is  implemented  and  monitored  by the  Performance  and  Control  Department  and  the Financing and Treasury Department.\n\nAny hedging of foreign exchange risk on operating margins must  be  analyzed  in  advance  by  the  Performance  and Control  Department  and  the  Financing  and  Treasury Department,  and  then  formally  authorized  by  the  Finance Department  or  General  Management,  as  well  as  reported\n\nmonthly  to  the  Chief  Financial  Officer.  Where  possible, foreign exchange transactions are mainly carried out by the Group's  trading  room  (Renault  Finance)  for  currencies  that can be traded on international markets.\n\nIn  2022,  in  order  to  limit  the  exposure  of  its  operating margin to currency risk, the Automotive segment has set up  currency  hedges  on  the  Argentine  peso,  the  Chinese yuan and the Turkish lira.\n\nIn addition,  in  order  to  avoid  any  currency-related distortion of financial results, the currency risk associated with financing and investment flows in foreign currencies is  systematically  minimized.  Cash  surpluses  in  countries not  centralized  at  the  parent  company  are  generally invested  in  local  currency  under  the  supervision  of  the Financing and Treasury Department. Financing transactions are carried out in the local currency of each entity, or when they are carried out in foreign currencies, are hedged in the same currency under the control of the Financing and Treasury Department. Any residual exposures  (including  those  relating  to  Renault  Finance operations) are subject to a waiver and are reported to the Chief Financial Officer on a monthly basis.\n\nEquity investments (in currencies other than the euro) are generally not hedged, resulting in translation adjustments,  if  any,  which  are  recognized  in  Group shareholders'  equity.  However,  given  the  size  of  the investment  in  Nissan,  Renault's  share  of  Nissan's  net worth is partially hedged  (see  note  12-G to the consolidated  financial  statements).  In  2022,  the  Group amended its management policy whereby the hedging of its net investment in Nissan is limited to its best estimate of  the  next  three  years  of  yen  dividends  to  be  received from Nissan. The Group may now hedge a higher amount of its foreign exchange risk exposure on its share of equity in Nissan, subject to the yen share of Nissan's equity and its assessment of the liquidity risk on the yen.\n\nThe  management  of  foreign  exchange  risk  by  the  Sales Financing  segment distinguishes  between  transactional and  structural  foreign  exchange  risk.  With  regard  to transactional foreign exchange risk, most Sales financing subsidiaries  operate  in  a  single  currency  and  are therefore not exposed to foreign exchange risk. However, some  subsidiaries finance assets denominated  in different currencies. Their transactional foreign exchange position  is  subject  to  limits,  and  the  residual  exposure  is kept to a marginal level for RCI Banque. At December 31, 2022, the RCI Banque group's consolidated transactional foreign  exchange  position  (excluding  investments  in subsidiaries) amounted  to  1.2 billion euros. These investments  are  of  strategic  importance  to  RCI  Banque and  are  included  in  the  Group's  risk  management.  They generate  structural  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk, which is managed with two main objectives: a) to protect the Group's consolidated capital ratios from the impact of changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates;  b)  to  comply  with local  regulatory  requirements  in  terms  of  capital  ratios, with an appropriate cushion.

In the event of a prolonged market closure or tension in access to credit, the  Group  is  exposed  to  liquidity  risk.  If  the  Group  cannot access  new  sources  of  financing  or  if  its  financing  needs increase, insufficient liquidity would be particularly detrimental  to  its  competitiveness,  operating  results  and financial  position.  Liquidity  risk  is  the  risk  that  the automotive  and  sales  financing  segments  will  have reduced  liquidity  to  repay  debts  as  they  mature  or  to finance balance sheet growth. The Group's liquidity could be significantly affected by factors beyond its control, such as  general  market  disruptions,  market  perceptions  of increased liquidity risk, or speculative pressures in the debt market.\n\nThe  Automotive  and  Sales  Financing  segments  are  also subject  to  financial  ratings  from  several  agencies.  Any downgrading of these ratings could limit and/or increase access to capital markets for these sectors of the Group. Under current market conditions, a possible downgrading of the financial rating of Renault S.A. (automotive sector) by Moody's would lead to a downgrading of the rating of RCI Banque (sales financing sector).\n\nThe table of financial ratings for Renault SA is presented below (as of December 31, 2022).\n\n## Renault S.A. ratings\n\n| Agency   | Rating & Outlook       | Date of last review   |\n|----------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Moody's  | Ba2/NP/Stable outlook* | November 2022         |\n| S&P      | BB+/B/Stable outlook*  | February 2023         |\n| R&I      | A-/Negative outlook    | June 2022             |\n| JCR      | A-/Stable outlook      | November 2022         |\n\n* Change in outlook (from negative to stable).\n\nA detailed schedule of financial liabilities of the Automotive and Sales financing segments is presented in note 23-D to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor  further  details  on  liquidity  risk,  see  note  25-B1  to  the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risk management\n\nLiquidity risk management in the Automotive segment is conducted  by  the  Financing  and  Treasury  Department. This  management  is  based  on  an  internal  model,  which defines the level of liquidity reserve to be maintained by the  Automotive  segment  in  order  to  finance  its  activity and development. This level of liquidity reserve is closely monitored  on  a  monthly  basis  through  periodic  reviews and reporting to the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nIn  2022,  Renault  S.A.  maintained  its  access  to  capital markets  by  issuing  a  \"Samurai\"  bond.  This  bond  was issued  at  the  end  of  June  2022  for  a  nominal  amount  of 80.7 billion yen and a maturity of three years. Renault S.A. also  maintained  its  access  to  short-term  financing through its NEU CP program.\n\nIn  addition,  in  2022,  Renault  S.A.  prepaid  \u20ac1  billion  of  the 4  billion euros initially drawn down in 2020 under the bank credit  agreement  guaranteed  by  the  French  State.  As  a reminder,  this  credit  agreement  for  an  initial  amount  of 5  billion  euros  was  put  in  place  in  2020  to  finance  the liquidity  needs  generated  by  the  Covid-19  pandemic. The facility, which can be drawn down until December 31, 2020, was drawn down three times in the second half of 2020 for a total amount of 4 billion euros. At December 31, 2022, the outstanding  nominal  amount  under  this agreement was 1 billion euros.\n\nThe contractual documentation for Renault SA's financing, including bank financing and credit agreements, does not contain  any  clause  that  could  call  into  question  the maintenance  of  credit  due  to  changes  in  the  quality  of Renault  Group's  signature  or  compliance  with  financial ratios.\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  the  Automotive  segment  had  a liquidity reserve of 17.7 billion euros. This liquidity reserve is significantly  above  the  internal  target  and  enables  the Automotive segment to meet its 12-month commitments. It is  made  up  of  14.2  billion  euros  in  cash  and  cash equivalents, and 3.4 billion euros in confirmed bank credit agreements, which were not used at December 31, 2022.\n\nLiquidity  risk  management  for  the  Sales  Financing segment is based  on  several  indicators  or  analyses, updated monthly on the basis of the latest forecasts for outstandings and refinancing transactions. Conservative assumptions are made regarding deposit runoff. The  Group  has  limits  governing  its  liquidity  risk.  RCI Banque  must  at  all  times  have  sufficient  financial resources to ensure the continuity of its business and its development. At December 31, 2022, RCI Banque's liquidity reserve  (Europe)  stood  at  14  billion  euros.  The  liquidity reserve remains significantly above internal targets. It is made up of 4.4 billion  euros  of  undrawn  confirmed  bank lines, 4.6 billion euros of collateral eligible for Central Bank monetary  policy  operations,  5.8  billion  euros  of  highly liquid assets (HQLA) and 0.2 billion euros of available cash. These  assets  enable  RCI  Banque  to  maintain  the financing  granted  to  its  customers  for  further  12  months without access to external liquidity.\n\nFor  further  details  see  note  25-B1  to  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\nI",

Credit risk arises from the uncertainty that the customer (debtor) will be able to meet its obligations to repay the debt it has contracted with RCI Banque.\n\nCredit risk can be broken down into the risk of default, i.e. the probability that a client will  not  meet  its  obligations  to  pay, and  the  risk  of  loss  in  the  event  of  default,  i.e.  the  nonrepayment  of  the  debt  at  the  time  of  default.  The assessment of these two components of credit risk is linked to the socio-economic and financial elements of the debtor and to  the  macroeconomic and microeconomic context in which the debtor is found.\n\nHence, the level of credit risk is expressed in terms of the classification  of  loans  according  to  their  level  of  risk (classification into three stages in accordance with IFRS9 ) and  in  terms  of  the  level  of  impairment  applied  to  each risk class (stage). Impairment charges on loans and losses are  recognized  annually  and  presented  in  RCI  Banque's income  statement  under  the  \"cost  of  risk\"  accounting aggregate.  The  level  of  the  annual  cost  of  risk  thus expresses the marginal increase or decrease in credit risk on the customer loan portfolio.\n\nThe  cost  of  risk  on  the  Client  and  Network  activity (individual and corporate financing) is marked by a return to normal after a very low level observed in 2021 in a more favorable economic context. Credit quality at origination has been maintained (tightening of acceptance policies) as has collection performance.\n\n## Risk management\n\nRCI  Banque's  acceptance  system  is  based  on  statistical models for granting loans, acceptance rules designed to protect our customers against the risk of overindebtedness, the use of external databases to check the  overall  indebtedness  of  our  customers  (except  in France, where there is no \"positive\" file), and measures to combat fraud. In addition, for financing to the dealership network,  RCI  Banque  has  an  internal  methodology  for rating each counterparty on a risk scale.\n\nIn  addition,  all  acceptance  procedures  are  governed  by Group standards transposed by each RCI Banque Group entity.  The  quality  of  credit  risk  at  the  outset  and throughout  the  life  of  the  loan  is  constantly  monitored, and  a  specific  governance  structure  has  been  set  up  to ensure that the credit risk monitoring system is consistent. Within  this  framework,  provision  adjustments  are  made for fragile  customer  segments  or  risk  deterioration factors such as inflation that has already occurred.\n\nLastly,  in  a  forward-looking  management  approach,  RCI Banque  makes  upward  adjustments  to  the  amount  of impairment on its  outstanding  customer  loans  using  the forward looking technique, taking into account unfavorable economic scenarios, and also measures the\n\nresilience of its business model and capital adequacy by applying a stress test to its customer loan portfolio.\n\nThe total cost of risk at December 31, 2022, was 0.44% of average earning assets compared  with  0.14%  at December  31,  2021.  At  December  31,  2022,  net  assets  of customers  amounted  to  39,063  million  euros  and  net assets of dealers to 10,429 million euros.\n\nFor further details on the customer and network credit risk management system, see note 25-B6 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risk of exposure to residual values\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA  downward  trend  in  the  market  for  used  vehicles  may result  in  a  risk  for  the  holder  of  the  residual  values,  who undertakes to take back the vehicles at the end of their financing at a price fixed at the inception of the contracts. This risk could have a negative impact on the company's operating  results  and  financial  position  due  to  the recognition  of  losses  not  anticipated  at  the  inception  of the  contract.    However,  the  situation  in  2022  is  very favorable,  with  an  increase  in  the  market  price  of  used vehicles and an improvement in the residual values of our entire range.\n\nThe  risk  of  a  decline  in  residual  values  is  borne  by  the Group's  automotive  activities  and  by  Mobilize  Financial Services for financing associated with a vehicle trade-in commitment.\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  the  Renault  Group's  exposure  to changes  in  residual  values  on  the  market  amounted  to 2,816  million  euros  for  Automobile  (net  book  value  of vehicles)  and  2,506  million  euros  for  Mobilize  Financial Services  (value  of  the  trade-in  commitment  in  financing contracts). At December 31, 2021, the exposure amounted to  3,121  million  euro  and  2,110  million  euro  respectively. The  decrease  in  exposure  for  the  automotive  division  is explained  by  the  sale  of  Retail  Renault  Group  car dealerships in France and Europe. The increase in Mobilize Financial Services is attributable to business in the United Kingdom, where contract volumes have increased (better commercial performance) as have vehicle residual values.\n\n## Risk management\n\nDevelopments in the used vehicle market are periodically and thoroughly monitored by the Renault Group Residual Value  Committee,  which  analyzes,  among  other  things, used  vehicle  sales  volumes,  their  current  and  future market  prices,  the  sales  channel  mix  and  the  new  sales prices of these same vehicles. The result is an estimate of risk, and provisions may be made on a conservative basis on  the  loan  portfolio  when  the  market  values  observed have fallen below the level of trade-in commitments, or if specific  future  risks  have  been  identified  in  the  used  car market.\n\nRCI Banque has equivalent governance and benefits from significant synergies with the parent company in terms of tools and information.",

RCI Banque's operating results may be affected by  changes  in  market  interest  rates  or  in  the  rates charged on customer deposits.\n\n## Risk management\n\nInterest  rate  risk  for  the  Sales  Financing  segment is managed  on  a  daily  basis:  sensitivity  is  calculated  by currency, by management entity and by asset portfolio to ensure that each entity complies with the individual limits set  for  it.  The  sensitivity  to  interest  rate  risk  is  measured using a common methodology for all RCI Banque entities. Sensitivity  consists  of  measuring  the  impact  of  an increase  in  interest  rates  on  the  value  of  balance  sheet flows  for  each  entity.  The  magnitude  of  the  increase depends on the currency. It is 100 bp for EUR, CHF, KRW, 15P bp for GBP, 200 bp for PLN, RON, COP, and 300 bp for BRL.  The  hedging  system  reduces  RCI  Banque's  overall exposure  as  well  as  the  exposure  of  each  entity. At  December  31,  2022,  after  hedging,  the  sum  of  the absolute values of sensitivities to a parallel rate shock in each  currency  amounted  to  5.7  million  euros,  below  the limit set by the Group (70 million euros).\n\nFor the Automotive  segment , liquidity reserves are generally built up at variable rates and  long-term investments  are  financed  at  fixed  rates.

Each  event  is  reviewed  regularly,  in particular  when  the  accounts  are  closed.  After  seeking  the opinion of the appropriate advisers, the group sets aside any provisions deemed necessary to cover the estimated risks (see note 20 'Provisions' to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Proceedings on emissions\n\n## In France\n\nLike several other manufacturers, Renault Group has been the target of a judicial investigation for aggravated deception since 2017.  This  case  follows  the  investigation  conducted  by  the DGCCRF into the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) of a dozen car manufacturers selling diesel vehicles in France. In this case, joined  by  fewer  than  20  complainants,  Renault  Group  was charged with deception on 8 June 2021. As per this status, the company is presumed innocent.\n\nRenault  Group  denies  having  committed  any  offence  and points out that its vehicles are not equipped with any rigging software for pollution control devices. The company takes all necessary measures to preserve its rights.\n\nAt  this  stage,  Renault  Group  has  had  to  post  a  bond  of \u20ac20 million  (\u20ac18  million  of  which  will  be  dedicated  to  the potential  payment of damages and fines) and provide a \u20ac60  million  bank  guarantee  dedicated  to  the  potential compensation for losses.\n\n## International\n\nAlso on the matter of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, Renault Group  has  been  the  target  of  civil  actions  for  damages  in\n\nvarious  countries  for  allegedly  equipping  its  vehicles  with rigging software for pollution control devices.\n\nIn Germany, for example, 44 cases are under way against Renault Group. 21 first-instance decisions and six appeals court  decisions  have  already  been  handed  down.  All  of them were in Renault Group's favour.\n\nIn Austria, seven civil proceedings are under way.\n\nIn  the  UK,  threatened class actions brought by three law firms,  in  which  some  very  preliminary  procedural  steps have  been  taken,  are  currently  being  brought  by  two  of them  (following  the  withdrawal  of  the  third)  against Renault Group and certain authorized dealers.\n\nLastly,  three  Dutch  foundations  have  initiated  legal proceedings  against  Renault  S.A.,  Renault  S.A.S.,  Renault Nederland NV, Renault-Nissan BV and Automobile Dacia S.A.  in  the  Netherlands,  as  well  as  certain  authorized dealers. This case is currently at a preliminary stage.\n\n## Antitrust investigations on end-of-life vehicles\n\nOn  15  March  2022,  the  European  Commission  conducted inspections at the premises of companies and associations  active  in  the  automotive  sector  located  in several  EU  Member  States.  In  parallel,  the  European Commission has sent out formal requests for information to  several  companies  active  in  the  automotive  sector. The  investigation  concerns  possible  anticompetitive collusion  in  relation  to  the  collection,  treatment  and recovery  of  end-of-life  (ELV)  cars  and  vans,  relating  in particular  to  (i)  the  compensation  of  ELV  collection, treatment,  and  recovery  companies,  and  (ii)  the  use  of data relating to the recyclability or recoverability of ELVs in advertising materials.\n\nRenault  was  one  of  the  companies  visited  on  15  March 2022.    In  parallel,  Renault  has  received  a  request  for information  from  the  UK  Competition  and  Markets Authority  (CMA),  which  is  investigating  similar  conduct. Renault has replied to the European Commission's and the CMA's requests for information.",

Renault  is  the  3 rd brand  on  pure  EV market and 2 nd brand on full-hybrid market in Europe;\n- \u25cf success of models:\n- \u25cf Renault  Arkana  recorded  86,000  sales  in  more  than 50  countries  in  2022.  In  Europe,  65%  of  sales  are  in E-Tech version, 74% on the highest versions and 56% on the retail channel;\n- \u25cf Renault Megane  E-Tech Electric reached over 33,000 sales in 2022, since its launch at the end of 2022 Q2. It was number 1 EV in France in 2022 H2. As of today, 49,000  orders  have  been  recorded  since  its  launch with more than 70% of these on the highest versions and more than 80% on the most powerful engines;\n- \u25cf Dacia Sandero, with 229,500 sales, remained the bestselling vehicle to retail customers in Europe since 2017;\n- \u25cf launched mid-2021, Dacia Spring 100%  electric recorded 48,900 sales, up 75% vs 2021 and was number 3 EV sold to retail customers in Europe;\n- \u25cf Dacia  Jogger  recorded  almost  57,000  sales  and  was number  2  of  C-segment  (ex.  SUV)  sold  to  retail customers in Europe;\n- \u25cf Alpine reached a record level of sales, up 33% versus 2021.\n- \u25cf product mix effect of +2.8 pts on the Automotive revenue vs  2021  thanks  to  new  launches  (Renault  Arkana,  Dacia Jogger and Renault Megane E-Tech Electric);\n- \u25cf acceleration of the pricing effect, which reached +9.7 pts on  the  Automotive  revenue  vs  2021  (+12.1  pts  in  2022  H2 after  +7.4  pts  in  2022  H1),  thanks  to  the  Renaulution commercial policy.\n\nReminder  relative  to  the  impacts  of  the  disposal  of Russian automotive activities on financial statements:\n\nIn  May  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Renault  Group unanimously approved the signing of agreements to sell 100% of  Renault  Group's  shares  in  Renault  Russia  to  the City  of  Moscow  and  its  67.69%  stake  in  Avtovaz  to  NAMI (the  Central  Institute  for  Research  and  Development  of Automobiles  and  Engines).    In  addition,  the  agreement provides for a call option for Renault Group to buy back its stake in Avtovaz, exercisable at certain periods over the next 6 years.\n\n## As a result of these agreements :\n\n- \u25cf the  Russian  activities  were  deconsolidated  in  Renault Group's  2022  financial  statements  and  treated  as discontinued  operations  under  IFRS  5  with  retroactive effect from January 1 st , 2022;\n\n- \u25cf the  financial  aggregates  of  continuing  operations  for 2022  therefore  no  longer  include  the  Russian  industrial activities and the year 2021 has been adjusted in line with this new scope of activity;\n- \u25cf the result of discontinued operations represents a loss of -\u20ac2.3 billion in 2022, mainly due to the impairment of the property,  plant  and  equipment,  intangible  assets  and goodwill  of  Avtovaz  and  Renault  Russia  as  well  as  the impairment of specific assets held by the other entities of  the  Group and the result of disposals on the Russian entities sold;\n- \u25cf the  Automotive  net  debt  was  reduced  by  \u20ac0.5  billion from -\u20ac1.6 billion to -\u20ac1.1 billion at December 31, 2021.\n\nGroup revenue reached \u20ac46,391 million, up 11.4% compared to 2021. At constant exchange rates 3 , it increased by 12.4% (-1 point of negative exchange rates effect).\n\nAutomotive  revenue stood  at  \u20ac43,121  million,  up  11.4% compared  to  2021.  At  constant  exchange  rates1,  it increased by 12.6% (-1.2 points of negative exchange rates effect mainly related to the Turkish lira and Argentinean peso devaluation).\n\nVolume  effect  stood  at  +3.4  points  thanks  to  the commercial success of vehicles coupled with an improved availability  of  EC  components.  Invoices  outperformed sales because of delays in the delivery of vehicles ordered by  and  invoiced  to  the  independent  dealers  to  answer their  customers'  demand.  These  delays  were  due  to outbound logistic tensions at the end of the year.\n\nThe  price  effect,  positive  by  +9.7  points,  reflected  the continuation of the Group's commercial policy, launched in 2020 Q3, focused on value over volume, as well as price increases to offset  cost  inflation,  and  an  optimization  of commercial discounts. It amounted to +12.1 points in 2022 H2 after +7.4 points in H1.\n\nThe success of Renault Megane E-Tech Electric launched at the end of 2022 Q2, Renault Arkana launched in 2021 Q2, as well as Dacia Jogger launched in 2022 Q1, evidenced the renewal and the offensive of Renault and Dacia brands in the C-segment. It generated in 2022 a +2.8 points positive product mix effect.\n\nThe  impact  of  sales  to  partners,  negative  by  -1.4  points, was  mainly  due  to  the  decrease  in  production  of  diesel engines and vehicles for Renault Group's partners (end of contracts of Master for Opel and Traffic for Fiat at the end of 2021).\n\nThe 'Others' effect, of -1.8 points, was due to a decrease in the  contribution  of  sales  from  the  Renault  Retail  Group (RRG)  network  following  the  disposals  of  branches  and lower  sales  of  used  cars,  partially  offset  by  strong performance in the aftersales activity.\n\nThe Group recorded  a  positive operating  margin of \u20ac2,59 million (5.6% of revenue) versus \u20ac1,153 million (2.8% of revenue)  in 2021 (+\u20ac1,442 million and  +2.8  points). It improved sequentially to 6.4% in 2022 H2 versus 4.7% in 2022 H1.\n\nI",

It largely offset the increase in costs which amounted to -\u20ac2,288 million. The latter was mainly explained by the impact of inflation on raw materials (-\u20ac1,916 million), on purchasing costs, and on manufacturing  and  logistic  costs,  despite  continuous productivity gains. The volume effect stood at +\u20ac199 million.\n\nThe  contribution  of Mobilize  Financial  Services (Sales Financing)  to  the  Group's  operating  margin  reached \u20ac1,223  million,  up  \u20ac38  million  compared  to  2021.  It  was positively  impacted  by  non-recurring  impacts  on  the swaps  valuation  mainly  coming  from  the  interest  rate increase in Europe and by the focus on the most profitable customer channels bringing higher margins.\n\nThe  6.4%  decrease  of  the  number  of  new  financing contracts in retail business, mainly linked to the evolution of  Group's  registrations,  was  more  than  offset  by  the 10.4% increase in the average financed amount. Thus, new financings increased by 3.3% versus 2021.\n\nOther  operating  income  and  expenses were  negative  at -\u20ac379 million (versus -\u20ac253 million in 2021) and were mostly explained  by  restructuring  provisions  for  -\u20ac354  million and  impairments  for  -\u20ac257  million  mainly  related  to  a Chinese  facility,  partially  offset  by  asset  disposals (+\u20ac202 million) related to the sale of several commercial subsidiaries of the Group and branches of RRG, in line with the announced strategy.\n\nAfter  taking  into  account  other  operating  income  and expenses,  the Group's  operating  income stood  at \u20ac2,216  million  versus  \u20ac900  million  in  2021  (+\u20ac1,316  million versus 2021).\n\nNet financial income  and  expenses amounted  to -\u20ac486  million  compared  to  -\u20ac295  million  in  2021.  Most  of this  deterioration  is  explained  by  the  accounting  impact of  hyperinflation  in  Argentina  despite  the  decrease  in financial interests on the net debt.\n\nThe contribution  of  associated  companies amounted  to \u20ac423  million  compared  to  \u20ac515  million  in  2021.  This included  \u20ac526  million  related  to  Nissan's  contribution, which  more  than  offset  the  negative  contribution  from other associates (-\u20ac103 million), notably in connection with the impairment of Renault Nissan Bank shares in Russia.\n\nCurrent  and  deferred  taxes represented  a  charge  of -\u20ac533 million compared to a charge of -\u20ac571 million in 2021. The  increase  linked  to  the  improvement  of  the  pretax income was more than offset by net year-over-year oneoffs.\n\nNet income from continuing operations was \u20ac1,620 million, up  \u20ac1,071  million  compared  to  2021.  Net  income  from continuing  operations,  Group  share,  was  \u20ac1,650  million (or \u20ac6.07 per share).\n\nNet  income  from  discontinued  operations amounted  to -\u20ac2,320 million due to the non-cash adjustment related to the disposals of the Russian industrial activities.\n\nThus, net income was -\u20ac700 million and net income, Group share, was -\u20ac338 million (or -\u20ac1.24 per share).\n\nThe cash  flow  of  the  Automotive  business reached \u20ac4,818 million, up \u20ac519 million compared to 2021 (including \u20ac800  million  of  Mobilize  Financial  Services  dividend versus  \u20ac1,000  million  in  2021).  This  cash  flow  largely covered  the  tangible  and  intangible  investments  before asset disposals which amounted to  \u20ac2.5 billion (\u20ac2.1 billion net of disposals) and the restructuring expenses (-\u20ac590 million).\n\nExcluding the impact of asset disposals, the Group's net CAPEX and R&D amounted to \u20ac3,451 million in 2022 (7.4% of  revenue)  stable  compared  to  2021  (\u20ac3,579  million  and 8.6% of revenue).\n\nAutomotive  operational  free  cash  flow 4 was  positive  at +\u20ac2,119  million  taking  into  account  a  positive  change  in working capital requirement of +\u20ac7 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, total inventories of new vehicles (including  the  independent  dealer  network)  represented 480,000  vehicles  compared  to  336,000  at  the  end  of December  2021.  This  increase  is  explained  by  higher independent dealers' inventories notably due to outbound logistic  tensions  at  the  end  of  the  year.  This  level  of inventories has to be put into perspective with the record level of the orderbook.\n\nThe Automotive  financial  position is  now  positive  at +\u20ac549  million  on  December  31,  2022,  compared  to -\u20ac1,100  million  adjusted  from  the  operations  of  Avtovaz and Renault Russia at December 31, 2021, an improvement of \u20ac1.6 billion.\n\nIn  2022,  Renault  Group  made  an  early  repayment  of \u20ac1  billion  and  reimbursed  \u20ac1  billion  for  the  mandatory annual repayment of the loan of a banking pool benefiting from  the  guarantee  of  the  French  State  (PGE).  As announced, the entire loan will be reimbursed by the end of 2023 at the latest.",

At constant exchange rates 11 , it increased by 12.4% (-1 point of negative exchange rate effect).\n\nAutomotive  revenue stood  at  \u20ac43,121  million,  up  11.4% compared  to  2021.  At  constant  exchange  rates 1 , it increased by 12.6% (-1.2 points of negative exchange rates effect mainly related to the Turkish lira and Argentinean peso devaluation).\n\nVolume  effect  stood  at  +3.4  points  thanks  to  the commercial success of vehicles coupled with an improved availability  of  EC  components.  Invoices  outperformed sales because of delays in the delivery of vehicles ordered by  and  invoiced  to  the  independent  dealers  to  answer their  customers'  demand.  These  delays  were  due  to outbound logistic tensions at the end of the year.\n\nThe  price  effect,  positive  by  +9.7  points,  reflected  the continuation of the Group's commercial policy, launched in 2020 Q3, focused on value over volume, as well as price increases to offset  cost  inflation,  and  an  optimization  of\n\ncommercial  discounts.  It  amounted  to  +12.1  points  in 2022 H2 after +7.4 points in H1.\n\nThe success of Renault Megane E-Tech Electric launched at the end of 2022 Q2, Renault Arkana launched in 2021 Q2, as well as Dacia Jogger launched in 2022 Q1, evidenced the renewal  of  Renault  and  Dacia  brands'  offensive  in  the C-segment.  It  generated  in  2022  a  +2.8  points  positive product mix effect.\n\nThe  impact  of  sales  to  partners,  negative  by  -1.4  points, was  mainly  due  to  the  decrease  in  production  of  diesel engines and vehicles for Renault Group's partners (end of contracts of Master for Opel and Traffic for Fiat at the end of 2021).\n\nThe 'Others' effect, of -1.8 points, was due to a decrease in the  contribution  of  sales  from  the  Renault  Retail  Group (RRG)  network  following  the  disposals  of  branches  and lower  sales  of  used  cars,  partially  offset  by  strong performance in the aftersales activity.",

It  largely  offset  the  increase  in  costs which  amounted  to  -\u20ac2,288  million.

It  was positively  impacted  by  non-recurring  impacts  on  the swaps  valuation  mainly  coming  from  the  interest  rate increase in Europe and by the focus on the most profitable customer channels bringing higher margins.\n\nThe  6.4%  decrease  of  the  number  of  new  financing contracts in retail business, mainly linked to the evolution of  Group's  registrations,  was  more  than  offset  by  the 10.4% increase in the average financed amount.

We  believe  that  the  audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code  de  commerce)  and  the  French  Code  of  Ethics  (code  de  d\u00e9ontologie)  for  statutory  auditors  for  the  period  from January 1 st , 2022 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating  to  the  justification  of  our  assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit  matters  relating  to  risks  of  material misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nI",

The value in use is calculated based on discounted future cash flows. When the recoverable amount is less than the net book value, the impairment loss is recognized as a reduction in the assets concerned.\n\nFor 2022 year-end closing, these impairment tests consider the assumptions used in the update of the Renaulution medium-term plan.\n\nIn addition, the perpetuity growth rates used in the tests as of December 31, 2022 take into account the impacts of the commitments made by the signatory States of the Paris agreements on climate change.\n\nWe have considered that the valuation of assets is a key audit matter because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the estimates and judgments required from Management to prepare these tests, particularly in the current context described above.\n\nDuring our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our procedures mainly consisted in:\n\n- \u25cf understanding the analysis performed by Management in order to identify impairment indicators\n- \u25cf for assets tested:\n- \u25cf reconciling the net book value of assets to the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u25cf assessing the consistency of the data on projected volumes and margins used in the tests with the latest management estimates presented in the updated Renaulution medium-term plan, which reflects the negative effects due to the component crisis and the impacts of the commitments made by the signatory States of the Paris agreements on climate change;\n- \u25cf in particular, verify that these data take into account the separation of certain mechanical activities of Renault Group known as HORSE, as announced at the Capital Market Day on November 8, 2022, the corresponding assets and liabilities of which have been reclassified in the consolidated statement of financial position on December 31, 2022, in accordance with IFRS 5 \"Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\";\n- \u25cf assessing, in the context described above, the reasonableness of the main assumptions used through interviews with management and by comparing the assumptions with the data used in the previous impairment tests, with the historical performance or with external market data;\n- \u25cf testing the arithmetical accuracy of the discounted cash flows projections prepared by management.;\n- \u25cf comparing the discount rate after tax used with external data available;\n- \u25cf performing sensitivity analysis on the main assumptions used.",

RCI Banque applies the accounting principles of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' which defines a provisioning model for expected losses based on three stages of risk: healthy receivables (stage 1), receivables showing higher credit risk since initial recognition (stage 2), and receivables in default (stage 3).\n\nThe provisions related to IFRS 9 are detailed in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements and amounts to 1 111 M\u20ac for an outstanding amount of 45 358 M\u20ac.\n\nWe consider the amount of credit loss provisioning as a key point of the audit, due to the significant amount of customer and network loans in the assets of the Group's balance sheet, the use of numerous parameters and assumptions in the calculation models and the use of judgment made by management in estimating expected credit losses. As mentioned in the note 2-B, those assumptions are even more important in the current situation which brings major economic uncertainties in the world for the years to come.\n\nOur procedures, performed with our specialists, mainly consisted in:\n\n- \u25cf assessing the key controls related to the governance established to validate the changes in parameters and key assumptions involved in the calculation of the expected credit loss\n- \u25cf assessing the methodologies applied to set the parameters used in the provisioning models and their operational integration in the information systems;\n- \u25cf assessing the provisioning adjustments made on expertise at local and Group levels;\n- \u25cf examining the documentation supporting the additional provisioning booked;\n- \u25cf assessing the models and assumptions used in the determination of the 'forward looking' component, in particular the weighting of the various scenarios used;\n- \u25cf testing the quality of the application program interfaces that support the calculation and accounting of the expected credit losses;\n- \u25cf evaluating the staging process;\n- \u25cf ensuring the completeness and the quality of the data used in the estimation of the provisioning;\n- \u25cf carrying out analytical procedures on the evolution of outstanding retail customer and dealer network loans and credit risk impairment;\n- \u25cf assessing the appropriateness of the information presented in Notes to the consolidated financial statements.",

Sales made by Group companies to Russian entities have also been classified as discontinued operations with corresponding restatement of 2021 data. Consolidated cash flow items from Renault Russia, AVTOVAZ and its subsidiaries, as well as the sales made by Group companies to Russian entities and the impairment of assets located outside the Russian Federation but whose loss of value is the direct consequence of the Group's exit from the Russian Federation, were also classified as discontinued operations. The data related to the 2021 financial years have also been restated accordingly.\n\nThe result of discontinued operations for 2022 amounts to 2 320 M\u20ac in the Group's consolidated financial statements, including an\n\nimpairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill in the Russian Federation of 2 221 M\u20ac. Details of this result from\n\ndiscontinued operations are provided in note 3-B to the consolidated financial statements. For the comparative year 2021, net income has\n\nbeen restated by 418 M\u20ac for the full year in respect of discontinued operations.\n\nWe considered that the accounting treatment of the sale by the Renault Russia Group and its shareholding in Lada Auto Holding is a key audit matter due to its significant nature and the estimates and judgments of management necessary to evaluate all the accounting impacts in terms of impairment and presentation.\n\nIn the context of our audit of the Group's consolidated financial statements, our work consisted mainly of:\n\n- \u25cf assessing on the basis of the documents obtained, the Group's analysis of the loss of control of the activities in the Russian Federation;\n- \u25cf assessing the appropriateness of the classification of the disposal of Renault Russia and Lada Auto Holding with regard to the provisions of IFRS 5, in particular through interviews with Group management, analysis of the minutes of the Board of Directors and the available documentation, as well as the reasonableness of the main data and assumptions on which the classification as discontinued operations is based;\n- \u25cf review the procedures put in place by the Group to identify the impacts of Renault Group's exit from the Russian Federation by interviewing those in charge within the Group and assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions used to determine these impacts;\n- \u25cf verify the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations made by the company, in particular to determine the amount of impairment and the result of disposal;\n- \u25cf corroborate, on a test basis, the figures for discontinued operations presented in the income statement, the cash flow statement, the consolidated comprehensive income and in the note 3-B with the information used to prepare the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u25cf assess the appropriateness of the disclosures in notes 2-B 'Estimates and judgments', 3-B 'Discontinued operations' and 28-B 'Offbalance sheet commitments received, contingent assets and assets received as collateral' to the financial statements concerning the option to repurchase the Avtovaz shares.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe  have  also  performed,  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  specific  verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), is included in the Group's information given in the management report, it being specified that, in accordance with  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  823 -10  of  this  Code,  we  have  verified  neither  the  fair  presentation  nor  the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein and the information must be reported by an independent third party.\n\nI",

As  it  relates  to  consolidated  financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased  on  the  work  we  have  performed,  we  conclude  that  the  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent to the block-tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to the European  single  electronic  format,  the  content  of  certain  tags  of  the  notes  may  not  be  rendered  identically  to  the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nFurthermore, we have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated financial statements that will ultimately be included by  your  company  in  the  annual  financial  report  filed  with  the  AMF  are  in  agreement  with  those  on  which  we  have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Renault by the Annual General Meeting held on April 30, 2014 for KPMG S.A. and on June 19, 2020 for MAZARS.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, KPMG S.A. was in the nineth year of total uninterrupted engagement and MAZARS in the third year.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe  Audit  and  Risks  Committee  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  financial  reporting  process  and  the  effectiveness  of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur  role  is  to  issue  a  report  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25cf Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n5",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u25cf Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u25cf Obtains sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business  activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the  direction,  supervision  and  performance  of  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  for  the  opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Risks Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit and Risks Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit, Risks Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were  of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  which  are therefore the key audit matters, that we are required to describe in this audit report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Risks Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Risks Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, February 24, 2023\n\nThe statutory auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nKPMG S.A.\n\nBertrand Pruvost\n\nMAZARS\n\nLoic Wallaert\n\nI",

Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements\n\n## 5.2.2.6.1.

This segment also includes investments in automotive-sector associates and joint ventures, principally Nissan.\n- \u25cf The 'Sales  Financing' segment,  which  the  Group considers  as  an  operating  activity  in  its  own  right, carried  out  for  the  distribution  network  and  final customers  by  RCI  Banque,  its  subsidiaries  and  its associates and joint ventures.\n- \u25cf The 'Mobility Services' segment consisting of services for new mobilities.\n\nThe  segment  previously  named  Avtovaz,  and  all  the discontinued  operations  in  Russia,  are  now  presented separately as Discontinued operations in the Automotive segment in 2022, in accordance with IFRS 5. The segment information for 2021 has been adjusted according to the same principles.\n\nThe  segment  result  regularly  reviewed  by  the  Board  of Management, identified as the 'Chief Operating DecisionMaker',  is  the  operating  margin.  The  definition  of  this indicator is detailed in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2022 (Note 2-D Presentation of  the  consolidated financial statements). The operating margin excludes restructuring costs.\n\nI",

Accounting policies and scope of consolidation\n\n## Note 1\n\n## Approval of the financial statements\n\nRenault Group's consolidated financial statements for 2022 were examined at the Board of Directors' meeting of February 15, 2023 and will be submitted for approval by the shareholders at the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Note 2\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIn application of European regulations, the Renault Group's consolidated financial statements for 2022 are prepared under IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) as issued by the lASB (International Accounting Standards Board) at December 31, 2022 and adopted by the European Union at the year-end.\n\n## 2-A. Changes in accounting policies\n\n## New amendments and improvements mandatory for 2022\n\nRenault Group applies the accounting standards and amendments that have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union and are mandatory from January 1, 2022.\n\n| Amendments to IAS 16                  | Property, plant and equipment: Proceeds before intended use   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Amendments to IFRS 3                  | Updating a reference to the conceptual framework              |\n| Amendments to IAS 37                  | Onerous contracts - Cost of fulfilling a contract             |\n| Annual improvements (2018-2020 cycle) | Annual improvements process                                   |\n\nApplication of these amendments from January 1, 2022 has no significant impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n## New standards and amendments not applied early by the Group\n\nMandatory application\n\n| New IFRS standards and amendments not applied early by the Group   | New IFRS standards and amendments not applied early by the Group                  | date set by the IASB   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| IFRS 17 and amendments                                             | Insurance contracts                                                               | January 1, 2023        |\n| Amendments to IFRS 17                                              | Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 - Comparative Information               | January 1, 2023        |\n| Amendments to IAS 12                                               | Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single  transaction | January 1, 2023        |\n| Amendments to IAS 1                                                | Disclosure of accounting policies                                                 | January 1, 2023        |\n| Amendments to IAS 8                                                | Definition of accounting estimates                                                | January 1, 2023        |\n\nThe  Group  does  not  at  this  stage  anticipate  that application of the amendments to IAS 1, IAS 8 and IAS 12 will  have  any  significant  impact  on  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\nIFRS  17  -  Insurance  Contracts,  published  on  May  18,  2017, and  modified  by  amendments  of  June  25,  2020,  sets  out the principles of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures for insurance contracts. It replaces IFRS 4, Insurance  Contracts,  and  will  be  applicable  for  financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\nFor  the  Group,  IFRS  17  mainly  applies  to  credit  insurance contracts issued and reassurance agreements signed by the  Sales  Financing  segment's  insurance  companies. Contracts  will  be  valued  under  the  general  'building block'  approach  which  comprises:  (1)  estimated  future cash flows discounted under the 'bottom-up' approach,\n\nwith  a  discount  rate  determined  by  adjusting  a  risk-free yield curve to take account of liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts portfolio, (2) adjustment for nonfinancial  risks  calculated  according  to  the  confidence interval  method,  and  (3)  the  contractual  service  margin. The contractual service margin will be recognized in the income statement based on the coverage units supplied during the period, i.e. according to the amortization of the insured credit.\n\nThe  modified  retrospective  application  of  IFRS  17  from January  1,  2023,  is  expected  to  have  a  positive  effect  on equity  around  \u20ac130  million  as  of  January  1,  2022,  the transition  date.  No  onerous  contracts  were  identified  in the  portfolio  at  the  transition  date.  Calculation  of  the impact of IFRS 17 on the 2022 income statement is not yet finalized.\n\n5",

This decision applies to drawings of TLTRO III financing by the Sales Financing segment, to which the Group has opted to apply  IFRS  9.  More  details  of  these  transactions  are provided in Note 23-C.\n\n## 2-B. Estimates and judgements\n\n## Specific context of 2022\n\n## Renault Group's exit from the Russian Federation\n\nAs announced on May 16, 2022, Renault Group has sold its investments  in  Renault  Russia  and  the  Avtovaz  Group. Those entities have therefore been deconsolidated. They are  treated  as  discontinued  operations  in  2022,  in compliance  with  IFRS  5,  and  the  2021  income  statement and  cash  flow  statement  figures  have  been  adjusted accordingly.  Following  this  sale,  the  Avtovaz  Group  is  no longer presented as a separate operating segment for the purposes of segment reporting.\n\nDetails  of  the  impacts  of  this  deconsolidation  are provided  in  Note  3-B,  Discontinued  operations,  and Renault  Group's  option  to  buy  back  its  investment  in Avtovaz  is  mentioned  in  Note  28-B.  Off-balance  sheet commitments  received,  contingent  assets  and  assets received as collateral.\n\nIn the Sales Financing segment, the Group fully consolidates  one  100%-  owned  entity  (RNL  Leasing)  and applies the equity method for RN Bank. Due to uncertainty over  its  recoverability  the  equity-accounted  value  of  RN Bank is fully written off at December 31, 2022 (see Note 13), with a negative impact of \u20ac 119 million on the net income of associates and joint ventures for the year. The contribution by RNL Leasing to the Group's shareholders' equity  remains  of  low  significance  (\u20ac2  million)  and  the \u20ac19 million shareholder loan is eliminated as an intragroup\n\n## Hyperinflation in Turkey\n\nOn  March  16,  2022  Turkey  was  identified  by  the International Practices Task Force (IPTF) of the Center for Audit  Quality  as  a  country  that  should  be  considered hyperinflationary  for  the  purposes  of  2022  financial statements.\n\nThe  entities  MAIS  Motorlu  Araclar  Imal  ve  Satis  AS  and ORFIN  Finansman  Anonim  Sirketi,  which  are  accounted for  under  the  equity  method,  use  the  local  currency  as their functional currency and have applied the hyperinflation adjustment at December 31, 2022. Its effect on their contribution to the Group financial statements is considered non-significant. The fully consolidated entities Oyak Renault and Renault Group Otomotiv prepare their accounts  for  the  Group  consolidation  using  the  euro  as their  functional  currency,  since  most  of  their  business  is conducted in euros. Consequently, their accounts do not require adjustment for hyperinflation.\n\noperation. At December 31, 2022 this entity is classified as Assets held for sale at a book value that does not exceed its recoverable value.\n\n## Components supply crisis\n\nSince  2021,  the  Automotive  segment  has  experienced disruptions  in  supplies  of  electronic  components  that have  affected  the  worldwide  automotive  sector.  The effects  of  this  components  crisis  continued  during  2022, and  the  principal  consequence  was  lower  production output.  As  a  result,  after  a  4.5%  decrease  between  2020 and 2021 to 2,696,401 units, sales volumes also declined by 5.9% between 2021 and 2022: 2,051,174 vehicles were sold in 2022, compared to an adjusted volume (excluding sales in Russia) of 2,179,562 vehicles sold in 2021.\n\n## External financing\n\nTo maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for its operations, in 2022  the  Group  issued  two  bonds  the  Japanese  market  as part  of  Renault's  Shelf  Registration  program,  for  a  total  of \u00a5290.7 billion. And the Group made \u20ac2,010 million repayment in 2022 of its State-guaranteed credit facility. The outstanding amount of this credit, which initially amounted to \u20ac4 billion, is \u20ac990 million at December 31, 2022. At the date of  publication  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements, the  Group  has  sufficient  cash  and  sources  of  financing  to ensure continuity of operations for the next twelve months and has demonstrated its capacity to issue debt.\n\nI",

At the Capital Market Day held on November 8,  2022,  it  announced  that  some  of  its  Horse  project powertrain technologies were to be combined into a joint venture.  The  groups  of  assets  and  liabilities  concerned were  therefore  reclassified  as  assets  and  liabilities  held for sale in the consolidated  financial position at December 31, 2022, in accordance with IFRS 5.\n\nThe  Group  also  announced  at  the  same  Capital  Market Day that  it  was  setting  up  five  targeted  businesses  with specialist  teams,  each  one  founded  on  a  homogeneous set  of  technologies with its own governance and results. The practical results of this announcement will be visible from 2023 as the entities concerned are formed or sold off, and  it  has  no  impact  on  the  structure  of  segment reporting for 2022.\n\nIn November 2022, the Group sold 34% of the capital of its Korean  subsidiary  RKM  to  the  Chinese  group  Geely,  and simultaneously purchased an industrial production licence to make two new vehicles for the Asian market\n\n## Employee agreements and employee shareholding\n\nAmid rising inflation, discussions took place between the Management  and  the  Unions  about  purchasing  power concerns  in  France.  An  agreement  was  signed  on September  30,  2022,  comprising  several  measures implemented  in  2022  (a  \u20ac500  bonus,  a  25%  increase  in monetized unused leave, etc).\n\nTo engage all employees in the Group's new strategy and future performance as in-depth changes are being made, Renault  Group  launched  Renaulution  Shareplan,  an employee  shareholding  operation  attributing  6  free shares to more than 95,000 employees across 22 countries. In 21 countries, the plan  also  offers employees  the  opportunity  to  buy  shares  at  a  30% discount. As the reference share price in the Renaulution Shareplan  is  set  at  \u20ac31.46,  the  discounted  share  price  is \u20ac22.02.  The  cost  of  this  plan  has  been  recognized  in  the 2022 financial statements.\n\n## Principal estimates and judgments in the 2022 context\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  Group's  exit  from  the  Russian Federation,  workforce  reduction  plans,  the  electronic components  supply  crisis,  and  inflation,  the  following items  in  the  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements have been paid particular attention in 2022:\n\n- \u25cf potential impairment  of  fixed  assets,  particularly impairment  on  specific  assets  linked  to  vehicles  and goodwill (see Note 11);\n- \u25cf the  recoverable  value  of  leased  vehicles  classified  as property, plant and equipment or inventories;\n- \u25cf investments in associates, notably Nissan and RN Bank (see Notes 12 and 13);\n- \u25cf impairment for expected credit losses concerning Sales Financing receivables (see Note 15);\n- \u25cf revenue recognition;\n- \u25cf determination of restructuring provisions (see Notes 6-A and 20);\n- \u25cf determination  of  risks  associated  with  distressed suppliers;\n- \u25cf determination of compliance with the requirements of IFRS 5 for reclassification of assets or groups of assets and  liabilities  held  for  sale  and  reporting  them  on specific lines in the balance sheet in the current assets and current liabilities (see Note 3-C);\n- \u25cf estimation of the costs associated with the Renaulution Shareplan  employee  shareholding  plan  introduced  in December 2022.\n\n## Principal estimates and judgments relating to environmental matters and climate issues\n\nThe  main  estimates  and  judgments  relating  to  climate and environmental questions are the following:\n\n- \u25cf estimation  of  the  risks  associated  with  the  applicable regulations on air pollution and CO2 emissions (specifically the potential impact of the CAFE 'Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy'  regulation,  which fines automakers if they exceed the average threshold for  CO2  emissions  by  European-registered  vehicles  in each calendar year, see Note 28);\n- \u25cf estimation of the consequences of commitments made in connection with environmental and climate issues for the value of Renault Group assets and their useful lives. At this stage, no impact has been identified on either the useful lives or the recoverable value of our tangible and intangible  assets.  An  analysis  of  the  useful  lives  of production assets, particularly against the background of changing markets, the growing proportion of electric vehicles  and  the  Group's  circular  economy  decisions (the 'Re-factories' at Flins and Seville) is conducted at each annual closing: this had no significant impact on the financial statements for 2022;\n- \u25cf estimation of the consequences of contractual purchase commitments for renewable energy made in connection  with  environmental  and  climate  issues covering  periods  of  up  to  15  years  and  involving substantial investments;  the  analysis  focused  on control  of  the  assets  and  the  financial  terms  of  these contracts, and concluded that they contained no leases or  embedded  derivatives;  information  is  provided  in Note 28-A1 on off-balance sheet commitments (minimum purchase commitments);\n- \u25cf use of a growth rate to infinity for impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life that incorporates the effects of commitments made by signatory States to the Paris Agreements on climate change. This has no impact, since the recoverable value of  the  assets  concerned  remains  significantly  higher than their book value.",

Jointly controlled companies are accounted for  under  the  equity  method  when  they  are  classified  as joint  ventures  and  consolidated  on  the  basis  of  the percentage  share  specific  to  each  balance  sheet  and income statement item when they are classified as joint operations.\n\nCompanies  in  which  the  Group  exercises  significant influence  (associates)  are  included  in  the  financial statements on an equity basis.\n\nSignificant  intercompany  transactions  and  unrealized internal profits are eliminated.\n\nthat are dependent on estimates and judgments are the following:\n\n- \u25cf capitalization  of  research  and  development  expenses and their amortization period (see Note 10-A);\n- \u25cf the  depreciation  and  amortization  periods  for  fixed assets  other  than  capitalized  development  expenses (see Note 10);\n- \u25cf recognition of deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards (see Note 8);\n- \u25cf provisions, particularly warranty provisions on vehicles and batteries sold (see Note 20), provisions for pensions and other long-term employee benefit obligations (see Note 19), provisions for workforce adjustment measures (see  Note  6-A),  provisions  for  legal  risks  and  tax  risks (other than  income  tax  risks  and  provisions  for uncertain tax liabilities);\n- \u25cf valuation of lease liabilities, particularly the incremental borrowing  rates  and  the  value  of  renewal  and termination  options  that  are  reasonably  certain  to  be exercised (see Note 23).\n\nPut options on non-controlling interests are carried in the consolidated financial position at fair value, and classified in  other  financial  liabilities  in  the  Automotive  segment and in other non-current liabilities in the Sales Financing segment, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\nOutstanding  price  supplements  payable  to  shareholders who  have  sold  shares  to  the  Group  are  recorded  in  the financial  position,  in  financial  liabilities  (Automotive  and Mobilities  segments)  or  in  other  liabilities  (Sales  Financing segment) to give a better  estimation  of  the  obligation.  The liability  is  initially  recognized  via  an  adjustment  to  goodwill (or unconsolidated investments) and subsequently via profit and loss (other financial income and expenses, or the share in net income of associates and joint ventures, depending on the nature of the investment).\n\n## 2-D. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Valuation basis\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  established under  the  historical  cost  convention,  except  for  certain categories  of  assets  and  liabilities,  in  compliance  with IFRS  rules.  The  categories  concerned  are  detailed  in  the following notes.\n\n## Operating income and operating margin\n\nOperating income includes all revenues and costs directly related  to  the  Group's  activities,  whether  recurrent  or resulting from non-recurring decisions or operations, such as restructuring costs.\n\nThe operating margin, which corresponds to the operating income of an individual segment as defined in IFRS 8, Operating Segments, corresponds to the operating income  before  other  operating  income  and  expenses, which  are  by  nature  unusual  or  significant  and  could\n\naffect  comparability  of  the  margin.  Other  operating income and expenses cover:\n\n- \u25cf restructuring  and  workforce  adjustment  costs  and significant  costs  relating  to  discontinued  activities. A  restructuring  is  a  program  that  is  planned  and controlled  by  management  and  materially  changes either:  a)  the  scope  of  a  business  undertaken  by  an entity;  or  b)  the  manner  in  which  that  business  is conducted. The estimated cost of workforce adjustment measures, which for accounting purposes is treated as an employee benefit, is covered by a provision over the estimated residual employment period of the employees concerned.  The  cost  of  termination  indemnities  is recognized  as  soon  as  a  detailed  plan  has  either  been announced or is in progress. The amount recorded is net of existing provisions for pensions;\n- \u25cf gains or losses on partial or total disposal of businesses or operating  entities,  gains  or  losses  on  total  or  partial disposals of investments in associates and joint ventures,\n\nI",

The  impairment  booked  is limited to the net book value of the investment, unless an additional commitment has been made.\n\nThe  gain  or  loss  resulting  from  the  sale  or  loss  of significant  influence  or  joint  control  over  associates  and joint ventures accounted for under the equity method and the  gain  or  loss  on  acquisition  of  control,  as  defined  by IFRS  10,  over  companies  that  were  already  consolidated but not controlled, is reported in other operating income and  expenses  in  the  Group's  consolidated  income statement.  This includes transfers of accumulated translation adjustments during the period the entity was accounted for under the equity method.\n\nThe Group recognizes a deferred tax liability on dividend distributions for all differences between the book and tax values of its investments in associates and joint ventures (see Note 2-I). This tax is included in current and deferred taxes in the Group's income statement.\n\nGoodwill  relating  to  associates  and  joint  ventures  is included in the value of the relevant entities as stated in the  assets  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial position. In the event of impairment, an impairment loss is booked  and  included  in  the  consolidated  income statement via the share in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures (see Note 2-J).\n\n5\n\nAcquisition expenses related to investments in associates and  joint  ventures  are  included  in  the  initial  acquisition cost for these investments.\n\nCross-investments between a consolidated entity and an associate are neutralized in measuring the investment in the associate as stated in the assets of the statement of financial  position.  Nissan's  15%  stake  in  Renault  is therefore neutralized in valuing the investment in Nissan shown  in  the  assets  of  the  consolidated  statement  of financial position (see Note 12).\n\nDividends  received  from  unlisted  associates  and  joint ventures are included in the Automotive operational free cash flow, while dividends received from listed associates and  joint ventures, i.e. Nissan, are excluded  from Automotive operational free cash flow.\n\n## Reporting by operating segment\n\nThe  information  by  operating  segment  is  based  on internal  reporting  to  the  Board  of  Management,  which  is identified as the 'Chief  Operating  Decision-Maker'. All  Group  financial  data  are  assigned  to  the  operating segments.  The  'Intersegment  transactions'  column  is reserved  for  transactions  between  the  segments,  which are carried out on near-market terms. Dividend payments by  the  Sales  Financing  segment  are  included  in  net financial income  and  expenses  of  the  Automotive segment.\n\nThe  indicator  used  to  evaluate  segment  performance  is the operating margin.\n\nThe  effects  of  the  French  consolidated  taxation  system are  included  in  the  tax  expense  of  the  Automotive segment.\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  are  specific  to  each  segment. Receivables assigned by the Automotive segment to the Sales  Financing  companies  are  treated  as  operating assets  by  the  assignee  when  the  risks  and  benefits  are substantially  transferred.  These  receivables  are  mostly receivables on the dealership network.\n\nVehicles and batteries for which the Automotive segment has  a  repurchase  commitment  are  included  in  the segment's assets. When these assets are financed by the Sales  Financing  segment,  the  Sales  Financing  segment recognizes a receivable on the Automotive segment.\n\n## Current and non-current assets and liabilities\n\nSales Financing receivables, other securities, derivatives, loans  and  financial  liabilities  of  the  Sales  Financing segment (other than redeemable shares and subordinated loans) are considered as current assets and liabilities, because  they  are  used  in  this  operating segment's normal business cycle.\n\nFor the Automotive segment, in addition to items directly related  to  the  business  cycle,  all  assets  and  liabilities maturing within one year are classified as current.",

Translation of foreign companies' financial statements into the presentation currency and hyperinflation effects\n\n## Translation of the accounts of foreign companies\n\nThe Group's presentation currency is the euro.\n\nFor foreign companies,  the  functional  currency  is generally  the  local  currency.  In  cases  where  most transactions are carried out in a different currency, that is adopted as the functional currency.\n\nForeign  companies'  accounts  are  established  in  their functional currency and subsequently translated into the Group's presentation currency as follows:\n\n- \u25cf financial  position  items  other  than  components  of shareholders' equity, which are stated at historical value, are translated at the closing exchange rate;\n- \u25cf income statement items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period;\n- \u25cf the translation adjustment is one of the other components  of  comprehensive  income  and  therefore has no impact on net income.\n\nGoodwill  generated  by  a  business  combination  with  a foreign company is treated as an asset or liability of the entity  acquired,  as  appropriate.  It  is  therefore  expressed in the relevant entity's functional currency and translated into euros at the closing rate.\n\nWhen  a  foreign  company  is  sold,  the  accumulated translation  adjustments  on  its  assets  and  liabilities  are transferred  to  other  operating  income  and  expenses  in the income statement.\n\n## Hyperinflation\n\nTo  determine  whether  a  country  is  in  hyperinflation,  the Group  refers  to  the  list  published  by  the  International Practices Task Force (IPTF) of the Center for Audit Quality. The  financial  statements  of  entities  in  hyperinflationary economies  are  translated  in  accordance  with  IAS  29 'Financial  reporting  in  hyperinflationary  economies'. Non-monetary  balance  sheet  items,  income  statement items,  comprehensive  income  items  and  cash  flow statement items are adjusted for inflation in their original local  currency,  then  all  the  financial  statements  are translated  at  the  closing  exchange  rate  for  the  period. This hyperinflationary accounting leads to recognition of a  gain  or  loss  resulting  from  exposure  to  hyperinflation, which  is  classified  as  other  financial  income  and expenses and thus included in reserves the following year.\n\nThe  accounts  of  the  Group's  subsidiaries  in  Argentina  are consolidated  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  IAS  29, which have been applied since January 1, 2018. The effects of index-based restatement and translation of the shareholders'  equity  of  subsidiaries  in  Argentina  are  all included in the translation adjustment in other components of comprehensive income, since restatement based on price indexes is correlated with movements in the exchange rate between the  Argentinian  peso  and  the  euro  and  mitigates the effect of the peso's devaluation.\n\nThe  accounts  of  equity-accounted  companies  in  Turkey are  consolidated  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of IAS 29, applied from January 1, 2022.\n\n## 2-F. Translation of foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions  undertaken  in  a  currency  other  than  the functional  currency  of  the  entity  concerned  are  initially translated  to  and  recorded  in  the  functional  currency, using the rate applicable at the transaction date.\n\nFor  financial  reporting  purposes,  monetary  assets  and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency are  translated  at  the  closing  rate.  All  resulting  foreign exchange  differences  are  recognized  in  the  income statement, except for foreign exchange gains and losses on  financial  instruments  designated  as  hedges  of  a  net investment in a foreign entity (see Note 2-X).\n\nThe  following  impacts  are  therefore  recorded  in  net income:\n\n- \u25cf translation  adjustments  related  to  financial  operations by  the  Automotive  segment  are  included  in  the  net financial income;\n- \u25cf other  translation  adjustments  are  included  in  the operating income (operating margin in the information by operating segment).\n\nDerivatives  are  measured  and  recorded  as  described  in Note 2-X.\n\nI\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nFinancial statements",

Revenues and margin\n\nRevenues comprise all proceeds from sales of the Group's automotive goods, services related to these sales and the various  Sales  Financing  products  marketed  by  the Group's companies to their customers.\n\n## Sales of goods and services and associated costs of the Automotive segment\n\n## Sales and margin recognition\n\nSales  of  automotive  goods  are  recognized  at  the  date control  is  transferred.  The  transfer  of  control  over automotive goods takes place when the goods are made available  to  the  distribution  network  in  the  case  of  nonGroup dealers (at the time they are added to or removed from stock, depending on the contractual arrangements) or upon delivery to the end-user in the case of direct sales.\n\nHowever,  there  is  no  transfer  of  control  in  the  case  of goods sold under an operating lease by a Group finance company,  or  in  the  case  of  goods  sold  with  a  buy-back commitment if it is highly likely that they will be returned. In such  transactions,  the  revenues  are  recognized progressively  over  the  lease  period  and  a  used  vehicle sale  is  recorded  when  control  of  the  used  vehicle  is transferred. The difference between the price paid by the customer  and  the  buy-back  price  is  treated  as  rental income and spread over the period the automotive item is at  the  customer's  disposal.  The  production  cost  for  the new automotive item concerned is recorded in inventories for  contracts  of  less  than  one  year,  or  included  in property, plant and equipment under fixed assets leased to  customers  when  the  contracts  exceed  one  year.  The forecast  resale  value  takes  account  of  recent  known developments  on  the  second-hand  automotive  market but also future anticipated developments over the period in which the automotive goods will be sold, which may be influenced  by  factors  both  external  (economic  situation, taxation)  and  internal  (changes  in  the  range  or  the manufacturer's  pricing  strategy).  As  soon  as  a  loss  is expected on the resale, a provision (if the automotive item is in inventories)  or  additional  depreciation  (if  the automotive  item  is  included  in  property,  plant  and equipment) is recognized to cover the loss.\n\n## Sales incentive programs\n\nSales incentive programs based on the volumes or prices of products sold are deducted from sales when the sales operations  concerned  are  recorded.  Any  provisions  are based on estimates of the most probable amount.\n\nThe  Group  undertakes  certain  promotional  campaigns offering reduced-interest customer credit or discounts on services.  Because  these  are  sales  incentives,  the  cost  of these operations is recognized as a reduction in sales by the  Automotive  segment  when  the  vehicle  sale  takes place and is not spread over the duration of the financing or the services concerned.\n\n## Warranty\n\nThe  Group  makes  a  distinction  between  insurance-type warranties  and  service-type  warranties.  Provisions  are\n\nestablished for insurance-type warranties, while servicetype  warranties  give  rise  to  revenue  that  is  spread  over the duration of the warranty extension.\n\nThe estimated or incurred costs relating to manufacturer's  product  or  part  warranties  classified  as insurance-type warranties are charged to expenses when the  sales  are  recorded.  Provisions  for  costs  still  to  be borne are valued on the basis of observed data for each model and engine regarding the  level  of  costs  and  their distribution over the periods covered by the manufacturer's warranty. In the event of product recalls following incidents that come to light after the vehicle has been  put  on  the  market,  provisions  are  established  to cover  the  costs  involved  as  soon  as  the  decision  to undertake the recall campaign has been made. Amounts claimed  from  suppliers  are  deducted  from  the  warranty expense when it is considered practically certain they will be recovered.\n\n## Services related to sales of automotive products\n\nRevenues  from  service  contracts  sold  by  the  Group  are recognized  on  a  percentage-of-completion  basis.  These contracts may be for warranty extensions, maintenance or insurance.\n\nSuch service contracts may be sold separately to the final customer  or  included  free  of  charge  in  a  sale  package covering a vehicle and related services. In either case, the Group considers service contracts as a separate service obligation  from  delivery  of  the  vehicle  and  allocates  a portion of revenue to the service contract.\n\nWhen  the  customer  makes  regular  payments  for  the service contract, the revenue is recognized on a straightline  basis.  When  the  contract  is  prepaid  (for  example, when  it  is  paid  for  by  the  customer  at  the  time  of  the vehicle purchase), the amounts received are recorded as deferred  income  and  spread  over  the  duration  of  the contract, on a straight-line basis for warranty extensions and  following  an  experience  curve  for  maintenance contracts.\n\n## Impairment of customer receivables\n\nImpairment  is  booked  in  respect  of  the  Automotive segment's customer receivables to reflect the prospective assessment of the credit risk at the inception of  the  receivable  and  any  deterioration  of  that  risk  over time. When there is an incurred credit loss, impairment is recorded individually for each receivable.\n\n## Sales Financing revenues\n\n## Sales Financing revenues\n\nSales  Financing  revenues  are  generated  by  financing operations  for  sales  of  vehicles  to  dealers  and  end-users. These financing operations take the form of loans from the Sales Financing segment companies and are carried in the balance sheet at amortized cost under the effective interest rate method,  less  any  impairment.  Income  on  these contracts is calculated so as to give a constant interest rate over the period and is included in sales revenues.",

They mainly comprise interest incurred by sales financing  companies  to  refinance  their  customer  loan transactions, other costs and revenues directly related to administration  of  this  type  of  refinancing  (temporary investments, hedging and management of exchange and interest  rate  risks)  and  the  cost  of  risks  related  to receivables. Refinancing comes from diversified sources: public  and  private  bond  issues,  public  and  private securitization  backed  by  Automotive  segment  loans, negotiable  debt  instruments,  savings  collected  and financing  from  credit  institutions  and  assimilate  or  the European Central Bank.\n\n## Commissions payable to business intermediaries\n\nCommissions  are  treated  as  external  distribution  costs and  therefore  deferred  as  contract  acquisition  costs,  so as  to  give  a  constant  interest  rate  over  the  term  of  the financing contracts.\n\n## Classification and impairment of receivables\n\nThe impairment method for financial receivables depends  on  the  category  concerned.  For  healthy receivables  (stage  1),  impairment  is  equivalent  to  the 12-month  expected  credit  loss;  for  receivables  on  which the  credit  risk  has  significantly  deteriorated  since  initial recognition  or  which  received  extensions  during  the lockdown  (stage  2),  impairment  is  equivalent  to  the lifetime  expected  losses;  and  for  receivables  in  default (stage 3),  impairment is  equivalent  to  the  incurred  credit loss.\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  uses  an  internal  scoring system  or  external  ratings  to  identify  any  significant deterioration  in  the  credit  risk.  In  addition,  this  segment has  decided  to  use  the  assumptions  set  out  in  the standard and thus downgrades any receivable outstanding after 30 days to stage 2 and any receivable\n\n## 2-H. Financial income (expenses)\n\nThe cost of net financial indebtedness comprises the cost of  gross  financial  indebtedness  less  income  associated with  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  financial  assets  of  the Automotive  segment.  The  cost  of  gross  financial indebtedness consists of income and expenses generated by the Automotive segment's financial indebtedness  during  the  period,  including  the  impact  of the effective portion of the related interest rate hedges.\n\nOther  financial  income  and  expenses  mainly  include foreign exchange gains and losses on financial items and related  hedges,  the  gain  or  loss  caused  by  exposure  to hyperinflation (see Note 2-E), the net interest on provisions for pensions and dividends and impairment of companies that are neither controlled nor under significant influence by the Group.\n\n## 2-I. Income tax\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  deferred  taxes  for  all  temporary differences  between  the  tax  and  book  values  of  assets and  liabilities  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial position.  Deferred  taxes  are  calculated  at  the  latest  tax rate enacted at the closing date applicable to the period when temporary differences are reversed. Each individual fiscal  entity  (legal  entity,  establishment  or  group  of entities  that  pays  tax  to  the  tax  administration)  that  is\n\nauthorized  to  offset  its  current  tax  assets  and  liabilities reports deferred tax assets and liabilities net. Recognition of  deferred  tax  assets  depends  on  the  probability  of future recovery.\n\nFor  associates and joint ventures, a deferred tax liability on  dividend  distributions  is  booked  for  differences between the book value and tax value of shares held.\n\nI\n\nstill  outstanding  after  90  days  to  stage  3.  Receivables  in default  (stage  3)  are  identified  by  the  Sales  Financing segment  in  compliance  with  the  European  Banking Authority's EBA/GL/2016/07 guidelines. The Sales Financing  segment  has  opted  for  the  'one  step' approach, which consists of applying the new definition of default and adjusting its internal models concurrently for the Dealer portfolio and Customer portfolio.\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  refers  to  the  current recommendations  of  the  Basel  Committee  to  generate the  parameters  needed  to  calculate  the  probability  of default and the loss rates in the event of default on loans and  financing,  finance  lease  receivables,  irrevocable financing  commitments  and  financial  guarantees  given to  customers  and  dealers  in  its  principal  countries  of business  (Germany,  Brazil,  Spain,  France,  Italy  and  the United Kingdom for customer and dealer financing, Korea for customer financing only). For other assets, a standard approach based on a simplified methodology is applied.\n\nAs  the  assumptions  used  are  essentially  based  on observable market data, the calculation of impairment for expected  credit  losses  in  the  Sales  Financing  segment also incorporates forward-looking macro-economic data (GDP, long-term rates, etc) to reflect changes in indicators and sector-specific information.\n\n## Write-off rules\n\nThe  gross  book  value  of  a  financial  asset  is  written  off when there are no reasonable expectations of recovery. The  asset  is  derecognized  via  a  loss  account  and  the associated  impairment  is  reversed  when  the  nonrecoverability of receivables is confirmed, or at the latest when the Sales Financing segment's rights as creditor are extinguished. Examples of receivables that become nonrecoverable and are derecognized are waivers negotiated with customers (notably as part of a recovery plan), time-barred receivables, receivables concerned by an unfavorable legal judgement (when the outcome of a lawsuit or litigation is negative) and receivables owed by a customer that no longer exists",

Tax  credits  that  are  recoverable  regardless  of  whether the  company makes a taxable profit are set against the relevant nature of expense.\n\nTo  determine  the  provisions  for  uncertain  tax  liabilities, the Group uses a case-by-case method based on the most probable value. In view of their qualitative characteristics these  provisions  are  reported  on  specific  lines  in  the consolidated financial position.\n\n## 2-J. Goodwill\n\nNon-controlling  interests  (commonly  called  'minority interests')  are  carried  at  fair  value  (the  full  goodwill method)  or  at  their  share  in  the  fair  value  of  assets acquired  and  liabilities  transferred  (the  partial  goodwill method).  To  date  Renault  has  only  recognized  goodwill valued  under  the  partial  goodwill  method.  The  choice  of which method to use is made for each individual case.\n\nImpairment  tests  of  goodwill  are  carried  out  at  least annually  or  whenever  there  is  evidence  of  loss  of  value. After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment.\n\nGoodwill  relating  to  associates  and  joint  ventures  is included in the value of the entities concerned as reported in the assets in the statement of financial position. In the event  of  impairment,  an  impairment  loss  is  booked  and included  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  via  the share in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures.\n\nAcquisitions  of  additional  investments  concerning  noncontrolling interests in companies controlled by the Group are  treated  as  equity  transactions.  The  positive  or negative difference between the cost of acquiring shares and  the  book  value  of  the  non-controlling  interests acquired is recorded in shareholders' equity.\n\n## 2-K. Research and development expenses and other intangible assets\n\n## Research and development expenses\n\nDevelopment expenses incurred between the decision to begin  development  and  implement  production  facilities for  a  new  vehicle  or  component  (e.g.  engine  or  gearbox) and  the  subsequent  approval  of  the  design  for  mass production are capitalized as intangible assets. They are amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  from  the  date  of approval for production, over the expected market life of the vehicle or part, which is initially no longer than seven years. Market lives are regularly reviewed and subsequently adjusted if there is a significant difference from the initial estimate. Capitalized development expenses mainly comprise the cost of prototypes, the cost of studies invoiced by external firms, the cost of personnel assigned  to  the  project  and  a  share  of  overheads dedicated exclusively to development activities.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the development of  a  project  requiring  at  least  12  months  of  preparation before commissioning are included in the gross value of the asset, which is a 'qualifying asset'. The capitalization rate  for  borrowing  costs  is  limited  such  that  capitalized borrowing costs do not exceed the total borrowing costs borne during the year. When a project is financed through\n\na specific borrowing, the capitalization rate is equal to the interest rate on the borrowing.\n\nExpenses  incurred  before  the  decision  to  begin  product development are recorded as costs in the period they are incurred, in the same way as research expenses. Expenses incurred after the start of mass production are treated as production costs.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther  intangible  assets  comprise  patents,  leasehold rights,  intangible  business  assets,  licences,  software, brands and similar rights purchased by the Group. When they  have  a  finite  useful  life,  patents,  leasehold  rights, licences, brands  and  similar  rights  purchased  are amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  period  of protection stipulated by the contact or the law, or over the useful  life  if  shorter.  Intangible  business  assets  and softwares are amortized over their useful life. The useful life of intangible assets is generally between 3 and 5 years. Intangible  assets  with  an  indefinite  useful  life,  are subjected to an impairment test at least once a year and when there is any indication of impairment.",

Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets\n\nThe  gross  value  of  property,  plant  and  equipment corresponds to historical acquisition or production cost.\n\nDesign  and  preparation  expenses  are  included  in  the asset's production cost.\n\nThe  production  cost  for  property,  plant  and  equipment also includes financing costs borne during the construction  phase,  under  the  same  method  as  for intangible  assets.  When  a  project  is  financed  through  a specific borrowing, the capitalization rate is equal to the interest rate on the borrowing.\n\nInvestment  subsidies  received  are,  where  relevant, presented  as  a  deduction  from  the  gross  value  of  the assets concerned.\n\nSubsequent expenses for property, plant and equipment, except those incurred to increase productivity or prolong the life of an asset, are charged to expenses as incurred.\n\nAssets  leased  to  customers  include  vehicles  leased  for more than one year from a Group finance company with a buy-back  commitment  by  the  Group  and  vehicles  sold under an agreement including a clause for buy-back after a  minimum one year of use.  Assets  leased  to  customers also include vehicles covered by operating leases longer than  one  year  from  Group  finance  companies  and batteries leased to electric vehicle users by Group finance companies (see Note 2-G).\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group's leases are essentially for real estate property.\n\nA contract contains a lease if it gives the lessee the right to use an identified asset for a specified period of time in exchange for payment.\n\nAt the contract's commencement  date,  a  lessee recognizes  an  asset  related  to  the  right  of  use  and  a financial liability that represents the lease obligation. The right-of-use asset is amortized over the estimated term of the  lease.  The  lease  liability  is  initially  recognized  at  the present value of lease payments over the expected term of  the  lease.  The  discount  is  unwound  using  the  implicit interest  rate  of  the  lease  agreement  if  it  can  be  readily determined,  or  at  the  incremental  borrowing  rate otherwise. The incremental borrowing rate, calculated for each  monetary  zone,  corresponds  to  the  risk-free  rate applicable  in  the  zone  plus  the  Group's  risk  premium applicable for the local currency. In the income statement, amortization  of  the  right-of-use  asset  is  recorded  in  the operating income (operating margin in the information by operating segment) and a financial expense corresponding  to  the  interest  on  the  lease  liability  is recorded  in  financial  income  and  expenses.  The  tax impact of this consolidation adjustment is recognized via deferred  taxes.  In  the  cash  flow  statement,  cash  flows from  operating  activities  are  impacted  by  interest\n\nexpenses  paid  and  cash  flows  from  financing  activities are impacted by the reimbursed lease liability.\n\nSubsequently, the right-of-use asset is regularly reduced by  impairment  where  relevant  (if  impairment  tests  are conducted  under  the  principles  presented  in  Note  2-N) and  adjusted  on  the  basis  of  certain  corresponding restatements of the lease obligation.\n\nLease payments on short-term leases (12 months or less) and leases  of  low-value  assets  are  treated  as  operating expenses.\n\nThe  term  of  the  lease  is  the  non-cancellable  period  of  a lease contract during which the lessee has the right to use the  leased  asset,  extended  by  any  renewal  options  the Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise.  For  French commercial  leases,  the  lease  term  is  generally  9  years. Lease  term  estimation  and  consideration  of  extension and termination options is conducted with the help of the real estate department, considering the types of site and their development plans.\n\nWhen  a  lease  is  renegotiated  to  shorten  the  term  or reduce  the  space  leased,  the  Group  recognizes  the reassessment of the lease obligation and the gain or loss resulting from the partial termination is recognized in the operating income (other operating income and expenses). When the Group revises the exercise value of a purchase, extension or termination option (for example by applying early termination clauses), a corresponding adjustment is made to the book value of the right-of-use asset.\n\nImprovements  to  leased  buildings  are  depreciated  over  a duration that is equal to or shorter than the lease term used to estimate  the  lease  liability  (if  the  lessee  has  neither  the intention nor the ability to use them for a longer period).\n\nWhen  a  lease  contract  contains  a  purchase  option  the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, it is in substance a purchase rather than a lease. The corresponding liability is  considered as a financial liability under IFRS 9 and the asset as a tangible asset in compliance with IAS 16.\n\nProvisions for repairs required contractually by lessors are recognized at the start of the lease, with a corresponding tangible asset.\n\n## Sale and leaseback operations\n\nIn  application  of  IFRS  16,  for  a  sale  and  leaseback operation, reference is made to the requirements of IFRS 15  to  determine  whether the transfer of the asset should be treated as a sale or a financing operation.\n\nIf  the  transfer  of  an  asset  does  not  qualify  under  IFRS  15  for recognition  as  a  sale,  the  asset  transferred  remains  in  the assets  reported  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  and  a financial  liability  equal  to  the  proceeds  of  the  transfer  is recognized.\n\nI\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nFinancial statements",

Impairment\n\n## Impairment of fixed assets\n\nFixed assets are subjected to impairment tests as soon as there  is  any  indication  of  a  loss  of  value,  such  as significant  adverse  changes  in  the  market  in  which  the company operates, or changes affecting the circumstances and manner of use of the assets.\n\nFor the Automotive segment , impairment tests are carried out at two levels:\n\n## At the level of vehicle-specific assets (including components)\n\nVehicle-specific assets (including components) consist of capitalized development expenses and tools. Impairment tests are carried out by comparing the net book value of the  assets  with  the  recoverable  value,  calculated  based on discounted future cash flows related to the vehicle and its  components.  These  assets  may  be  specific  to  the model and/or the country of destination.\n\n## At the level of cash-generating units\n\nA  cash-generating  unit  is  defined  as  a  coherent  subset that  generates  largely  independent  cash  flows.  Cashgenerating units may represent an economic entity (plant or subsidiary) or the whole Automotive segment. Net fixed assets  related  to  cash-generating  units  notably  include goodwill, specific assets  and  capacity  assets  and components of working capital.\n\nFor  each  of  the  two  levels,  impairment  tests  are  carried out by comparing the net book value with the recoverable value. Recoverable value is defined as the higher of value in use or fair value less selling costs.\n\nValue in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows  expected  to  arise  from  the  use  of  an  asset.  Future cash  flows  derive  from  the  business  plan  drawn  up  and validated  by  the  Management,  plus  a  terminal  value based  on  discounted  normative  cash  flows  after application of a growth rate to infinity. They also include a bonus  ('excess  earnings')  paid  to  the  Automotive segment  for  business  referrals  to  the  Sales  Financing segment.  The  assumptions  underlying  the  business  plan include estimates of market developments in countries in which the Group operates and its share of those markets,\n\n| Buildings  (1)                                      | 15 to 30 years   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Specific tools                                      | 2 to 7 years     |\n| Machinery and other tools (other than press  lines) | 5 to 15 years    |\n| Press lines, stamping and painting  installations   | 20 to 30 years   |\n| Other tangible assets  (2)                          | 4 to 6 years     |\n\n- (1) Buildings in use before 1987 are depreciated over a period of up to 40 years.\n- (2) Except for leased batteries, which are depreciated over periods of 8 to 10 years depending on the models.\n\nUseful  lives  are  regularly  reviewed  and  accelerated depreciation  is  recorded  when  an  asset's  useful  life becomes shorter than the initially expected period of use, particularly  when  it  is  decided  to  withdraw  a  vehicle  or component from the market.\n\nchanges  in  the  sale  price  of  products  and  the  prices  of purchased  components  and  commodities.  The  pre-tax discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital as determined by the company.\n\nWhen  the  recoverable  value  is  lower  than  the  net  book value, impairment equivalent to the difference is recorded against the assets concerned.\n\nFor  the Sales  Financing  segment ,  an  impairment  test  is carried  out  at  least  once  a  year  or  whenever  there  is  an indication  of  loss  of  value,  by  comparing  the  book  value and  recoverable  value  of  assets.  Recoverable  value  is defined as the higher of fair value (less selling costs) and value  in  use.  The  value  in  use  is  based  on  a  market approach, determined by using multiples for each group of  cash-generating  units  made  up  of  legal  entities  or groups of legal entities in the same country.\n\n## Impairment of investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nImpairment tests of the value of investments in associates and joint ventures are carried out as soon as there is any indication  of  a  loss  of  value,  essentially  significant adverse  changes  in  the  markets  in  which  the  company operates, or a major or long-term decline in stock market value.\n\nImpairment tests are carried out in compliance with IAS 28 and  IAS  36,  by  comparing  the  book  value  of  the investment  in  the  associate  or  joint  venture  with  the recoverable value, which is the higher of value in use and fair value, less selling costs. The value in use is equal to the share of the present value of future estimated cash flows expected by the associate or joint venture. If the associate or  joint  venture is listed, the fair value is its stock market value.\n\nWhen the recoverable value is lower than the book value, impairment  equivalent  to  the  difference  is  recorded against  the  relevant  investment  in  an  associate  or  joint venture and included in the Group's income statement via the  share  in  net  income  (loss)  of  associates  and  joint ventures.",

Non-current assets or groups of assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale are non-current assets or  groups  of  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  available  for immediate  sale  and  are  highly  likely  to  be  sold  within twelve months due to advanced discussions with a known buyer.\n\nAssets and groups of assets and liabilities held for sale are presented  separately  in  the  statement  of  consolidated financial  position,  in  accordance  with  IFRS  5.  They  are stated at the lower of net book value and fair value less selling  costs.  No  further  depreciation  or  amortization  is recorded on non-current assets that are classified as held\n\n## 2-O. Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost corresponds to acquisition cost or production cost, which  includes  direct  and  indirect  production expenses  and  a  share  of  manufacturing  overheads, based on a forecast level of activity and the results of any related hedges. The level of activity is forecast site by site, in  order  to  determine  the  share  of  fixed  costs  to  be excluded if the actual level of activity is lower.\n\nfor sale (or included in a group of assets and liabilities held for sale).\n\nDiscontinued  operations,  as  defined  by  IFRS  5  -  Noncurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, are activities or geographical zones that are significant to the  Group  and  are  in  the  process  of  being  sold  or  are classified  as  assets  held  for  sale.  The  income  statement and  cash  flow  statement  items  relating  to  discontinued operations  are  presented  on  specific  lines  in  the consolidated  financial  statements  for  all  the  periods presented.\n\nInventories  of  the  Automotive  segment  and  the  Sales Financing segment are valued under the FIFO (First In First Out) method.\n\nWhen the net realizable value is lower than the financial position  value,  impairment  equal  to  the  difference  is recorded.\n\n## 2-P. Assignment of receivables and reverse factoring\n\nReceivables assigned to third parties (through securitization, discounting,  or  factoring)  are  removed  from  Group  assets when the associated risks and benefits are also substantially transferred to the third parties in question. Risk analysis  principally  concerns  the  credit  risk,  the  risk  of  late payment and the country risk. The same rule applies in the Automotive segment and the Sales Financing segment.\n\nThe Automotive segment sometimes uses reverse-factoring programs.  These  programs  can  be  used  to  support  a supplier,  or  to  benefit  the  Group  by  extending  payment deadlines.  In  the  first  case,  the  liability  continues  to  be considered as part of the operating cycle and the amounts concerned remain in trade payables in the financial position.\n\n## 2-Q. Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares are shares held for the purposes of stock option plans, performance share plans, other share-based payment arrangements and the liquidity contract.\n\nIn the second case, if the reverse factoring contract includes an  unconditional  commitment  by  the  Group  to  pay  the amount initially due to the supplier to the financial institution that  is  a  party  to  the  contract,  the  liability  is  no  longer considered as part of the operating cycle and the amounts concerned are reclassified as financial liabilities (this has no impact  on  the  cash  flow  statement  at  the  reclassification date). If the contract is considered as a financial liability and covers  a  financing  requirement  for  the  group  subsidiary involved,  the  repayments  to  financial  institutions  impact cash  flows  from  financing  activities  in  the  cash  flow statement; otherwise, they are included in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nThey are recorded at acquisition cost and deducted from Group shareholders' equity until the date of sale.\n\nI",

Performance share plans attribution plans and other share-based payment agreements\n\nThe Group awards performance shares and other sharebased payments made in Renault shares. The grant date is  the  date  at  which  beneficiaries  are  informed  of  the decision to award shares and the terms of the share plan. For plans subject to performance conditions, an estimate of achievement of the conditions is taken into account in determining  the  number  of  shares  distributed.  This estimate  is  reviewed  annually  based  on  changes  in  the probability  of  performance  condition  achievement.  The final fair value  of  services  rendered  in  return  for performance shares is measured by reference to the fair value of those shares at their grant date. Entitlements to performance shares are valued based on the share value\n\nat  the  grant  date  less  dividends  expected  during  the vesting period. The share price volatility factor applied is implicit volatility at the grant date. The expected dividend is determined  by  reference  to  the  dividend  payout schedule announced at the time each plan is valued.\n\nThe total fair value calculated in this way is spread on a straight-line  basis  over  the  entire  vesting  period.  This expense  is  included  in  personnel  expenses,  with  a corresponding  adjustment  to  consolidated  reserves. When  the  performance  shares  vest,  the  cash  amount received by the Group in settlement of the exercise price is booked in cash and cash equivalents, with a corresponding adjustment to consolidated reserves.\n\n## 2-S. Pensions and other long-term employee benefit obligations\n\nThe  Group's  payments  for  defined-contribution  benefit plans are recorded as expenses for the relevant period.\n\nFor defined-benefit plans concerning post-employment benefits,  the  Group  uses  the  Projected  Unit  Credit  Method  to determine  the  present  value  of  its  obligations.  Under  this method, benefits are attributed to periods of service according to the plan's benefit formula, principally on a straight-line basis over the years of service that earn benefit entitlements.\n\nThe future payments for employee benefits are measured on  the  basis  of  future  salary  increases,  retirement  age, mortality  and  length  of  employment  with  the  company and are discounted at a rate determined by reference to yields  on  long-term  high  quality  corporate  bonds  of  a\n\n## 2-T.

Financial assets and receivables of the Sales Financing segment\n\nThe Group recognizes a financial asset when it becomes a party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of  a  financial instrument.\n\nFinancial  assets  comprise  investments  in  non-controlled companies in which Renault does not exercise significant influence, marketable securities, negotiable debt instruments,  loans  and  derivative  assets  related  to financial transactions (see Note 2-X).\n\nThese  instruments  are  presented  as  non-current  assets, apart from those maturing within 12 months of the closing date, which are classified as current assets.\n\n## Investments in non-controlled companies in which Renault does not have significant influence\n\nInvestments  in non-controlled companies  in  which Renault does not have significant influence are classified as equity instruments at fair value through profit and loss. The fair values of such financial assets are determined in priority  by  reference  to  the  market  price.  If  this  is  not possible,  the  Group  uses  a  valuation  method  that  is  not based on market data.\n\n## 2-V. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash includes cash on hand, current accounts and other demand deposits, with the exception of bank overdrafts, which are included in financial liabilities.\n\nCash equivalents are investments held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments. For an investment  to  qualify  as  a  cash  equivalent,  it  must  be considered  as  liquid,  be  readily  convertible  for  a  known amount of cash and be subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## Marketable securities and negotiable debt instruments\n\nShort-term  investments  in  the  form  of  marketable securities and negotiable debt instruments are undertaken for the management of cash surpluses, but do not meet the requirements to qualify as cash equivalents. These are debt instruments carried at fair value through other  components of comprehensive income, except for shares  in  investment  funds  (UCITS)  which  are  carried  at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nImpairment  equivalent  to  expected  credit  losses  is booked  upon  initial  recognition  of  debt  instruments carried  at  fair  value  through  other  components  of comprehensive income.\n\n## Loans\n\nLoans  essentially  include  loans  for  investment  of  cash surpluses and loans to associates.\n\nLoans are carried at amortized cost. Impairment equivalent  to  expected  credit  losses  is  recognized  upon initial recognition of the financial asset and when there is objective  evidence  of  loss  of  value  caused  by  an  event arising after the initial recognition.\n\nThese instruments are stated at amortized cost except for shares  in  investment  funds  (UCITS)  which  are  carried  at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nBank  accounts  subject  to  restrictions  due  to  sectorspecific  regulations  (for  example,  banking  or  insurance regulations)  or  bank  accounts  allocated  to  increasing credit on securitized receivables are included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## 2-W. Financial liabilities of the Automotive segment and Sales Financing debts\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  a  financial  liability  (for  the Automotive  segment)  or  a  Sales  Financing  debt  when  it becomes  a  party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of  a financial instrument.\n\nFinancial  liabilities  and  Sales  Financing  debts  comprise redeemable  shares,  subordinated  debt,  bonds,  other debts represented by a certificate, borrowings from credit institutions,  lease  liabilities  (see  Note  2-L),  other  interestbearing  borrowings  and  derivative  liabilities  related  to financial transactions (see Note 2-X).\n\nRedeemable shares of the Automotive segment are listed subordinated debt instruments that earn a variable return indexed  on  consolidated  revenues.  They  are  carried  at amortized  cost,  determined  by  discounting  forecast\n\ncoupons using the effective  interest  rate  on  borrowings. The  estimated  effective  interest  rate  takes  account  of indexation  and  the  amortized  cost  recorded  in  financial result is re-estimated when there is a significant change in future  sales  prospects,  particularly  when  medium-term business plans are released.\n\nFinancial  liabilities  not  concerned  by  specific  hedge accounting  methods  (see  Note  2-X)  are  generally recorded  at  amortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest rate  method.    financial  expense  calculated  in  this  way includes issuance expenses and issuance or redemption premiums, together with the impact of debt renegotiations  when  the  old  and  new  terms  are  not substantially different.\n\nI",

Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\n## Measurement and presentation\n\nDerivatives are initially stated at fair value. This fair value is subsequently reviewed at each closing date.\n\n- \u25cf The  fair  value  of  forward  exchange  contracts  and currency  swaps  is  determined  by  discounting  future cash flows,  using  closing-date  market  rates  (exchange and interest rates).\n- \u25cf The fair value of interest rate derivatives is the amount the  Group  would  receive  (or  pay)  to  settle  outstanding contracts  at  the  closing  date,  taking  into  account interest  rates  forward  curves  and  the  quality  of  the counterparty to each contract at the closing date. This fair value includes accrued interest.\n- \u25cf The  fair  value  of  commodity  derivatives  is  based  on market conditions.\n\nThe Automotive segment's derivatives are reported in the financial  position  as  current  if  they  mature  within 12 months and non-current otherwise. All Sales Financing segment derivatives are reported in the financial position as current.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe  treatment  of  derivatives  designated  as  hedging instruments depends on the type of hedging relationship:\n\n- \u25cf fair value hedge;\n- \u25cf cash flow hedge;\n- \u25cf hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nThe  Group  identifies  the  hedging  instrument  and  the hedged  item  as  soon  as  the  hedge  is  set  up  and documents the hedging relationship, stating the hedging strategy, the risk hedged and the method used to assess the  hedge's  effectiveness.  The  Sales  Financing  segment documents hedging relationships concerning one or more homogeneous items to cover its risks. This documentation  is  subsequently  updated  such  that  the effectiveness of the designated hedge can be demonstrated.\n\nHedge  accounting  uses  specific  measurement  and recognition methods for each category of hedge.\n\n- \u25cf Fair  value  hedges:  the  hedged  item  is  adjusted  to  fair value up to the risk hedged and the hedging instrument is  recorded at fair value. As changes in these items are recorded in the income statement simultaneously, only the ineffective portion of the hedge has an impact on net income.  It  is  recorded  in  the  same  income  statement item as changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n- \u25cf Cash flow hedges: no adjustment is made to the value of the hedged item; only the hedging instrument is adjusted to fair value. Following this adjustment, the effective portion of the change  in  fair  value  attributable  to  the  hedged  risk  is recorded, net of taxes, in other components of comprehensive  income,  while  the  ineffective  portion  is included in net income. The cumulative amount included in shareholders' equity is transferred to the income statement when the hedged item has an impact on net income.\n- \u25cf Hedge  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation:  the hedging  instrument  is  adjusted  to  fair  value.  Following this  adjustment,  the  effective  portion  of  the  change  in fair  value  attributable  to  the  hedged  exchange  risk  is recorded, net of taxes, in other components  of comprehensive  income,  while  the  ineffective  portion  is included in net income. The cumulative amount included in  shareholders'  equity  is  transferred  to  net  income  at the  date  of  liquidation  or  sale  of  the  investment.  The interest  rate  component  of  borrowings  in  yen  used  to hedge  the  investment  in  Nissan  is  considered  as  the ineffective portion and is therefore recorded directly in financial income and expenses.\n\n## Derivatives not designated as hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges  are  recognized  directly  in  financial  income, except in the case of derivatives entered into exclusively for reasons closely related to business operations. In this case, changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in the operating  income  (operating  margin  in  the information by operating segment).",

Changes in the scope of consolidation\n\n## Automotive\n\n- \u25cf Starting from the first half-year of 2022, the Group fully consolidates the Turkish-based company Renault Group Otomotiv  A.S.,  which  was  set  up  at  the  end  of  2021  for new  industrial  and  commercial  projects  and  is  fullyowned by Renault.\n- \u25cf In  March  2022  the  Group  acquired  a  13.7%  stake  in BeyonCa  HK  Limited,  a  company  in  which  it  exercises significant influence, for the price of \u20ac18 million followed by  a  \u20ac29  million  capital  increase.  This  company  is accounted for under the equity method.\n- \u25cf On  15  May  2022  the  Group  sold  its  subsidiary  Renault Russia to the city of Moscow and its 67.69% investment in Avtovaz to NAMI (the Central Research and Development Automobile and Engine Institute), each for the  sale  price  of  one  rouble.  The  sale  agreement  gives Renault  Group  an  option  to  buy  back  its  investment, which can be exercised during certain periods over the next six years.  The contribution made by these entities is presented under discontinued operations, in accordance  with  IFRS  5.  The  accounting  effects  are described in Note 3-B below.\n- \u25cf In  May  2022,  the  Group  sold  the  distribution  company Renault  Nordic  AB,  which  operates  in  the  Swedish  and Danish  markets,  for  the  price  of  \u20ac37  million  of  which \u20ac14 million will be paid over the next five years.\n- \u25cf In  September  2022,  the  Group  sold  the  distribution companies Renault Nissan Slovenija and Renault Nissan Croatia,  for  the  price  of  \u20ac9  million  and  \u20ac7  million respectively.\n\n## 3-B. Discontinued operations\n\nOn  March  23,  2022,  Renault  Group  announced  the suspension of Renault Russia's activities  and  said  it  was assessing  the  available  options  for  its  investment  in Avtovaz. The Group stated that impairment of its tangible and intangible assets and goodwill in Russia, estimated at \u20ac2,195 million at December 31, 2022, would be recognized during the first half-year of 2022. A press release of 12 May 2022 confirmed that this impairment had been booked at March 31, 2022. It was then announced on May 16, 2022 that agreements had been signed to sell 100% of the shares in Renault Russia to the city of Moscow and the 67.69% stake in Lada Auto Holding (the parent company of Avtovaz) to NAMI (the Central Research and Development Automobile\n\n- \u25cf In October 2022, the Group sold the distribution company Renault Hungaria Kft which operates on the Hungarian market,  for  the  sale  price  of  \u20ac16  million,  \u20ac3  million  of which will be paid in instalments over the next five years.\n- \u25cf In November 2022, the Group sold its entire investment in its French  subsidiary  Fonderie  de  Bretagne  to  the German  group  Callista  GmbH.  Under  the  terms  of  the sale,  which  took  place  for  the  symbolic  price  of  \u20ac1, Renault Group gave a commitment to provide \u20ac57 million funding for a secure recovery plan.\n- \u25cf In November 2022, RKM, a Korean subsidiary owned 80% by the Group, undertook a 34% capital increase for the Geely Group in exchange for the simultaneous acquisition of a technological licence from Geely for the same  amount,  i.e.  264  billion  won  (approximately  \u20ac194 million). Renault Group's percentage interest in RKM was 53% at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Sales Financing\n\n- \u25cf The  Group  finalized  determination  of  the  fair  value  of assets  acquired  and  liabilities  transferred  from  BI-PI Mobility  SL  and  its  subsidiaries,  of  which  it  purchased 100%  in  July  2021  for  the  price  of  \u20ac67  million.  This company  specializes  in  flexible  vehicle  rentals.  The principal adjustments concern the brand, recognized at the value of \u20ac8 million and the technology, recognized at the value of \u20ac5 million. The final goodwill is calculated at  \u20ac59  million.  BI-PI  Mobility  SL  also  formed  two  new subsidiaries in the UK and the Netherlands in 2022, BI-PI Mobility  UK  Ltd  and  BI-PI  Mobility  Netherlands,  both fully-owned and fully-consolidated.\n\nand  Engine  Institute).  This  led  to  deconsolidation  of Renault  Russia  and  the  Avtovaz  Group  during  the  first half-year of 2022.\n\nThe table below provides details of the income statement for  these  discontinued  operations  from  January  1  to April  30,  2022,  together  with  the  gain  on  the  sale  of  the shares in Renault Russia and Lada Auto Holding and the effects of the sale (debt waiver, impairment of dedicated inventories,  repayment  of  some  of  the  financial  debt  of Renault Russia, etc).\n\nAs the sales and operating margin of Renault Russia and Avtovaz  were  not  material  between  May  1  and  May  15,\n\nI",

The statement of consolidated comprehensive  net  income  and  the  statement  of consolidated  cash  flows  for  2021,  have  been  adjusted accordingly.\n\n## 3-C. Non-current assets (liabilities) held for sale\n\nAt  the  Capital  Market Day on November 8, 2022, Renault Group announced  the signature of a framework agreement  with  the  Geely  Group  for  creation  of  a  new worldwide entity to develop, manufacture and supply lowemission hybrid engines and powertrains. The framework agreement  stipulates  that  Renault  Group  and  Geely  will each  hold  50%  of  the  shares  in  this  new  venture.  The assets and liabilities held for sale, collectively referred to as Horse below, will be deconsolidated in the second halfyear of 2023.\n\nIn  application  of  its  strategic  plan  'Renaulution',  the Group has started to sell certain real estate assets (land, industrial sites), branches  (in France) and vehicle distribution subsidiaries (outside France).\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  the  group  of  assets  held  for  sale consists of \u20ac3,861 million of assets and \u20ac(873) million of debts and other liabilities.  The variation in these amounts between December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, i.e. a \u20ac3,732 million increase in assets held for sale and a \u20ac(691) million increase in  the  associated  liabilities,  is  mainly  explained  by  the reclassification  of  'Horse'  project  assets  and  liabilities  in preparation  for  the  new  joint  venture  dedicated  to  hybrid and thermal powertrains (see Note 2-B). The Group stopped recording  amortization  on  these  tangible  and  intangible assets from November  8, 2022, the date of their reclassification as assets held for sale.\n\nThe reclassification of these assets held for sale and the associated  liabilities  is  reflected  in  other  changes  in  the relevant notes.\n\n|                                                        | December   | Increase Decrease   | Increase Decrease   | Increase Decrease   | December   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|\n| (\u20ac million)                                            | 31, 2021   | Including Horse     | Including Horse     | Including Horse     | 31, 2022   |\n| Intangible assets and goodwill                         | 8          | 795                 | 795                 | (8)                 | 795        |\n| Tangible assets                                        | 42         | 2,522               | 2,166               | (27)                | 2,537      |\n| Inventories                                            | 21         | 418                 | 338                 | (21)                | 418        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                              | 15         | 23                  | 8                   | (15)                | 23         |\n| Other                                                  | 43         | 88                  | 71                  | (43)                | 88         |\n| TOTAL ASSETS HELD FOR SALE                             | 129        | 3,846               | 3,378               | (114)               | 3,861      |\n| TOTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS HELD FOR SALE | (182)      | (872)               | (841)               | 181                 | (873)      |",

Impairment tests on vehicle-specific assets (including components) and the assets of certain entities\n\nFollowing  impairment  tests  of  specific  assets  dedicated to vehicles (including components) and assets belonging to  certain  entities,  impairment  of  \u20ac(246)  million  was booked  during  2022  (\u20ac(78)  million  in  2021),  comprising \u20ac(41) million for intangible assets (\u20ac(48) million in 2021) and\n\n\u20ac(205) million for property, plant and equipment (\u20ac(30) million in 2021).\n\nA further \u20ac(71) million of impairment was also recognized in 2021, notably after decisions to discontinue production or terminate leases.\n\n## 11-B. Impairment test of the Automotive segment cash-generating unit\n\nThe recoverable value used for the purpose of impairment tests  for  the  Automotive  segment  is  the  value  in  use,\n\ndetermined  under  the  discounted  future  cash  flow method on the basis of the following assumptions:\n\n|                         | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Growth rate to infinity | 1.0%                | 1.0%                |\n| After-tax discount rate | 11.6%               | 8.9%                |\n\nThe assumptions used for impairment testing at December  31,  2022  are  derived  from  the  medium-term plan  for  the  period  2021-2025,  which  was  presented  in January 2021 and updated in late 2022. They incorporate assumptions  concerning  the  negative  effects  of  the electronic components  supply  crisis, inflation and increasing climate risks.\n\nThe  growth  rates  to  infinity  used  in  the  tests  at December  31,  2022  and  2021  include  the  impacts  of commitments made by the States that are signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nAt  December 31, 2022, no impairment was recognized on assets  of  the  Automotive  segment  as  a  result  of  the impairment test and it was considered that a reasonably possible change in the main assumptions used should not result in a recoverable value lower than the book value of the assets tested.\n\nThe recoverable value of the assets tested would remain higher  than  the  book  value  in  the  event  of  the  following changes in those assumptions:\n\n- \u25cf a growth rate to infinity of 0%;\n- \u25cf an after-tax discount rate of 12.5%.\n\nI",

Nissan consolidation method\n\nRenault Group and the Japanese automakers Nissan and Mitsubishi have developed an alliance between their three distinct companies with common interests, uniting forces to achieve  optimum  performance.  The  Alliance  is organized  so  as  to  preserve  individual  brand  identities and respect each company's corporate culture.\n\n## Consequently:\n\n- \u25cf Renault Group is not assured of holding the majority of voting rights in Nissan's Shareholders' Meeting.\n- \u25cf The terms of the Renault Group-Nissan agreements do not  entitle  Renault  Group  to  appoint  the  majority  of Nissan directors, nor to hold the majority of voting rights at  meetings  of  Nissan's  Board  of  Directors;  Renault Group  cannot  unilaterally  appoint  the  President  of Nissan.\n- \u25cf In  March  2019,  Renault  Group,  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi announced the creation  of  the  new  Alliance  Operating Board  (AOB)  which  oversees  Alliance  operations  and governance.  The  Alliance  Operating  Board  consists  of\n\nthe  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Renault  Group,  the  Chief Executive Officer of Renault Group, the Chief Executive Officer  of  Nissan  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Mitsubishi Motors. Orientations are taken by consensus. In  November  2019,  the  AOB  appointed  an  Alliance Secretary General, who reports to the AOB and the CEOs of the three alliance companies.\n\n- \u25cf At December 31, 2022, Renault Group occupied two seats on Nissan's Board of Directors and was represented by Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of the Renault Group Board and Pierre Fleuriot, Lead Director in Renault Group.\n- \u25cf Renault Group can neither use nor influence the use of Nissan's assets in the same way as its own assets.\n- \u25cf Renault  Group  provides  no  guarantees  in  respect  of Nissan's debt.\n\nIn  view  of  this  situation,  Renault  Group  is  considered  to exercise  significant  influence  over  Nissan  and  therefore uses the equity method to include its investment in Nissan in the consolidation.\n\n## 12-B. Nissan consolidated financial statements included under the equity method in the Renault Group consolidation\n\nThe Nissan accounts included under the equity method in Renault Group's financial statements  are Nissan's consolidated  accounts  published  in  compliance  with Japanese accounting standards (as Nissan is listed on the Tokyo  Stock  Exchange),  after  adjustments  for  the requirements of the Renault Group consolidation.\n\nNissan publishes consolidated financial statements quarterly and annually at March 31. For the purposes of the Renault Group consolidation, Nissan results are included\n\nin line with the Renault Group calendar (the results for the period January to December are consolidated in Renault Group's annual financial statements).\n\nNissan held 0.6% of its own treasury shares at December 31, 2022  (0.6%  at  December  31,  2021).  Consequently, Renault SA's percentage interest in Nissan is 43.7% (43.7% at  December  31,  2021).  Renault  SA  holds  43.7%  of  voting rights in Nissan  at  September  30,  2022  (43.7%  at September 30, 2021).",

Hedging of the investment in Nissan\n\nThe  Group  has  partially  hedged  the  yen/euro  exchange risk  on  its  investment  in  Nissan  since  1999.  Details  of  this hedge are given in Note 25-B2.\n\nAt December  31,  2022,  the  corresponding  hedging operations totalled \u00a5199.9 billion (\u20ac1,421 million) of private\n\nplacements  in  bonds  issued  directly  in  yen  on  the Japanese Samurai bond market.\n\nIn 2022  foreign  exchange  differences  generated  an unfavorable  effect  of  \u20ac25  million  (favorable  effect  of \u20ac4 million in 2021).\n\n## 12-H. Valuation of Renault Group's investment in Nissan at stock market prices\n\nBased  on  the  quoted  price  at  December  31,  2022  of  \u00a5418 per share, Renault Group's investment in Nissan is valued\n\nat \u20ac5,444 million (\u20ac7,812 million at December 31, 2021 based on the price of \u00a5556 per share).\n\n## 12-I. Impairment test of the investment in Nissan\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  the  stock  market  value  of  the investment  was  68.9%  lower  than  the  value  of  Nissan  in Renault Group's statement of financial position (51.9% at December 31, 2021).\n\nIn  application  of  the  approach  presented  in  the  note  on accounting policies, an impairment test was carried out at December  31,  2022.  An  after-tax  discount  rate  of  7.73% and  a  growth  rate  to  infinity  (including  the  effect  of inflation) of 1.42% were used to calculate value in use. The terminal value was calculated under profitability assumptions  consistent  with  Nissan's  past  data  and conservative medium and long-term prospects,\n\nincorporating  new  medium-term  forecasts  for  volumes and exchange rates.\n\nThe  test  result  did  not  lead  to  recognition  of  any impairment on the investment in Nissan at December 31, 2022,  and  it  is  considered  that  a  reasonably  possible change in the main assumptions used should not result in a  recoverable  value  lower  than  the  book  value  of  the investment in Nissan.\n\nThe same  conclusion was reached following the impairment test performed at December 31, 2021, applying an after-tax discount rate of 6.53% and a growth rate to infinity (including the effect of inflation) of 1.47%.\n\n## 12-J. Operations between Renault Group and the Nissan Group\n\nRenault  Group  and  Nissan  follow  joint  strategies  for vehicle and component development, purchasing, production and distribution resources. This cooperation is reflected in synergies that reduce costs.\n\nThe  Automotive  segment  is  involved  in  operations  with Nissan on two levels:\n\n- \u25cf Industrial  production:  cross-over  production of vehicles and components in the Alliance's manufacturing plants:\n- -sales  by  Renault  Group  to  the  Nissan  group  in  2022 totalled  approximately \u20ac2,015 million (\u20ac1,763 million  in 2021),  comprising  around  \u20ac1,443  million  for  vehicles (\u20ac1,065  million  in  2021),  \u20ac427  million  for  components (\u20ac579  million  in  2021),  and  \u20ac145  million  for  services (\u20ac119 million in 2021);\n- -purchases by Renault Group from the Nissan group in 2022 totalled approximately \u20ac1,564 million (\u20ac1,559 million in2021), comprising around \u20ac1,200 million of  vehicles  (\u20ac1,206  million  in  2021),  \u20ac249  million  of components  (\u20ac226  million  in  2021)  and  \u20ac115  million  of services (\u20ac127 million in 2021);\n- -the  balance  of  Renault  Group  receivables  on  the Nissan  group  is  \u20ac504  million  at  December  31,  2022 (\u20ac424 million at December 31, 2021) and the balance of Renault  Group  liabilities  to  the  Nissan  group  is \u20ac500  million  at  December  31,  2022  (\u20ac607  million  at December 31, 2021).\n- \u25cf Finance:  In  addition  to  its  activity  for  Renault  Group, Renault Finance acts as the Nissan group's counterparty in financial instrument trading to hedge  foreign exchange  and  interest  rate  risks.  Renault  Finance undertook approximately \u20ac14.9 billion of forex transactions on the foreign exchange market for Nissan in 2022 (\u20ac12.4 billion in 2021). Operations undertaken with Nissan on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are  recorded  at  market  price  and  included  in  the positions  managed  by  Renault  Finance.  In  the  balance sheet, the derivative assets on the Nissan group amount to  \u20ac188  million  at  December  31,  2022  (\u20ac11  million  at December  31,  2021)  and  derivative  liabilities  amount  to \u20ac54  million  at  December  31,  2022  (\u20ac34  million  at December 31, 2021).\n\nI",

Both  types  of operation are conducted  through  special purpose vehicles. Some public operations were subscribed by RCI Banque, which makes it possible to have securities eligible as collateral for the European Central Bank.\n\nIn  2022,  the  Sales  Financing  segment  undertook  an operation  worth  approximately  \u20ac700  million  on  the securitization market, backed by automotive loans made by its French subsidiary DIAC (comprising \u20ac650 million in senior debt and around \u20ac50 million of subordinated debt).\n\nThe segment also launched its first securitization in Spain, with  creation  of  \u20ac1.1  billion  of  senior  bonds  entirely retained by the Group. This new program strengthens the\n\nGroup's  liquidity  by  increasing  and  diversifying  assets eligible for the ECB's monetary policy operations\n\nThe receivables assigned through such operations are not derecognized, as all risks are retained by the Group. The associated  liabilities  correspond  to  securities  resulting from the securitization operations and are recognized in other debts represented by a certificate.\n\nThe difference between the receivables assigned and the amount  of  the  associated  liabilities  corresponds  to  the higher  credit  necessary  for  these  operations  and  the share  of  securities  retained  by  RCI  Banque  to  form  a liquidity reserve.\n\nSecuritized assets can no longer be assigned or pledged. Subscribers  to  debt  securities  only  have  claims  on  the assets assigned.\n\nAssets  pledged  as  guarantees  for  management  of  the liquidity reserve are presented in Note 28-A4.\n\nI",

This  risk  is  reduced  by  guarantees  provided by customers, as reported in off-balance sheet commitments received (Note 28-B).

Share capital\n\nThe total number of ordinary shares issued and fully paid at December 31, 2022 is 295,722 thousand, with par value of \u20ac3.81 per share (unchanged since December 31, 2021).\n\nTreasury shares do not bear dividends. They account for 1.80% of Renault SA's share capital at December 31, 2022 (1.55% at December 31, 2021).\n\n## 18-B. Capital management\n\nIn  managing  its  capital,  the  Group's  objective  is  to guarantee  continuity  of  business  in  order  to  provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders  and  to  maintain  optimum  capital  structure in  order  to  optimize  its  cost.  The  Group  may  adjust dividend payments to shareholders, redeem some of the capital or issue new shares.\n\nThe Group's objectives are monitored in different ways in the different operating segments.\n\nThe Nissan Group holds approximately 15% of Renault SA through  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary  Nissan  Finance Co. Ltd (no voting rights are attached to these shares).\n\nThe Sales Financing segment must comply with regulatory  ratios  specific  to  banking  operations.  The minimum  solvency  ratio  (shareholders'  equity  including subordinated  loans  to  total  weighted  risks)  is  8%.  RCI Banque's  Core  Tier  1  solvency  ratio  is 14.47% at December 31, 2022 (14.76% at December 31, 2021).\n\nThe Group also partially hedges its investment in Nissan (Notes 12-G and 25-B2).",

All plans  include  performance  conditions  which  determine the number of performance shares granted to beneficiaries.

A  liability  corresponding  to  these  put options  is  included  in  other  liabilities,  amounting  to \u20ac117  million  for  the  Brazilian  subsidiary,  \u20ac4  million  for  the Argentinian subsidiary, \u20ac16 million for the Czech subsidiary and \u20ac49 million for the Colombian subsidiary at December 31, 2022 (\u20ac102 million, \u20ac4 million, \u20ac0 million and \u20ac63 million respectively at December 31, 2021). A corresponding charge is made to shareholders' equity, allocated in priority to the non-controlling interests' share with  any  residual  amount  allocated  to  the  parentcompany shareholders' share. The liability is stated at fair value. Fair value is determined by estimating the potential purchase  price,  taking  into  account  future  results  of  the\n\nfinancing portfolio as it exists at the closing date and the provisions of the partnership contracts. This is a level 3 fair value,  as  it  uses  recognized  models  but  their  significant data are not based on observable market data.\n\nPartnership agreements were signed in 2018 with Oyak in Turkey,  including  put  and  call  options  (see  Note  28-A3). The  Group  also  holds  call  options  for  shares  in  several entities in the Oyak group (Note 28-B).\n\nThere are no significant restrictions on the Group's capacity to access or use its assets and settle its liabilities, other than restrictions  that  result  from  the  regulatory  framework  in which  the  subsidiaries  operate.  The  local  supervisory authorities  may  require  banking  subsidiaries  to  keep  a certain level of capital and liquidities, limit their exposure to other group parties and comply with other ratios.",

Pension and benefit plans\n\nPensions and other long-term employee benefit obligations  essentially  concern  active  employees.  These benefits are covered either by defined-contribution plans or defined-benefit plans.\n\n## Defined-contribution plans\n\nThe Group makes earnings-related payments, in accordance with local custom, to the national organizations responsible for paying pensions and similar financial benefits. There is no actuarial liability concerning these pension arrangements.\n\nThe  total  expense  for  defined-contribution  plans  is \u20ac516 million in 2022 (\u20ac393 million in 2021).\n\n## Defined-benefit plans\n\nThe  accounting  treatment  of  defined-benefit  plans  is described  in  Note  2-S  and  involves  establishment  of provisions. These plans concern:\n\n- \u25cf indemnities  payable  upon  retirement  or  departure,  in application  of  legislation  or  agreements  in  certain countries such as France, Turkey, etc;\n- \u25cf supplementary  pensions  providing  employees  with contractual income; the countries applying this type of plan  are  in  Europe  (e.g.  the  United  Kingdom,  France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, etc);\n- \u25cf other  long-term  benefits,  chiefly  long-service  awards and flexible holiday entitlements.\n\nDefined-benefit supplementary pension plans are generally  covered  by  contracts  with  pension  funds  or insurance companies. In such cases, the obligations and assets are valued separately. The difference between the obligation and the fair value of the assets held to fund it may indicate underfunding or overfunding. In the event of underfunding,  a  provision  is  booked.  In  the  event  of overfunding,  an  asset  is  recognized  subject  to  certain conditions.\n\n## Principal defined-benefit plans of the Group\n\nIn  France, the Group's retirement indemnities result from agreements  negotiated  with  each  French  entity  and employee representatives. They are based on employees' salaries and length of service; payment is conditional on being  in  the  company's  employment  at  the  time  of retirement. Retirement benefit obligations for France are entirely covered by provisions and account for most of the Group's liabilities for retirement indemnities.\n\nThe Group's most significant supplementary pension plan is  in  the  United  Kingdom,  where  two  defined-benefit pension  plans  are  managed  as  part  of  a  dedicated pension fund comprising two compartments: one concerns  Automotive  subsidiaries  and  the  other  RCI Financial Services Ltd, together covering 1,712 people. This plan has been closed to new members since 2004 and no further rights have been earned under it since December 31, 2019. All employees benefit from a defined-contribution pension  plan  from  January  1,  2020.  Underfunding  at December  31,  2022  is  valued  at  \u00a338  million  for  the  fund compartment dedicated to the Automotive segment and \u00a35  million  for  the  fund  compartment  dedicated  to  RCI Financial Services Ltd.\n\nThis  pension  fund  (a  trust)  is  a  legal  entity.  It  is administered  by  a  board  of  Trustees  with  equal representation for the participating companies and their current  and  former  employees.  The  fund  is  governed  by local regulations, which  set  the  minimum  funding requirements  that  can  lead  to  additional  contributions being  made  by  the  Group.  After  the  last  three-yearly valuation in 2018, the Group made a commitment to cover the funding shortfall by 2027 through payments amounting  to  \u00a35  million  maximum  per  year.  The  asset investment policy is defined for each section of the fund by  a  supervisory  body  which  examines  the  performance of investments quarterly. The risks associated with these plans  are  the  usual  risks  (lower  future  returns  on  fund assets,  a  decline  in  the  equities  markets,  longer  life expectancy for beneficiaries, a rise in inflation, etc).\n\nI",

Information  on  contingent liabilities is provided in Note 28-A2.\n\nIncreases to restructuring provisions essentially comprise the  effect  of  workforce  adjustment  measures  in  the Europe Region (Note 6-A).\n\nAt December 31, 2022, other provisions include \u20ac107 million of provisions established in application of environmental regulations  (\u20ac98  million  at  December  31,  2021).  These include  provisions  to  cover  expenses  relating  to  end-oflife vehicles  and  used  batteries  and  environmental compliance costs for industrial land in the Europe Region and  for  industrial  sites  in  the  Americas  and  Eurasia Regions.\n\nI\n\nAt the date  of  this  report, the best  estimate  of contributions that will  be  payable  to  the  funds  in  2022  is approximately \u20ac13 million.\n\nThe  Group's  pension  fund  assets  do  not  include  Renault Group's financial instruments.

The  outstanding amount payable by Renault Group at December 31, 2022 is \u20ac84 million (\u20ac88 million at December 31, 2021).\n\n## 22-C. Cash not available to the Group\n\nThe Group has liquidities in countries where repatriation of funds can be complex for regulatory or political reasons. In most of these countries, such funds are used locally for industrial or sales financing purposes.\n\nSome current bank accounts held by the Sales Financing Securitization  Fund  are  used  to  increase  credit  on\n\nsecuritized receivables and consequently act as guarantees  in  the  event  of  default  on  payment  of receivables  (Notes  15-B1  et  28-A4).  These  current  bank accounts  amount  to  \u20ac1,169  million  at  December  31,  2022 (\u20ac909 million at December 31, 2021).\n\nI",

Changes in financial liabilities and sales financing debts\n\n## Changes in redeemable shares of the Automotive segment\n\nThe redeemable shares issued in October 1983 and April 1984  by  Renault  SA  are  subordinated  perpetual  shares listed on the Paris Stock Exchange. They earn a minimum annual return of 9% comprising a 6.75% fixed portion and a variable portion that depends on consolidated revenues and is calculated based on identical Group structure and methods. The sale of our automotive businesses in Russia thus had no effect on this rate of return.\n\nRedeemable  shares  are  stated  at  amortized  cost, calculated  by  discounting  the  forecast  interest  coupons at the effective interest rate of the borrowing.\n\nThese  shares  traded  for  \u20ac270.58  at  December  31,  2022 (\u20ac442.00  at  December  31,  2021).  The  financial  liability based  on  the  stock  market  value  of  the  redeemable shares at December 31, 2022 is \u20ac216 million (\u20ac353 million at December 31, 2021).\n\n## Changes in bonds and other debts of the Automotive segment\n\nAs  part  of  its  Shelf  Registration  program,  Renault  SA launched  two  bonds  on  the  Japanese  market  on December 22, 2022 for a total of \u00a5290.7 billion (equivalent to  \u20ac2  billion).  The  first  bond  was  launched on July 1, 2022, for a total amount  of  \u00a580.7  billion  (equivalent  to \u20ac561 million), with a 3.5% coupon and 3-year maturity. The\n\nsecond  was  launched  on  December  22,  2022  for  a  total amount of \u00a5210 billion  (equivalent  to  \u20ac1.45  billion),  with  a 2.8% coupon and 4-year maturity.\n\nIn  2022,  Renault  SA  redeemed  bonds  for  a  total  of \u20ac207 million.\n\n## Change in State-guaranteed credit facility of the Automotive segment\n\nIn 2020, Renault Group opened a credit line with a pool of five banks, for the maximum amount of \u20ac5 billion covered by a French State guarantee for up to 90% of the amount borrowed.  At  December  31,  2020,  \u20ac4  billion  had  been drawn on this credit line.\n\nThe  initial  maturity  for  each  drawing  was  12  months, extendable by Renault Group for a further three years, with repayment of one third each year. The interest rate on each drawing  was  indexed  on  the  12-month  Euribor  for  the  first year,  then  the  6-month  Euribor  for  any  extensions.  If extended, these credit drawings were repayable in one-third instalments in 2022, 2023 and 2024 on the anniversary dates of the initial drawings, with the possibility of early repayment of outstanding instalments at Renault Group's initiative.\n\nThe  Group  exercised  the  extension  options  on  all  these drawings except for the drawing maturing in August 2021, of which \u20ac1 billion was repaid.\n\nAs announced on February 18, 2022, the Group made three early repayments  in 2022 totalling \u20ac1,020 million,",

The change of intent was treated as a modification of a financial  liability  in  compliance  with  IFRS  9,  paragraph B5.4.6. This led to a decrease in the financial liability with recognition  of  a  corresponding  amount  of  \u20ac29  million  in financial  income  at  December  31,  2022.  After  the  three repayments  made  at  maturity  during  the  second  halfyear, totalling \u20ac990 million, the outstanding amount of the State-guaranteed  credit  facility  at  the  year-end  is \u20ac990 million. The total amount will be repaid in 2023.\n\n## Changes in Sales Financing debts\n\nOn  June  27,  2022  the  RCI  Group  issued  a  \u20ac500  million, 5-year green bond with a 4.75% coupon. The proceeds of this issue were received on July 6, 2022. These funds will be used  to  finance  or  refinance  electric  vehicles  and charging  infrastructures,  to  promote  the  transition  to electric mobility and the fight against climate change.\n\nIn 2022, RCI Banque group also issued new bonds totalling \u20ac2,833 million with maturities between 2024 and 2028 and redeemed bonds for a total of \u20ac3,319 million.\n\nThe Group had access to the TLTRO III program (targeted long-term refinancing operations) set up by the European Central  Bank  (ECB).  Three  drawings  were  made  during 2020  for  a  total  of  \u20ac1,750  million,  maturing  in  2023.  Two other  drawings  were  made  during  2021,  for  a  total  of \u20ac1,500 million, maturing in 2024.\n\nThe IFRS IC decision clarifying analysis and recognition of TLTRO  III  transactions  became  final  in  March  2022.  This decision  applies  to  drawings  of  TLTRO  III  financing  to which the Group has opted to apply IFRS 9.\n\nThe maximum interest rate applicable to TLTRO drawings is  calculated  based  on  the  average  deposit  facility  rate 'DFR' of the European  Central  Bank  (ECB).  Rate reductions  apply  based  on  criteria  of  growth  in  loan grants. On June 10, 2022 the Group received confirmation that loan  grant  targets  for  the  special  additional reference period had been met (October 2020 - December 2021) and that consequently it will benefit from an interest rate reduction (June 2021-June 2022). In application of the\n\nprovisions of IFRS 9, this rate reduction gives rise to a \u20ac14 million adjustment to TLTRO liability items.\n\nNew  savings  collected  rose  by  \u20ac3,422  million  during  the year (\u20ac1,938 million of sight deposits and \u20ac 1,484 million of term  deposits)  to  \u20ac24,441  million  (\u20ac17,661  million  of  sight deposits  and  \u20ac6,780  million  of  term  deposits)  and  are classified  as  other  interest-bearing  borrowings.  These savings  are  collected  in  Germany,  Austria,  Brazil,  Spain, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.\n\nTo hedge certain floating-rate liabilities (savings collected  and  TLTRO  financing),  RCI  Banque  set  up interest  rate  derivatives  that  do  not  qualify  as  hedging derivatives  under  IFRS  9.  The  net  operating  income  was positively affected by a \u20ac80 million increase in the value of these swaps due to the current rise in interest rates.\n\n## Cash out flows on leases\n\nCash outflows on leases restated in application of IFRS 16 amounted to \u20ac170 million in 2022 (\u20ac145 million in 2021). This includes \u20ac148 million of repayments of the principal value of  lease  liabilities  (\u20ac126  million  in  2021)  and  \u20ac22  million  of interest (\u20ac19 million in 2021).\n\nCash  outflows  on  leases  that  were  reclassified  as purchases in substance in application of IAS 16 amounted to \u20ac12 million in 2022 (\u20ac11 million in 2021). This amount does not include repayments of interest.\n\nCash  outflows  on  leases  benefiting  from  the  exemption for  low-value  and  very  short-term  leases  amounted  to \u20ac93  million in 2022 (\u20ac95 million in 2021) (see Note 5-C).\n\nThe  potential  future  cash  outflows  resulting  from  the exercise  of  extension  options  and  contracts  already signed which take effect after the 2022 year-end amount to \u20ac12 million.\n\n## Changes in financial liabilities of the Mobility Services segment\n\nThe  financial  liabilities  of  the  Mobility  Services  segment consist of internal Group financing issued by Renault s.a.s. in the form of interest-bearing loans.",

Financing by assignment of receivables\n\n## Automotive segment financing by assignment of receivables\n\nSome  of  the  Automotive  segment's  external  financing comes  from  assignment  of  commercial  receivables  to non-Group financial establishments.\n\nDetails of financing  by  assignment  of  commercial receivables is as follows:\n\n|                                      | December 31, 2022     | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021     | December 31, 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| (\u20ac million)                          | To non-group entities | To Sales Financing  | To non-group entities | To Sales Financing  |\n| Assignment of Automotive receivables | 1,555                 | 244                 | 1,373                 | 181                 |\n| Automotive network financing         | -                     | 7,662               | -                     | 4,876               |\n| TOTAL ASSIGNED                       | 1,555                 | 7,906               | 1,373                 | 5,057               |\n\nThe  total  amount  of  tax  receivables  assigned  and derecognized in 2022 is \u20ac236 million, comprising \u20ac136  million  of  CIR  receivables  and  \u20ac100  million  of  VAT receivables (\u20ac139 million of CIR receivables and \u20ac66 million of VAT receivables in 2021).\n\nFrench  tax  receivables  assigned  outside  the  Group  (the 'CIR' Research Tax Credit), with transfer of substantially all the risks and benefits associated with ownership of the receivables, are only derecognized if the risk of dilution is deemed to be non-existent. This is notably the case when\n\nthe assigned receivables have already been subject to a tax  inspection  or  preliminary  audit.  No  assigned  tax receivables remained in the balance sheet at December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Automotive segment assigns its dealership receivables  to  the  Sales  financing  segment.  The  total dealership receivables transferred to the Sales financing segment principally concerns Renault Group. The amounts are presented in Note 15-D.\n\n## Note 24\n\n## Financial instruments by category, fair value and impact on net income\n\n## 24-A. Financial instruments by category and fair values by level\n\nIFRS 9 defines three categories of financial instruments:\n\n- \u25cf financial  assets  or  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  other components of comprehensive income;\n- \u25cf financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u25cf loans and receivables carried at amortized cost.\n\nThe  following  breakdown  by  level  of  fair  value  is presented for financial instruments carried in the balance sheet at fair value:\n\n- \u25cf level  1:  instruments  whose  fair  values  are  derived  from quoted prices in an active market; fair value is generally identical to the most recent quoted price;\n- \u25cf level  2:  instruments  whose  fair  values  are  derived  from observable market prices and are not included in level 1;\n- \u25cf level  3:  instruments  whose  fair  values  are  derived  from unobservable  inputs  on  the  market;  the  fair  value  of investments in non-controlled entities is generally based on the share of net assets.\n\nFair  values  have  been  determined  on  the  basis  of information  available  at  the  end  of  the  year  and  do  not therefore take account of subsequent movements.\n\nIn 2022, no  financial  instruments  were  transferred between level 1 and level 2, or into or out of level 3.\n\nI",

Management of financial risks\n\nThe Group is exposed to the following financial risks:\n\n- \u25cf Liquidity risk;\n- \u25cf Market risks (foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity risks);\n- \u25cf Bank counterparty risk and credit risk on customer and dealer financing.\n\nRisk  management  differs  depending  on  the  operating segment. The risks described below concern the Automotive segment  and  the  Sales  Financing  segment.  The  Mobility Services segment does not have any specific financial risks since it is financed by the Automotive segment.\n\n## 25-B1. Liquidity risk\n\nThe  Group  must  have  sufficient  financial  resources  to finance  its  automotive  and  sales  financing  businesses and the investments necessary for their growth. To ensure this  is  the  case,  the  Automotive  and  Sales  Financing segments borrow on the capital and banking markets to refinance  their  gross  debt  and  guarantee  liquidity.  This exposes.  them  to  liquidity  risks  if  markets  are  closed  for long  periods  or  credit  is  hard  to  access.  The  Automotive and  Sales  Financing  segments  are  also  credit-rated  by several  agencies.  Any  downgrading  of  external  credit ratings could limit and/or increase the cost of their access to the capital markets.\n\n## Liquidity risks - Automotive segment\n\nThe Automotive segment's liquidity risk is managed by the Financing  and  Treasury  department.  It  is  founded  on  an internal  model  that  defines  the  level  of  the  liquidity reserve  the  Automotive  segment  must  maintain  to finance  their  operations  and  development.  The  liquidity reserve  is  closely  monitored  by  a  monthly  review  and reported to the Chief Financia l Officer.\n\nRenault SA handles most refinancing for the Automotive segment  through  long-term  resources  via  the  capital markets (bond issues and private placements), short-term financing such as NEU  CP  (Negotiable European Commercial  Paper),  or  bank  financing.  Renault  SA  has several debt programs at December 31, 2022:\n\n- \u25cf An  EMTN  bond  program  with  a  \u20ac10  billion  ceiling.  This program has been registered with the AMF;\n- \u25cf A  Shelf  Registration  bond  program  on  the  Japanese market with a \u00a5400 billion ceiling. This program has been registered  with  the  Japanese  stock  market  authorities (Kanto Local Finance Bureau);\n- \u25cf A  NEU  CP  program  with  a  \u20ac2.5  billion  ceiling.  This program has been registered with the Bank of France.\n\nRenault  SA  and  its  debt  programs  are  credit-rated  by several  agencies.  On  March  29,  2022  S&P  affirmed  the rating of BB+ with a negative outlook. Moody's upgraded the outlook from negative to stable while maintaining the rating at Ba2 on November 18, 2022. The Japanese ratings agencies R&I and JCR affirmed their ratings for Renault SA (R&I:  A-,  negative  outlook  on  June  3,  2022;  JCR:  A-,  stable outlook on November 22, 2022).\n\nI",

The first of this  bonds  was  issued  at  the  beginning  of  July  2022  with nominal  value  of  \u00a580.7  billion  (\u20ac561  million)  with  a  3.5% interest rate and 3-year maturity. The second was issued in  December  2022  with  nominal  value  of  \u00a5210  billion (\u20ac1.45 billion) with a 2.8% interest rate and 4-year maturity. Renault  SA  also  maintained  its  access  to  short-term financing through use of its NEU CP (Negotiable European Commercial Paper) program.\n\nIn  2022, Renault SA reimbursed \u20ac2,010 million (Note 23-C) of  the  bank  credit  facility  guaranteed  by  the  French government. This credit facility of an initial \u20ac5 billion was set  up  in  2020  to  cover  liquidity  requirements  resulting from  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  It  was  available  until December 31, 2020, and three drawings totalling \u20ac4 billion were made on it during the second half-year of 2020. The principal  outstanding  at  December  31,  2022  amounts  to \u20ac990 million.\n\nRenault  SA  also  has  confirmed  credit  lines  opened  with banks  worth  \u20ac3,430  million  at  December  31,  2022 (3,430 million December 31, 2021). These credit lines mature in more than one year and were undrawn at December 31, 2022  (and  2021).  They  form  a  liquidity  reserve  for  the Automotive  segment.  The  maturities  of  the  Automotive segment's  financial  liabilities  at  December  31,  2022  are presented in Note 23-D.\n\nThe contractual documentation for Renault SA's confirmed  credit  arrangements,  bank  loans  and  market financing  does  not  contain  any  clause  that  could  affect the  continued  supply  of  credit  as  a  result  of  changes  in either Renault Group's credit rating or its financial ratios. Certain types of financing, particularly market financing, contain  standard  clauses  (pari  passu,  negative  pledge and cross-default clauses).\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  the  Automotive  segment  have  a liquidity  reserve  of  \u20ac17.7  billion,  sufficient  to  cover  their commitments  over  a  12-month  horizon.  This  reserve consists of \u20ac14.23 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and \u20ac3.43 billion of unused confirmed credit lines.\n\n## Liquidity risks -Sales Financing segment\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  is  very  attentive  to diversification  of  its  sources  of  liquidity.  In  recent  years Renault  Group  has  diversified  widely  its  sources  of financing, moving into new distribution zones in addition to its longstanding base of Euro bond investors.\n\nRCI  Banque's  liquidity  risk  management  follows  the recommendations  of  the  European  Banking  Authority.  It uses  several  indicators  and  analyses  (static  liquidity, liquidity  reserve,  several  stress  scenarios),  which  are\n\nupdated and reported to RCI Banque's Financial Committee  on  a  monthly  basis.  The  stress  scenarios include assumptions concerning deposit leakage, loss of access to new financing, partial unavailability  of  certain elements  of  the  liquidity  reserve  and  forecasts  for issuance of new credit.\n\nThe alternation of different maturities and issue formats is  part  of  the  Sales  Financing  segment's  diversification strategy  for  financing  sources.  This  policy  has  been followed  for  several  years  and  enables  the  segment  to reach the maximum number of investors.\n\nThe Group took advantage of the favorable context early in the  year  to  issue  \u20ac750  million  of  debt  with  a  term  of 3.5  years  as  a  part  of  EMTN  program  (Euro  Medium  Term Note Program). This operation generated an order book of over  \u20ac4.5  billion  from  more  than  180  investors.  The  Group also returned to the Swiss market, placing a CHF 110 million bond  with  3-year  maturity.  In  June,  the  bank  successfully completed its first green bond issue, totalling \u20ac500 million. The  proceeds  of  this  issue  will  be  used  to  finance  or refinance  electric  vehicles  and  charging  infrastructures. This operation demonstrated the Group's determination to promote the transition to electric mobility and fight climate change. In September, when the markets were still volatile, a  \u20ac650  million  6-year  bond  was  also  issued.  In  November, when the market was particularly favorable, a \u20ac750 million 3-year bond was also issued.\n\nOn the securitization market, the Group placed approximately  \u20ac700  million of securities backed  by automotive loans made by its French subsidiary DIAC, and increased its private securitization in England by \u00a3100 million.\n\nAgainst  high  volatility  on  the  markets,  collection  of  new savings was particularly resilient and competitive in terms of  the  cost  of  resources  collected  compared  to  market finance sources. Customer deposits increased by \u20ac2.1 billion over the year to \u20ac23.1 billion.\n\nWith  these  resources,  as  well  as  \u20ac4.4  billion  of  undrawn confirmed credit lines with banks, \u20ac4.6 billion of collateral eligible for the Central Banks' monetary policy operations, \u20ac5.8  billion  of  highly  liquid  assets  (HQLA),  RCI  Banque  is able  to  maintain  its  customer  financing  for  almost 11 months  without  access  to  external  liquidities.  At December 31, 2022, RCI Banque's liquidity reserve (for the Europe  scope)  amounts  to  \u20ac14.9  billion  (\u20ac14.4  billion  at December 31, 2021).\n\nThe RCI Banque group's issues and programs are creditrated  by  several  agencies.  In  2022,  S&P  confirmed  RCI Banque's  rating  of  BBB-  with  a  stable  outlook,  while Moody's  affirmed  its  rating  of  Baa2  but  changed  the outlook from negative to stable on November 22, 2022.",

Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe  Group  made  no  major  changes  to  its  foreign exchange risk management policy in 2022.\n\nThe Group's exposure to foreign exchange risk principally concerns the Automotive segment.\n\n## Foreign exchange risks - Automotive segment\n\nIn  the  Automotive  segment,  fluctuations  in  exchange rates  can  affect  the  following  financial  aggregates: operating  income  (loss),  financial  income  (expenses), share in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures, shareholders' equity and net cash position.\n\nThe  Performance  and  Control  Department  and  the Financing  and  Treasury  Department  are  in  charge  of rolling  out  and  monitoring  the  Automotive  segment's foreign exchange risk management policy.\n\n## Operating income\n\nexpenses  must  first  be  analysed  by  the  Performance  and Control Department  and  the  Financing  and  Treasury Department,  and  then  require  formal  authorization  by  the Chief Financial Officer or Chief Executive Officer, with monthly reporting  of  results  to  the  Chief  Finance  Officer.  Wherever possible, foreign exchange operations are mainly undertaken by the Group's trading room (Renault Finance) for currencies that are negotiable on the international markets.\n\nThe  principal  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risks  lies  in the operating income (loss). At December 31, 2022 based on the 2022 structure of operating results and cash flows, a  1%  rise  by  the  euro  against  all  other  currencies  would have  an  unfavorable  impact  of  \u20ac11  million  on  the Automotive  segment's  annual  operating  income  (loss) after any hedging.\n\nIn  2022,  to  limit  the  foreign  exchange risk exposure of its operating margin, the Automotive segment set up foreign exchange hedges of the Argentinian peso, Chinese yuan, and Turkish lira.\n\nThe Automotive segment sometimes hedges certain positions. Foreign exchange hedges on operating income and\n\nThe  principal  exposure  in  2022  concerned  the  pound  sterling  and  the  Chinese  yuan,  with  a  unfavorable  impact  of approximately \u20ac(15) million and favrable impact of approximately \u20ac11 million respectively in the event of a 1% rise by the euro against these currencies, after eventual hedging. The 10 largest exposures in absolute value and their sensitivities after hedging are presented below in millions of euros:\n\n(\u20ac million)\n\n| Currency         |     | Annual net operating items   | Impact of a 1% rise in the euro   |\n|------------------|-----|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Pound sterling   | GBP | 1,475                        | (15)                              |\n| Polish zloty     | PLN | 735                          | (7)                               |\n| Argentinian peso | ARS | 486                          | (5)                               |\n| Swiss Franc      | CHF | 477                          | (5)                               |\n| Moroccan dirham  | MAD | 464                          | (5)                               |\n| Mexican Peso     | MXN | 462                          | (5)                               |\n| Indian Rupee     | INR | (355)                        | 4                                 |\n| Romanian leu     | RON | (716)                        | 7                                 |\n| Korean won       | KRW | (994)                        | 10                                |\n| Chinese yuan     | CNY | (1,355)                      | 11                                |\n\n## Financial income (expenses)\n\nTo  avoid  any  exchange-related  distortion  of  the  net financial income, it is the Automotive segment's policy to minimize  the  foreign  exchange  risk  affecting  financing and investment items in foreign currencies.\n\nAll the  Automotive  segment's  exposures  to  foreign exchange  risks  on  financial  income  and  expense  items are  aggregated  and  monitored  by  the  Financing  and Treasury Department, with monthly reporting to the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nIntra-group  financing  flows  in  foreign  currency  are hedged  in  the  same  currency.  If  a  subsidiary  needs external  financing  in  a  currency  other  than  the  local\n\ncurrency,  the  parent  company  monitors  the  operations closely. Cash surpluses in countries that are not part of the parent  company's  centralized  cash  management  are generally invested in local currency, under the supervision of  the  Group's  Financing  and  Treasury  Department.  The subsidiary Renault Finance can undertake foreign exchange  operations  on  its  own  behalf,  within  strictly defined  risk  limits.  Its  foreign  exchange  positions  are monitored and valued in real time. This activity is chiefly intended  to  maintain  the  Group's  expertise  on  the financial markets. It generates very short exposures and does not exceed a few tens of millions of euros, so that it cannot  have  a  significant  impact  on  Renault  Group's consolidated results.\n\nI",

On  the basis of its contribution to 2022 net income, a 1% rise in the euro  against  the  Japanese  yen  would  have  decreased Nissan's contribution by \u20ac5 million. This impact corresponds  only  to  the  impact  of  the  euro  on  the translation of Nissan's contribution to the Renault Group's consolidated statements. It does not reflect the inherent impact  of  euro  fluctuations  on  Nissan's  own  accounts, given  that  Nissan  does  varying  levels  of  business  in  the Euro zone and Renault Group has no control over this.\n\n## Equity investments\n\nThe foreign exchange risk exposure of equity investments (in currencies other than the euro) is not generally hedged. However, due to its importance, the investment in Nissan is subject to a partial foreign exchange hedge amounting to  \u00a5199.9  billion  at  December  31,  2022  (\u00a518.3  billion  at December 2021) (Note 12-G). In 2022 the Group amended its management  rule restricting hedging of its net investment in Nissan to its best estimate of the next three years of dividends in yen to be received from Nissan. The Group  can  now  decide  to  hedge  a  higher  amount  of  its exposure to foreign exchange risks through the share of equity held in Nissan than the above estimate, although it cannot exceed the share in yen of Nissan equity and its assessment  of  the  liquidity  risk  on  the  yen.  This  foreign currency hedge is only a limited part of the investment in Nissan.\n\n## Net cash position\n\nFor the purposes of the partial hedge of the investment in Nissan, some of Renault Group's net financial indebtedness is denominated in yen. At December 31, 2022 a  1%  rise  in  the  euro  against  the  yen  would  increase  the net cash  position  of  the  Automotive  segment  by \u20ac14 million.  This  net  cash  position  may  also  be  impacted by  changes  in  exchange  rates  concerning  subsidiaries' financial assets and liabilities in their local currency.\n\n## Analysis of financial instruments' sensitivity to foreign exchange risks\n\nThis analysis concerns the sensitivity to foreign exchange risks  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  (including  intraGroup  balances)  and  derivatives  denominated  in  a currency other than the currency of the entity that holds them. However, it does not cover items (hedged assets or liabilities and  derivatives)  concerned  by  fair  value hedging,  for  which  changes  in  fair  value  of  the  hedged item and the hedging instrument totally offset each other in the income statement.\n\nThe  impact  on  shareholders'  equity  (before  tax)  of  a  1% rise  in  the  euro  against  other  currencies  is  assessed  by converting  financial  assets,  cash  flow  hedges  and  the partial  hedge  of  the  investment  in  Nissan.  For  the Automotive segment,  this  impact  would  be  a  favorable \u20ac14 million at December 31, 2022 (\u20ac1 million at December 31,\n\n2021), explained by the yen bond issues that make up the partial hedge of the investment in Nissan (see Note 12-G).\n\nThe impact on net income of a 1% rise in the euro against other  currencies  would  be  an  unfavorable  impact  of \u20ac5 million at December 31, 2022 (\u20ac2 million at December 31, 2021),  mainly  attributable  to  unhedged  operating  assets and  liabilities  denominated  in  a  currency  that  is  not  the functional currency of the entity that holds them.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk - Sales Financing segment\n\nThe Sales Financing segment has low exposure to foreign exchange  risks  due  to  the  management  principles applied.  No  position  can  be  taken  under  the  central management  framework  for  refinancing;  the  trading room  hedges  all  flows  concerned.  Residual,  temporal positions  in  foreign  currencies  related  to  the  time differences in cash flows inherent to multi-currency cash management may still remain. They are monitored daily and the same hedging policy applies. The Sales Financing subsidiaries are obliged to obtain refinancing in their own currency and as a result are not exposed. In exceptional circumstances, limits are assigned to subsidiaries where sales  financing  activities  or  refinancing  take  place  in several different currencies, and to subsidiaries authorized  to  invest  some  of  their  cash  surpluses  in  a currency other than their local currency.\n\nAt  December  31,  2022  RCI  Banque  group's  consolidated foreign exchange position reached \u20ac12.7 million.\n\n## 25-B3. Interest rate risks\n\nThe Group made no major changes to its interest rate risk management policy in 2022.\n\nThe  Group's  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  principally concerns the Sales Financing segment.\n\n## Interest rate risk - Automotive segment\n\nThe  Automotive  segment's  net  financial  income  is exposed  to  a  risk  of  variations  in  market  interest  rates affecting its cash surpluses and financial liabilities, and to a lesser degree its shareholders' equity.\n\nThe  interest  rate  risk  management  policy  applies  the following principles:\n\n- \u25cf Liquidity reserves  are  generally  established  using floating-rate financing. The  Automotive  segment's available cash is managed centrally by Renault SA as far as possible and invested by Renault Finance in the form of short term bank deposits and mutual funds approved as  money  market  funds  and  meeting  the  criteria  for classification as cash equivalents\n- \u25cf Long-term  investments  by  the  Automotive  segment generally use fixed-rate financing.\n\nInterest  rate  hedging  instruments  for  the  Automotive segment are standard interest swaps that are adequately covered by hedged liabilities, such that no ineffectiveness is expected.\n\nFinally, Renault Finance carries out interest rate transactions on its own behalf, within strictly defined risk limits, and positions are monitored and valued in real time.",

RCI Banque's operating results may be affected by movements  in  market  interest  rates  or  interest  rates applicable  to  customer  deposits.  The  Sales  Financing segment's aim is to limit these risks as far as possible in order to protect its margin on sales.\n\nTo take account of the difficulty of precisely matching the structure  of  borrowings  with  the  structure  of  loans,  a limited amount of flexibility is allowed in each subsidiary's interest  rate  hedging.  This  flexibility  is  reflected  in  a sensitivity limit assigned to each subsidiary and validated by the finance committee, in an individual adaptation of part  of  the  limit  Renault  Group  assigns  to  the  Sales Financing segment.\n\nA  daily  sensitivity  calculation  by  currency,  management entity,  and  asset  portfolio  is  used  to  ensure  that  each entity respects its assigned limits. All RCI Banque entities use the same method for this assessment of interest rate sensitivity, which measures the impact of a 100 base point increase  in  interest  rates  on  the  value  of  balance  sheet items  for  each  entity.  Sensitivity  is  calculated  daily  for each  currency  and  each  management  entity  (central refinancing  office,  French  and  foreign  sales  financing subsidiaries)  for  the  purpose  of  overall  management  of interest  rate  risks  across  the  consolidated  scope  of  the Sales Financing segment.\n\nEach  entity's  position  with  regard  to  its  limit  is  checked daily, and immediate hedging directives are issued to the subsidiaries  if  circumstances  require.  The  results  of  the checks  are  reported  monthly  to  the  Sales  Financing segment's  Finance  Committee,  which  checks  that  the positions comply with the Group's financial strategy and current procedural instructions.\n\nAnalysis  of  the  Sales  Financing  segment's  structural interest rate risk shows the following:\n\n- \u25cf Virtually  all  loans  to  customers  by  Sales  Financing subsidiaries bear interest at a fixed rate and have terms from  one  to  seventy-two  months.  These  loans  are hedged by fixed-rate resources with the same structure. They are covered by macro-hedging and only generate a  residual  interest  rate  risk.  In  subsidiaries  where  the financing  bears  interest  at  a  floating  rate,  the  interest rate risk is hedged by macro-hedging using interest rate swaps.\n- \u25cf The  main  activity  of  the  Sales  Financing  segment's central  refinancing  department  is  refinancing  the segment's  sales  subsidiaries.  The  outstanding  credit issued  by  Sales  Financing  subsidiaries  is  backed  by fixed-interest  resources,  some  of  which  are  microhedged  by  interest  rate  swaps,  and  floating-rate\n\nresources.  Macro-hedging  transactions  in  the  form  of interest rate swaps  keep  the  sensitivity of the refinancing holding company below the limit set by the Group (\u20ac32 million). These macro-hedging transactions concern floating-rate resources and/or fixed-rate resources  converted  to  floating-rate  resources  by micro-hedging of swaps.\n\n## Analysis of Group financial instruments' sensitivity to interest rate risks\n\nThe  Automotive  and  Sales  Financing  segments  are exposed to the following interest rate risks:\n\n- \u25cf variations in the interest flows on floating-rate financial instruments  stated  at  amortized  cost  (including  fixedrate instruments swapped  to  floating rate, and structured products);\n- \u25cf variations  in  the  fair  value  of  fixed-rate  financial instruments stated at fair value;\n- \u25cf variations in the fair value of derivatives.\n\nImpacts are estimated by applying a 100 base point rise in interest rates over  a  one-year  period  to  financial instruments reported in the closing statement of financial position.\n\nFor the Sales Financing segment,  the  impact  on shareholders'  equity  corresponds  to  the  change  in  fair value before reclassification in profit or loss (section 2) of fixed-rate debt instruments classified as financial assets at fair value through other components of comprehensive income and cash flow hedges after a 100 base point rise in interest rates. All other impacts affect net income.\n\nCalculation  of  the  individual  segments'  sensitivity  to interest rates includes intersegment loans and borrowings.\n\nFor the Automotive segment, the impact on net income of a 100 base point rise in interest rates applied to financial instruments  exposed  to  interest  rate  risks  would  be  a favorable  \u20ac97.9  million.  Shareholders'  equity  would  be unaffected.\n\nFor the Sales Financing segment, the overall sensitivity to interest rate risks in 2022 remained below the limit set by the RCI Banque group (\u20ac70 million at December 31, 2022). At December 31, 2022, a 100 base point rise in interest rates would  have  the  following  impacts  on  net  income  and shareholders' equity (before taxes):\n\n- \u25cf +\u20ac1.1 million for items denominated in Moroccan dirham;\n- \u25cf \u20ac(0.3) million for items denominated in Swiss francs;\n- \u25cf +\u20ac1 million for items denominated in pounds sterling;\n- \u25cf \u20ac(0.3) million for items denominated in Russian rouble;\n- \u25cf \u20ac(1.6) million for items denominated in euros;\n- \u25cf +\u20ac0.3 million for items denominated in Czech koruna;\n\nThe  sum  of  the  absolute  sensitivities  in  each  currency amounts to \u20ac7 million.\n\nI",

Equity risk\n\nSince the sale of its  shares  in  Daimler  in  March  2021,  the Group's exposure to equity risks has been marginal.\n\n## 25-B5. Commodity risk\n\n## Management of commodity risk\n\nCommodity  purchase  prices  can  change  suddenly  and significantly, and cannot necessarily be passed on through vehicle sale prices. This may  lead  Renault  Group's Purchases  department  to  hedge  part  of  its  commodity risks using financial instruments. These hedges are subject to volume, duration, and price limits. The subsidiary Renault Finance can undertake metal operations on its own behalf, within strictly defined risk limits. Its positions are monitored and valued in real time and do not qualify as hedging. This activity  cannot  have  a  significant  impact  on  Renault Group's consolidated results.\n\nIn  2022  Renault  Group  undertook  hedging  operations  on base  metals  and  precious  metals,  within  the  limits validated by the CEO of Renault SA.\n\nThe  operations  in  progress  at  December  31,  2022  are classified  for  accounting  purposes  as  cash  flow  hedges, and accordingly changes in their fair value are included in other components of comprehensive income to the extent of the effective portion of the hedges.\n\n## Analysis of financial instruments' sensitivity to commodity risks\n\nFinancial instruments' accounting sensitivity to commodity  risks  results  from  derivatives  used  to  hedge the Group's economic exposure to these risks.\n\nA  10%  increase  in  commodity  prices  for  derivatives designated as hedging derivatives would have a positive impact of \u20ac96 million on other components of comprehensive income at December 31, 2022.",

Bank counterparty risk and credit risk on customer and dealer financing\n\n## Customer credit risk on Automotive receivables\n\nThe Automotive segment's exposure to credit risk is limited because of the assignment of many receivables leading to their  deconsolidation,  and  systematic  hedging  of  risks  on export  receivables.  Non-assigned  sales  receivables  and receivables covered by guarantee are regularly monitored.\n\n## Credit risk on customers, dealers and commitments given by the Sales Financing segment\n\nThe Sales Financing segment is exposed to customer and dealer credit risk when risk management techniques are insufficient for protection against default on payment by its counterparties.\n\nCredit risk is the risk of losses due to the incapacity of RCI Banque customers to fulfil the terms of a contract signed with  the  bank.  Credit  risk  is  closely  linked  to  macroeconomic  factors  including  the  unemployment  rate, corporate  bankruptcies,  debt  servicing  costs,  revenue growth, disposable household income, dealership profitability  and  the  price  of  used  vehicles.  It  has  a significant  impact  on  the  Sales  Financing  segment's business.\n\nThe  level  of  credit  risk  on  the  dealership  network  is influenced by the dealers' financial health, the quality of guarantees, and the general demand for vehicles.\n\nRCI Banque uses advanced scoring systems and external databases to evaluate the quality of loans made to retail and  business  customers.  It  also  uses  an  internal  rating system  to  evaluate  lending  to  dealers.  Although  RCI Banque  is  constantly  adjusting  its  acceptance  policy  in response to market conditions, any increase in the credit risk  would  increase  its  cost  of  risk  and  its  provisions  for bad debt. RCI Banque has detailed procedures to recover receivables that are compromised or in default, arranging repossessions  and  sales  of  unpaid  vehicles.  However, there  can  be  no  guarantee  that  the  policies  of  issuing credit,  monitoring  credit  risk,  payment  recovery  action, and  repossession  of  vehicles  are,  or  will  be,  sufficient  to avoid  an  unfavorable  impact  on  its  financial  results  and position.\n\nAn increase in the credit risk would increase the cost of risk and provisions for bad debt, with a direct impact on RCI's financial results and potentially on its internal capital.\n\n## Bank counterparty risk\n\nDue  to  its  operations  on  the  financial  markets  to  invest cash  surpluses,  manage  foreign  exchange  risks  and interest  risks,  and  manage  payment  flows,  the  Group  is exposed to a bank counterparty risk.\n\nThis bank  counterparty  risk  affecting  Group  entities  is managed  by  both  the  Automotive  and  Sales  Financing segment in  a  fully-coordinated  approach.  It  is  founded  on  an internal  rating  system  based  mainly  on  counterparties'  longterm credit ratings and equity. This system is used by all Renault Group companies exposed to a bank counterparty risk.\n\nGroup  companies  which,  due  to  the  nature  of  their business, are significantly exposed to a bank counterparty risk are monitored daily to ensure that they comply with authorized counterparty limits, in accordance with specific procedures. The Group produces  a  consolidated  monthly  report  covering  all  its bank  counterparties,  organized  by  credit  rating.  This report  provides  a  detailed  analysis  of  compliance  with limits in terms of amount, maturity and type, as well as a list of the main exposures.\n\nTo reduce the bank counterparty risk, most deposits are contracted with large network banks and generally have terms shorter than 90 days, as this allows a good spread of  the  risk.  In  the  event  of  volatile  macroeconomic situations  that  may  arise  in  emergent  countries  and potentially  affect  their  banking  systems,  the  Group introduces  an  action  plan  to  step  up  counterparty  risk monitoring,  and  makes  adjustments  to  the  counterparty limits if necessary. The exposure on each banking group is assessed  monthly  on  a  consolidated  basis,  with  the Automotive and Sales Financing entities. The Group is not subject  to  any  significant  risk  concentration  for  its operations on the financial and banking markets.\n\nNo  losses  due  to  default  by  a  bank  counterparty  were recorded in 2022. The bank counterparty risk borne by the Group  through  its  shares  in  investment  funds  (UCITS)  is incorporated  into  the  risk  of  changes  in  value  for  those products, and monitored using specific rules.\n\nI",

Transactions with unconsolidated controlled entities\n\nA certain number  of controlled entities are not consolidated because their contribution to the consolidated  financial  statements  is  considered  nonsignificant (Note 17).\n\nThe  only  company  with  sales  of  more  than  \u20ac100  million and/or a balance sheet value of more than \u20ac100 million is Renault  Nissan  Global  Management,  which  manages Renault Group and Nissan expatriates.\n\nIn  2022,  the  Renault  Group's  expenses  with  this  company amounted to approximately \u20ac89 million (\u20ac120 million in 2021).\n\nIn  Renault  Group's  financial  position  at  December  31,  2022, the balances of transactions between Renault Nissan Global Management  and  Renault  Group  consist  mainly of operating receivables amounting to \u20ac75 million (\u20ac80 million at December 31, 2021) and operating payables amounting to \u20ac25 million (\u20ac45 million at December 31, 2021).\n\n## Note 28\n\n## Off-balance sheet commitments, contingent assets and liabilities, assets pledged and received as collateral\n\nIn the course of its business, Renault enters into a certain number of commitments, and is involved in litigations or subject to investigations by competition and automobile regulation authorities.

The  maximum  payable  within  one  year  is \u20ac485  million  at  December  31,  2022  (\u20ac300  million  at December 31, 2021). Irrevocable commitments at December 31,  2022  were  essentially  made  to  secure  raw material supplies.\n\n## 28-A2. Contingent liabilities\n\nGroup companies  are periodically subject to tax inspections  in  the  countries  in  which  they  operate. Accepted tax adjustments are recorded as provisions in the financial statements. Contested tax adjustments are recognized on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the risk that the proceedings or appeals undertaken may be unsuccessful. Tax  liabilities are recognized  via provisions when  there  are uncertainties over the determination of taxes.\n\nOn December 19, 2019 Renault s.a.s. received notification, interrupting  the  limitation  period,  of  a  tax  reassessment on  transfer  prices  in  2016,  and  an  additional  notification was received on June 24, 2021 concerning the years 2017 and 2018. On December 21, 2022, the French tax authorities issued a proposed reassessment for the year 2019 relating to a further inspection covering the period 2019-2020, also interrupting the relevant limitation period. Renault Group is  challenging  the  most  significant  amounts  of  these notifications, and no provision has been recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2022 in connection with this matter.\n\nRESA (Renault  Espa\u00f1a  SA)  was  notified  in  late  2020  of  a \u20ac213  million  tax  reassessment  for  transfer  prices,  which Renault  Group  is  contesting.  A  procedure  for  amicable settlement between France and Spain was begun in 2021. No provision has been recognized in connection with this notification,  since  Renault  Group  considers  that  it  has good chances of winning its case. A deposit of \u20ac213 million was  paid  to  the  Spanish  tax  authorities  (\u20ac135  million  in 2020  and  \u20ac78  million  in  2021),  recognized  in  non-current financial  assets  and  presented  in  cash  flows  from investing activities (under Decrease (Increase) in loans of the  Automotive  segment)  in  the  consolidated  cash  flow statement.  The  Spanish  tax  authorities  are  currently conducting an inspection of the years 2017 to 2020.\n\nDisposals of subsidiaries or businesses by the Group generally include representations and warranties in the buyer's favour. At  December  31,  2022,  the  Group  has  not  identified  any significant risk in connection with these operations.\n\nGroup companies are periodically subject to investigations by the authorities in the countries in which they operate. When the resulting financial consequences are  accepted,  they  are  recognized  in  the  financial statements via provisions. When they are contested, they are  recognized  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  based  on estimates  that  take  into  account  the  risk  that  the proceedings or appeals undertaken may be unsuccessful.\n\nThe main investigations by the competition and automotive regulation authorities in progress at December  31,  2022  concern  illegal  agreements  and  the level of vehicle emissions in Europe.\n\nIn  the  ongoing  'emissions'  affair  in  France,  in  which  a formal legal investigation was opened on January 12, 2017 at  the  request  of  the  Paris  public  prosecution  office, Renault s.a.s. was officially placed under investigation for deceit on June 8, 2021.\n\nIn July 2021 Renault Group paid bail of \u20ac20 million (included in  the  balance  sheet)  to  guarantee  its  representation throughout the proceedings and to cover payment of any damages  and  fines.  It  also  issued  a  \u20ac60  million  bank guarantee on October 8, 2021 to cover compensation for any  prejudice  identified.  Renault  Group  denies  having committed  any  offence.  All  Renault  Group  vehicles  are, and always have been, type-approved in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The potential consequences  of  the  next  steps  in  these  ongoing proceedings  cannot  be  reliably  estimated,  and  no provision  was  recognized  in  connection  with  this  matter at December 31, 2022 (nor at December 31, 2021).\n\nApproximately  80%  of  the  Group's  2022  sales  were subject  to  CO2  emission  regulations,  principally  in  the European Union but also notably in  the  United  Kingdom, South Korea and Brazil.\n\nIn 2020,2021 and 2022, the three members of the Alliance Renault,  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi  Motors  Corp.  -  signed agreements to  pool  their  CAFE  (Corporate  Average  Fuel Economy)  targets  for  the  European  Union.  The  potential noncompliance  penalties  payable  to  the  authorities concerned  are  determined  at  the  level  of  the  group formed  by  the  Alliance's  three  automakers.  Renault  did not  recognize  any  provision  in  connection  with  the  EU CAFE regulation at December 31, 2022 (nor at December 31, 2021 and December 31,2020).\n\nRenault Group confirmed in a press release of January 17, 2022 that it had achieved its CAFE targets for passenger vehicles  and  light  commercial  vehicles  in  2021  (these results are due to be consolidated and officialized by the European Commission in the next few months). Based on the estimates available for 2022, the 2022 targets should also be met.\n\nA  provision  of  \u20ac10  million  was  recognized  for  CAFE penalties  payable  for  2022  in  South  Korea  (\u20ac11  million  in 2021), raising the total provision for the years 2019 to 2022 to \u20ac45 million.\n\nGroup  companies  are  also  subject  to  the  applicable regulations  regarding  pollution,  notably  of  soil  and  ground water.  These  regulations  vary  depending  on  the  country  of location. Some of the associated environmental liabilities are potential  and  will  only  be  recognized  in  the  accounts  if  the activity is discontinued or the site closed. It is also sometimes difficult  to  determine  the  amount  of  the  obligation  reliably. Provisions are only established for liabilities that correspond to  a  legal  or  constructive  obligation  at  the  closing  date,  and can be estimated with reasonable reliability.\n\nThe Group  establishes provisions for its products recycling under  regulatory  requirements,  when  the practical organization of recycling operations is defined. In  France,  the  'AGEC'  law  of  February  10,  2020  to  fight waste and promote a circular  economy was adopted to extend  industrial operators' legal responsibility for management  of  their  waste.

A study is  in  progress  to  determine the amount of the obligation. No  provision  was  recognized  in  connection  with  this matter at December 31, 2022.\n\nOn  15  March  2022,  the  European  Commission  conducted inspections at the premises of companies and associations active in the automotive sector located in several EU Member States.  In  parallel,  the  European  Commission  has  sent  out formal requests for information to several companies active in the automotive  sector.  The  investigation  concerns possible anticompetitive collusion in relation to the collection,  treatment  and  recovery  of  end-of-life  (ELV)  cars and vans, relating in particular to (i) the compensation of ELV collection,  treatment,  and  recovery  companies,  and  (ii)  the use  of  data  relating  to  the  recyclability  or  recoverability  of ELVs in advertising materials.\n\nRenault  was  one  of  the  companies  visited  on  15  March 2022.    In  parallel,  Renault  has  received  a  request  for information  from  the  UK  Competition  and  Markets Authority  (CMA),  which  is  investigating  similar  conduct. Renault has replied to the European Commission's and the CMA's requests for information.\n\nThe possible consequences of the ongoing investigation cannot  be  reliably  estimated  at  this  stage  and  no provision  in  connection  with  this  matter  has  been recorded at December 31, 2022.\n\n## 28-A3. Share purchase commitments given\n\nWhen  the Group grants put options to minority shareholders to sell their investments in fully consolidated companies,  a  liability  corresponding  to  the  option  is recognized, with a reduction in shareholders' equity - noncontrolling interests' share.\n\nPut options granted by the Group to minority shareholders concern Banco RCI Brasil S.A, Rombo  Compania Financiera,  RCI  Colombia  S.A  and  RCI  Financial  Services s.r.o.  The  consequences  for  the  financial  statements  are explained in Note 18-H.\n\nPartnership agreements were signed in 2018 with Oyak in Turkey,  including  perfectly  symmetrical  put  and  call options for non-controlling investments, entitling Renault\n\ns.a.s.,  subject  to  certain  conditions,  to  purchase  Oyak's shares in Oyak Renault (call) and to sell its shares in MAIS (put), and entitling Oyak to sell its shares in Oyak Renault (put)  and  purchase  Renault  s.a.s.'s  shares  in  MAIS  (call). The exercise price for the put option, if exercised, will be determined by three independent experts who would be appointed at the exercise date. Analysis of the contracts did not identify any circumstances beyond the control of Renault  Group  that  could  lead  to  Oyak's  put  option exercised  without  Renault  Group  being  able  to  object. Consequently, no liability was recognized at December 31, 2021  or  December  31,  2022  in  connection  with  these options.\n\n## 28-A4. Assets pledged as guarantees for management of the liquidity reserve\n\nFor  management  of  its  liquidity  reserve,  the  Sales Financing  segment  has  access  to  the  monetary  policy operations  of  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB)  and  the Bank of England (BOE).\n\nTo  benefit  from  European  Central  Bank  monetary  policy operations, the segment has provided guarantees to the Banque  de  France  (under  France's  central  collateral management system 3G - Gestion Globale des Garanties) in  the  form of assets with book value of \u20ac8,907 million at December  31,  2022  (\u20ac7,111  million  at  December  31,  2021).

This  option  is  conditional  on  Whylot  achieving certain objectives, and is not exercisable at December 31, 2022.  No  liability  is  recognized  in  connection  with  this commitment.\n\nThe  Group  holds  derivative  instruments  to  subscribe  to future capital increases by Verkor, without taking control of  the  company.  No  liability  is  recognized  in  connection with this commitment.\n\nThe  agreement  for  the  sale  by  Renault  Group  of  its investments  in  Renault  Russia  and  the  Avtovaz  Group, which took place on May 15, 2022, gives Renault Group an option  to  buy  back  its  investment  in  Lada  Auto  holding\n\n## Note 29\n\n## Subsequent events\n\nRenault Group has announced on February, 06 th 2023 the signing  of  a  binding  framework  agreement  defining  the principles  of  a  new  governance  structure  and  the rebalancing  of  cross-shareholdings  between  Renault Group and Nissan. The two companies plan to conclude a new  agreement  by  March  31,  2023  that  will  replace  the current  agreements  governing  the  Alliance.  The  new agreement  would  be  effective  for  an  initial  period  of  15 years.\n\nRenault Group would transfer 28.4% of Nissan shares into a French  trust,  where  the  voting  rights  would  be 'neutralized' for most of the decisions, but the economic rights  (dividends  and  shares'  sale  proceeds)  would  still entirely  benefit  to  Renault  Group  until  such  shares  are\n\n(the parent company of Avtovaz), exercisable during three 90-day  periods  starting  on  May  15,  2024,  2026  and  2028. The  exercise  price  of  this  option  is  one  rouble,  plus  a commitment  by  Renault  Group  to  make  a  cash contribution to Avtovaz over 4 years, of an amount to be determined at Renault Group's discretion by reference to the  sum  of  non-refundable  subsidies  received  from  the Russian  State,  cash  contributions  to  assets  and/or  the share capital of Avtovaz, and the accumulated profits of the  Avtovaz  Group  calculated  under  IFRS  between  the date of Renault's sale of its investment in Avtovaz and the date at which the repurchase option is exercised.\n\nThe  amount  of  this  contribution  will  determine  the ownership  interest  acquired  by  Renault  Group  (between 51%  and  67.69%).  A  \u20ac400  million  contribution  will automatically give the Group a 51% investment.\n\nThe derivative corresponding to this option has nil value at December 31, 2022.\n\nsold. Renault Group and Nissan would retain a 15% crossshareholding,  with  a  lock-up  obligation,  as  well  as  a standstill  obligation.  They  would  both  be  able  to  freely exercise  the  voting  rights  attached  to  their  15%  direct shareholding,  with  a  15%  cap.  Renault  Group  would instruct  the  trustee  to  sell  the  entrusted  Nissan  shares  if commercially reasonable for Renault Group in a coordinated  and  orderly  process,  but  it  would  have  no obligation  to  sell  the  shares  within  a  specific  predetermined period of time. The Alliance Operating Board would remain the coordination forum.\n\nThis  announcement  has  no  impact  on  the  consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2022.\n\nI",

We  believe  that  the  audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements'section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code  de  commerce)  and  the  French  Code  of  Ethics  (code  de  d\u00e9ontologie)  for  statutory  auditors  for  the  period  from January 1 st , 2022 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating  to  the  justification  of  our  assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit  matters  relating  to  risks  of  material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese  matters  were  addressed  in  the  context  of  our  audit  of  the  financial  statements  as  a  whole,  and  in  forming  our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\nI\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nFinancial statements",

Their value in the  balance  sheet  is  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  share  of  each  of  these  companies,  fully  consolidated,  in  the shareholders' equity determined according to the rules of consolidation, without taking into account the elimination of transactions between group companies. The annual change  in the overall share of shareholders' equity corresponding to these  interests  is    recorded  in  shareholders'  equity  under  'Equity  valuation  difference'.  When  the  'equity  valuation difference' becomes negative, a provision for overall depreciation is accounted in the income statement.\n\nOther  investments,  i.e.  investments  in  non-exclusively  controlled  companies,  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  at acquisition cost, excluding incidental purchase expenses, and mainly concern Renault's investment in Nissan. They are valued at the lower of acquisition cost  or book value, taking into account the share of net assets and the profitability prospects. When the book value of the securities is lower than the gross value, a depreciation is recorded for the amount of the difference.\n\nThe assessment of the recoverable value of Renault's investment in Nissan requires judgement from management. As stated in note 4.1 of the financial statements, an impairment test was carried out on December 31, 2022, on the basis of profitability  assumptions  consistent  with  Nissan's  historical  data  and  with  future  medium  and  long  term  prudent assumption taking into account the new medium-term volume and exchange rate forecasts.\n\nIn this context, we have considered that the valuation of the investments was a key audit matter due to their importance in the company's financial statements and management's estimates and judgments necessary to determine the value in use of equity interests, particularly with regards to Renault's stake in Nissan.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe have reviewed the methodology used by management to determine the equity value of equity securities of companies controlled  exclusively  and  the  value  in  use  of  other  equity  securities  and  examined  the  methods  for  implementing  the impairment test as described in notes 2.1 of the annual financial statements.\n\nIn order to assess the reasonableness of the value in use of equity investments, we mainly relied on the work performed for the purpose of the consolidated financial statement audit. Our work mainly consisted in:\n\nRegarding Renault's investments in controlled companies:\n\n- \u25cf Check that the shareholders' equity in each of these investments corresponds to their contribution to the consolidated equity of Renault,\n- \u25cf Check that Renault has performed the necessary adjustments, if any, to take into account potential impairment losses accounted for in the group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nRegarding Renault's investment in Nissan:\n\n- \u25cf Assessing  whether  there  are  any  identified  impairment  indicators,  the  main  indicators  being  significant  adverse changes on markets where Nissan operates or a significant and long lasting drop in Nissan stock market value.\n- \u25cf Examining  the  relevance  of  the  main  assumptions  used  by  Renault  in  the  impairment  test  performed  to  assess  the recoverable value of its investment in Nissan, by reference to Nissan mid-term plan, historical performance achieved by Nissan as well as the overall perspectives of the Automotive sector.\n- \u25cf Understanding the conclusions and the work performed by the independent auditor of Nissan regarding the impairment test in accordance with our instructions which detail the procedures to be performed.\n- \u25cf Assessing the appropriateness of the information provided in the notes to the individual financial statements.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe  have  also  performed,  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  specific  verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe  have  no  matters  to  report  as  to  the  fair  presentation  and  the  consistency  with  the  financial  statements  of  the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders.",

Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a public  takeover  bid  or  exchange  offer,  provided  pursuant  to  Article  L.22-10-11  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  we  have agreed  this  information  to  the  source  documents  communicated  to  us.  Based  on  these  procedures,  we  have  no observations to make on this information.\n\n## Other information\n\nIn  accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling interests and the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights and the cross-shareholdings has been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the Annual Financial Report\n\nWe  have  also  verified,  in  accordance  with  the  professional  standard  applicable  in  France  relating  to  the  procedures performed  by  the  statutory  auditor  relating  to  the  annual  and  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the annual financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2,  I  of  the  French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code  (code  mon\u00e9taire  et financier), prepared under the responsibility of Chief Executive Officer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Renault by the Annual General Meeting held on April 30, 2014 for KPMG S.A. and on June 19, 2020 for MAZARS.\n\nAs at December  31,  2022,  KPMG  S.A.  was  in  the  nineth  year  of  total  uninterrupted  engagement  and MAZARS in the third year.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  in  accordance  with French  accounting  principles  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management  determines  is  necessary  to  enable  the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going  concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and  using  the  going  concern  basis  of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe  Audit  and  Risks  Committee  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  financial  reporting  process  and  the  effectiveness  of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nI",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25cf Identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25cf Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u25cf Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- \u25cf Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the  audit  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u25cf Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit and Risks Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Risks Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Risks Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors.

Statutory auditors' special report on the related party agreements\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of Renault S.A.,\n\nIn our capacity as statutory auditors of your Company, we hereby present to you our report on related party agreements.\n\nWe  are  required  to  inform  you,  on  the  basis  of  the  information  provided  to  us,  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  those agreements indicated to us, or that we may have identified in the performance of our engagement, as well as the reasons justifying  why  they  benefit  the  Company.  We  are  not  required  to  give  our  opinion,  as  to  whether  they  are  beneficial  or appropriate or to ascertain the existence of other agreements. It is your responsibility, in accordance with Article R. 225-31 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), to assess the relevance of these agreements prior to their approval.\n\nWe are also required, where applicable, to inform you in accordance with Article R. 225-31 of the French Commercial Code (Code  de  commerce)  of  the  continuation  of  the  implementation,  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  of  the agreements previously approved by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nWe performed those procedures which we deemed necessary in compliance with professional guidance issued by the French  Institute  of  Statutory  Auditors  (Compagnie  nationale  des  commissaires  aux  comptes)  relating  to  this  type  of engagement. These procedures consisted in verifying the consistency of the information provided to us with the relevant source documents.\n\n## Agreements submitted for approval to the Annual General Meeting\n\nWe hereby inform you that we have not been notified of any agreements authorized during the year ended December 31, 2022  to  be  submitted  to  the  Annual  General  Meeting  for  approval  in  accordance  with  Article  L.  225-38  of  the  French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\n## Agreements previously approved by the Annual General Meeting\n\n## Agreements approved in previous years which continued to be executed during the year under review\n\nIn accordance with Article R. 225-30 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we have been notified that the implementation  of  the  following  agreements,  which  were  approved  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  in  prior  years, continued during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## With the French State, shareholder of your Company\n\n## Persons concerned\n\nMr Thomas Courbe and Mr Alexis Zajdenweber, Board members of your Company representing the French State.\n\n## Governance Agreement\n\n## Nature and purpose\n\nOn December 11, 2015, your Board of Directors authorized the conclusion of a 'Governance Agreement' between Renault and the French State which aims to regulate the exercise of voting rights attached to the Renault S.A. shares held by the French State.\n\n## Conditions\n\nPursuant to the authorization granted by your Board of Directors, on February 4, 2016 and by your Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2016, your Company has signed concurrently with the French State a Governance Agreement under which the voting rights attached to the French State's shares exceeding a certain percentage of Renault's total exercisable rights (set at 17.9% in the event of a \"usual\" quorum, or at 20% in the event of a particularly high quorum) are, in certain cases, exercised  in  a  neutral  manner,  that  is  to  say  in  such  a  way  that  they  do  not  affect  the  adoption  or  rejection  of  the resolutions  concerned  by  the  limitation.  The  written  agreement  also  describes  the  conditions  for  implementing  these restrictions with the registrar of Renault S.A.\n\nThe restriction to the free exercise of voting rights of the French State notably applies to all decisions which fall within the authority  of  the  Ordinary  Annual  General  Meeting,  except  for  decisions  concerning  (i)  dividend  distributions,  (ii)  the appointment,  renewal  or  removal  from  office  of  Board  members  representing  the  French  State,  (iii)  the  disposal  of significant Company's assets, (iv) related-party agreements that are not approved by the representatives of the French State and (v) buybacks of shares from identified shareholders.\n\nHowever, the French State retains all of its voting rights for decisions which fall within the authority of the Extraordinary Annual General Meeting, except for the most day-to-day decision-making such as (i) the granting or renewal of ongoing delegations to the management bodies of your Company when their conditions comply with the latter's existing practices,\n\nI",

Ltd of voting rights in your Company, the announcement of a public offering on your Company's shares, or a shareholder exceeding the threshold of 15% in your Company's capital or voting rights, including Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.\n\nThe  governance  agreement  is  completed  by  a  technical  agreement,  describing  more  precisely  conditions  of  the implementation of these restrictions with the registrar of Renault S.A.\n\nThe governance agreement was concluded on April 4, 2016, for a period of 20 years and is renewable by tacit agreement for successive periods of ten years unless it is terminated at least two years before the expiry of the term.\n\n## With Nissan Motor Co.

This agreement specifies the operational terms and conditions of Renault-Nissan B.V. ('RNBV') as the corporate entity involved in defining the Alliance's strategy.\n\nAn initial amendment to the 'Restated Alliance Master Agreement' was signed on April 29, 2005 and submitted for the approval of the Annual General Meeting of May 4, 2006.\n\nIn  its  meeting  of  October  3,  2012,  your  Board  of  Directors  authorized  the  signature,  on  November  7,  2012,  of  a  second amendment to the 'Restated Alliance Master Agreement', which modifies the composition of the RNBV Executive Board and as a result, the voting arrangements within the Executive Board. This amendment was submitted to the approval of your general meeting of April 30, 2013.\n\nIn its meeting on December 11, 2015, your Board of Directors authorized the signature of a governance agreement between your  Company  and  Nissan  Motor  Co.  Ltd.  concerning  the  governance  of  Nissan  Motor  Co.,  which  constitutes  a  third amendment to the 'Restated Alliance Master Agreement'.\n\nThe  conditions  of  this  third  amendment  concern  your  Company's  undertaking  (i)  to  vote  in  favour  of  the  resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors of Nissan to the Annual General Meeting of Nissan for the appointment, dismissal and compensation of the members of the Board of Directors of Nissan (other than the members appointed upon proposal of your Company, (ii) not to submit a resolution to the Annual General Meeting of Nissan that would not have been approved by the Board of Directors of Nissan , and (iii) not to vote in favour of a resolution that would not be supported by the Board of Directors of Nissan.\n\nFor these resolutions, your Company remains free to vote as it sees fit, however, in the event that your Company does not comply with its commitment, Nissan may acquire Renault's shares without the prior approval of your Board of Directors, notwithstanding the provisions of the Restated Alliance Agreement which prevent the parties from increasing, without prior agreement, their respective holdings. The amendment modifies the 'Restated Alliance Master Agreement' without altering  its  term,  which  remains  indefinite.  It  has  been  applicable  since  it  was  entered  into.  This  agreement  has  been approved by the Annual General Meeting of April 29, 2016.",

Notes to the financial statements\n\nThe  following  disclosures  constitute  the  notes  to  the balance sheet at 31 December 2022, before appropriation of  net  profit  for  the  year,  which  shows  total  assets  of \u20ac34 535 million and to the income statement for the year then ended, which shows net profit of \u20ac364 million.\n\nThe financial statements cover the twelve-month period from 1 January to 31 December 2022.\n\nThe financial statements for 2022 were approved for issue by  the  Board  of  Directors'  meeting  of  Renault  S.A.  on 15 February 2023.\n\nThese financial statements are included in the consolidated financial statements of Group Renault.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.1. Significant events\n\nNissan's exercise ended on 31 March 2022 with a net profit of \u20ac1,598 million (Y216 billion) and Renault S.A. received \u20ac64 million (Y9 billion) dividend from Nissan during 2022.\n\nTo maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for its operations, in 2022 the Group issued two bonds the Japanese market as part of Renault's Shelf Registration program, for a total of  \u00a5290.7  billion.  And  the  Group  made  \u20ac2,010  million repayment in 2022 of its State-guaranteed credit facility. At the date of publication of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has sufficient cash and sources of financing to  ensure  continuity  of  operations  for  the  next twelve  months  and  has  demonstrated  its  capacity  to issue debt.\n\nTo engage all employees in the Group's new strategy and future performance as in-depth changes are being made,\n\nRenault  Group  launched  Renaulution  Shareplan,  an employee  shareholding  operation  attributing  6  free shares to more than 95 000 employees across 22 countries. In 21 countries, the plan  also  offers employees  the  opportunity  to  buy  shares  at  a  30% discount. As the reference share price in the Renaulution Shareplan  is  set  at  \u20ac31.46,  the  discounted  share  price  is \u20ac22.02.  The  cost  of  this  plan  has  been  recognized  in  the 2022 financial statements.\n\nAt  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  May  25,  2022, upon  the  proposal  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  it  was decided not to distribute a dividend for 2021.\n\nOn 10 July 2022, Renault SA set up a liquidity contract.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.2. Accounting policies\n\nRenault S.A. has drawn up its annual financial statements in  accordance with the provisions of regulations 2014-03 of the ANC (Autorit\u00e9 des Normes Comptables), approved by the ministerial decision of September  8,  2014 concerning the French chart of accounts.\n\nThe  following  methods  were  applied  in  valuing  balance sheet and income statement items:\n\n- \u25cf the going concern principle,\n- \u25cf consistency of methods,\n- \u25cf accruals-basis  accounting,  and  applying  the  general rules for preparation  and  presentation  of  annual financial statements.\n\nThe  basic  method  used  to  value  items  recorded  in  the accounting records is the historical cost method.",

Investments\n\nAs allowed by CNC (Conseil National de la Comptabilit\u00e9) notice N\u00b034 (July 1988), as an alternative to the standard valuation method for investments carried in the balance sheet,  Renault  S.A.  has  opted  to  state  investments  in wholly-controlled companies at equity:\n\n- \u25cf this  method  is  applied  to  all  companies  that  are  fully consolidated in the Group's financial statements;\n- \u25cf the shareholders' equity of these companies  is determined under the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements; as this is a valuation method,  intercompany  eliminations  are  not  taken  into account;\n- \u25cf in valuing a subsidiary, its holdings in companies wholly controlled by the Group are valued in the same way;\n- \u25cf the change during the year in the overall percentage of shareholders' equity corresponding to these interests is not an income or loss item; it is included in shareholders' equity under \"Equity valuation difference\". This amount cannot be distributed or used to offset losses. When it is negative, a provision for general depreciation is established as a charge against income.\n\nInvestments in companies not wholly controlled by Renault S.A. are valued at acquisition cost, less related expenses, or at  their  book  value  if  this  is  lower.  The  book  value  takes account  of  the  share  of  net  assets  and  profitability prospects.  Provisions  are  established  when  the  book  value of the investments is lower than the gross value.\n\nLoans  granted  and  receivables  relating  to  subsidiaries and affiliates are recorded at historical cost. Impairment is recognized when there is a risk that these advances will not be recovered.\n\n## B. Marketable securities\n\nMarketable  securities  are  valued  at  acquisition  cost, excluding  related  expenses  and  accrued  interest  for bonds, or at market value if this is lower.\n\nTreasury shares held for the purposes of free share plans and  stock  option  plans  and  the  liquidity  contract  are included  in  marketable  securities.  These  shares  are covered by a provision for expenses, corresponding to the difference  between  the  value  of  the  shares  (acquisition price or net book value at the date of reallocation) and the exercise price of the options for beneficiaries, when that exercise price is lower than the acquisition cost.\n\nTreasury shares not allocated to a specific plan are also included in marketable securities. Impairment is recorded if the stock market price falls below the book value.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  securities  is  determined  mainly  by reference to market prices.\n\n## C. Receivables\n\nReceivables  are  stated  at  nominal  value.  Impairment  is recognizsed  when  their  realizable  value  falls  below historical cost, notably based on age and the risk of nonrecovery.\n\n## D. Translation  of  foreign  currency  receivables  and\n\n## liabilities\n\nReceivables and liabilities denominated  in  foreign currencies are translated as follows:\n\n- \u25cf all  receivables  and  liabilities  in  foreign  currencies  are converted at the year-end exchange rate;\n- \u25cf exchange  differences  arising  between  the  date  of transactions  and  December  31  are  recorded  in  Other assets and Deferred income (translation adjustment);\n- \u25cf a  provision  for  risk  equal  to  the  unrealised  exchange losses is established after determining an overall foreign exchange position for each currency (including derivatives).\n\nUnrealized  losses  affecting  Nissan  hedge  are  no  longer covered  by  provisions  in  the  income  statement.  Under regulation ANC 2015-05, no provisions are recorded in the income  statement  for  unrealized  losses  on  the  hedging instrument until the hedged cash flows are realized (date of liquidation or sale of the investment).\n\n## E. Redeemable shares\n\nRedeemable  shares  are  recorded  in  a  separate  line  of shareholders' equity at nominal value with no subsequent revaluation.\n\n## F. Loans and financial debts\n\nLoans  are  stated  at  their  nominal  amount.  Loan  costs, including  issuance  expenses,  and  bond  redemption premiums,  which  are  recorded  in  Other  Assets,  are amortised on a straight-line basis over the corresponding duration.\n\n## G. Provisions for risks and liabilities\n\nProvisions for risks and liabilities are defined in accordance  with  ANC  regulation  2014-03.  They  are established for probable payment obligations existing at the  year-end.  A  contingent  liability,  in  contrast,  is  an obligation that is neither probable nor definite at the date the  financial  statements  are  established,  or  a  probable obligation  that  cannot  be  reliably  estimated.  Provisions are  not  established  for  contingent  liabilities,  but  an  offbalance sheet commitment is reported where relevant.\n\n## H. Derivatives\n\nChanges  in  the  value  of  hedging  derivatives  are  not recognized  in  the  balance  sheet  unless  partial  or  total recognition  of  such  changes  is  relevant  to  ensure symmetrical treatment to the hedged item .\n\nThis  symmetrical treatment would involve revaluation of the  hedging  instrument  in  a  transition  account,  with  a corresponding  entry  in  a  Cash  Instrument  account,  in parallel  to  the  translation  adjustments  booked  on  the hedged item.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses on loans set up for the Nissan hedge have no longer been included in profit and loss since the application of ANC regulation 2015-05 form 1 January  2017.  They  are  recorded  in  specific  accounts under  other  receivables  or  other  liabilities  and  the accumulated amounts will  be  transferred  to  the  income statement  at  the  date  of  liquidation  or  sale  of  the investment.\n\nI",

If the market value indicates an unrealized loss, an  equivalent  provision  is  recognized  in  the  income statement.\n\nThe  positive  or  negative  difference  between  the  spot price  and  the  forward  price  of  the  hedge  is  spread  over the duration of the hedge in the financial result.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.3.

Foreign exchange gains and losses\n\nForeign  exchange  gains  and  losses  in  2022  amount  to \u20ac3 million (\u20ac4 million in 2021), and comprise the following:\n\n- \u25cf A  foreign  exchange  gain  of  \u20ac3,5  million  on  treasury notes (mainly in US Dollar and Pound).\n- \u25cf A  foreign  exchange  loss  of  \u20ac0,5  million  on  dividends received from Sofasa.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.5. Other financial income and expenses\n\nIn 2022, the financial income and expenses, amounting to a  net  loss  of  \u20ac277  million  (loss  of  \u20ac236  million  in  2021) principally  comprise  interest  paid  and  similar  expenses totaling \u20ac267 million, \u20ac8 million for impairment on treasury shares.\n\n## Assumptions and methods used\n\nUnrealised foreign exchange gains and losses correspond to the difference between the spot price and the year-end price.\n\n## I. Net extraordinary items\n\nExceptional  items  are  revenues  and  expenses  resulting from events or transactions that are clearly distinct from the  company's  normal  business  operations,  and  are  not expected to recur on a frequent or regular basis.",

There  were  no  other  financial  expenses recognised in 2021.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.6. Extraordinary items\n\nIn  March 2021, Renault SA sold its involvement in Daimler AG for a sum of \u20ac1 143 million. The disposal of the shares, with  a  historical  value  of  \u20ac584  million,  resulted  in  an exceptional profit of \u20ac558 million.\n\nThere are no extraordinary operations in 2022.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.7. Income tax\n\nAs Renault S.A. elected to determine French income taxes under the domestic tax consolidation regime when it was formed,  this  regime  has  applied  to  the  group  in  which Renault  S.A.  is  taxed  in  France  since  January  1,  2004. French  subsidiaries  that  are  more  than  95%  owned  by Renault  S.A.  pay  their  income  taxes  directly  to  the company  under  this  regime.  Each  entity  included  in  the domestic  tax  consolidation  records  its  theoretical  taxes as if it was taxed separately. The tax saving generated by this  system  is  treated  as  income  for  Renault  S.A.,  the company  heading  the  group  of  entities  concerned.  The Renault  tax  group,  applying  the  principle  of  neutrality, Renault S.A. is not obliged to reallocate or reimburse the subsidiaries  for  the  tax  savings  resulting  from  utilization of their tax losses.\n\nThe  maximum  allowable  amount  of  losses  carried forward against taxable income is \u20ac1 million plus 50% of the taxable income above that amount. The balance can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nThese rules are applicable:\n\n- \u25cf for determining the income/loss of the tax consolidation group;\n- \u25cf by convention, for determining the income/loss of each company included in the tax consolidation serving as a base for their calculation of income tax.\n\nThese rules on tax loss carryforwards apply to all losses existing at the year-end, whatever their origin.\n\nIn  practice,  Renault  S.A.  has  not  charged  deficits  for  the determination of its 2022 taxable income which amounts to -\u20ac1 835 million.\n\nIn  2022,  the  tax  consolation  group  waived  the  reduced rate  on  industrial  royalties  as  permitted  by  article 39 terdecies of the CGI.\n\nThe  income  generated  by  income  taxes  in  2022  was \u20ac132 million, corresponding to the income tax paid by the subsidiaries of Renault S.A., including any tax adjustments, as if they were taxed separately.\n\nI",

Ltd.  At  December  31,  2022,  this  investment comprised 1,831,837,027 shares or 43.40% of the capital of Nissan.  These  shares  are  listed  on  the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange and have a nominal value of Y50. At December 31,  2022,  their  stock  market  price  was  Y418  (\u20ac2,97)  per share,  giving  a  total  of  \u20ac5  441  million  (Y556  (\u20ac4,26)  per share and a total of \u20ac7 804 million at December 31, 2021).\n\nBased on the Nissan share price at December 31, 2022, 418 yen per share, the Renault Group's investment in Nissan is valued  at  \u20ac5,441  million  (\u20ac7,804  million  at  December  31, 2021 based on a share price of 556 yen).\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  the  stock  market  value  of  the investment was 12.48% lower than the value of Nissan in Renault Group's statement of financial position.\n\nIn  application  of  the  approach  presented  in  the  Note  on accounting policies, an impairment test was carried out at December  31,  2022.  An  after-tax  discount  rate  of  7.73% and  a  growth  rate  to  infinity  (including  the  effect  of inflation) of 1.42% were used to calculate value in use. The terminal value was calculated under profitability assumptions  consistent  with  Nissan's  past  data  and conservative medium and long-term prospects, incorporating  new  medium-term  forecasts  for  volumes and exchange rates.\n\nThe  test  result  did  not  lead  to  recognition  of  any impairment on the investment in Nissan at December 31, 2022  and  it  is  considered  that  a  reasonably  possible change in the main assumptions used should not result in a  recoverable  value  lower  than  the  book  value  of  the investment in Nissan.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.9.

At  December  31,  2020,  \u20ac4  billion  had  been drawn on this credit line.\n\nThe  initial  maturity  for  each  drawing  was  12  months, extendable  by  Renault  Group  for  a  further  three  years, with repayment of one third each year. The interest rate on each drawing was indexed on the 12-month Euribor for the first year, then the 6-month Euribor for any extensions. If extended, these credit drawings were repayable in onethird instalments  in  2022,  2023  and  2024  on  the anniversary  dates  of  the  initial  drawings,  with  the possibility of early repayment of outstanding instalments at Renault Group's initiative.\n\nThe  Group  exercised  the  extension  options  on  all  these drawings except for the drawing maturing in August 2021, of which \u20ac1 billion was repaid.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.16. Other liabilities\n\nChanges in other liabilities were as follows:\n\n| (in Euro million)                      | At start of year   | Variation   | At year-end   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Trade payables and related accounts    | -                  |             | -             |\n| Social liabilities                     | 3                  | (1)         | 2             |\n| Tax liabilities *                      | 620                | (38)        | 582           |\n| Liabilities related to other assets    | 5                  |             | 5             |\n| Other liabilities                      | 2                  |             | 2             |\n| TOTAL                                  | 630                | (39)        | 591           |\n| * Current portion (less than one year) | 215                |             | 213           |\n| Long-term portion (over 1 year)        | 415                |             | 377           |\n\nThe variation in tax liabilities is mainly due to a \u20ac38 million increase in the tax consolidation.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.17. Unrealized gains on financial instruments\n\nThese are unrealized foreign exchange gains on treasury notes in US dollars and borrowings in yen that are no longer part of the Nissan hedge.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.18. Deferred income\n\nDeferred income comprises unrealized foreign exchange gains on borrowings issued in yen or swapped to yen, and a  foreign  exchange  gain  on  repayment  of  borrowings\n\nissued in yen used for the Nissan hedge, which is recorded in a cash  instrument  valuation  difference  account, amounts to \u20ac18 million.\n\nI\n\nAs announced on February 18, 2022, the Group made three early repayments in 2022 \u20ac340 million each, on February 7, March  22  and  June  23  corresponding  to  the  final instalments  (August,  September  and  December  2024)  of the three drawings. After the three repayments made at maturity during the second half-year, totalling \u20ac990  million,  the  outstanding  amount  of  the  Stateguaranteed credit facility at the year-end is \u20ac990 million. The total amount will be repaid in 2023.\n\n## C. Other loans and financial debts\n\nOther loans and financial debts amounted to \u20ac3 848 million at December 31, 2022 (\u20ac3 973 million in 2021), and principally comprise:\n\n- \u25cf \u20ac2,918 million in borrowings from Group subsidiaries with surplus cash;\n- \u25cf \u20ac930 million in treasury notes.\n\nNo loans or financial debts are secured or have a duration over 1 year.\n\nNo loans are secured by security rights.",

Financial instruments\n\n## Management of exchange and interest rate risk\n\nThe corresponding commitments, expressed in terms of notional amount where appropriate, are shown below:\n\n|                                            | 2022     | 2022       | 2021     | 2021        |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|------------|----------|-------------|\n| (In Euro million )                         | Notional | Fair value | Notional | Fair valuer |\n| Currency swaps                             | 1,376    | (27)       | 1,423    | (9)         |\n| Other forward exchange contracts Purchases | 736      | 11         | 402      | 16          |\n\nAll the operations are with Renault Finance.\n\nForward purchases and sales and swap transactions are off-balance sheet.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk:\n\nForeign exchange risk management essentially comprises  currency  swaps  and  forward  exchange operations  to  cover  Renault's  own  foreign-currency financing. Renault S.A. also undertakes forward exchange operations  to  hedge  loans  and  borrowings  in  foreign currencies with its subsidiaries.\n\n## Interest rate risk:\n\nRenault S.A. carries most of the Group's indebtedness. Its interest  rate  risk  management  policy  applies  two  basic principles: long-term investments use fixed-rate financing,  and  investments  for  liquidity  reserves  use floating-rate  financing.

It therefore regularly borrows on the banking and capital markets to refinance its debt, and this exposes it to a liquidity risk in the event of market closure or tensions over  credit  availability.  As  part  of  its  centralised  cash management policy, Renault S.A. handles most refinancing for the automotive operating segment via the capital  markets  through  long-term  resources  (bond issues, private placements) and short-term financing such as treasury notes, or by bank financing.\n\nRenault  S.A.  also  has  confirmed  credit  agreements  with banking establishments (see note 5.2.4.2.20).\n\nThe  contractual  documentation  for  these  financing arrangements and credit agreements contains no clause that might adversely affect credit availability as a result of  a  change  in  Renault's  credit  rating  or  financial  ratio compliance.\n\nGiven the available cash reserves, confirmed credit lines unused at the year-end, and the prospects for renewal of short-term financing, Renault S.A. has sufficient financial resources  to  cover  its  commitments  over  a  12-month horizon.",

Accepted tax adjustments are recorded as provisions in the financial statements. Contested tax adjustments are recognized on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the risk that the proceedings or appeals undertaken may be unsuccessful. Tax  liabilities are recognized  via provisions when  there  are uncertainties over the determination of taxes.\n\nOn 19 December 2021, Renault S.A. received a provisional notification  of  a  tax  reassessment  in  respect  of  transfer pricing  for  the  years  2013  to  2016.  Renault  Group  is challenging  the  most  significant  amounts  of  these notifications, and no provision has been recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2022 in connection with this matter.\n\nOn December 19, 2019 Renault s.a.s received notification, interrupting  the  limitation  period,  of  a  tax  reassessment on  transfer  prices  in  2016,  and  an  additional  notification was received on June 24, 2021 concerning the years 2017 and 2018. On December 21, 2022, the French tax authorities issued a proposed reassessment for the year 2019 relating to a further inspection covering the period 2019-2020, also interrupting the relevant limitation period. Renault Group is  challenging  the  most  significant  amounts  of  these notifications, and no provision has been recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2022 in connection with this matter.\n\n## Other information\n\n## 5.2.4.2.21.

When the resulting financial consequences are  accepted,  they  are  recognized  in  the  financial statements via provisions. When they are contested, they are  recognized  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  based  on estimates  that  take  into  account  the  risk  that  the proceedings or appeals undertaken may be unsuccessful.\n\nThe main investigations by the competition and automotive regulation authorities in progress at December  31,  2022  concern  illegal  agreements  and  the level of vehicle emissions in Europe.\n\nIn  the  ongoing  'emissions'  affair  in  France,  in  which  a formal legal investigation was opened on January 12, 2017 at  the  request  of  the  Paris  public  prosecution  office, Renault s.a.s. was officially placed under investigation for deceit on June 8, 2021.\n\nIn July 2021 Renault Group paid bail of \u20ac20 million (included in  the  balance  sheet)  to  guarantee  its  representation throughout the proceedings and to cover payment of any damages  and  fines.  It  also  issued  a  \u20ac60  million  bank guarantee on October 8, 2021 to cover compensation for any  prejudice  identified.  Renault  Group  denies  having committed  any  offence.  All  Renault  Group  vehicles  are, and always have been, type-approved in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  the  next  steps  in  these ongoing  proceedings  cannot  be  reliably  estimated,  and no  provision  was  recognized  in  connection  with  this matter at December 31, 2022 (nor at December 31, 2021).",

Subsequent events\n\nNissan Motor CO Ltd and Renault Group have decided to rebalance  the  Alliance  with  a  15%  cross-shareholding, with a retention obligation, as well as an obligation to cap their holdings. They will both be able to freely exercise the voting  rights  attached  to  their  15%  direct  shareholding, with a 15% cap.\n\nRenault Group will transfer 28.4% of its Nissan shares into a French trust, where voting rights would be \"neutralised\" for most decisions, but where economic rights (dividends and  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  the  shares)  will  still  fully benefit Renault Group until the sale of those shares.\n\nRenault Group will instruct the trustee to sell these Nissan shares  if  the  economic  conditions  are  reasonable  for Renault Group, in an organised and orderly process, but it has  no  obligation  to  sell  its  shares  within  a  specific predetermined timeframe.\n\nThe Alliance Operating Board will remain the coordinating body.\n\nThis  decision  has  no  impact  on  the  valuation  of  Nissan Motor CO Ltd shares in the Renault S.A. balance sheet at the close of December 31, 2022.\n\nI",

Annual General Meetings\n\n## 6.1.2.4. Identifiable bearer shares\n\nAnnual  General  Meetings  are  convened  in  accordance with applicable legal and regulatory provisions. The right to  attend  Annual  General  Meetings  is  evidenced  by  the registration of the shares in an account in the name of the shareholder or in the name of the registered intermediary acting  on  his/her  behalf,  by  midnight  (zero  hours)  Paris time  on  the  second  working  day  before  the  Annual General  Meeting,  either  in  the  registered  share  account held by the Company or in the bearer share accounts held by an authorized intermediary. The registration of bearer shares  in  the  share  records  held  by  the  authorized intermediary  is  evidenced  by  a  shareholding  certificate issued by this intermediary.\n\n## 6.1.2.3. Shares and voting rights\n\nShares  are  registered  in  an  account  according  to  the provisions  and  terms  established  by  law.  Fully  paid-up shares  are  in  either  registered  or  bearer  form,  at  the discretion  of  their  owner.  However,  shares  that  are  not fully paid-up must be in registered form.\n\nEach  shareholder  has  as  many  votes  as  he  or  she  owns shares, subject to the provisions below.\n\nSince April 3, 2016, pursuant to Article L. 225-123 of the French Commercial  Code,  as  amended  by  Law  No.  2014-384  of March 29, 2014 (the Florange Law), unless provided otherwise in Renault  S.A.'s  Bylaws  adopted  subsequently  to  the promulgation of the Florange Law, a voting right  double  to that conferred to other shares is automatically attributed to all  fully  paid-up  shares  for  which  proof  of  registration  is provided  for  at  least  two  years  in  the  name  of  the  same shareholder.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, 104,899,372 Renault shares held double  voting  rights,  representing  around  35.5  %  of  the share capital and around 68.4 % of the voting rights that may be exercised in Renault's Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  double  voting  right  automatically  ceases  for  any share that has been converted to a bearer share or that has  undergone  a  transfer  of  ownership,  subject  to  any exceptions provided for by law.\n\nShares  resulting  from  the  capital  increase,  earnings  or other  paid-in  capital  are  entitled  to  double  voting  rights from their date of issue if they are attributed on account of shares already enjoying such rights.\n\nIn  addition,  treasury  shares  do  not  carry  voting  rights.\n\n- At  December  31,  2022,  the  theoretical  number  of  voting rights was 400,621,656.\n\nIn  view  of  the  treasury  shares  (5,310,961)  and  the  shares held  by  Nissan  Finance  Co.,  Ltd.  (44,358,343,  see  chapter 6.2.6.1 below), all of which are non-voting shares, the total number of exercisable voting rights was 306,705,509 as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe  Company  is  authorized  to  make  use  of  the appropriate legal  provisions  for  identifying  shareholders having  immediate  or  future  voting  rights  in  its  own Shareholders' General Meetings.\n\n## 6.1.2.5. Shareholding disclosures\n\nIn  addition  to  the  legal  requirement  for  shareholders  to inform  the  Company if  they  hold  certain  percentages  of its share capital or voting rights, every shareholder or fund management company that comes into possession of a number of shares above 2% of the share capital or voting rights,  or  a  multiple  of  this  percentage  representing  less than or equal to 5% of the share capital or voting rights, shall  inform  the  Company  of  the  total  number  of  shares held.  Such  disclosure  shall  be  made  by  registered  letter with  return  receipt  within  four  (4)  business  days  starting from  the  date  of  registration  of  the  shares  that  brought the shareholder's interest up to or beyond the threshold. Beyond  5%,  the  aforementioned  disclosure  requirement applies to fractions of share capital or voting rights of 1%.\n\nFor the purposes of determining the thresholds described above, indirectly held shares or equity equivalents held as defined by the provisions of Articles L. 233-7 and L. 233-9 of the  French  Commercial  Code  will  also  be  taken  into account.\n\nThe declarer must certify that this declaration includes all shares  held  or  owned  as  per  the  provisions  of  the preceding  paragraph  and  must  indicate  the  acquisition date(s).  The  disclosure  requirement  applies  in  the  same manner  if  the  holding  of  shares  falls  below  any  of  the aforementioned thresholds, 2% or 1% as applicable.\n\nIf  the  conditions  described above are not complied with, any shares exceeding the fraction that should have been declared  shall  be  deprived  of  its  voting  rights  at  any Shareholders'  General  Meetings  held  in  a  period  of  two years  following  the  date  of  due  notification,  in  so  far  as this is requested  at  the  meeting  by  one  or  more shareholders  who  together  hold  at  least  1%  of  share capital.\n\n## Threshold crossings in 2022\n\nIn  2022,  the  Company  received  declarations  for  the crossing of the legal threshold of 5% of the voting rights, alternately  upwards  and  downwards,  from  Bank  of America,  acting  on  behalf  of  clients  and  funds  under  its management. Bank of America's most recent notification, dated  September  1,  2022,  indicated  that  it  held  1.07%  of the  Company's  share  capital  and  0.79%  of  its  voting rights.\n\nI",

Pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 225-209-2 of the French Commercial Code, the seventeenth resolution of the Combined General Meeting of 19 June 2020 authorized the Company to trade in its own shares so as to allow it to benefit from the opportunities granted by applicable law. The authorization was granted until 19 June 2021 . A new share buyback program was authorized by the Annual General Meeting of 23 April 2021, rendering the program authorized on 19 June 2020 ineffective from the date of said meeting. In June 2021, Renault acquired 1,010,000 of its own shares as part of the share buyback program approved by the Annual General Meeting of 23 April 2021. vvsvsvs ly or indirectly by Renault at December 31, 2021, are allocated in their entirety to the fulfilment of free performance share plans or any other form of allocation, allotment or transfer granted to employees or senior executives of the Company. The shares acquired by the beneficiaries of share-based compensation (Long-Term Incentives) must not have any effect on the share capital structure.

and\n- v. more generally, perform all other transactions currently allowed or that would become authorized or allowed by applicable laws or regulatory provisions or by the AMF.\n\nThe  acquisition,  disposal,  transfer  or  exchange  of  these shares may be performed by any means, notably on the market or through over-the-counter transactions, including block trading, using derivative financial instruments or bonds or securities granting access to the Company's  share  capital,  or  by  implementing  option strategies, within the bounds of applicable regulations.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting sets:\n\n- \u25cf the  maximum  purchase  price  (or  the  counter-value  of this  amount  on  the  same  date  in  any  other  currency), excluding  acquisition  costs,  at  \u20ac100  per  share,  and  the maximum amount of funds allocated for the completion of  the  share  purchase  program  at  \u20ac957.25  million,  it being  specified  that  in  the  event  of  transactions affecting the share capital (splitting or consolidation of shares or bonus share allocations to shareholders), the price  and  the  maximum  amount  of  funds  allocated  for the  completion  of  the  share  purchase  program  will  be adjusted on the basis of a multiplying factor equal to the ratio  of  the  number  of  securities  constituting  the  share capital prior to the transaction compared with the total number after the transaction;\n- \u25cf the number of shares that may be acquired at 10% of the shares constituting the share capital, it being specified that  (a)  this  limit  applies  to  a  given  amount  of  the Company's share capital, to be adjusted if necessary to take  into  account  transactions  affecting  the  share capital subsequent to this Annual General Meeting and (b)  if  the  aim  of  the  share  buyback  is  to  enhance  share liquidity  pursuant  to  the  conditions  set  out  in  the  AMF General  Regulations,  the  number  of  shares  taken  into account  to  calculate  the  10%  limit  corresponds  to  the number  of  shares  purchased,  minus  the  number  of shares resold during the authorization period.\n\nWithin  the  limits  allowed  by  the  applicable  regulations, transactions  performed  by  the  Board  of  Directors pursuant to this authorization may take place at any time during the validity of the share buyback program, it being specified that if a public bid for the Company's stocks is made  by  a  third  party,  the  Board  of  Directors  may  not implement this authorization, and the Company may not pursue any share purchase program until after the end of the bid period, except in the case of prior authorization by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nPursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  225-210  of  the French  Commercial  Code,  the  Company  may  not  own more than 10% of the total of its own shares, or more than 10% of any given share category, either directly or through any  person  acting  in  their  own  name  on  behalf  of  the Company.\n\nAll powers are granted to the Board of Directors, including powers of sub-delegation, to implement this authorization, specify, if necessary, its terms, decide on its conditions and, in particular, place all orders on or off the stock  market,  assign  or  reassign  the  shares  acquired  to the  different  purposes  pursued  in  compliance  with applicable  legal  and  regulatory  conditions,  perform  all formalities,  and,  more generally, do all that is required in this respect.",

At  December  31,  2022,  this  was distributed as follows:\n\n- \u25cf the  French  State  held  15.01%  of  the  share  capital corresponding to 22.16% of theoretical voting rights and 28.94% of exercisable voting rights in Renault (excluding the  application  of  the  restrictions  described  in  chapter 6.2.6.2 of the Universal registration document);\n- \u25cf the  Nissan  group,  through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary Nissan  Finance  Co.,  Ltd.,  held  15.00%  of  Renault's  share capital  (unchanged  compared  with  December  31,  2021). However, Nissan Finance Co., Ltd. is not entitled to exercise the voting rights attached to these shares pursuant to the provisions  of  Article  L.  233-31  of  the  French  Commercial Code,  owing  to  Renault's  ownership  interest  in  Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., parent company of Nissan Finance Co., Ltd;\n- \u25cf Renault's employees and former employees own 3.79% of  the  share  capital,  including  2.92%  via  FCPE  mutual funds  under  collective  management  and  0.87%  by employee beneficiaries of performance share allocations since the 2016 plan;\n- \u25cf treasury  stock  represented  1.80%  of  the  share  capital. Under French law, such shares do not carry voting rights;\n- \u25cf the  free  float  represented  64.40%  of  the  share  capital (compared with 64.83% at December 31, 2021); and\n- \u25cf the  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  together  and directly  hold  less  than  0.5%  of  the  Company's  share capital.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, aside from The Capital Group Companies, Inc. (5.05%), no other shareholder holds more than 5% of the capital or voting rights, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert, other than the French State or Nissan Finance Co., Ltd.\n\nA survey of Renault SA shareholders was conducted as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThis  survey  gave  an  estimated  breakdown  of  the  public ownership's  interest  by  category  of  major  shareholder. At that date:\n\n- \u25cf the institutional shareholders owned 48.99% of Renault's share capital, it being stated that:\n- \u25cf French institutional investors held 11.04% of the share capital;\n- \u25cf foreign institutional investors held 37.95% of the share capital; and\n- \u25cf the 10 largest French and foreign institutional investors held approximately 21.62% of the share capital.\n- \u25cf the remaining public ownership in the capital i.e. 15.41% was held primarily by individual shareholders.\n\nI",

Shareholder agreements on shares and voting rights of the Company\n\nTo the best knowledge of the Company, and as at the date of  this  Universal  Registration  Document,  there  are  no shareholder agreement governing relations between the Company's shareholders and no concerted actions.\n\n## Restrictions on the free exercise of voting rights attached to shares held by the French State\n\nIn the context of the discussions conducted, on the one hand, between  Renault  and  Nissan  and  on  the  other  between Renault  and  the  French  State,  to  restore  the  balance between  the  investments  of  these  two  shareholders  in Renault,  and  on  this  occasion,  to  ensure  the  continuity  and development of the Alliance, on February 4, 2016, Renault and the  French  State  entered  into  a  governance  agreement aimed at restricting the free exercise of the French State's voting  rights  in  respect  of  certain  decisions  submitted  to Renault's Annual General Meeting.\n\nThis  limitation  varies  depending  on  the  quorum  reached at the Annual General Meeting:\n\n- \u25cf if the  shareholders  attending  or  represented  at  the Annual General Meeting in question own maximum 70% of  the  shares  with  voting  rights  (either  single  or  double voting  rights),  the  French  State's  freely  exercisable voting  rights  are  capped  at  17.9%  of  the  exercisable voting rights; and\n- \u25cf if  the  shareholders  attending  or  represented  at  the Annual General Meeting in question own more than 70% of  the  shares  with  voting  rights  (either  single  or  double voting  rights),  the  French  State's  freely  exercisable voting  rights  are  capped  at  20%  of  the  exercisable voting rights.\n\nBeyond  this  applicable  capping  threshold,  the  French State's voting rights are exercised in a neutral way, i.e.:\n\n- \u25cf at  50%  in  favor,  and  50%  against,  the  adoption  of ordinary resolutions;\n- \u25cf at  66\u2154%  in  favor,  and  33\u2153%  against,  the  adoption  of extraordinary resolutions; and\n- \u25cf in full for the adoption of resolutions requiring shareholder unanimity.\n\nThe French State's neutralized voting rights do not have an impact on the outcome of the vote for resolutions subject to capping, unlike voting rights that are freely exercisable by the French State and the other shareholders.\n\nThe restriction on the free exercise of the French State's voting rights applies to all decisions within the competence  of  the  Ordinary  General  Meeting,  with  the exception of the following decisions, for which the French State may freely exercise all of its double voting rights:\n\n- \u25cf appropriation  of  income,  fixing  of  the  dividend  and  its payout date;\n- \u25cf the option of receiving all or part of the dividend payout in cash or in shares;\n- \u25cf appointment of directors representing the French State, renewal  of  their  terms  of  office  or  ratification  of  their appointments by the Board of Directors;\n- \u25cf removal of directors representing the French State;\n- \u25cf approval of the sale of significant assets;\n- \u25cf related-party agreements against which the representatives of the French State voted on the Board of Directors; and\n- \u25cf grant of delegation to the Board of Directors to trade in Renault's shares, in the event of a program to buy back one or more blocks of shares from one or more identified shareholders.\n\nFor Extraordinary General Meetings, the French State may freely exercise all of its voting rights, with the exception of the following decisions for which the French State's freely exercisable voting rights are capped, namely\n\n- \u25cf grant or renewal of delegations of authority or powers to the management bodies of Renault whose terms are consistent  with  the  existing  practices  of  Renault  as demonstrated  over  the  five  years  preceding  the decision;\n- \u25cf decision or delegation granted to the Board of Directors to award stock options, allocate performance shares or issue shares or securities giving access to the capital to the employees and company officers of the Group;\n- \u25cf modification  of  the  age  limit  for  the  exercise  of functions  or  the  term  of  office  of  directors  and  senior executive officers; and\n- \u25cf transfer of the head office (except outside of France).",

and\n- \u25cf as  long  as  a  person  (with  the  exception  of  the  French State,  but  including  Nissan),  acting  alone  or  in  concert, owns,  directly  or  indirectly,  immediately  or  in  future,  a\n\nparticipation  or  an  economic  exposure  representing more than 15% of the share capital or voting rights of the Company.\n\nIn  the  event  of  violation  by  the  French  State  of  its commitments under the corporate governance agreement,  Renault  may  seek  conversion  into  bearer shares  of  all  Renault  shares  owned  by  the  French  State, thus  depriving  them  of  the  double  voting  rights  for  a period of two years.\n\nUptevia (previously, BNP Paribas Securities Services), the custodian  for  Renault's  shares,  assists  Renault  Group  in the  implementation  of  this  mechanism  through  the management  of  the  seven  fully  registered  shareholder accounts in which the Renault shares held by the French State are registered. The terms of its involvement are set out  in  an  agreement  for  the  implementation  of  the governance agreement, which was signed on February 4, 2016, between Renault, the French State and BNP Paribas Securities Services.\n\nI",

Average calculated on end of month figures for customer segment and on daily data on dealer financing\n\nAVES: Alliance  Vehicle  Evaluation  System:  a  system  of quality checks conducted on new vehicles as they come off  the  assembly  lines.  AVES  applies  a  detailed  method comprising  a  static/visual  component  and  a  dynamic component to detect defects.\n\nAvtovaz: Russian  company,  manufacturer  of  the  Lada brand  in  which  Renault  has  a  controlling  interest,  via  a joint  venture,  fully  consolidated  in  Renault's  financial statements since the end of 2016.\n\nB\n\nBOM: Board of Management, which was in charge of the company's  strategic  orientations  and  decisions,  was replaced by the Leadership Team on February 1, 2023.\n\nC\n\nCAFE: Corporate Average Fuel Economy, which represents the average level of fuel consumption or CO2 emissions for all passenger vehicles sold by a carmaker.\n\nCCT: Cross-Company Team, a team comprised of Renault and Nissan representatives  who,  as  part  of  the  Alliance, explore synergy possibilities for the two companies.\n\nCET1: (Common  Equity  Tier  1)  this  ratio  is  a  regulatory indicator  of  banks'  financial  soundness,  derived  from Basel  3.  It  makes  it  possible  to  measure  performance  in terms of capital consumption.\n\nCKD (Completely Knocked Down): Supply chain principle whereby  basic  bodywork  components  and  sets  of assembly  parts  are  shipped  unassembled  to  faraway plants. The shell is then assembled in the body shop, paint shop and trim & chassis shop.\n\nCMF: Common  Module  Family,  a  sharing  principle,  via  a series  of  shared  platforms  of  the  Alliance,  based  on  a modular system of architecture that enables a wide range of  vehicles  to  be  built  from  a  smaller  pool  of  parts, creating higher added value for the Group's customers.\n\nCVT: Continuously  Variable  Transmission.  A  gearbox technology  that  enables  the  vehicle  to  run  at  optimum power.  A  CVT  delivers  better  fuel  economy  than  a conventional  automatic  transmission.

Optimizing combustion-powered  engines  remains  one  of  the  most economical ways of limiting fuel consumption and, as such, reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Downsizing  involves reducing  the  capacity  of  the  engines  -  and  thus  fuel consumption  and  CO2  emissions  -  while  maintaining performance.\n\nE\n\nEBA: Emergency  Brake  Assist.  A  system  that  detects emergency  braking situations and instantaneously increases  braking  pressure  to  shorten  the  distance  the vehicle takes to stop.\n\nElectriCity: Renault  Group  created  in  2021  ' Renault ElectriCity ', an  industrial  hub  in  the  north  of  France (manufacturers in in Douai, Maubeuge and Ruitz) that has the Group's largest electric vehicle manufacturing capacity in the world.\n\nEquity: The Group manages the capital of the Automotive segment excluding Avtovaz using a ratio equal to the net debt  of  the  Automotive  segment  excluding  Avtovaz divided  by  the  amount  of  equity.  The net  financial indebtedness includes all non-operating interest-bearing financial liabilities and commitments less cash and cash equivalents  and  other  non-operating  financial  assets such  as  marketable  securities  or  the  segment's  loans. Equity  is  the  amount  shown  in  the  Group's  financial statement.\n\nEuro NCAP: safety standards for crash tests.\n\nEuro  NCAP  conducts  crash  tests  to  provide  consumers with accurate information on the safety performances of their  cars.  Since  2009,  Euro  NCAP  has  given  an  overall rating to each vehicle tested with assessments of 'Adult occupant  protection',  'Child  protection',  'Pedestrian protection'  and  'Safety  assist'.  Euro  NCAP  publishes information  about  ESC  fitment  and  the  results  of  rear impact (whiplash) tests in terms of seat design.\n\nEuro 5 and Euro 6: the Euro 5 emission standards are part of  the  Euro  emission  standards,  which  set  the  maximum pollutant emission limits, excluding CO2, for cars and other vehicles. The Euro 5 emission standard came into effect in September 2009 for new car certifications and covers all new cars since January 2011. In 2014, Euro 6, which focuses mainly on NOx emissions, took its place.\n\nI",

Consisting of a nucleus and a single electron, hydrogen is the simplest and lightest of the elements. It is 14 times lighter than air. In a fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen are  brought  into  contact  on  either  side  of  a  polymer electrolyte membrane.\n\nThey combine to produce water, the only 'emission' of the engine,  which  generates  electricity  and  heat.  It  is  this electrical energy that powers the vehicle's electric engine.\n\nFree  cash  flow is  the  amount  of  cash  generated  by  a company after interest payments, tax and net investments. FCF is used to:\n\n- \u25cf reduce the Net Financial Debt of Automotive;\n- \u25cf pay dividends;\n- \u25cf buy  back  the  company's  own  shares  and  minority interests;\n- \u25cf carry out external growth operations: acquire companies or holdings in associated companies.\n\nThe  FCF  indicator  for  the  automotive  sectors is an indicator  defined  and  calculated  based  on  accounting data in the cash flow statement. However, this indicator is neither defined nor required in IFRS.\n\nThe  Group  has  chosen  to  calculate  this  indicator  on  the basis  of  the  Automotive  segments,  excluding  all  items from  the  sales  financing  segment,  with  the  exception  of dividends paid and capital increases in sales financing.\n\nFree cash flow is therefore obtained from the items in the statement  of  cash  flows  of  the  automotive  sectors  by adding the following items:\n\nCash  flow  (excluding  dividends  received  from  listed companies  and  including  dividends  received  from  sales finance)\n\n- + change in the working capital requirement\n- + physical and intangible investments net of disposals\n- +  change  in  capitalized  leased  assets  (vehicles  and batteries)\n- - subscription to Sales Financing capital increases\n\n## = operational free cash flow of the automotive sectors\n\nFTT: Functional  Task  Team:  a  team  made  up  of  Renault and Nissan representatives who, within the framework of the Alliance, provide  their respective  expertise  on management processes, standards and tools.\n\n## G\n\nGEC: The Group's Executive Committee is responsible for the company's strategic guidance and decisions. Renamed Board of Management (BoM) since January 2021.\n\n## H\n\nHSE: Renault  created  an  HSE  division  (Health,  Safety, Environment) on September 1, 2016. Its task is to converge policies  on  working  conditions,  health,  safety  and  the environment.  The  mission  of  this  new  entity  is  to  ensure the Group's HSE governance by defining, in collaboration\n\nwith  the  business  lines  concerned,  an  overall  policy  and ambitious  progress  objectives  concerning  safety  and working  conditions,  ergonomics,  industrial  hygiene  and the environment.\n\nHyvia: In June 2021, Renault Group and Plug Power signed an  agreement  to  create  a  joint  venture  dedicated  to hydrogen  mobility.  The  company  Hyvia  will  offer  a complete ecosystem of turnkey solutions,  including  light commercial vehicles with fuel cells, and charging stations.\n\n## K\n\nKPI: Key  Performance  Indicators.  KPIs  are  used  to measure  the  Company's  performance.  They  provide  an overview  of  the  Group's  performance,  which  is  reported monthly  to  the  GEC.  KPIs  are  the  main  tool  for performance  management  in  each  geographical  region or business line.\n\nL\n\nLAB: the  accident  analysis,  biomechanics  and  human behavior laboratory known as the desire to improve road safety,  drawing  on  a  number  of  scientific  disciplines where  physics  and  human  sciences  converge.  Accident analysis  and  research  into  driver  behavior  probe  the causes and consequences of road accidents with a view to  improving  prevention.  Biomechanics  endeavors  to increase protection for vehicle occupants.\n\nLeadership  Team: The  Leadership  Team  is  in  charge  of the  company's  strategic  orientations  and  decisions. Replaces the BOM (Board of Management) on February 1, 2023.\n\n## M\n\nMateriality  matrix: the  materiality  matrix  is  a  tool  which enables  prioritization  of  extra-financial  stakes  with strategic reach. By conducting a materiality analysis, the Company works on the subjects that have a (potentially) extensive  and  significant  impact  on  its  business  model, and  then  translate  these  (as  far  as  possible)  into indicators. The methodology used must be comprehensible, reproducible and transparent.\n\n## N\n\nNEDC: The New European Driving Cycle is a standardized driving  cycle  and  test  procedure  used  to  measure  the emission levels and fuel economy of all types of vehicles in Europe.  The  NEDC  is  thus  an  objective  criterion  for assessing  the  performance  of  models  by  different manufacturers.  The  vehicle  is  put  on  a  roller  bench  and driven three times through the same urban cycle (ECE-15), followed by one 'extra-urban' cycle. The average of the four cycles is the average fuel economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOpen  Innovation  Lab: the  creation  of  Open  Innovation Labs  is  part  of  the  Renault-Nissan  Alliance's  innovation culture and strategy: they enable innovation opportunities to be cultivated based on an open ecosystem comprising",

Other operating income and expenses mainly include:\n\n- \u25cf restructuring provisions associated with activity stoppages  and  the  costs  of  workforce  adjustment measures';\n- \u25cf income  from  disposals  of  activities  or  operational investments (total or partial), the income from disposals of investments in associates and joint ventures (total or partial),  other  income  from  changes  in  scope  such  as takeovers under IFRS 10 of entities previously consolidated  under  the  equity  method  and  the  direct acquisition  costs  of  companies  consolidated  by  full consolidation  or  according  to  the  percentage  share specific  to  each  balance  sheet  and  income  statement item;\n- \u25cf gains  or  losses  on  disposal  of  property,  plant  and equipment  or  intangible  assets  (except  leased  assets sales);\n- \u25cf impairment  on  property,  plant  and  equipment  or intangible  assets  and  goodwill  (excluding  goodwill  of associates or joint ventures);\n- \u25cf income  and  expenses  that  are  unusual  in  their frequency,  nature  or  amount,  in  respect  of  disputes  or impairment on significant operating receivables.\n\nThe Monozukuri is the indicator that measures performance  growth  for  the  Purchasing,  Warranty,  R&D, Production  and  Logistics  business  activities  over  the current  year  versus  the  previous  year.  It  is  calculated excluding changes  in raw materials, mix effects, enrichment, volume and currencies.\n\nOYAK Renault: Renault's manufacturing partner in Turkey.\n\n## P\n\nPF: particulate filter; a particulate filter clears the exhaust gases of the particulates they contain, retaining them in a microporous  honeycomb  structure.

R&AE activities are managed across the company's Engineering departments using a shared, structured plan. The plan covers all  vehicle,  powertrain,  product,  process and service applications.\n\nREACH : Registration,  Evaluation  and  Authorisation  of CHemicals  is  a  regulation  adopted  in  2006  by  the European  Parliament  and  Council.  It  has  enabled  the creation  of  a  Community  system  for  the  registration, evaluation  and  authorization  of  chemical  substances managed by the new European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) based in Helsinki.\n\nThe implementation of REACH is the result of three main intentions:  to  expand  knowledge  of  the  health  and environmental risks of over 30,000 chemical substances, to  implement  a  substitution  policy  for  the  most  harmful substances and to entrust manufacturing and exporting companies with the evaluation and management of risks linked to these substances.\n\nRefactory :  in  November  2020,  Renault  Group  announced the  transformation  of  its  site  in  Flins  to  create  the Refactory, Europe's first circular economy  factory dedicated  to  mobility,  with  the  target  of  a  negative  CO2 balance by 2030.\n\nRenaulution :  strategic plan presented on January 14, 2021, which  aims  to  redirect  Renault  Group's  strategy  from volume to value creation. It is structured in three phases launched in parallel:\n\n- \u25cf the 'Resurrection' phase, running until 2023, will focus on margin recovery and cash generation;\n- \u25cf the  'Renovation'  phase,  running  until  2025,  will  bring renewal  and  enrichment  to  the  ranges,  contributing  to brand profitability;\n- \u25cf the 'Revolution' phase, which will start in 2025, will pivot the Group's business model to tech, energy and mobility, making Renault Group a frontrunner in the value chain of new mobility.\n\nRenault  Group: Renault  Group  is  at  the  cutting-edge  of mobility that is going through a reinvention process. Thanks to  its  alliance  with  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi  Motors,  and  its unique electrification expertise, Renault Group draws on the complementary nature of its four brands - Renault - Dacia Alpine and Mobilize - and offers sustainable and innovative mobility solutions to its customers. Established in more than 130 countries, the Group has sold 2.69 million vehicles in 2021. It employs 156,466 people who embody its Purpose every day so  that  mobility  brings  people  closer.
