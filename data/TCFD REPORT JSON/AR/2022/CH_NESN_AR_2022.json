Good for You, Good for the Planet is at the heart of our strategy. Our strong brands, our impactful innovation capabilities and our operational execution have helped us continue to deliver.\n\n## True to our values/uni00A0\n\nAt the start of 2022, the extreme challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to be waning. There were some supply chain challenges as well as inflationary pressures but those appeared to be manageable. The unexpected invasion of Ukraine at the end of February changed the course of the year. Global supply chain issues proliferated, inflation became rampant, concerns over energy shortages took hold and food insecurity grew.\n\nWe faced a choice this past year in how to react to these challenges. There was little handwringing as it was clear to us that we could not lose sight of our long-term strategy: we continued to invest in R&D, our brands and sustainability initiatives. Increased food insecurity only strengthened Nestl\u00e9's commitments to maintaining essential food supplies, providing a/ffordable nutrition and advancing regenerative food systems.\n\nTo stay on course required a constant rebalancing between growth, a/ffordability, and meeting our commitments to shareholders and other stakeholders. There were no easy solutions, but we did not waver in our resolve to deliver on short-term expectations, progress on our long-term ambitions and remain true to the core of our strategy: Good for You, Good for the Planet. Nestl\u00e9's decentralized fivezone structure allowed us to be close to our consumers and respond to shifts in their needs, while our global, balanced and diversified portfolio helped us weather inflation and supply chain challenges.\n\n'Increased food insecurity only strengthened Nestl\u00e9's commitments to maintaining essential food supplies, providing a/ffordable nutrition and advancing regenerative food systems.'/uni00A0",

We stayed focused on bringing fast-paced innovations to market, enhancing our digital capabilities, investing in our brands and managing our portfolio. Our real internal growth remained robust under challenging conditions.\n\nWe adjusted prices to reflect our own growing costs due to inflation. However, we did so responsibly, seeking internal e/fficiencies and cost-saving measures to try to limit price increases. Nestl\u00e9's role has always been to make nutritious food a/ffordable and accessible to people everywhere, and we stay committed to that even in times of economic headwinds. Highlights from 2022 include the following:\n\n/uni00A0\n\n- -Organic growth reached 8.3%, with pricing of 8.2% and/uni00A0real internal growth of 0.1%.\n- -Foreign exchange reduced sales by 0.9%. Net acquisitions had a positive impact of 1.1%. As a result, total/uni00A0reported sales increased by CHF 7.3 billion or 8.4% to/uni00A0CHF/uni00A094.4/uni00A0billion./uni00A0\n\n- -Underlying trading operating profit (UTOP) margin reached 17.1%. The trading operating profit (TOP) margin was unchanged versus the prior year at 14.0% on a reported basis. As announced at our investor seminar, we expect our underlying trading operating profit margin to return to a range of 17.5% to/uni00A018.5% by 2025, following the impact of cost inflation on our/uni00A0margin in 2021 and 2022.\n- -Underlying earnings per share (EPS) increased by 9.4% in/uni00A0constant currency and by 8.4% on a reported basis to CHF/uni00A04.80. We expect to deliver an underlying EPS growth target range of 6% to 10% in constant currency. Earnings per share decreased by 43.5% to CHF 3.42 on a reported basis, mainly reflecting the gain on the/uni00A0disposal of L'Or\u00e9al shares in 2021.\n- -Free cash flow was CHF 6.6 billion, as working capital/uni00A0increased temporarily in the context of supply chain constraints and capital expenditure remained at/uni00A0an/uni00A0elevated level. We expect to trend toward free cash flow of 12% of sales and ROIC of 15% by 2025.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic portfolio management/uni00A0\n\nIn 2022, we continued to invest in high-growth categories that contribute to our Nutrition, Health and Wellness strategy. Nestl\u00e9 remains disciplined in its approach to portfolio management, looking for strategic and cultural fit, as well as attractive financial returns.\n\nWe remain focused on driving sustained profitable growth in the co/ffee category with the announced acquisition of Seattle's Best Co/ffee brand from Starbucks. In/uni00A0addition to Starbucks packaged co/ffees sold by Nestl\u00e9 under the Global Co/ffee Alliance, Seattle's Best Co/ffee will join Nestl\u00e9's roster of beloved co/ffee brands in the United States including Nescaf\u00e9 , Nespresso and Blue Bottle .\n\nWe continue to develop Nestl\u00e9 Health Science's leadership position in nutrition and health, sharpening the focus on Consumer Care and Medical Nutrition. In 2022, we acquired a majority stake in Orgain as well as the businesses of Puravida and The Better Health Company. The new brands expand our markets in the vitamins, minerals and supplements segment in the United States, Latin America and Oceania. At the same time, we decided to explore strategic options for Palforzia , the peanut allergy treatment, following slower than expected adoption by patients and healthcare professionals.\n\n## Innovating to unlock the power of food\n\nBuilding a pipeline of highly di/fferentiated innovations, while rapidly testing and launching new ideas, fuels our growth. Our focus is on delivering tasty, nutritious, a/ffordable and sustainable products by anticipating growing trends and meeting people's diverse evolving needs and preferences, while investing in solutions with an improved environmental footprint. In 2022, we were able to maintain the same time-to-market speed as in 2021, despite the challenging environment.\n\nInfant nutrition. We continue to develop science-based nutritional solutions for infants. The newly launched infant formula with Nutrilearn Connect , a unique nutrient blend to increase brain myelination, and rollout of our infant formulas with five human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) to support gut health and immunity exemplify this focus. In 2022,\n\ninfant formula with HMOs had CHF/uni00A01.3/uni00A0billion in sales with double-digit growth.\n\nCo/ffee. We are innovating novel systems that bring the perfect cup of co/ffee to consumers in a sustainable way. Nescaf\u00e9 Dolce Gusto Neo gives co/ffee lovers the best co/ffeeshop-at-home experience with three brewing methods and compostable paper-based pods. Nespresso will also roll out a new range of compostable paper-based capsules that are retro-compatible with Nespresso Original machines, while Nespresso Vertuo Pop o/ffers the smartest, smallest, most optimized and accessible co/ffee machine ever, made from 35% recycled plastic.\n\nPlant-based. Market demand for plant-based products continues to create opportunities for new o/fferings across the entire food and beverage portfolio, which contribute to our sustainability goals. An early focus into a wide variety of plant-based alternatives and a retail focus on ready-made meals has proven to be a winning strategy. Recent launches include Gerber Plant-tastic , soy-based Milo , KitKat V , Garden Gourmet Voie Gras and Malher Huevo M\u00e1s . Plant-based products generated sales of around CHF/uni00A01/uni00A0billion in 2022, posting high single-digit organic growth.\n\n## Accelerated digitalization/uni00A0\n\nData and technology are an essential source of competitive advantage and Nestl\u00e9 continues its data-driven digital transformation. We are building a seamless consumer experience and channel-less commerce system, unlocking value via consumer data across geographies and categories. E-commerce sales grew by 9.2% to account for 15.8% of total Group sales. We remain on track to hit 25% by 2025.\n\nArtificial intelligence and remote assistance are allowing us to be more agile and flexible in our manufacturing sites and supply chains - more important now than ever.\n\n## Creating Shared Value/uni00A0\n\nCreating Shared Value has always been fundamental to the way we do business at Nestl\u00e9. We have long believed that our company can only be successful in the long term by creating value for both our shareholders and society. For decades, our activities and products have aimed to make",

In 2022, we made a commitment to increase the transparency of the nutritional value of our global portfolio. For the first time, we benchmarked our entire global portfolio against the Health Star Rating (HSR) system - a nutrient profiling system used by the Access to Nutrition Initiative - and have given an overview of our wide range of specialized nutrition products, which are not covered by\n\nthe HSR system. Nestl\u00e9 is the first company to disclose the nutritional value of its entire portfolio.\n\n/uni00A0\n\n## Refined Board oversight/uni00A0\n\nOur Board of Directors continued to provide valuable guidance on our strategy, business performance and sustainability agenda. We maintained our practice of adding diverse experience and expertise through the appointment of two new independent directors. In recent years we have, in particular, strengthened the Board's expertise on food systems, food and beverage, digitalization, marketing, sustainability and other topics.\n\nDuring 2022, the Board further refined the governance framework related to our sustainability agenda, including the/uni00A0annual work plan of the dedicated Sustainability Committee, which advises on all aspects of the Group's environmental and social sustainability, including our e/fforts on climate change, human rights, and diversity and inclusion.\n\n/uni00A0\n\n## Consistently committed to our purpose/uni00A0\n\nWe are committed to creating shared value for our shareholders and all stakeholders connected to our business by unlocking the power of food to enhance quality of life. We could not do this without the loyalty of our employees, business partners and investors. In this challenging year, we thank our employees for their admirable dedication in keeping us on track while rebalancing. We are also grateful for the support of our business partners, our consumers and the communities where we operate.

Internal e/fficiency projects help us free up resources for investments by optimizing our skills and enhancing e/ffectiveness and speed of our organization.\n\nWe continued to adapt our organization to be more agile, flexible and digitalized. In manufacturing, we continued to upgrade our operational footprint in 2022, increasing factory fixed overheads by around 6%.

It is a vital pillar of cultures, brings people together, underpins economies and impacts planet health. At Nestl\u00e9, through our R&D organization, we innovate with purpose to unlock the power of food and deliver tasty, nutritious, a/ffordable and sustainable products - for today, and for generations to come.\n\n## Our innovation capabilities\n\nWe continuously strengthen our innovation capabilities to ensure that we deliver products that meet people's diverse evolving needs, while reducing our carbon footprint and contributing to company growth. In 2022, we were able to maintain the same time-to-market speed as in 2021, despite the challenging environment.\n\nThrough our regional R&D centers in Africa, China, India and South-East Asia, we can innovate closer to the people we serve with agility. We recently inaugurated an additional regional R&D Center for Latin America in Santiago, Chile, enabling us to innovate for consumers in the region, while leveraging our global science and technology capabilities to deliver tasty, nutritious, a/ffordable and sustainable products.\n\nWe also rely on new innovation tools to increase speed, e/fficiency and decision making, and deliver breakthrough solutions. Using advanced algorithms, we can capture information on trends, ingredients, flavors and health benefits to virtually create and quickly test concepts before further refining for launch. Using these tools, in China we launched Nescaf\u00e9 Dalgona co/ffee mixes and Nesvita probiotic supplements for adults. We are also exploring the use of artificial intelligence and data science that can help to manage tradeo/ffs between taste,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnutrition, sustainability and a/ffordability in an increasingly complex innovation environment.\n\nTo go from idea to shop in six months - with new sites in Chile, China, India and Arlington, Virginia, in the United/uni00A0States - we now have 14 R+D Accelerators. Since 2019, the Accelerator initiative has had over 300/uni00A0participants, with 150/uni00A0new products in 20/uni00A0countries.\n\nUsing a test-and-learn approach and working closely with retailers, we quickly develop and pilot novel concepts before investing in a full-scale launch. After a successful pilot test for KitKat/uni00A0V , we launched the vegan chocolate on a wider scale in 15/uni00A0European markets.\n\n## Nutrition solutions across life stages\n\nWe develop innovations that are backed by science across life stages, for people and pets. New research showed that Nutrilearn Connect , a unique nutrient blend, increases brain myelination, a process vital for cognition and motor development during early life. This led to a first launch in Hong Kong and China under the Wyeth S-26 Ultima brand. We also continued the rollout in 20 markets of infant formula with five HMOs to support gut health and immunity.\n\nTo meet toddlers' unique nutritional needs, we introduced Gerber Powerblend cereals in China and India. These are/uni00A0made from diverse food groups such as whole grains, legumes, milk and fruits to support immunity, brain development and the gut microbiome.\n\nProviding solutions for people with specific health needs is also a priority for us. To support women during and after pregnancy while breastfeeding, we launched a range of Materna multivitamins and supplements in Latin America and Europe.\n\nOur new regional R&D Center for Latin America in Santiago, Chile, enables us to innovate tasty, nutritious, a/ffordable and sustainable products that are highly relevant to local consumers.\n\nIn the United States, we developed a range of Compleat plant-based standard tube feeding formulas to support digestive health, increased energy needs or decreased fluid needs in patients aged 1 to 13 years. In China, we launched Yiyang milk powder made with mulberry leaf extract, a traditional Chinese ingredient, to support people aged over 45 years in/uni00A0managing blood glucose.\n\nFor cats and dogs, we launched Purina Pro Plan supplements - in a multiformat such as oils, powders and tablets - to support mobility, immunity, vitality, healthy skin and coat.",

In Latin America, under the Malher brand, we piloted a powdered, shelf-stable, plantbased protein blend to complement egg dishes in a nutritious and a/ffordable way. When cooking scrambled eggs, omelets and batters, the soy-based Huevo M\u00e1s can replace some eggs at a lower cost, but with an equal amount of protein, fewer calories, and less cholesterol and saturated fats.\n\nOur scientists developed a new source of iron suitable for dairy products and three times more absorbed when compared to existing sources. It was first used in Bunyad Iron+ , an a/ffordable dairy-based drink to address iron deficiency in children in Pakistan, with more products to follow.\n\n## Breakthrough technology for sugar reduction\n\nO/ffering healthier choices as part of a balanced diet is a priority for us. Our new proprietary technology reduces sugar in key raw materials, with no impact on taste or texture, for di/fferent types of products.\n\nBased on fermentation, the technology significantly reduces sugar in malt and milk, while generating prebiotic fibers. We introduced sugar-reduced Milo in South-East Asia, Africa and Oceania, with other product categories and geographies to follow.\n\n## Pioneering plant-based products\n\nOur expertise in proteins, nutrition, plant sciences and culinary arts enables us to develop tasty, nutritious and sustainable plant-based products across brands, categories, formats and geographies.

We created the Nestl\u00e9 Institute of Agricultural Sciences to translate and apply agricultural science and identify the most promising technologies. Part of our global research organization in Switzerland, the Institute includes a plant science unit in France, and cocoa, co/ffee and dairy research farms in Ecuador, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Thailand and Switzerland.\n\nWe also explore emerging technologies with start-ups, such as the pilot for animal-free dairy protein-based beverages through our US R+D Accelerator. Using precision fermentation, the products are made with animal-free protein sourced from the start-up Perfect Day, which is identical to cow's milk whey protein without compromising on nutrition and taste. We are also exploring tasty, nutritious and sustainable cultured meat with the start-up Future Meat Technologies.",

These emissions have fallen below our 2018 baseline for the first time since introducing our Roadmap, despite revenue growth over the same four-year period. Emissions reductions are the result of a wide range of projects in our/uni00A0agricultural supply chains, as/uni00A0well as in our factories.\n\nIn addition to these emissions reductions, we secured 4.3/uni00A0million tonnes of GHG removals by implementing nature-based solutions that transfer GHGs from the atmosphere into carbon stores. These removals take place within our supply chain and the landscapes where we source our raw materials, and help to restore forests, wetlands and peatlands, or improve land management.\n\nWe are proud of our progress, but know there is more to do to reduce Nestl\u00e9's absolute emissions on our way to net zero by 2050. We are still adapting our approach in response to what we learn.

We remain focused on achieving our deforestation-free commitment.\n\n## Our vision for packaging and circularity\n\nOur vision continues to be that none of our packaging, including plastic, ends up in landfill or as litter. As with carbon, we are moving beyond peak virgin plastics, reducing the volume we use while our business continues to grow.\n\nWe have a strategy that supports our vision and addresses both product design and infrastructure systems. By reducing/uni00A0unnecessary packaging, designing better packaging for reuse and recycling systems, modeling fair collection systems and supporting good regulation, we aim to support the transition to no waste in landfills or nature.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Henniez bottledwater plant in Switzerland produces renewable energy by collecting and burning manure from local cattle in a biogas plant, together with spent co/ffee grounds from Nespresso .",

We have run over 20 packaging reuse pilots in 12 countries, providing products in our Nestl\u00e9 Waters business and with partners such as Loop, Aldo and Carrefour. However, we recognize that more needs to be done and will work with retail partners to increase and scale up reuse and refill systems.\n\nWe advocate for well-planned regulation to enable collection, sorting, reuse and recycling systems.

We also help farmers and women in the household access the training and resources needed to make the changes.\n\nTo enable these payments and bring about lasting change, we are shifting our sourcing to segregated cocoa supplies that can be traced from the farming family all the way to our factory.\n\nThe income accelerator program is expanding a successful pilot of 1000 farmers in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to a further 10 000 families. We will assess the results, adapting where necessary, before extending the program throughout our global cocoa supply chain by 2030.\n\nOUR VOICES\n\n'It m/o.ss01t/i.ss01v/a.ss01t/e\\_s m/e.ss01 t/o.ss01 s/e\\_e f/a\\_rm/e\\_rs /c\\_o\\_nv/i\\_nc/e.ss01d o/f.ss01 t/h.ss01e b/e\\_n/e\\_fi/t.ss01s: o/v.ss01/e\\_r 90% w/a\\_nt t/o.ss01 /c\\_o\\_nt/i\\_nu/e.ss01 p/r.ss01/u\\_n/i\\_ng /a\\_nd s/o\\_me a/l.ss01r/e.ss01a/d.ss01y p/r.ss01/u\\_n\\_ed t/h.ss01e r/e\\_ma/i\\_n/d\\_er o/f.ss01 t/h.ss01e/i\\_r p/l.ss01o/t.ss01.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLuc A/ffoli N'Guessan Toussaint Income Accelerator Project Manager C\u00f4te d'Ivoire\n\nIN FIGURES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CHF 500\n\nthe amount families can earn annually in the first two years",

Plus, they want full transparency about how their/uni00A0products were made. To meet these demands and/uni00A0drive growth, we are accelerating our data-driven digital transformation.\n\n## Acceleration of e-commerce\n\nIn 2021, we launched the e-commerce acceleration initiative, building detailed action plans by market. In 2022, our primary focus was executing these plans to improve e-commerce performance in all markets and categories.\n\nOur 2025 ambition of 25% of sales via e-commerce will impact all markets, brands and roles. As such, a key priority is building e-commerce skills. We have created a global e-commerce community of more than 3000 employees who connect and share best practices, successes and challenges. We are reaching an even wider audience with online webinars and trainings. More than 11 000 people across Nestl\u00e9 have already attended these events.\n\nExecuting online has parallels with o/ffline but requires a di/fferent approach to win. While remaining agile, we have defined our vision of perfect shelf execution and have set about measuring this by market and retailer, down to the SKU level. By standardizing and scaling our approach, we can improve digital shelf execution - including content, text, ratings and reviews. To advance our Retail Digital Media we are working closely with our retail partners, adapting our ways of working and developing practices to improve return on investment.\n\nRetailer websites, apps and direct-toconsumer platforms are a shop window for our consumers to engage with our brands. Tracking and making continuous improvements at scale help us continuously improve the customer experience and drive/uni00A0sales.\n\nAs the retail landscape becomes more fragmented, we have ever more customers and channels to manage. This complexity requires us to do more with less. With Amazon, one of our largest e-commerce customers, we created the Amazon center of scale where we outsource or automate routine tasks to ensure our teams are only working on the most value-adding activity.\n\n## Advancing always-on analytics\n\nQuick access to actionable data insights is key to understanding fast-changing consumer needs and optimizing our demand-generation activities, thus maximizing our resources. We are harnessing the power of data to streamline our business practices, becoming more strategic and predictive while making changes in real time.\n\nIn 2022, our analytics capability has been critical to help us navigate an extremely volatile retail environment and rising costs of raw materials. Our data-powered sales and marketing teams have been able to optimize our sales prices and promotional activity while maintaining consumer demand for our brands and products.\n\nOur strategic revenue management program now covers around 95% of our markets. We are also leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) with end-to-end analytics to deepen collaboration with customers, improve product assortment and enhance promotion e/ffectiveness.\n\nTo increase the e/ffectiveness of our marketing investment, we are investing in proprietary solutions deployed at scale in many geographies from Indonesia to North America.",

In 2022, we further expanded our expertise across the digital value chain and the content studio model: 37 content studios are producing high-quality content 50% cheaper than our previous model. We use AI to track, correct and enhance the relevance of more than 500 000 digital assets per year across the key digital platforms, leading to performance improvement up to 66% in return on ad spend measured across Meta platforms, Facebook and Instagram.\n\n## Digitally enhanced operations\n\nWe are deploying advanced operational planning technology at scale covering all key areas across our value chain - from demand sensing to production scheduling. The technology allows us to drive agility and resilience of our operations, enhancing our ability to react to consumer demand quickly and e/fficiently. We have successfully implemented these core capabilities in the United States, our biggest market, and are accelerating rollout with the intention to reach 80% of our businesses by the end of 2025.\n\nOur core digital technologies are now deployed in more than 275 factories in 60 countries, enabling over 50 000 connected workers to be highly productive and autonomous with fast and easy decision making.

Digitally enabled transport control towers (or T-Hubs) are now deployed in more than 20 locations, manage more than 16 000 trucks daily and cover 85% of our turnover. Capabilities have been built around cost e/fficiency as well as resilience and responsiveness.\n\nOur journey to warehouse automation is well underway to deliver cost\n\ne/fficiency. These agile operations meet customer requirements while mitigating labor shortage.\n\n## Validation of sustainability\n\nDigitalization helps enable Nestl\u00e9's sustainability agenda in areas such as sustainable packaging, responsible sourcing, tackling CO/uni2082 emissions and water management.\n\nWith the help of our greenhouse gas performance system, we are now able to monitor our carbon footprint more accurately, including Scope 3 emissions. In addition to an automated combination of Nestl\u00e9 spend and activities with the emission factors from relevant external databases, this system enables Nestl\u00e9 to include primary data about emissions from suppliers and farms.\n\nIn 2022, we debuted a new technology to improve endto-end traceability and substantiate sustainability claims. Nespresso partnered with OpenSC to use their technology to bring greater transparency and accountability to the supply chain for Reviving Origins organic co/ffee, Kahawa Ya Congo , by using smart devices and QR codes. The OpenSC platform automatically verifies that each smallholder farmer receives the correct Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality Program premium directly for the co/ffee they produced - either via mobile money or cash.",

They include among others:\n\n- -Organic growth, Real internal growth and Pricing;\n- -Underlying trading operating profit margin and Trading operating profit margin;\n- -Net financial debt;\n- -Free cash flow; and\n- -Underlying earnings per share (EPS) and EPS in constant currency.\n\nManagement believes that these non-IFRS financial performance measures provide useful information regarding the Group's financial and operating performance.\n\nThe Alternative Performance Measures document published under www.nestle.com/investors/ publications defines these non-IFRS financial performance measures.\n\nOperating segments 2021 comparative figures have been adjusted following the creation of Zone North America (NA) and Zone Greater China (GC) as of January 1, 2022. Zone AOA includes Middle East and North Africa (MENA) previously included in Zone EMENA (see Note 3 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Introduction\n\nLast year brought many challenges and tough choices for families, communities and businesses. Inflation surged to unprecedented levels, cost of living pressures intensified and the e/ffects of geopolitical tensions were felt around the world.\n\nThe entire Nestl\u00e9 team demonstrated dependability, as we navigated this di/fficult environment. Organic growth was solid, margins continued to be resilient and our underlying earnings per share development was strong. At the same time, we ensured access to nutritious products and a/ffordable o/fferings globally.\n\nDuring 2022, we also confirmed our longstanding nutrition strategy, with Good for You, Good for the Planet at its heart. We took important actions to further strengthen our industry-leading responsible marketing practices and to provide transparency on the nutritional value of our global portfolio. At the same time, we also advanced the implementation of our climate roadmap.\n\nLooking to 2023, we expect another year of robust organic growth, with a focus on restoring our gross margin, stepping up marketing investments and increasing free cash flow. Nestl\u00e9's value creation model puts us in a strong position to achieve our 2025 targets and to generate reliable, sustainable shareholder returns.\n\n## Group sales\n\nOrganic growth (OG) was 8.3%. Pricing increased to 8.2%, reflecting significant cost inflation. Real/uni00A0internal growth (RIG) was positive at was positive at 0.1%, following a high base of comparison in 2021, supply constraints and portfolio optimization actions.\n\nOrganic growth was 7.1% in developed markets, driven by pricing. In emerging markets, organic growth was 10.0%, supported by both pricing and RIG.\n\nBy product category, Purina PetCare was the largest contributor to organic growth, with continued momentum for science-based and",

The underlying trading operating profit margin decreased by 30/uni00A0basis points to 17.1% on a reported basis and by 40/uni00A0basis points in constant currency, reflecting significant cost inflation.\n\nGross profit increased by 2.5% to CHF/uni00A042.7/uni00A0billion. Gross profit margin decreased by 260/uni00A0basis points to 45.2%, following significant broadbased inflation for commodity, packaging, freight and energy costs. The impact of cost inflation increased in the second half, reflecting higher costs for dairy, cereals and energy. Pricing, growth leverage and e/fficiencies helped to partly o/ffset the impact of cost inflation.\n\nDistribution costs as a percentage of sales benefited from the divestment of the Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America brands.\n\nMarketing and administration expenses decreased by 2.6% to CHF/uni00A016.8/uni00A0billion. Consumer-facing marketing spend decreased temporarily, following a lower level of promotion and marketing activities in the context of supply constraints. Consumer-facing marketing spend increased in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Administrative expenses as a percentage of sales benefited from very disciplined cost control.\n\nRestructuring expenses and net other trading items were CHF/uni00A02.9/uni00A0billion, slightly below the prior year. As a result, trading operating profit increased by 8.5% to CHF/uni00A013.2/uni00A0billion and the trading operating profit margin was unchanged versus the prior year on a reported basis at 14.0%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Underlying trading operating profit by operating segment\n\nIn % of sales\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nZone NA\n\n- Zone EUR\n- Zone AOA\n- Zone LATAM\n- Zone GC\n- Nespresso\n- Nestl\u00e9 Health Science\n\n## Trading operating profit by operating segment\n\nIn % of sales\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our average cost of net debt increased slightly to 2.2%, compared to 2.0% in 2021.\n\nThe Group reported tax rate increased by 330/uni00A0basis points to 24.2% as a result of one-o/ff items. The underlying tax rate was relatively stable at 20.9%.\n\n## Net profit and Earnings per share\n\nNet profit decreased by 45.2% to CHF/uni00A09.3/uni00A0billion. Net profit margin decreased by 960/uni00A0basis points to 9.8%, reflecting the gain on disposal of L'Or\u00e9al shares in 2021. As a result, earnings per share decreased by 43.5% to CHF/uni00A03.42 on a reported basis.\n\nUnderlying earnings per share increased by 9.4% in constant currency and by 8.4% on a reported basis to CHF/uni00A04.80. The increase was mainly the result of strong organic growth. Nestl\u00e9's share buyback program contributed 1.8% to the underlying earnings per share increase, net of finance costs.\n\n## Cash flow\n\nCash generated from operations before changes in working capital increased from CHF/uni00A016.8/uni00A0billion to CHF/uni00A018.4/uni00A0billion, up 20 basis points as a percentage of sales.\n\nFree cash flow decreased from CHF/uni00A08.7/uni00A0billion to CHF/uni00A06.6/uni00A0billion, reflecting a deliberate and temporary increase in inventories in the context of supply chain disruptions and the energy crisis in Europe.

If approved, this will be the company's 28th consecutive annual dividend increase. The company has maintained or increased its dividend in Swiss francs over the last 63/uni00A0years. Nestl\u00e9 is committed to maintaining this long-held practice to increase the dividend in Swiss francs every year.\n\nThe last trading day with entitlement to receive the dividend will be April/uni00A021, 2023.

The higher level of debt largely reflected share buybacks of CHF/uni00A010.5/uni00A0billion, mostly financed by/uni00A0the disposal/uni00A0of L'Or\u00e9al shares in December 2021, and/uni00A0a temporary increase in working capital.\n\n## Return on invested capital (ROIC)\n\nThe Group's ROIC was unchanged versus 2021 at/uni00A012.2%.

RIG/uni00A0was -1.3%, following pricing activities, a high base of comparison in 2021 and supply constraints.

We aim to create long-term value through a balance of sustainable growth and resource e/fficiency. Our culture and values - rooted in respect for ourselves, others, diversity and the future guide our decisions and actions. Our Creating Shared Value approach helps us prioritize those areas that maximize value creation for shareholders and cultivate positive societal and environmental impacts.\n\nThe Nestl\u00e9 Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework is designed to assess and mitigate risks in order to minimize their potential impact and support the achievement of Nestl\u00e9's long-term purpose and business strategy. A/uni00A0top-down assessment is performed at Grouplevel once a year. A bottom-up assessment occurs in parallel, resulting in aggregation of the individual market assessments. This creates a good understanding of the company's key risks in order to allocate ownership to drive specific actions around them and take any relevant steps to address them.\n\nAdditionally, Nestl\u00e9 engages with external stakeholders to better understand the issues that are of most concern to them. The materiality assessment (included in the Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report ) rates the degree of external stakeholder concern and potential business impact. This helps to ensure that wider sustainability issues are incorporated into the risks and opportunities under consideration across the company.\n\nRisk assessments and any mitigating actions are the responsibility of the individual line management. If Group-level intervention is required, responsibility for mitigating actions will generally be determined by the Executive Board. The annual Group risk assessment is reported annually to the Executive Board, Audit Committee and Board of Directors. Under the Group's governance, the full Board is responsible for risk oversight. Further detail of the ERM processes can be found in the Corporate Governance Report .\n\nWe are committed to transparency and action on climate-related risks and opportunities. As such, we have aligned our reporting disclosures with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our TCFD-aligned disclosures, including our analysis undertaken in 2022, can be found on page/uni00A017 and in Nestl\u00e9's 2022 Climate Risk and Impact Report (www.nestle.com/tcfdreport).\n\nThe risks listed below are considered the most relevant for our business and performance.

We continue to balance the pursuit of top-line and bottom-line growth with capital e/fficiency. Aiming for business to be a force for good, we use our scale, resources and expertise to create shared value for all our stakeholders.\n\nIn 2022, our value creation model proved its resilience and allowed us to continue to invest, renovate and grow. Our science- and consumerdriven innovations met fast-changing consumer needs. At the same time, we progressed on our path to gradually reduce absolute GHG emissions in our supply chain to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and continued to support the transition to a regenerative food system. Our engagement on climate action is in line with our detailed Net Zero Roadmap, which our shareholders strongly supported at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. While making our portfolio good for the planet, we further intensified our e/fforts to make our products good for our consumers. In 2022, we strengthened our internal tools and systems that guide the nutritional composition of our foods and beverages, upgraded our policies and increased transparency on the healthfulness of our portfolio.\n\nOur diverse and competent Board of Directors is engaged to oversee the direction of our company. We have continuously strengthened the Board by adding new independent directors with diverse experience and expertise directly relevant to Nestl\u00e9, for example, with respect to food systems, food and beverage, digitalization, marketing and other topics. Under our governance, the full Board is in charge of strategy, governance and risk oversight. We continue to engage with our shareholders through our roadshows, investor meetings and analyst calls. Our Chairman's Roundtables took place virtually with investors in Asia, North America, Switzerland, Germany, the UK, France and the Netherlands.\n\nOur Chair's and Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews all aspects of our governance, as well as our asset and liability management and other topics. Our Nomination Committee, chaired\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nby our Lead Independent Director, evaluates Board composition, performance, structure and succession planning, and assesses candidates for nomination to the Board. Our Sustainability Committee advises on our environmental and social sustainability, including our response to climate change and our human rights due diligence program. Our Compensation Committee ensures alignment of our remuneration systems with our values, strategies and performance. In 2022, it continued its work to review the KPIs in our short- and long-term incentive plans. Our Audit Committee oversees internal and external audit, financial and non-financial reporting, and internal controls; and reviews reports regarding compliance, fraud and risk management.\n\nWe recognize that for our company to be successful over time and to be a force for good, we must also create value for society. Our governance helps us strike the right balance in our pursuit of long-term, sustainable value creation.",

Our commitments to ethics, integrity, fairness and authenticity are enshrined in our Purpose and Values, the Corporate Business Principles and the Code of Business Conduct . Our comprehensive Compliance Management System helps our employees and managers do the right thing for the right reason, while protecting and strengthening Nestl\u00e9's reputation.\n\nOur Board of Directors and our Executive Board oversee and promote good practices throughout the company. Line management is supported by our Legal and Compliance function, which provides guidance and functional leadership, as well as by all other functions engaged in our risk- and principles-based Compliance program. Our Group Compliance Committee ensures a continuous evolution of our Integrated Assurance Framework. Market Compliance O/fficers and Committees ensure a consistent approach across the Group and help identify local compliance priorities.\n\nIn 2022, we continued a positive evolution of mandatory trainings and during the year more than 800 000 modules were taken on topics relating to the Corporate Business Principles , the Code of Business Conduct , Human Rights, Diversity & Inclusion, and others.\n\nOur IT Roadmap facilitates an e/ffective management of our Compliance Management System through increased automation.\n\nWe monitor compliance through our corporate functions, our internal audit function and our external auditors. Through our CARE program, we regularly assess specific aspects of our social compliance with the help of independent external auditors. 2022 was the second year of our threeyear CARE cycle and a total of 264 audits were performed in 2022, covering 389 sites.\n\nOur Speak Up system allows us to address concerns from employees and external\n\nstakeholders. It is independently operated by a third party to ensure confidentiality. All complaints are investigated and remedial actions taken as needed. Trend analysis enables us to monitor key risks and the quality of consequence management decisions and improvement action plans. Substantiated complaints helped us address issues such as abuse of power and/or mobbing/bullying, labor practices, discrimination and harassment, sexual harassment, fraud and non-compliance with the WHO Code. In 2022, 154/uni00A0employees had to leave our company and 11/uni00A0service providers were terminated as a result of/uni00A0non-compliance incidents.\n\nAn annual Compliance communication plan reinforces our Compliance culture. This helps us create sustainable value for all our stakeholders and make Nestl\u00e9 a force for good.",
