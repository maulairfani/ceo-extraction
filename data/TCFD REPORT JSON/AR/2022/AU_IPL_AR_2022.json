With a team of just over 5800 dedicated employees, we have a strong safety culture that we're committed to building on. With iconic brands, leading technology solutions and great customers, we operate in the resilient markets of agriculture, mining and quarry and construction. And of course, we are committed to a sustainable and decarbonised world.\n\nAn ASX100 company, IPL has two customer facing businesses, Dyno Nobe l based in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) and Asia Paci/fic and Incitec Pivot Fertilisers , a leading integrated manufacturer and distributor of fertilisers across the east coast of Australia. We are an international business with world-scale explosives and fertiliser manufacturing, leading technology solutions, marketing and servicing operations. We are proud to be considered a trusted partner by customers and suppliers.\n\nOur explosives are used to unlock resources ranging from gold, iron ore and copper, to quarry and construction materials. Those resources contribute to new technologies, such as electric vehicles and wind turbines, and critical infrastructure. Our fertiliser products play an important role in enabling sustainable food production to meet the rapidly rising demand for food around the world.\n\nWith a rich technology heritage, IPL's key technology drivers are to improve safety, productivity & e/fficiency, and sustainability. And we continue to invest in the development of new technologies and our service o/ffering.\n\nWe have an ambition to reach Net Zero operational emissions by 2050, or sooner if practicable. Our climate change management strategy is focused on four key pillars:\n\n- 1.  Ensuring strong governance;\n- 2.  Reducing operational emissions;\n- 3.  Delivering products and strategies that reduce Scope 3 emissions; and\n- 4.  Managing strategic business risks and opportunities.\n\nOur Net Zero Pathway shows the key enablers and technologies required to reduce our emissions, along with the expected timeframe for each.\n\n## Global footprint\n\nServing high quality customers with technological solutions across six continents, including Australia, North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Africa, we manufacture ammonium nitratebased explosives and initiating systems, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers, and nitrogen related industrial and specialty chemicals. We have major manufacturing sites across Australia and the US, with key sites in Cheyenne (Wyoming, USA), Louisiana (Missouri, USA), Waggaman (Louisiana, USA), Moranbah (QLD, Australia), Geelong (VIC, Australia) and Phosphate Hill (QLD, Australia).\n\nFurther strengthening each business are a number of key investments. The acquisition of Titanobel - a leading French industrial explosives manufacturer - allows the Dyno Nobel business to leverage its technology into new and pro/fitable markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa. The Incitec Pivot Fertilisers business has acquired a majority stake in Australian Bio Fert Pty Ltd (ABF) , with plans to develop and deliver a new category of sustainable fertilisers. And /finally, our Easy Liquids (formerly Yara Nipro) acquisition will enable IPF to better serve customers through a strengthened storage and distribution network and improve security of supply of a diverse range of liquid products for dealers, agents, and agronomists.\n\n## Dyno Nobel\n\n## Delivering advanced technology through practical innovation\n\nDyno Nobel is IPL's international explosives and technical blasting services business and one of the largest industrial explosives distributors in North America and Australia. Blasting is an essential step in extracting the minerals required to meet the world's demand for power, infrastructure and consumer goods. Construction, mines, quarries and seismic explorers use Dyno Nobel products to achieve safety goals and improve operational e/fficiency.\n\nWe provide a full range of reliable explosives products from manufacturing plants around the world and extensive blasting services. In fact, we boast some of the most highly trained blasters and technical experts in the industry, and operate in Australia, Canada, the United States, Indonesia, Mexico, Chile, Papua New Guinea, Turkey and France. Our research & development focuses on practical ways to use new technologies to bene/fit our customers and include DIFFERENTIAL ENERGY \u00ae , DigiShot \u00ae Plus.4G and CyberDet \u00ae I (1) .",

Our people, products and services support farming communities and contribute to our growers' production, which in turn helps feed millions around the globe. Resilient, diverse and proud, we are driven by science, innovation and maximising soil potential. Through our comprehensive 'Agronomy in Practice' training course we help educate and develop the capability of Australian agronomists. Using an interactive and engaging program with hands-on activities and assessments at every step of the way, it's the ultimate course in best practice soil, plant tissue and water sampling, testing, interpreting analysis results and making fertiliser recommendations.\n\nIncitec Pivot Fertiliser's leading brands include Granulock\u00ae , SuPerfect\u00ae and our patented  de-nitri/fication inhibitor eNpower\u00ae . With a dedicated network of suppliers and agents across the east coast of Australia, as well as our NATA-accredited Nutrient Advantage\u00ae Laboratory , Incitec Pivot Fertilisers supports farmers with the crop nutrition insights and products they need to maximise yield potential in an e/fficient way. Further a/field, through our global trading business Southern Cross Fertilisers, we sell and trade in  major o/ffshore agricultural markets including Asia Paci/fic , the Indian subcontinent , the United States , Latin America and other international locations.\n\n## The future looks di/fferent\n\nThe way we operate at IPL and what our customers want from us, has changed. It is being driven by the increasing importance of food security and mining extraction for the world's future, as well as the global trend in decarbonisation. With a clear opportunity to accelerate our growth through the development of technology and customer solutions, we can capitalise on the signi/ficant potential in the mining and agricultural sectors.\n\nAnd this is why in May 2022 we announced our demerger proposal, with the intention to create two market leading companies. Under this proposal, Dyno Nobel and Incitec Pivot Fertilisers will each have a dedicated purpose, vision and leadership. With technology solutions and prioritised capital allocation, each company will have the opportunity to accelerate its growth ambitions. This will help drive value for shareholders, and better serve our customers, employees and the communities in which they operate. The demerger will enable each business to create focussed solutions to meet GHG emission reduction targets, and to assist their direct and indirect customers in achieving their own net zero ambitions.\n\nBuilding on impressive one-hundred-year histories, there is a clear and compelling path for Dyno Nobel and Incitec Pivot Fertilisers to thrive as two independent companies. To be trusted partners delivering technology-driven solutions to customers. The demerger is subject to /final Board approval, shareholder and other third-party approvals.\n\nI\n\nncit\n\nec P\n\niv\n\not Limit\n\ned\n\nAnnual R\n\nepor\n\nt 2022\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## CHAIRMAN'S REPORT\n\n2022 has been a stand-out year for the IPL Group, marked by a record result against a backdrop of geo-political and economic challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nAs we look towards 2023, our improved performance and strategic progress has positioned the business well to capitalise on the favourable market conditions. We have very good momentum and we remain absolutely focused on our corporate strategy.\n\nThe strategic progress of both our explosives and fertilisers businesses during the year led to our announcement in May of our intention to demerge these two di/fferent businesses during 2023.  With two separate dedicated boards, leadership teams, and appropriate capital structures, these two iconic businesses will be positioned to thrive and pursue their respective strategies unencumbered.\n\nAlso, in November 2022 and consistent with our long-term strategy, we announced a strategic review of our ownership in our ammonia production plant in Waggaman, Louisiana, with the timing driven by interest from a number of credible counterparties. The strategic review of  Waggaman means that the timeline for the demerger will be delayed by approximately 6-12 months.\n\nWe continue to invest signi/ficantly in a number of projects to address climate change on our journey to Net Zero by 2050. These projects are positioned to deliver our medium term absolute GHG reduction target and, have the potential to deliver a more than 42% emission reduction for IPL's current portfolio by 2030.\n\nI am pleased to announce that we were once again included in the S&P Global Dow Jones Sustainability Index due to our Company Benchmarking Score for 2022. We improved our 2021 score, positioning ourselves well against our industry peers and improving our own score by 15 points over the past decade. These results validate the work we are doing to improve the sustainability of your company.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nWe reported a 162% increase in Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) excluding individually material items (IMIs) to $1,485m. Our Net Pro/fit after Tax (excluding IMIs) of $1,027m, is up 186% compared to the prior year.\n\nDyno Nobel Americas reported EBIT of US$532.8m, up from US$141.2m, with strong second half manufacturing performance capturing favourable commodity markets. However, a lag in passing through price increases to address in/flation impacted explosives margins in the second half.\n\nDyno Nobel Asia Paci/fic delivered EBIT of $162m, up 16%, re/flecting strong volumes and growth from technology sales.\n\nFertilisers EBIT increased to $614m, up from $268.4m, with manufacturing more than doubling earnings during the year.\n\nWe retained a strong balance sheet with net debt of $1bn and Net Debt/ EBITDA ratio ex IMIs of 0.5x, down from 1.1x.\n\nWith the improved earnings performance, strong cash generation and balance sheet strength, the Board was pleased to announce a record /final dividend of 17 cents per share, taking our total dividend to 27 cents per share. In addition, the Board has announced an on-market share buyback of up to $400m over the next 12 months.\n\nWe also continue to focus on improving our return on invested capital (ROIC) and in 2022 we achieved a 13.8% ROIC, up from 5.8% in the prior year.\n\nThe Board will continue to focus on ensuring we have an appropriate capital structure to support the opportunities ahead for the business, as well as delivering strong returns for shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Towards the demerger\n\nThe Board believes that signi/ficant value can be unlocked by the separation of the explosives and fertilisers businesses, with both operating in large and attractive markets that value their industry leading technology and products.\n\nWith increased focus and appropriate capital structures, processes and policies for each business, these two iconic, but di/fferent businesses will be unencumbered to pursue their respective and unique destinies.\n\nNow, more than ever, we are seeing the increasing importance of food security and mining extraction to the world, as well as the rapid acceleration towards decarbonisation and electri/fication.\n\nThere is unprecedented opportunity for us to accelerate our growth through the development of technology and customer solutions and to capture the signi/ficant potential in the resources and agricultural sectors.\n\nAnd given how quickly the world is changing and the opportunity set in front of both businesses - it is clear that separating the two companies will further empower them to more successfully capture these markets.\n\nThe progress that Jeanne and the team have made to improve the reliability of our assets and develop and grow technology, coupled with our overall balance sheet capability, mean that we will pursue a separation from a position of strength.\n\nThis allows us to ensure both businesses will have capital structures that re/flect their di/fferent earnings pro/files and have the capacity to invest in the compelling growth opportunities they have in front of them.\n\nAlso, we know there is a high level of interest for an opportunity for separate exposures to either a premium explosives business, or a focused Australian fertilisers business from both existing shareholders and prospective shareholders.  This reinforces our view that increased choice for investors will be an important contributor in unlocking value from the separation.\n\nWe look forward to presenting the demerger proposal in further detail over coming months and to the shareholder vote expected within the next 12 months.\n\n## Waggaman strategic review\n\nOur corporate strategy is focused on adding value through technology solutions for our customers in both of our businesses to grow recurring earnings.\n\nThe review of Waggaman is in direct alignment with our long term corporate strategy and addresses the excess commodity exposure to ammonia in our current portfolio.\n\nGiven the current performance of Waggaman, the outlook for the global ammonia market and the external interest in this asset, we believe that now is the optimum time for the review and so completing the review will result in a short delay in the demerger process.\n\nWe will, of course, look to minimise the delay so as to retain the momentum we have established with the demerger process.\n\n## Our people\n\nDuring the year, as travel once again became possible,  the Board was able to visit our people on the ground with Board visits to Townsville, Gibson Island, Geelong and Werribee in Australia and Salt Lake City, Waggaman and Carthage in the USA. These visits provide us with important opportunities to gain more insights into the business, our people and our customers.\n\nIn the lead up to the demerger, we have made some exciting appointments for a future, stand-alone fertilisers business.\n\nIn June, we were delighted to announce Michael Carroll as Chairmandesignate of the fertilisers business. Mike is a highly experienced director and has a long history working in the agricultural sector across /finance, fertilisers and agricultural services.\n\nIn addition, current IPL Board member, Greg Robinson, will join Mike on the future board as a non-executive director. Greg will be a valuable addition, bringing knowledge of the fertilisers business, along with extensive experience across the resources, energy and /finance sectors.\n\nWe have also appointed the CEO-designate and CFO-designate for the fertilisers business with Christine Corbett and Chris Opperman taking on these roles and establishing what is a very capable senior management team to lead the business both in the lead up to, and following, the demerger.\n\nI would like to sincerely thank our Managing Director & CEO Jeanne Johns and the Executive Team for their impressive leadership, and all our people for their incredible hard work and dedication to IPL throughout the year.\n\nI would also like to thank my fellow Board members for their contribution throughout the year.\n\nLooking ahead, your company is in a strong position as we enter FY23 with both of our businesses performing well in very attractive markets and with great opportunities to be able to continue creating value for our shareholders and all other stakeholders. We have clear strategic directions established for both businesses and will be working diligently to deliver on those strategies over the coming year.\n\nBrian Kruger Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

I thank our people across the business for both their extraordinary e/fforts and the terri/fic outcome under these challenging circumstances.\n\nI am particularly proud of our cross functional team including those at Gibson Island who responded to the Australian government's concerns about AdBlue supply shortage over year-end 2021/22. IPL worked closely with the Australian government to increase our production from our normal 10% market share up to, at times, 80%. It was an extraordinary team e/ffort over a normally peak vacation period and I want to acknowledge all the sacri/fices made by our people to keep Australian trucks and other essential vehicles moving.\n\nOur company prospered throughout the 2022 /financial year and is well positioned going into next year.  Our customers value our reliability of supply and our distinctive technology that supports their safety, environmental, and productivity goals.  We produce essential products which underpin the agricultural and resource industries.  Our business and supply chain teams have worked tirelessly to keep our customers supplied and our business performing at a high level.\n\n## Safety and sustainability\n\nOur Zero Harm value has served us well during the peak of COVID-19 in January of this year. I am proud of how the team responded to the COVID-19 crisis - showing care for each other and our customers, putting in place the processes and systems to keep people safe. Our COVID-19 response has now been integrated into our overall safety management system.\n\nOur safety journey continued to improve as the number of process safety incidents decreased by 34%. While our personal safety recordable rate stayed /flat, I was pleased that injuries that resulted in serious harm continued to decrease for the third year running.\n\nWe continue on our journey to Net Zero by 2050, or earlier if practicable. In 2022, we progressed four signi/ficant projects to achieve this - Moranbah tertiary nitrous oxide abatement, Waggaman geological sequestration, the conversion of our Gibson Island manufacturing facility to green ammonia, and nitrous oxide abatement for our Louisiana, Missouri, facility. I am pleased that these four projects aim to deliver in excess of 42% GHG emission reductions against our 2020 baseline, for our current portfolio. We will be re-visiting our medium-term target next year as these projects progress and following the release of the Science Based Targets Initiative target setting methodology for the chemicals sector.\n\nWe also made signi/ficant progress in identifying and measuring the Scope 3 GHG emissions in our supply chains. In collaboration with a customer, we measured GHG emission reductions of 25% with the use of our premium technology DeltaE, which is currently being veri/fied by an independent third party. Our enhanced e/fficiency fertilisers have also demonstrated an ability to reduce emissions from their use by up to 70% (1) dependent upon the application, for our farming customers.",

        "page_content": "## Business performance\n\n2022 represents the best /financial performance in IPL corporate history with $1,027m NPAT excluding IMIs.\n\nOur Waggaman plant delivered US$344m in FY22 after US$70m in insurance recovery related to the February outage caused by a thirdparty original construction issue. I am very pleased to report that the plant continues to run reliably above the 95% manufacturing excellence target since its restart in April.\n\nOur explosive businesses operate in two of the best mining regions in the world, Australia and North America.\n\nIn North America, our explosives EBIT of US$110m was down 13% due to the lag in recovering energy, in/flation, and supply chain cost increases.  Overall volumes grew with good sales growth of our premium technology of electronic detonators and further Delta E uptake. The volume growth was driven by strong performance in Quarry and Construction and an increase in coal demand. Metals were slightly down due to temporary customer mine outages, partially o/ffset by growth in the Western US and Eastern Canada. Our manufacturing Agriculture and Industrial Chemicals segment delivered a record US$79m due to strong operations at St. Helens facility post the 2021 turnaround, capturing the available margin.\n\nIn our Asia Paci/fic region, EBIT increased 16% to $162m re/flecting strong customer and technology growth with a 14% increase in premium emulsions and an 18% increase in electronic detonators.\n\nAmmonium nitrate supply continues to be tight in both of our explosives markets and our businesses are well situated to capture projected positive pricing upon contract renewals over the next few years.\n\nOur fertilisers business delivered an EBIT of $614m, up 129%, as the business captured the upswing in commodity pricing while delivering a major planned turnaround at Phosphate Hill. The disruption in contracted natural gas supply from the Northern Territory to Phosphate Hill was managed to ensure the plant continued throughout the period at full rates. Natural gas will be secured for the coming year until full contracted supply is expected to resume in February. Distribution earnings remained resilient in a volatile supply and pricing environment, supported by good demand and agricultural conditions.\n\n## Progressing our strategic agenda\n\nWe made excellent progress across our strategic agenda for both businesses during the year.\n\nWe completed our purchase of Titanobel, entering the French quarry and construction market and providing access to Western African markets, with future facing mineral opportunities. The low penetration of technology in key European and African markets, especially electronic detonators, is a large opportunity for this business. When combined with our existing Nitromak business in Turkey, we have a compelling foundation to grow our explosives business across the EMEA region.\n\nOur soil health strategy was furthered with the purchase of Yara Nipro (now renamed Easy Liquids) and the increased ownership in Australian BioFerts. With these purchases, we will extend our fertiliser o/ffering to more organic bio fertilisers and expand our o/ffer in liquid specialty products, which are both growing segments of the fertilisers market.\n\nAlong with our pathway to Net Zero for each of our businesses, these purchases set the foundation for our intention to demerge and create two sector leading companies to pursue their di/fferent destinies.\n\n## Leadership\n\nWe are pleased to have CEO-designate of our fertiliser business, Christine Corbett, join the business. Christine joins the company with a wealth of executive experience in energy, e-commerce, retail and logistics, and will join the Executive Team running the fertilisers business until the demerger takes place.\n\nFurther strengthening our Executive Team, I am very pleased to welcome Paul Victor as our CFO. Paul brings strong /financial and business experience from his previous CFO role with the publicly listed entity Sasol of South Africa.\n\nWe are proud of our culture of valuing people and their development which has led to the opportunity to promote some of our key talent. Upon embedding the manufacturing facilities inside our business units, I was pleased to appoint Stephenie DeNichilio as our Chief HSE and Operations Excellence O/fficer during the year. Rob Mill likewise joined the Executive Team as Chief People O/fficer.\n\nI want to o/ffer my thanks to the dedicated teams across our businesses for their contributions to the company's success. I would also like to extend my thanks to the Board for their invaluable support during the year.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nThe supply/demand fundamentals for our products continue to look very favourable as we enter the new year. Our priority is to capture these tailwinds while managing supply disruptions and in/flationary pressure. We remain focused on safe, reliable operations, serving our customers with leading technology solutions, and enhancing our supply chain resilience.\n\nWe continue to invest in both our businesses in line with the macro trends of decarbonising the world's energy while meeting growing demand for food and materials. With investment in our strategy, we are targeting in the medium term for mid-to-high single digit growth in our explosives business and doubling our fertiliser distribution earnings through soil health o/fferings and improved supply positions.\n\nOur focus entering the new year is to maintain our momentum in earnings while we pursue the strategic option review for Waggaman. Demerger preparations will continue as we look to unlock additional value from these two iconic companies so they can pursue their respective destinies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJeanne Johns Managing Director & CEO",

IMIs) of $1,027m, an increase of 186% compared to $359m in the pcp.\n\n## Individually Material Items (IMIs)\n\nNPAT for FY22 includes a loss of $13m (FY21 a loss of $209m) of aftertax IMIs relating to costs incurred in preparing for IPL's proposed demerger ($9.2m pre-tax) and additional costs associated with the preparations for the closure of IPL's gas manufacturing facilities at Gibson Island, Queensland, ($10m pre-tax).\n\n## Capital Management\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) ex IMIs of 52.9 cents per share increased by 34.4 cents per share compared to FY21 EPS of 18.5 cents.\n\nA /final dividend of 17 cents per share 100% franked has been announced, representing a 51% payout ratio of NPAT (excl. IMIs).\n\nIn addition to the /final dividend, IPL announced its intention to undertake an on-market share buyback of $400 million over a 12 month period. This announcement is in line with the Capital Allocation Framework announced at IPL's Investor Day on 6 September 2022. IPL has established its Capital Allocation Framework with the objective of enhancing shareholder value through optimising its weighted average cost of capital while retaining an appropriately strong credit pro/file in support of its investment grade credit ratings.\n\nThe buyback is expected to bene/fit shareholders by reducing the shares on issue with a resultant improvement in earnings per share, dividends per share and returns on equity.\n\nIPL has su/fficient cash reserves and committed bank facilities to complete the buyback. The share buyback will be conducted in the ordinary course of trading and the exact amount and timing of share purchases will be dependent on regulatory requirements and market conditions.\n\n## Net Debt\n\nNet debt increased by $32m to $1,036m at 30 September 2022 (pcp: $1,004m) and Net Debt/EBITDA ex IMIs decreased to 0.5x (pcp: 1.1x). Net debt increased during the year as a result of the acquisitions of Titanobel and Yara Nipro ($144m), investments in sustenance (including turnarounds) and minor growth projects ($434m), dividends paid to shareholders ($355m), lease liability payments ($43m) and other non-cash movements in net debt ($139m) o/ffsetting almost $1.1b of operating cash/flows. The Group's investment grade credit ratings were maintained:\n\n- \u00bb S&P: BBB (stable outlook)\n- \u00bb Moody's: Baa2 (stable outlook)\n\n## Zero Harm\n\nIPL's Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (5) (TRIFR) for the rolling twelve-month period ended 30 September 2022 was 0.89, an increase from 0.87 at 30 September 2021. There were 25 Process Safety Incidents (6) recorded in FY22 (pcp:38). The Company maintained its strong environmental safety record with zero Signi/ficant Environmental Incidents (7) during the year (pcp: 0). IPL has refreshed its safety programs to drive improvement.\n\n## Financial Performance\n\n|                                  | Year ended 30 September   | Year ended 30 September   | Year ended 30 September   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| INCOME STATEMENT                 | FY22  A$m                 | FY21  A$m                 | Change  %                 |\n| Revenue                          |                           |                           |                           |\n| Business Revenue                 |                           |                           |                           |\n| DNA                              | 2,532.9                   | 1,588.7                   | 59                        |\n| DNAP                             | 1,200.4                   | 937.8                     | 28                        |\n| Fertilisers APAC                 | 2,647.8                   | 1,894.6                   | 40                        |\n| Eliminations                     | (65.8)                    | (72.6)                    | 9                         |\n| Group Revenue                    | 6,315.3                   | 4,348.5                   | 45                        |\n| EBIT                             |                           |                           |                           |\n| Business EBIT ex IMIs            |                           |                           |                           |\n| DNA                              | 759.3                     | 189.9                     | 300                       |\n| DNAP                             | 162.5                     | 140.2                     | 16                        |\n| Fertilisers APAC                 | 613.7                     | 268.4                     | 129                       |\n| Eliminations                     | 0.8                       | (1.8)                     | nm*                       |\n| Corporate                        | (51.1)                    | (30.3)                    | (69)                      |\n| Group EBIT ex IMIs               | 1,485.2                   | 566.4                     | 162                       |\n| EBIT margin                      | 23.5%                     | 13.0%                     |                           |\n| NPAT                             |                           |                           |                           |\n| Underlying interest expense  (8) | (101.4)                   | (107.4)                   | 6                         |\n| Non-cash unwinding liabilities   | (5.8)                     | (5.4)                     | (7)                       |\n| Net borrowing costs              | (107.2)                   | (112.8)                   | 5                         |\n| Tax expense ex IMIs              | (350.8)                   | (95.0)                    | (269)                     |\n| Minority interest                | (0.1)                     | -                         | nm*                       |\n| NPAT excluding IMIs              | 1,027.1                   | 358.6                     | 186                       |\n| IMIs after tax                   | (13.4)                    | (209.5)                   | 94                        |\n| Group NPAT                       | 1,013.7                   | 149.1                     | 580                       |\n\n*not meaningful",

        "page_content": "## FY22 Business Review\n\nThe Group reported FY22 Earnings Before Interest and Tax excluding IMI's (EBIT) of $1,485m, an increase of $919m compared to pcp. Major movements for the year were as follows:\n\nManufacturing Performance: Aside from the one-o/ff incident at WALA, the plant operated at nameplate capacity throughout the year. With the exception of Phosphate Hill where production rates were below nameplate leading into the turnaround, manufacturing reliability saw strong improvements at IPL's other ammonia plants. This is a positive re/flection of the investment made by IPL into improving plant reliability over the past 4 years.\n\nThe net /financial impact of planned turnarounds was negligible with the favourable impact of turnarounds in FY21 at Waggaman, Moranbah and St Helens o/ffset by the impact of the Phosphate Hill turnaround in FY22. The Cheyenne turnaround, scheduled for later in FY23, is the last of the plants scheduled for its turnaround as part of the reliability improvement plan.\n\nReliable production at around nameplate capacity has been achieved at all plants following the turnarounds.\n\nPhosphate Hill Gas: Phosphate Hill's contracted gas supply was disrupted throughout the year due to the performance of a third party provider. To maintain production and capitalise on a high DAP price, gas was purchased on the spot market at an incremental cost to contract of $41m. IPF's gas supplier has advised that full quantities are expected to be restored by February 2023.\n\nDepreciation: The $7m net favourable depreciation impact is largely driven by the impairment of the Gibson Island manufacturing facility (recognised in September 2021) resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of $23m in the fertilisers business. This was partially o/ffset by additional charges resulting from the three major turnarounds completed in FY21 (Waggaman, St Helens and Moranbah).\n\nWALA Incident: An incident occurred in mid-February 2022 (net $83m)  which brought the plant down for repairs for approximately 8 weeks at a cost of $182m (US$128m). The insurance claim was /finalised during the year and resulted in a recovery of approximately $99m (US$70m).\n\nAmericas Explosives: The $11m improvement was supported by strong market growth primarily across the Coal and Q&C sectors. End market coal production has been supported by elevated natural gas prices, while construction rates remain strong despite escalating in/flation.  Further to this, the business results were negatively impacted by a lagging impact of passing on the continuous price increases experienced during the year.\n\nAsia Paci/fic Explosives: Dyno Nobel's premium technology suite continues to deliver strong results underpinning the $32m improvement in earnings. Increased sales of key o/fferings such as Delta E, Cyber Det and Electronics contributed an additional $8m in earnings compared with the pcp, with a further $7m bene/fit coming from new customers looking to gain access to Dyno's advanced technology. As previously communicated to the market, a further $11m earnings improvement came from the less pro/fitable WA contracts rolling o/ff in FY22. The international businesses continue to recover from the impacts of COVID with an increase in o/ffshore earnings (primarily Turkey) of approximately $10m. Unfavourable weather conditions negatively impacted the result by $4m.\n\nAsia Paci/fic Fertilisers: The $9m decrease in distribution earnings primarily relates to a reduction in domestic sales volume and costs associated with investment in the distribution network. Heavy rains in key regions in Southern Queensland and NSW impacted fertiliser application, while high prices also resulted in reduced demand. The extreme price volatility during the year was managed through selective procurement and stock management decisions - resulting in year on year volume reduction. However, strong margins (on a dollar per tonne basis) were realised.\n\nSupply Chain/In/flation: Despite management action to address cost pressures through e/fficiency improvements and contract pricing, the speed and extent of global supply chain pressures and rising in/flation had a negative impact on the FY22 result. The impact was most prominent in the DNA business ($41m of the $54m) and includes higher cost of energy, raw materials related to Initiating Systems and abnormal freight costs driven by supply chain disruptions. The lag in recovery of these cost increases is expected to materially reduce in FY23.\n\nCommodity Prices & Foreign Exchange: Higher commodity prices, primarily ammonia and DAP, contributed $920m to the result compared to pcp, with a weaker Australian dollar contributing a further bene/fit of $80m.\n\nCorporate: Corporate costs increased compared to the pcp. The increase includes provisioning for legal claims.\n\n## Strategic review of WALA and implications for structural separation of the Explosives and Fertilisers businesses\n\nOn 15 November 2022, IPL announced that it had received a number of unsolicited approaches in relation to a potential acquisition of its ammonia manufacturing facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, USA (WALA). The Company will undertake a review of the strategic options for WALA in the near-term. Under any scenario, IPL intends to maintain the strategic value of long-term supply of ammonia from WALA into the Dyno Nobel Americas business. An estimate of the /financial impact cannot be made at this point.\n\nThe strategic review process will have implications for the timing of the proposed structural separation of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses which was announced on 23 May 2022. It is currently anticipated that the previously communicated target completion date for the separation of early 2023 will likely be extended by 6-12 months, pending the completion of the strategic review process for WALA. There has been no impact on the /financial statements for FY22 in relation to the proposed structural separation other than the costs incurred to date which have been classi/fied as an individually material item and disclosed in the notes to the /financial statements.",

The movement was mainly due to the impact of higher commodities in both the Fertilisers and Explosives businesses ($292m) and the lower utilisation of trade working capital /financing facilities ($64m). Change in accounting method to transfer precious metals to inventory ($48m) and business acquisitions/new business ($91m). Underlying trade working capital (excluding the impact of /financing facilities) as a percentage of sales remained /flat with the pcp at 16.2%.\n- \u00bb Net Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E) : Increase of $318m ($140m excl impact of FX translation). Mainly driven by sustenance and turnaround capital expenditure of $316m, growth and sustainability capital spend of $119m and the /fixed assets acquired through the purchase of Titanobel and Yara Nipro ($32m). This is partially o/ffset by depreciation expense for the year of $303m, disposals and writedowns of $11m and transfers to inventory of $12m.\n- \u00bb Intangible Assets : Increase of $281m ($90m excluding the impact of FX translation). Mainly driven by the goodwill and other intangibles recognised upon acquisition of Titanobel and Yara Nipro of $92m. Amortisation charges for the year are mostly o/ffset by minor additions.\n\n## Liabilities\n\n- \u00bb Environmental & restructure liabilities : Increase of $6m ($1m excluding the impact of FX translation). Mainly driven by an increase in the Gibson Island closure provision of $10m and the interest unwind on long term asset restoration obligation provisions of $5m. This was o/ffset by spend against provisions for the year, primarily in relation to Gibson Island closure preparation.\n- \u00bb Net other assets : Increase of $137m. Mainly due to Phosphate Hill security deposit paid in relation to spot gas purchases of $46m, WALA insurance proceeds accrual $35m (of which approximately $25m has since been received) and settlement of the payable owing to the bank as part of the trade receivables facility at 30 September 2021 of $58m.\n- \u00bb Net Debt : Increase of $32m (decrease of $77m excluding the impact of FX translation). Mainly due to strong cash generation driven by rising commodity prices o/ffset by a reduction in the use of trade working capital /financing facilities (-$64m), payments related to sustenance capital expenditure (-$343m), growth capital (-$91m) and payment for acquisitions of Titanobel and Yara Nipro (-$144m).

The improvement is primarily a result of higher earnings in FY22 with EBITDA (excl. IMIs) improving 99% over the pcp.\n\nInterest Cover : Improved to 20.3x (pcp: 9.7x).\n\nCredit Ratings: Investment Grade credit ratings remained unchanged:\n\n- \u00bb S&P: BBB (stable outlook)\n- \u00bb Moody's: Baa2 (stable outlook)\n\n## Debt Facilities\n\nIPL has su/fficient liquidity and headroom with $797m of available undrawn committed debt facilities at 30 September 2022.\n\nThe average tenor of the Group's debt facilities at 30 September 2022 is 4.2 years (September 2021: 5.1 years). No committed debt facilities are due to mature until April 2024.\n\n## Trade Working Capital Facilities\n\nIPL uses trade working capital facilities to e/ffectively manage the Group's cash /flows, which are impacted by seasonality, demand and supply variability.\n\nThe Group has a non-recourse receivable purchasing agreement to sell certain domestic and international receivables to an unrelated entity in exchange for cash. As at 30 September 2022, receivables totalling $95m (30 September 2021: $124m) had been sold under the receivable purchasing agreement.\n\nIPL also o/ffers suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain /financing. The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against several indicators to assess whether to classify outstanding amounts as payables or borrowings. The balance of the supply chain /finance program, classi/fied as payables, at 30 September 2022 was $173m (30 September 2020: $208m).\n\n## Capital Allocation\n\nIPL's capital allocation process is centralised and overseen by the Group's Corporate Finance function. Capital is invested on a prioritised basis and all submissions are assessed against risk factors including HSE, sustainability, operational, /financial and other strategic risks. Capital is broadly categorised into /first order capital (sustenance, turnaround, sustainability and minor growth) and second order capital (major growth).\n\nOther than the company acquisitions during the year, there was no second order capital investment.\n\nThe table below includes a summary of cash spend per business on growth and sustenance capital:\n\n|                      | Year ended 30 September   | Year ended 30 September   | Year ended 30 September   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| IPL GROUP            | FY22  A$m                 | FY21  A$m                 | Change  A$m               |\n| Capital Expenditure  |                           |                           |                           |\n| DNA                  | 28.7                      | 24.6                      | 4.1                       |\n| DNAP                 | 33.3                      | 18.6                      | 14.7                      |\n| Fertilisers          | 29.2                      | 8.0                       | 21.2                      |\n| Minor growth capital | 91.2                      | 51.2                      | 40.0                      |\n| DNA                  | 118.3                     | 82.6                      | 35.7                      |\n| DNAP                 | 19.5                      | 22.3                      | (2.8)                     |\n| Fertilisers          | 64.3                      | 49.1                      | 15.2                      |\n| Sustenance           | 202.1                     | 154.0                     | 48.1                      |\n| DNA                  | 20.5                      | 82.9                      | (62.4)                    |\n| DNAP                 | 5.3                       | 53.5                      | (48.2)                    |\n| Fertilisers          | 87.1                      | 13.4                      | 73.7                      |\n| Turnaround           | 112.9                     | 149.8                     | (36.9)                    |\n| DNA                  | 22.9                      | -                         | 22.9                      |\n| DNAP                 | 4.9                       | -                         | 4.9                       |\n| Fertilisers          | -                         | -                         | -                         |\n| Sustainability       | 27.8                      | -                         | 27.8                      |\n| Total                | 434.0                     | 355.0                     | 79.0                      |\n\nSubject to currency /fluctuations, sustenance spend is expected to be in the range of $180m to $220m. Turnaround spend is expected to be approximately $60m to $80m with spending on sustainability targeted to be between $50m and $60m. These amounts don't include one-o/ff strategic sustenance expenditure on upgrades of Gibson Island distribution assets in order to return volumes to historical market share levels.",

Signi/ficant movements included:\n\n- \u00bb EBITDA : Increased by $923m driven by favourable realised commodity price movements ($920m) and favourable movements in the A$:US$ exchange rate ($80m). The unfavourable one-o/ff net impact of the WALA incident in midFebruary of $83m and the Phosphate Hill gas supply disruption of $41m was partially o/ffset by improved manufacturing reliability, particularly at Waggaman of $75m. Downstream business earnings (excluding manufacturing, non-controllables and supply chain/in/flation impacts) improved by $34m primarily due to growth in the DNAP business.  The impact of supply chain disruptions and in/flation was $54m.\n- \u00bb Net Interest Paid : Decreased by $25m, principally as a result of a one-o/ff interest cost in FY21 relating to the bond buy-back ($14m) and lower levels of borrowings in FY22 versus pcp, partially o/ffset by increasing interest rates and a weakening AUD.\n- \u00bb TWC Movement : Increased $272m compared to the pcp largely as a result of higher commodities driving higher TWC balances at the end of FY22 and lower usage of trade working capital /financing facilities (down $64m on pcp).\n- \u00bb Dividends received from JV's :  Decreased by $37m with one of IPL's larger JV partners (QNP) not paying a dividend in FY22 due to a turnaround taking place during the year. Turnarounds generally take place every 4 years. Additionally, a large US based joint venture declared a lower dividend in FY22 compared with FY21.\n- \u00bb Other Non-TWC : Decreased $115m compared to the pcp largely as a result of timing of payments and accruals including the Phosphate Hill security deposit paid in relation to spot gas purchases of $46m and WALA insurance proceeds accrual of $35m.\n\n## Investing Cash Flow\n\nNet investing cash out/flows of $575m increased $232m as compared to the pcp. Signi/ficant movements included:\n\n- \u00bb Minor growth capital: Higher growth spend of $40m supporting plant e/fficiency projects and other projects supporting volume growth and technology investments. These projects have a short pay-back period.\n- \u00bb Sustenance capital: Higher sustenance spend re/flects the impact of the largest turnaround on record at Phosphate Hill/ Mt Isa ($87m in FY22), decarbonisation projects required to meet our greenhouse gas reduction targets and investment in manufacturing and distribution facilities to drive reliability improvement.\n- \u00bb Acquisition of subsidiaries and non-controlling interests: Cash out/flow for the acquisition of Titanobel ($124m) and Yara Nipro ($20m).\n\n## Financing Cash Flow\n\nNet /financing cash out/flow of $551m was $267m higher compared with the pcp. Signi/ficant movements included:\n\n- \u00bb Dividends paid to members of IPL: Higher dividend of $336m in line with increased earnings. Payout ratio of 51% of Group NPAT (excl IMI's).\n- \u00bb Foreign Exchange on Net Debt: The non-cash increase of $107m re/flects the impact from translating US dollar denominated debt at a lower exchange rate.",

Outlined below are the major earnings movements during the year for each business segment.\n\n## Explosives\n\n## Business Performance\n\nExplosives earnings for FY22 of US$110m was US$16m lower than the pcp principally due to the following:\n\nEBIT Margins: The rapid impact of in/flation, energy costs and supply chain interruptions has had a temporary negative impact on EBIT margins.\n\nManufacturing: The positive earnings impact of US$5m re/flects the recovery from outages in FY21 at the Cheyenne, WY. and Louisiana, MO, plants. The recovery was partially o/ffset by the impact of minor outages at the Louisiana, MO, plant in 2H22.\n\nCustomer Growth: US$8m growth in volumes, primarily driven by Quarries & Construction, where volumes were up 9% on pcp due to strong market fundamentals and market share gain. The elevated natural gas prices also led to a resurgence in end market coal demand (volumes up 19%), driving elevated volumes vs pcp.\n\nWhile Metals volumes were down overall (-4%) due to customer mine closures, 2H22 volumes were supported by the start-up of several new customers.\n\nSupply Chain / In/flation: In/flationary pressure, higher energy costs, and supply chain dislocation led to a US$29m unfavourable impact to earnings:\n\n- \u00bb In/flationary Pressure: US$9m unfavourable impact due to high demand for raw materials and tightness in supply driving up material costs at a quicker rate than price recovery.\n- \u00bb Higher Energy cost: US$12m increase due to elevated utility and commodity prices. Elevated ammonia and fuel costs, together with higher electricity charges, impacted the cost of production and supply.\n- \u00bb Supply Chain Dislocation: US$8m increase in costs related to scarcity of raw materials, which results in additional freight movements to supply customers and plants, and led to elevated costs to meet customer demand. The rate of in/flation increases was unprecedented. Management has worked to reduce the lag caused by continuous cost increases.\n\n## Market Summary\n\n## Quarry & Construction\n\n42% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Quarry & Construction sector in FY22 (43% pcp). The strong growth in this sector in 1H22 carried over into 2H22 as US infrastructure spending and a healthy construction market supported 9% volume growth compared to pcp.\n\n## Base & Precious Metals\n\n36% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Base & Precious Metals sector in FY22 (39% pcp). Volumes decreased by 4% during the year with revenues (in dollar terms) near /flat compared to the pcp. The primary driver of the decreased volume was temporary customer mine closures and lower seasonal Arctic shipments which are expected to return to previous levels in 2H23. These volume decreases were partially o/ffset by volume growth in the Western US.\n\n## Coal\n\n22% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Coal sector in FY22 (18% pcp). Volumes were up 19% versus the pcp as elevated natural gas prices have incentivised the power sector to temporarily switch back to more coal-generated power.",

Elevated natural gas prices partially o/ffset this favourable movement resulting in a net favourable earnings impact of US$303m.\n\nManufacturing Reliability: Production at the Waggaman plant was at nameplate capacity preceding, and at nameplate after, the reported 1H22 incident.  The recovery from the turnaround and weather outages in the pcp resulted in a US$103m bene/fit.\n\n1H22 outage: As previously disclosed, the FY22 results were impacted by an 8-week closure of the facility, which resulted in a US$128m negative impact to the result.  IPL recovered approximately US$70m from property insurance coverage, resulting in a net impact from the outage of US$58m.\n\nDepreciation: US$8m higher than pcp.  As previously disclosed, depreciation is higher primarily as a result of the FY21 turnaround.\n\nDiscount to Tampa Ammonia price: The discount realised on sales priced at Tampa benchmark in FY22 was approximately 8% prior to the 8-week outage.  The timing of sales volumes contributes to the disconnect between the realised price and the benchmark index, as the outage coincided with highest benchmark months.\n\nThe discount realised on sales priced on other benchmarks (primarily sales to Dyno's Louisiana MO facility) performed as expected in the elevated Tampa Ammonia pricing market, with FY22 being the /first year since operations commenced where the pricing resulted in a discount to Tampa rather than a premium. Ammonia supply (into Dyno's Louisiana, MO facility) and o/fftake (from Waggaman, LA facility) decisions are continuously evaluated to maximise cash /flow to the Dyno Nobel Americas business.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing performance in the Explosives and Ag & IC businesses during FY22 was as follows:\n\nCheyenne, Wyoming: Cheyenne ammonia operations recovered from unplanned outages in FY21. As a result, ammonia production was up 3% compared to pcp.  Nitric Acid production was negatively impacted due to an unplanned electrical feed outage, resulting in decreased production of 2% compared to pcp.\n\nLouisiana, Missouri: Overall production was up 16% on the pcp.\n\nSt Helens, Oregon: Urea and ammonia production from the St Helens plant increased 25% and 28% respectively, compared to the pcp, with plant production slightly above expectations post turnaround.\n\nWaggaman, Louisiana: As previously disclosed, the plant operated at nameplate capacity up to the February incident that resulted in an 8-week closure of the facility.  Following a successful re-start in mid-April 2022, the plant operated at nameplate capacity for the remainder of FY22.",

Major movements for the year were due to the following:\n\nForeign Exchange and Commodity Prices: $472m net increase, primarily driven by higher DAP price ($851/t vs $524/t), higher Urea price ($710/t vs $373/t) and lower AUD:USD exchange rate (0.72 vs 0.76), partially o/ffset by higher cost sulphur/sulphuric acid.\n\nCost of Gas - Phosphate Hill: Gas supply disruptions at Phosphate Hill increasing FY22 gas cost by $41m (~A$10m incurred in 1H22). Power and Water Corporation (gas supplier) expect full supply to be restored in February 2023. Additional top-up gas volumes to be purchased to make up shortfalls to February 2023 at an estimated cost of approximately $60m to $70m in FY23.\n\nDepreciation: Net $23m reduction in depreciation charges due to the impairment of Gibson Island assets in September 2021 o/ffset in part by higher depreciation at Phosphate Hill mainly related to capital expenditure for the construction of critical infrastructure.\n\nPlanned Plant Shutdowns: Phosphate Hill turnaround completed during 2H FY22. This planned shutdown negatively impacted earnings by $74m compared to the pcp.\n\nManufacturing Reliability: $25m net decrease due to lower than expected production and plant e/fficiency at Phosphate Hill in the run up to the turnaround.\n\nVolumes and Margins: Distribution volumes were lower as a result of lower demand, largely due to higher pricing, wet weather and global fertiliser supply constraints. Distribution margins when measured as a function of revenue will naturally decrease when commodity prices increase. Distribution EBIT margin per tonne in FY22 was up slightly versus pcp.\n\n## Market Summary\n\nTotal Fertilisers Asia Paci/fic sales volumes of 2,576k metric tonnes was 20% lower than FY21 sales of 3,220k metric tonnes. The planned 8 week turnaround at Phosphate Hill adversely impacted sales volumes in FY23 as did lower demand, largely due to higher pricing, wet weather and global fertilisers supply constraints.\n\nGlobal fertiliser prices traded signi/ficantly higher in FY22 with realised Ammonium Phosphate prices improving by more than 62% compared with the pcp while, despite its volatility, realised Urea prices increased 90% over the pcp. The supply and demand dynamic remains broadly favourable to support strong prices in the near term.\n\nProgress on the soil health strategy continues, highlighted by an increase in Nutrient Advantage earnings and the acquisition of the Yara Nipro liquid fertiliser business.",

        "page_content": "## Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing performance in the Fertilisers Asia Paci/fic business in FY22 was as follows:\n\n## Phosphate Hill\n\nAmmonium phosphate production decreased to 736k mt, down 23% on pcp. The lower production was a combination of the planned turnaround as well as some critical pieces of equipment operating at below capacity leading into the turnaround that commenced in early May 2022.\n\nAmmonium phosphates cost per tonne was impacted by a number of factors, the most consequential being the increased cost of gas and sulphur. Higher depreciation and some additional repair costs leading into the turnaround also contributed to the higher cost per tonne.\n\n## Gibson Island\n\nIn response to the critical shortage of AdBlue in the Australian market resulting from international supply chain disruptions, IPL's Gibson Island plant, with the assistance of the Federal Government, was able to rapidly recon/figure its production to uprate the production of AdBlue and satisfy the Australian demand.\n\nThe plant produced 405k mt of urea equivalent product, down 19% on pcp. The majority of the reduced production resulted from various minor equipment failures and ine/fficiencies, the majority of which have been addressed. The plant is on track to close at the end of the calendar year.\n\n## OUTLOOK AND SENSITIVITIES\n\nIPL does not generally provide pro/fit guidance, primarily due to the variability of commodity prices and foreign exchange movements. Instead, IPL provides an outlook for business performance expectations and sensitivities to key earnings drivers based on management's current view at the time of this report.\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Dyno Nobel Americas\n\n- \u00bb The explosives business is well placed to bene/fit from heightened ammonium nitrate pricing.\n- \u00bb Apart from a potential outage of up to 4 weeks to allow the installation of a replacement cooler (if required) the Waggaman plant is expected to produce at nameplate capacity in FY23. The operational earnings of Waggaman remain subject to movements in ammonia and natural gas prices.\n- \u00bb Tampa Discount - Ammonia sales from the Waggaman facility should return to the historical contract mix, with tonnes that are priced o/ff the Tampa index returning to a 6-8% discount to Tampa. Should the Tampa benchmark price remain at the recent level of circa US1,000/mt, when factoring in those sales that are not linked to the Tampa benchmark, the overall discount is expected to be between 13% and 15% in FY23.\n- \u00bb Agriculture & Industrial Chemicals earnings remain subject to movements in global fertiliser prices, particularly Urea.\n- \u00bb The St. Helens fertiliser plant is scheduled for a 28 day outage in February 2023 for mid-cycle maintenance.\n- \u00bb The Cheyenne, WY ammonia facility is scheduled for a 55 day planned turnaround in June/July 2023.\n- \u00bb Coal demand is expected to be /flat to FY22 as higher demand based on elevated natural gas prices and low electric generator inventory levels lead to restocking.\n- \u00bb Quarry and Construction growth is expected to continue driven by residential and infrastructure spending. Growth of 3% to 5% is expected.\n- \u00bb Metals - Growth in the overall metals sector is expected to be in the low single digits.\n- \u00bb Dyno's market leading technology is expected to support growth in future facing commodity markets, with a recent contract win in Chile a good example.\n- \u00bb The negative impacts of higher in/flation, energy costs and supply chain dislocations are expected to be mostly recovered in FY23 through price escalations and contract negotiations.\n- \u00bb The full year earnings from WALA that are attributable to the DNA business in FY23 could be impacted by the outcome of the announced strategic review, and the timing of the settlement of any sale transaction that may result.\n\n## Dyno Nobel Asia Paci/fic\n\n- \u00bb Favourable pricing conditions on the East Coast of Australia are expected over the re-contracting cycle.\n- \u00bb Technology growth is expected to continue at a run-rate similar to the guidance provided in FY20 as customers look to drill more complex ore bodies and increasingly value productivity, safety and environmental improvements.\n- \u00bb Moranbah is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $10m due to the cessation of ammonia supply from Gibson Island (20kt per annum).\n- \u00bb Supply Chain and in/flationary costs continue to challenge and impact the business. Although e/fficiency improvements are expected to mitigate the impact, FY23 is expected to see a lag in being able to recover some of these costs through re-pricing.",

        "page_content": "## Fertilisers Asia Paci/fic\n\n- \u00bb Fertiliser's earnings will continue to be dependent on global fertiliser prices, the A$:US$ exchange rate and weather conditions.\n- \u00bb Despite the severe /flooding in NSW and southern Queensland, agricultural conditions across Eastern Australia are generally favourable. Increased soil moisture levels in most districts on the East Coast, coupled with high dam levels is expected to drive demand for fertiliser through the year. This is further subject to weather conditions in FY23.\n- \u00bb Farm economics are expected to remain favourable through FY23 with farmer cash/flows supportive of strong fertiliser demand, although high fertiliser prices can in/fluence volumes.\n- \u00bb Distribution earnings expected to bene/fit further from IPL's soil health strategy.\n- \u00bb Distribution margins and volumes will continue to be in/fluenced by Australian East Coast agronomic conditions and global fertiliser prices. Global supply constraints ex China and Europe may pose a risk for fertiliser import volumes in FY23.\n- \u00bb Phosphate Hill is expected to produce approximately 1,000kt in FY23 after a successful turnaround in FY22. Gas supply disruptions at Phosphate Hill are expected to continue in 1H FY23. Power and Water Corporation (gas supplier) con/firmed full quantities to be restored in February 2023. Additional gas volumes to be purchased to make up shortfalls at an estimated incremental cost of approximately $60m to $70m.\n- \u00bb Production of Ammonia at Gibson Island will cease in early January 2023 with a staged shutdown of downstream production anticipated to cease by end February 2023.\n\n## Group\n\nCorporate: Corporate costs are expected to be approximately $40m in FY23 (excluding impact of demerger). This includes an allowance for increased spend on international business development, an allowance for wage growth and minor investment in energy transition and HR Organisational Development.\n\nBorrowing Costs: Net borrowing costs for FY23 are expected to be approximately $133m. The increase is primarily related to higher interest rates and amortisation charges.\n\nTaxation: IPL's e/ffective tax rate for FY23 is expected to be between 24% and 26%.\n\nHedging Program: US$350m of FY23 US$ linked fertilisers sales are hedged at a rate of $0.7418 with a further US$240m hedged via a collar (cap of $0.7500 and a /floor of $0.6184).

These risks, which may occur individually or concurrently, could signi/ficantly a/ffect the Group's business and operations. For some of the risks described below, factors such as continuing global geopolitical uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, in/flationary pressures and global recessionary risks have the potential to exacerbate those risks. IPL is also undertaking a demerger to implement a structural separation of its fertilisers and explosives businesses to create two separately listed companies on the ASX. Some of these risks may be heightened for the businesses on a stand-alone basis.\n\nThere may be additional risks unknown to IPL and other risks, currently believed to be immaterial, which could become material.

The safety of our people, customers, and community is our core value and integral to the way we work and operate.\n\nZero Harm is fundamental in everything we do - it is our core company value. This year we continued to work towards our ambition to achieve industry leading performance in occupational health, personal safety, process safety and reducing our impact on the environment.\n\nOur safety performance is tracked against our three-year strategic plan which targets the delivery of global Zero Harm initiatives and is supported by our global collaboration networks.\n\n## 2022 safety performance\n\nThe Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) has plateaued in FY22 with a Group TRIFR of 0.89. Even though our overall TRIFR target was not achieved, injuries that have resulted in serious harm have continued to decrease by 73% over the last three years, with zero fatalities for 2 years.\n\nThe Group focus continues to be on improving personal safety performance through maintaining operating discipline, e/ffective visible safety leadership with quality safety conversations, and targeted injury reduction programs such as our Safe Hands campaign. Our SafeTEAMS training has also continued to be e/ffective with our global workforce emphasising psychological safety and reporting to reinforce a learning culture.\n\nWe have been able to sustain our excellent environmental performance with Zero Signi/ficant Environmental Incidents reported through implementation of key environmental compliance initiatives.\n\n## Zero Harm snapshot\n\nIPL TRIFR (2) (Number of recordables)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProcess Safety Incidents decreased with 25 in FY22 compared to 38 last year delivering a year-on-year improvement of 31%. The signi/ficant improvement re/flects the implementation of process safety improvement plans for both group and business units with continued focus on delivering e/ffective operational risk management and learning from Signi/ficant Events. A detailed understanding of loss of containment process safety events has enabled the identi/fication of e/ffective strategies for further reducing the frequency of these events. (1)\n\nThe targeted performance in signi/ficant event management for investigations completed was achieved. The quality of our investigations has signi/ficantly improved with a focus on embedding our learnings with establishment of our Global Signi/ficant Event Governance Forum. We have also seen a signi/ficant increase in the hazard/near-miss-to-incident ratio in Signi/ficant Events, with a 94% improvement over the last 3 years, demonstrating continuous improvement in hazard awareness and reporting, and active learning from Signi/ficant Events to prevent harm to people and the community. Transport related Signi/ficant Events have also diminished as a result of implementation of controls and intervention strategies during FY22.\n\n## Environment 2022 Goal\n\nZero Signi/ficant Environmental Incidents\n\n## TARGET ACHIEVED\n\nTARGET EXCEEDED\n\n## Process Safety Management 2022 Goal\n\nTarget achieved for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Process Safety Incidents\n\n- (1)   Tier 1 and 2 Process Safety Incidents as de/fined by the Centre for Chemical Process Safety.\n- (2) TRIFR is calculated as the number of recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked and includes contract workers.\n- (3) Signi/ficant Environmental Incidents as assessed against IPL's internal risk matrix with consequences of 5 or higher on a 6-level scale.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This commitment is driven by our Company Values, which are core to our business, and built into our six Strategic Drivers.\n\nIn order to identify those issues most material for our stakeholders and our business, we conduct a biennial materiality review. The steps in this process follow Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, with our most recent materiality assessment conducted in 2021. This materiality assessment was designed to identify the broader megatrends that are currently shaping our operating environment and impacting the ways in which we create value. These are shown on the following page along with 2022 highlights.\n\nDuring 2022, and in keeping with our announced plans to structurally separate our explosives and fertilisers businesses, we also reviewed our materiality assessment in terms of each of our business units, Dyno Nobel and Incitec Pivot Fertilisers. Our 2022 Sustainability Report will be released in February 2023 ahead of the Annual General Meeting and will describe in detail the megatrends and identi/fied material issues and topics for each of these businesses, and how they are leveraging key environmental, social and governance (ESG) trends to create value.

For this reason, the production of these essential agricultural and mining products is currently based on a hard-to-abate chemical process.\n\nLast year, we investigated new technologies required to decarbonise and developed a potential Net Zero Pathway to 2050. During 2022, we focussed on progressing a range of projects to meet our 2025 reduction target and to support a more ambitious 2030 target. Our 2022 progress has allowed us to:\n\n- \u00bb Approve a project to underpin our short-term absolute reduction target of 5% of operational (Scope 1 & 2) GHG by 2025;\n- \u00bb Identify projects that create a pathway to a greater than 42% reduction by 2030 ; and\n- \u00bb Rea/ffirm our ambition to achieve Net Zero GHG by 2050 or sooner if practicable.\n\n## Total direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n2014\n\n2013\n\n2012\n\n2011\n\n2010\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n2014\n\n2013\n\n2012\n\n2011\n\n2010\n\n## Water Use and Discharge\n\nCooling water is also a key necessity for nitrogen manufacturing. In addition to IPL's comprehensive annual risk management process and climate scenarios, the World Resources Institute (WRI) Water Tool is completed each year for long term projections and reviewed by IPL's Chief Risk O/fficer.\n\nOur 2022 total global water withdrawal increased by 16% on 2021 withdrawal, to 48,467 megalitres (ML). We discharged 29,648 ML to the environment, 95.7% of which was clean cooling water returned under EPA licence to the US rivers from which it was taken. This brings our net water use to 18,819 ML in 2022. For more details on our assessment of water risks and water management strategies, see IPL's 2022 Climate Change Report, currently available on IPL's website, and IPL's 2022 Sustainability Report, which will be available on IPL's website after its release in February 2023.\n\nDuring 2022, we also made signi/ficant progress on managing our Scope 3 GHG emissions, engaging a specialist third party to review our Scope 3 calculations methodology and reduction opportunities, and to investigate Science Based Targets for IPL and its businesses. For more detail on Scope 3 progress and the projects identi/fied to support our operational targets see the Climate Change section on the following pages, and IPL's 2022 Climate Change Report.\n\nOur 2022 global energy use increased by 11% since 2021 due to a 16% increase in ammonia production, as production recovered against major plant outages in 2021. This also increased our Scope 1 GHG emissions by 13%. Increased plant e/fficiencies reduced our GHG per tonne of ammonia by 3% on last year, which is an 11% reduction against our 2015 intensity baseline. Our purchased electricity and Scope 2 GHG emissions remained stable (changing by 1.2% and -3.8% respectively). Our Scope 3 Value Chain emissions decreased by 5%.

This has reduced GHG emissions by ~400,000 tCO 2 e each year for the past nine years.\n\nDuring 2022, IPL approved the installation of tertiary N 2 O abatement, which will provide even greater reductions. A further ~200,000 tCO 2 e will be abated annually, which equates to a 5% reduction against IPL's 2020 baseline. The project is expected to be installed in 2024 and will underpin the achievement of IPL's 5% by 2025 reduction target. A similar project is being investigated for our Louisiana, Missouri AN facility which if adopted, would achieve a further 7-11% reduction against our 2020 baseline. (8)\n\n## Waggaman Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS)\n\nDuring 2022, a FEED study was approved for a Carbon Capture Facility (CCF) at the Waggaman, Louisiana ammonia manufacturing facility. If adopted, the CCF would capture the pure stream of CO 2 created during the ammonia manufacturing process. Due to its high concentration, this CO 2 stream is much more economic to process than many other industries' CO 2 streams, with only drying and compression required before transport via pipeline to a permanent geological sequestration site. Memorandums of Understanding (MOU's) have been established with several shortlisted parties to work through options for transport and deep well injection.\n\nLouisiana is an ideal site for CCS due to its geology, its existing CO 2 pipeline infrastructure, and a range of potential local partners with experience in using proven technology and management techniques to meet the very stringent regulatory requirements set by the US EPA for Class VI wells. Subject to the successful completion of the FEED study, and subject to a /final investment decision, construction of the carbon capture unit at Waggaman is expected to begin in 2024 and be completed by the end of 2025. If adopted, this would result in a 22% reduction against IPL's 2020 baseline.\n\n## Gibson Island Green Ammonia\n\nThe Gibson Island Green Ammonia project is a partnership between IPL and Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) to investigate green ammonia production at the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers Gibson Island site. The site has used natural gas to produce hydrogen (H 2 ) for the manufacture of ammonia (NH 3 ) since it was built in 1969 (obtaining\n\nthe nitrogen (N) required from the air). The current model under consideration would involve FFI constructing an on-site water electrolysis plant to produce hydrogen from the electrolysis of water (H 2 O) using renewable electricity, thereby dramatically reducing GHG emissions. FFI would develop and operate the hydrogen manufacturing facility, with IPL operating the ammonia manufacturing facility.\n\nWe are excited to report that the project progressed to FEED stage in 2022 and secured a $13.7m ARENA grant. Should the project proceed to a /final investment decision, it would be Australia's /first industrial scale green ammonia production facility, demonstrating existing infrastructure can be retro/fitted to utilise zero-emissions energy sources.\n\nIf adopted, the proposed water electrolysis facility would produce up to 50,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year and replace all of Gibson Island's current gas feedstock and 95% of its natural gas energy use. This would result in a 12% reduction against IPL's 2020 baseline.\n\n## Investigating Science Based and Scope 3 Targets\n\nDuring 2022, we engaged a specialist third party to assist us to investigate Science Based Targets (SBTs) which are targets veri/fied by the Science Based Target Initiative. Part of the work on the way to preparing SBTs includes an independent review of Scope 1, 2 and 3 calculations, as well as preparing Scope 1&2 and Scope 3 future emissions trajectories based on our business plans. An assessment of our proposed operational decarbonisation projects and Scope 3 reduction opportunities was also completed.\n\nThis work has con/firmed our global Scope 1&2 emissions calculations with only minor changes. It also aligned our Scope 3 calculation methodology more fully with the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Calculation Guidance, resulting in a more complete Scope 3 inventory and baseline from which to move forward.\n\nOur business units integrated Scope 3 emissions management into their business strategies this year, and are targeting FY23 delivery of a management framework with systems in place to track and manage Scope 3 by FY25. To assist, a supply chain partner with experience in Scope 3 has been engaged to assist IPL's businesses in obtaining supplier speci/fic emissions factors and seek to work with value chain partners to collaborate on reducing Scope 3.

A snapshot of events from our global community include:\n\n## IPL supports Queensland and New South Wales' /flood a/ffected communities get back on their feet, Australia\n\nFrom February to March 2022 north-eastern Australia was inundated with severe /flooding events. In March 2022, IPL donated $100,000 to GIVIT in support of their Storms and Flooding Appeal, which helped people who su/ffered devastating losses due to /flooding in Queensland. These funds were used to buy essential items for over 90 families including beds, fridges, washing machines, kettles, toasters and much more.\n\nIPL also donated $100,000 to Rural Aid's Flood Appeal in support of Northern New South Wales and Queensland farmers who had been ravaged by catastrophic /flooding. Rural Aid was able to support to these communities by providing counselling, /financial and fodder assistance.\n\nIn addition, IPL employees generously contributed $10,354 to GIVIT, which included fund matching by IPL. Delegates from IPL also purchased seats and attended Rural Aid's Long Lunch in April 2022.\n\n## Moranbah plant celebrates 10 th anniversary, Australia\n\nIPL's Queensland based Moranbah plant celebrated 10 years of being a part of the community. The anniversary marks a long-term, genuine investment in the Moranbah community through both housing their workforce and continuing to be a major supporter of local initiatives and events.\n\nAs part of the celebration, IPL donated two paintings by Barada Barna Traditional Owner Benjamin Isaacs to Moranbah East Primary School and Moranbah State Primary School. Moranbah State High School was also gifted with vital equipment including lathe and welders for their Blue Shed workshop to help students progress their metal working skills.\n\n## Dajarra Campdraft, Rodeo & Gymkhana in Mt Isa, Australia\n\nIPL continued as the major sponsor for the annual Dajarra Campdraft, Rodeo and Gymkhana which was held in September 2022 in North-Western Queensland. It is one of the biggest bush and social events in the Mt Isa region. This year a team of 11 employees from IPL's Phosphate Hill site also volunteered to operate the canteen for the three-day event. All funds raised from the weekend go to help local community groups in the Dajarra area.\n\n## Celebrating Children's Day at Planta Austral, Chile\n\nOur Planta Austral site in Chile honoured the anniversary of the United Nations adoption of the Universal Declaration of the Rights of the Child. In August 2022, sta/ff members were given presents to give to their children and gifts were donated to the Las Barrancas School.\n\n## Generator donation leads to United Way support, USA\n\nOn 28 August 2021, Category 4 Hurricane Ida hit Dyno Nobel's Waggaman Plant and surrounding areas. Most employees and the plant were left without power for two to three weeks in sweltering summer conditions. Thanks to donations from Dyno Nobel plants from across the US, employees in need were supplied with a generator, allowing them and their families to live more comfortably.\n\nOnce life returned to normal in the Waggaman community, Dyno Nobel decided to auction the generators to their employees, so they could be used when needed. As a result of the auction, IPL was able to donate over $12,300 to United Way, a local initiative which supports community programs in education, economic mobility, health and basic needs.\n\n## Porgera Memorial Golf Day, Australia\n\nIPL's team at Helidon continued the tradition of hosting the annual Porgera Memorial Golf Day. The day included 110 players as well as IPL volunteers who ensured the day went smoothly. The tournament included 'hole sponsorships' and prize donations which allowed IPL to raise $18,000. Funds raised were split between Autism Spectrum Australia and the Salvation Army Christmas Food Appeal. Ongoing since December 2019, sta/ff from the Helidon site also volunteer to collect food and pack and distribute hampers for the Salvation Army as part of the appeal.\n\n## Supporting Louisiana's youth, USA\n\nThroughout 2022, our Louisiana operations supported numerous initiatives towards children's health and wellbeing. Highlights include sponsoring a golf team for the Pike County Memorial Hospital Foundation's 'Tee O/ff Fore Tots' Golf Tournament, where all raised proceeds were used to support the health needs of area children. IPL was also a sponsor for the Back to School Fair for the Pike Community Care Partnership. This program assists thousands of local children and families by obtaining much needed school supplies and backpacks. In addition to helping prepare kids for back to school, the partnership provides supplies to families in need throughout the year.\n\n## Thanksgiving meals provided to Wyoming families, USA\n\nDyno Nobel's Cheyenne, Wyoming Nitrogen Plant employees buy, package, and deliver a full thanksgiving meal to 15 local families each year in November. The plant partners with CASA of Laramie County, a non-pro/fit organization that advocates for children in the community. With CASA's help, families requiring support are identi/fied and provided with a meal to celebrate the holiday.",

The record date for entitlement to this dividend is 6 December 2022. The total dividend payment will be $330.2m.\n\nOn 15 November 2022, IPL also announced that it intends to undertake an on-market share buy back of up to $400m. The proposed buy back will be conducted in the ordinary course of trading and the exact amount and timing of share purchases will be dependent on regulatory requirements and market conditions.\n\n## Strategic review of WALA and implications for structural separation of the Explosives and Fertilisers businesses\n\nOn 15 November 2022, IPL announced that it has received a number of unsolicited approaches in relation to a potential acquisition of its ammonia manufacturing facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, USA (WALA). The Company will undertake a review of the strategic options for WALA in the near-term. Under any scenario, IPL intends to maintain the strategic value of long-term supply of ammonia from WALA into the Dyno Nobel Americas business. An estimate of the /financial impact cannot be made at this point.\n\nThe strategic review process will have implications for the timing of the proposed structural separation of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses which was announced on 23 May 2022. It is currently anticipated that the previously communicated target\n\ncompletion date for the separation of early 2023 will likely be extended by 6-12 months, pending the completion of the strategic review process for WALA. There has been no impact on the /financial statements for FY22 in relation to the proposed structural separation other than the costs incurred to date which have been classi/fied as an individually material item and disclosed in the notes to the /financial statements.\n\nOther than the matters reported on above, the directors have not become aware of any other signi/ficant matter or circumstance that has arisen since the end of the /financial year, that has a/ffected or may a/ffect the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of a/ffairs of the Group in subsequent years, which has not been covered in this report.\n\n## Likely developments\n\nThe OFR contains information on the Company's 2022 /financial performance and prospects for future /financial years, and refers to likely developments in the Company's operations and the expected results of these operations in future /financial years. Information on likely developments in the Company's operations for future /financial years and the expected results of those operations together with details that could give rise to material detriment to the Company (for example, information that is commercially sensitive, con/fidential or could give a third party a commercial advantage) have not been included in this report where the directors believe it would likely result in unreasonable prejudice to the Company.\n\n## Environmental regulation and performance\n\nThe operations of the Group are subject to environmental regulation under the jurisdiction of the countries in which those operations are conducted including Australia, United States of America, Mexico, Chile, Canada, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Turkey and France. The Group is committed to complying with environmental legislation, regulations, standards and licences relevant to its operations.\n\nThe environmental laws and regulations generally address certain aspects and potential impacts of the Group's activities in relation to, among other things, air and noise quality, soil, water, biodiversity and wildlife. The Group operates under a Global Health, Safety and Environment Management System which sets out guidelines on the Group's approach to environmental management, including a requirement for sites to undertake an Environmental Site Assessment.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions, the Group holds licences for some of its operations and activities from the relevant environmental regulator. The Group measures its compliance with such licences and reports statutory non-compliances as required.\n\nMeasurement of the Group's environmental performance, including determination of areas of focus and assessment of projects to be undertaken, is based not only on the actual impact of incidents, but also upon the potential consequence, consistent with IPL's risk-based focus.\n\nDuring the year, the Group has continued to focus on licence compliance and identi/fication and mitigation of environmental risks. Remediation works have progressed at a number of sites in Australia and the United States.\n\nEnvironmental performance has maintained last year's improvement with zero Signi/ficant Environmental Incidents reported in the 2022 /financial year. This result has highlighted the importance of delivering speci/fic environmental improvement plans to achieve sustainable improvement. The implementation of our Compliance Management Framework and in particular the new Environmental Licence Compliance Procedure, with a continued focus on environmental compliance across the organisation through automation, increased controls, and improved practices has delivered improvement in our environmental performance.",

        "page_content": "During the 2022 /financial year in Australia, two incidents (one at Mount Isa and one at Phosphate Hill) led to four Penalty Infringement Notices (PIN) being issued by the Queensland Department of Environment and Science. Along with a PIN received for an incident at Gibson Island which occurred in the 2021 /financial year, the /five PINs amounted to /fines of AU$65,148. Three incidents involved losses of containment from pipe networks to ground or to surface water. Corrective actions have been implemented for these incidents including clearer inspection and maintenance regimes and de/fined responsibilities.\n\nAt Gibson Island, the obligations and associated milestones under the two Environmental Protection Orders relating to stormwater release quality and groundwater contamination issued in 2021 have consistently been met during the year. These orders enforce commitments made by site operations to improve infrastructure, systems and materials handling to signi/ficantly reduce the risk of unacceptable releases to the environment.\n\nIn the United States, ongoing compliance monitoring and implementation of physical improvements at the Carthage and Louisiana, Missouri sites and St. Helens, Oregon are progressing to plan under two separate Consent Decrees. Regular reports are submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documenting the status of this progress and to date the sites have met all Consent Decree milestones. It is expected that the remaining tasks for both Consent Decrees will be completed by the end of calendar year 2022.\n\n## Indemnities and insurance\n\nThe Company's Constitution provides that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company must indemnify any person who is, or has been, a director or secretary of the Company against any liability incurred by that person including any liability incurred as an o/fficer of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company and legal costs incurred by that person in defending an action.\n\nThe Constitution further provides that the Company may enter into an agreement with any current or former director or secretary or a person who is, or has been, an o/fficer of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company to indemnify the person against such liabilities.\n\nIn accordance with the Company's Constitution, the Company has entered into Deeds of Access, Indemnity and Insurance with each director of the Company and certain o/fficer's and members of senior management. Pursuant to those deeds, the Company has paid a premium in respect of a contract insuring directors and o/fficers of the Group against any liability for costs and expenses incurred by them in defending civil or criminal proceedings involving them as such o/fficers, with some exceptions. The contract of insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium paid.\n\n## Auditor independence and non-audit services\n\nDeloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Deloitte) was appointed as the Company's external auditor at the 2011 Annual General Meeting and continues in o/ffice in accordance with section 327B(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 . Mr Tim Richards is the Company's lead audit partner for the 2022 /financial year.\n\nThe Group may decide to engage the auditor, Deloitte, for the provision of non-audit services, where such services are not in con/flict with their role as auditor and their expertise and/or detailed experience with the Company may allow cost e/fficiencies for the work.\n\nThe Board has considered the position and, in accordance with advice received by the Audit and Risk Management Committee, is satis/fied that the provision of non-audit services during the year by Deloitte is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and does not compromise the external auditor's independence.\n\nThe Board also notes:\n\n- \u00bb the engagements for all non-audit services provided by Deloitte were reviewed by the Chief Financial O/fficer, and where relevant, approved by the Audit and Risk Management Committee, in accordance with the Committee's Charter and the Company's policy on the engagement of the external auditor for the provision of non-audit services to ensure they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and\n- \u00bb the non-audit services provided by Deloitte did not undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision making capacity for the Group, acting as an advocate for the Group or jointly sharing economic risks or rewards.\n\nDeloitte provided non-audit services to the amount of $730k during the year ended 30 September 2022 (refer to note 24 to the /financial statements).\n\nThe lead auditor has provided a written declaration that no professional engagement for the Group has been carried out during the year that would impair Deloitte's independence as auditor. A copy of the auditor's independence declaration is set out on page 83 and forms part of this report.\n\n## Proceedings on behalf of IPL\n\nNo application has been made under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 in respect of IPL, and there are no proceedings that a person has brought or intervened in on behalf of IPL under that section.\n\n## Rounding\n\nAs the Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191, the amounts shown in this report and in the /financial statements have been rounded o/ff, except where otherwise stated, to the nearest one hundred thousand dollars.\n\nThe Directors' Report, which includes the OFR and the Remuneration Report, is signed in accordance with a resolution of the directors of Incitec Pivot Limited.\n\nBrian Kruger Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJeanne Johns\n\nManaging Director & CEO\n\n15 November 2022",

Although TRIFR (1) has been /flat, FY22 has seen a material reduction in injury severity and environmental incidents. This year we have made good progress on our journey to Net Zero with a range of projects advanced to decarbonise our operations. The Board and Management remain focused on continued progress to our sustainability performance.\n\nThe 2022 /financial year was characterised by higher commodity prices, supply chain challenges, and ongoing COVID-19 uncertainties. These factors continued to make /financial target setting very challenging. For /financial year 2022, higher commodity prices helped deliver a record Headline Group NPAT result of $1,027.1 million. With strong /financial results the Company's share price increased 19.4% from $2.94 to $3.51. Pleasingly with increased pro/fitability in 2022, dividends payments were increased 190% from 9.3 cents to 27 cents per share and a share buyback of up to $400 million has been announced.\n\nHigh commodity prices o/ffset manufacturing related issues experienced at both our Waggaman, Louisiana, USA (WALA) and Phosphate Hill plants. We remain focused on consistent and reliable production.\n\nSome signi/ficant strategic steps have been progressed with the planned demerger of the fertiliser and explosives businesses, the acquisition of Titanobel in France, and assessments to convert the Gibson Island ammonia plant to run on green hydrogen.\n\nPost the end of the /financial year, the 2023 strategic objectives have been expanded to include the strategic review of the Waggaman ammonia plant. The strategic review process will have implications for the timing of the proposed demerger of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses. The deliverables for both projects have been incorporated into relevant executive strategic objectives for FY23.\n\n## Executive changes in FY22\n\nMr Paul Victor commenced as the new Chief Financial O/fficer (CFO) on 1 July 2022. Mr Victor has over 30 years' experience across a range of industries, including upstream oil and gas, gold and coal mining, chemicals and energy industries for international listed companies.\n\nFormer CFO, Nick Stratford, left the Company on 31 December 2021 (refer section 4.6).\n\nMr Stephan Titze (President - Incitec Pivot Fertilisers) has retired and left the Company on 30 September 2022 (refer section 4.6).\n\nWe thank both for their signi/ficant contributions to the Company.\n\n## Fixed remuneration in FY22\n\nA new regional manufacturing model was introduced this year. Duties for the previous Global Manufacturing & HSE (Health Safety & Environment) role were reassigned geographically to the President - Dyno Nobel Americas, the President - Dyno Nobel Asia Paci/fic, and the President - Incitec Pivot Fertilisers, resulting in increases to their /fixed remuneration (refer section 2.2). The MD&CEO did not receive an increase to /fixed remuneration in 2022.\n\n## Short-term incentive in FY22\n\nThe MD&CEO achieved an STI outcome of 64% of maximum and the average Executive KMP STI outcomes was 59.3% of maximum. The STI outcomes were as a result of record Headline Group NPAT and strong performance by Executive KMP against their personal measures. Strategic objectives that have progressed well during FY22 include the planned demerger, acquisition of Titanobel and progress on decarbonisation initiatives.\n\nHSE overall outcomes for the year showed improvement and achieved an at target result (refer section 2.3). Sustainability measures attached to each Executive KMP's STI delivered above target outcomes for all but the President - Incitec Pivot Fertilisers, who delivered a result between threshold and target. Group Adjusted NPAT (2) was impacted by manufacturing-related issues, which resulted in an overall outcome below threshold level.\n\nFor the Dyno business units, adjusted EBIT results for DNA did not reach threshold and DNAP was between threshold and target levels. The IPF business unit did not reach threshold for adjusted EBIT, largely due to Phosphate Hill production issues. Section 2.1 outlines additional information on the Company's FY22 performance and resulting STI outcomes are provided in section 2.3 of this report.\n\n## Long-term incentive\n\nThe 2019/22 LTI plan shifted its performance period for the Relative TSR condition from an end of /financial year to a November 2022 testing date. The decision to move this Relative TSR performance period was to align the end of the testing period with the release of the Company's annual results.\n\nAs a result, only non-TSR performance conditions attached to the 2019/22 LTI plan can be commented on in this year's report (refer to Section 2.5), with detailed reporting on the 2018/21 tranche included under Section 2.4. The three metrics for the 2019/22 plan are Relative TSR, Return on Invested Capital, and Long Term Value Metrics. Although /final performance for the Relative TSR component was not known at the time of this report, we expect a higher level of vesting for the 2019/22 LTI at around 60% to 80%.\n\nAs previously disclosed, for the 2018/21 LTI plan with the performance period that ended on 30 September 2021, 15% of performance rights vested.\n\n## FY23 Remuneration framework\n\nThe FY23 STI remuneration framework is expected to remain largely the same as FY22. With the strategic review of Waggaman, timing of the demerger of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses is likely to be extended by 6 to 12 months (refer to section 5 for proposed FY23 STI weightings for each Executive KMP). After a recent salary review, the MD&CEO's /fixed remuneration will be increased by 3.9% in January 2023, the /first increase since January 2019. The performance conditions for the LTI 2022/25 are expected to be largely the same as the LTI 2021/24. We are reviewing the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) metric and expect to move to a three-year average calculation.\n\nWe continue to review market trends to ensure our remuneration framework supports the execution of our strategies to increase shareholder value. This objective is balanced with retaining and motivating our key talent and ensuring alignment with our other key stakeholders.\n\nWe look forward to ongoing dialogue with, and the support of our shareholders, and welcome your feedback and comments on any aspect of this Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGreg Robinson Chairman",

Accordingly, 0% of the performance rights granted subject to the ROE Growth Condition vested (out of a maximum of 30% of performance rights granted under the plan).\n\n## 2.5 LTI 2019/22 outcomes\n\nThe performance period for the Absolute ROIC and Long Term Value Metrics conditions of the LTI 2019/22 ended on 30 September 2022. The performance period for the Relative TSR condition will end after the disclosure of the Company's full year results in November 2022 and therefore after the date of this report.\n\nIn relation to the conditions that can be reported for the LTI 2019/22 to date, 30% allocated to Absolute ROIC will vest in full, and the 30% allocated to Long Term Value Metrics will vest at 50%.\n\nCurrent projections are for the Relative TSR component (worth 40%) to partially vest as a result of surpassing 50th percentile performance against the ASX 100 index.\n\nTotal vesting of the LTI 2019/22 is therefore currently expected to be in the range of 60% - 80% of maximum opportunity.\n\nDetails on the number of rights vested and lapsed in relation to each of the performance conditions attached to this tranche, will be updated at the coming Annual General Meeting and reported in full in the 2023 Remuneration Report.",

IPL embraces a set of Strategic Value Drivers that underpin the Company's business and form the platform for the Company's future earnings growth and shareholder returns. The Company's commitment to addressing climate change challenges and looking for opportunities in the decarbonisation of the world's energy systems is at the heart of the business strategy and integrated across all the Strategic Value Drivers:\n\nZero Harm - Broadening and setting year-on-year improvement objectives across key metrics including environmental care and process safety.\n\nTalented and Engaged People - One IPL collaborative culture with engaged, diverse and inclusive teams focused on customers and value creation.\n\nCustomer Focus - Partnering with our customers to create added value and practical solutions for today and the future.\n\nManufacturing Excellence - Driving consistently high performance across all of our assets and investigating ways to address our greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nLeading Technology Solutions - Innovation on the ground with practical innovations that our customers can use today to improve their operations and environmental outcomes.\n\nPro/fitable Growth - Focus on opportunities that are distinctive to our di/fferentiated technology, core markets, core capabilities and market segments.\n\nUnder the Strategic Value Driver of 'Talented and Engaged People', IPL recognises that to generate competitive returns for its shareholders, it requires talented people who are capable, committed and motivated. IPL's remuneration strategy is designed to support the objectives of the business and to enable the Company to attract, retain and reward Executives of the requisite skill and calibre.\n\nThe key principles of the Company's remuneration strategy are to:\n\n- \u00bb reward strategic outcomes at both the Group and business unit level that create top quartile long term shareholder value;\n- \u00bb require integrity and encourage disciplined risk management in business practice;\n- \u00bb drive strong alignment with shareholder interests through delivering part of the reward in the form of equity;\n- \u00bb structure the majority of executive remuneration to be 'at risk' and linked to demanding /financial and non-/financial performance objectives;\n- \u00bb attract and retain the best available talent;\n- \u00bb reward Executives for high performance within their role and responsibilities, and ensure rewards are competitive within the industry and market for their role in respect of pay level and structure; and\n- \u00bb ensure the remuneration framework is simple, transparent and easily implemented.\n\n## 3.3 Executive remuneration governance\n\nThe remuneration of the Executives is set by the Board, having regard to recommendations from the Remuneration Committee.\n\nWhere appropriate, the Remuneration Committee of the Board engages external advisors to provide input into the process of reviewing Executive and Non-executive Director remuneration. For the 2022 /financial year, the Remuneration Committee received market and benchmarking data from various sources, but this information did not constitute a remuneration recommendation for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\n\nFurther information in relation to the Board and the Remuneration Committee can be found in IPL's Corporate Governance Statement available on IPL's website.\n\n## 4. 2022 Executive Remuneration Framework\n\n## 4.1 Overview\n\nThe charts below set out the theoretical breakdown of the Executives' total remuneration package for the 2022 /financial year. The FAR component is inclusive of cash and superannuation only, whilst 'at risk' compensation is based on maximum entitlement that could potentially be awarded under the STI and LTI plans.\n\nThe restricted shares component of the STI (50% for the MD&CEO, 25% for other Executive KMP) must be deferred until an Executive's MSR is attained.\n\nMD&CEO\n\nFixed\n\n25%\n\nSTI - cash/\n\nrestricted shares\n\n38%\n\nFAR\n\n25%\n\nLTI\n\n37%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Risk\n\n75%",

The Executives' FAR is set by reference to appropriate benchmark information for each Executive's role, level of knowledge, skill, responsibilities and experience.

This condition provides shareholder alignment as it takes into account the Company's share price movement as well as dividends paid, relative to other organisations comparable to the Company.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 100 has been chosen as the comparator group because, having regard to the business segments in which the Company operates and, speci/fically, the absence of a su/fficient number of direct comparator companies, the Board considers the S&P/ASX 100 to represent the most appropriate, and objective, comparator group. It also represents the group of companies against which the Company competes for shareholder capital. The Board has the discretion to vary the comparator group at any time, including to remove companies from, or include companies in, the comparator group.\n\nThe table below sets out the TSR Condition, and the percentage of the performance rights that will vest based on satisfaction of this condition.\n\n| Relative TSR ranking of IPL                                      | % of performance rights subject to the TSR Condition that will vest   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Less than 50th percentile                                        | Nil                                                                   |\n| At or greater than 50th percentile but less than 75th percentile | Pro rata from 50% on a straight-line basis                            |\n| At 75th percentile or greater                                    | 100%                                                                  |\n\n## Long Term Value Metrics Condition (15%)\n\nThe Long Term Value Metrics Condition relates to the delivery of signi/ficant aspects of the Board approved strategy. The Long Term Value Metrics Condition comprises components aligned with the Company's strategic drivers: Manufacturing Excellence, Pro/fitable Growth and Customer, Practical Technology & Innovation. Each of these strategic drivers has a direct impact on /financial outcomes.\n\nThe table below summarises the Long Term Value Metrics components for the LTI 2021/24:\n\nScorecard\n\n| Long Term Value  Metrics Condition   | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                          | Performance goals                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Manufacturing  Reliability           | Our integrated platforms and facilities  across high quality markets enable us  to drive advantage in management  of our supply chain and deliver  competitive value to customers. | If FY24 reliability performance exceeds the reliability  measures, the relevant condition will have been  satis/fied. |\n| Margin from  Technologies            | Our explosives technology enables  us to capture market share in a                                                                                                                 | Delivery against a Board-determined Compound  Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) schedule.                                     |\n| Explosives Global  Growth            | Our competitive position in our  existing markets allows for strategic  geographic expansion, facilitating                                                                         | Board-determined EBITDA target that requires a capital  internal rate of return (IRR) of 12%-15%.                     |\n\nDetails of the scorecards and speci/fic performance goals for each component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition were noti/fied to Executives on commencement of the LTI 2021/24 plan. Some of the performance goals involve commercial-in-con/fidence quantitative targets and, as such, some detailed performance goals are not disclosed, but performance against the goals is disclosed at the end of the performance period. For the LTI 2018/21, these details are set out in section 2.4. For the LTI 2021/24, the relevant details will be set out in the 2025 Remuneration Report.\n\nThe Board will determine the outcome for the relevant component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition under each LTI plan having regard to the results achieved against the performance goals across the entirety of the Scorecard for that component. If the Board determines that all of the performance goals in respect of a component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition have been achieved, all of the performance rights subject to that component will vest.\n\nIf not all performance goals in respect of a component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition are met over the performance period, the extent to which that component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition has been satis/fied (if at all) will be determined by the Board. In doing so, the Board will have regard to the results achieved against the performance goals across all of the components of the relevant Scorecard, without applying a speci/fic weighting to any particular performance goal.",

ROIC has been selected as it is a key determinant of e/fficient use of the capital entrusted to management by shareholders. It also re/flects factors that improve shareholder value, including operational e/fficiency, capital e/fficiency, asset utilisation and pro/fitability. ROIC is de/fined as Net Pro/fit After Tax, excluding interest and individually material items, divided by total invested capital (on a rolling 13 month average basis).\n\nThe table below sets out the Absolute ROIC Condition for the LTI 2021/24, and the percentage of performance rights that will vest based on satisfaction of this condition:\n\n| Absolute ROIC Targets               | % of performance rights subject to the Absolute ROIC Condition that will vest   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Less than 6.4%                      | Nil                                                                             |\n| At or above 6.4% but less than 6.8% | Pro rata from 50% on a straight-line basis                                      |\n| 6.8% or greater                     | 100%                                                                            |\n\n## Sustainability Condition (10%)\n\nThe Sustainability Condition was introduced for the LTI 2021/24 as an additional metric. This Condition will measure the Company's organisational performance against the Sustainability strategy, and progress towards 2030 targets, and its development of a Scope 3 emissions reduction strategy. Key successes during this 3-year period will be driven by demonstrating material progress on implementation of the Moranbah tertiary abatement project, and the WALA sequestration MoU/project. The Board has the discretion to determine the vesting outcome between 0% and 100% for this Condition as it considers appropriate.\n\n## 4.6 Executive service agreement terms\n\nRemuneration and other terms of employment for the Executives are formalised in service agreements. Most Executives are engaged on similar contractual terms, with minor variations to re/flect di/ffering circumstances. Each agreement is unlimited in term; however, each agreement provides that the Company may terminate an Executive's employment immediately for cause without any separation payment, save for accrued amounts such as leave, or otherwise without cause, with or without notice, in which case the Company must pay a separation payment plus accrued amounts such as leave.\n\nThe notice period to be provided by the Executives is set out in the table below:\n\n| Current Executives   | Notice period to be   provided by the Executive   | Notice period to be   provided by the Company   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| J Johns  (1)         | 52 weeks                                          | 52 weeks                                        |\n| P Victor             | 26 weeks                                          | 26 weeks                                        |\n| G Hayne  (2)         | 26 weeks                                          | 52 weeks                                        |\n| B Lusk               | 26 weeks                                          | 26 weeks                                        |\n| Former Executives    | Notice period   provided by the Executive         | Notice period   provided by the Company         |\n| S Titze  (3)         | 26 weeks                                          | 26 weeks                                        |\n| N Stratford  (4)     | 26 weeks                                          | 52 weeks                                        |\n\n- (3) Mr Titze ceased as a KMP on 27 July 2022.\n- (4) Mr Stratford ceased as a KMP on 14 November 2021.",

Non-executive Director Remuneration\n\nIPL's policy is to:\n\n- \u00bb remunerate Non-executive Directors by way of fees and payments which may be in the form of cash and superannuation bene/fits; and\n- \u00bb set the level of Non-executive Directors' fees and payments to be consistent with the market and to enable the IPL Group to attract and retain directors of an appropriate calibre.\n\nNon-executive Directors are not remunerated by way of options, shares, performance rights, bonuses nor by incentive-based payments.\n\nNon-executive Directors receive a fee for being a director of the Board and Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman of the Board, receive additional fees for either chairing or being a member of a Board Committee. The level of fees paid to a Non-executive Director is determined by the Board after an annual review and re/flects a Non-executive Director's time commitments and responsibilities.\n\nFor the 2022 /financial year, there were no increases to Non-executive Directors' fees. Fees paid to Non-executive Directors amounted to $1,690,000 which was within the $2,000,000 maximum aggregate fee pool approved by shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meeting. For the 2023 /financial year, the Board has determined that there will be a minor uplift to fees paid to the Remuneration Committee, resulting from the increase in workload that this Committee has experienced over recent years. The Remuneration Committee Chairperson will now be paid $40,000 (formerly $35,400) with Remuneration Committee Members receiving $20,000 (formerly $17,700).

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Basis of preparation\n\nFor the year ended 30 September 2022\n\n## Basis of preparation and consolidation\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements of the Group have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain /financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe /financial results and /financial position of the Group are expressed in Australian dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated /financial statements. Where applicable, comparative disclosures have been reclassi/fied for consistency with the current period if material.\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 15 November 2022.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. The /financial results and /financial position of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated /financial statements from the date control commences until the date control ceases.\n\nA list of the Group's subsidiaries is included in note 15.\n\nJoint arrangements and associates\n\nA joint venture is an arrangement where the parties have rights to the net assets of the venture.\n\nA joint operation is an arrangement where the parties each have rights to the assets and liabilities relating to the arrangement.\n\nAssociates are those entities in respect of which the Group has signi/ficant in/fluence, but not control, over the /financial and operating policies of the entities.\n\nInvestments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost, and subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated /financial statements include the Group's share of the pro/fit or loss and other comprehensive income of the investees.\n\nThe interests in joint operations are brought to account recognising the Group's share of jointly controlled assets; liabilities; expenses; and income from the joint operation.\n\nA list of the Group's joint arrangements and associates is included in note 15.\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements are general purpose /financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (including Australian Interpretations) and the Corporations Act 2001. The consolidated /financial statements of the Group comply with International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) and interpretations. The Company is a for-pro/fit entity.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nKey accounting estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectation of future events that may have a /financial impact on the Group and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nThe resulting accounting estimates will, by de/finition, seldom equal the subsequent related actual result. The estimates and judgments that have a signi/ficant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities within the next /financial year are set out in the notes.\n\n## Rounding of amounts\n\nThe Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument, ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 , issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission dated 24 March 2016 and, in accordance with that Legislative Instrument, the amounts shown in this report and in the /financial statements have been rounded, except where otherwise stated, to the nearest one hundred thousand dollars.\n\n## Global economic challenges\n\nVarious global challenges including in/flation, the war in Russia/ Ukraine, global supply chain disruption, tighter global /financial conditions, renewed Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdown continue to pose future uncertainties. To date, the negative impact on IPL Group results has not been signi/ficant and no structural changes that impact the longer term operations and cash /flows have been identi/fied.\n\n## Structural Separation\n\nOn 23 May 2022 the Company announced that it intends to implement a structural separation of its Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses to create two separately listed companies on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). There has been no impact on the /financial statements for FY2022 other than the costs incurred to date which have been classi/fied as an individually material item and disclosed in the notes to the /financial statements.\n\n## Accounting standards issued\n\nThe Group adopted any amendments to Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ( AASB ) that are relevant to its operations and e/ffective for the current year. The adoption of these revised Standards and Interpretations did not have a material impact on the Group's result.\n\nCertain new accounting Standards and Interpretations have been issued that are not mandatory for the 30 September 2022 reporting period and have not been early adopted by the Group. These Standards and Interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods or on foreseeable future transactions.\n\nThe London Interbank O/ffered Rate (LIBOR) and other benchmark interest rates are being replaced by alternative risk-free rates (ARR) as part of interbank o/ffer rate (IBOR) reform. USD LIBOR will no longer be published after 30 June 2023. As at 30 September 2022, the Group has not transitioned any of its existing cross currency and interest rate swaps to alternative risk-free rates, however it is expecting to commence active transition of the existing cross currency and interest rate swaps portfolio to alternative benchmark rates (e.g SOFR benchmark rate) during the /first half of FY2023. The Group is working closely with its Treasury system provider to fully manage the transition to alternative benchmark rates.\n\nThe group has assessed the implication of IBOR reform and expects the impact to be minimal.",

Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade allowances and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue is recognised for the major business activities on the following basis:\n\n- \u00bb Sale of goods and services: revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised at the point in time when the performance obligations under the customer contract are satis/fied. This is typically when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. The fee for the service component is recognised separately from the sale of goods.\n- \u00bb Take-or-pay revenue: revenue is recognised in line with the sale of goods policy. In circumstances where goods are not taken by the customer, revenue is recognised when the likelihood of the customer meeting its obligation to 'take goods' becomes remote.\n- \u00bb Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the e/ffective interest method.\n\nThe Group disaggregates its revenue per reportable segment as presented in note 1, as the revenue within each business unit is a/ffected by economic factors in a similar manner.\n\n## Goods and services tax\n\nRevenues, expenses, assets and liabilities (other than receivables and payables) are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax ( GST ). The only exception is where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the relevant taxation authorities. In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of the asset or as part of the item of expenditure.\n\n## Other income\n\nOther income represents gains that are not revenue. This includes Government grants, royalty income and management fees from the Group's joint ventures and associates, income from contractual arrangements that are not considered external sales and government grants. IPL received Government grants during the year of $48m to fund the increased production of AdBlue at the Gibson Island facility given the shortage in the domestic market. Grant income is recognised as a deduction from the related expense with any excess income reported as other income. Government grants received in advance are recognised on the balance sheet as deferred income and released to the pro/fit and loss once the related expense is incurred.",

Tax expense is recognised in the pro/fit or loss, unless it relates to items that have been recognised in equity (as part of other comprehensive income). In this instance, the related tax expense is also recognised in equity.\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year. It is calculated using tax rates applicable at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised for all taxable temporary di/fferences and is calculated based on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for /financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax bene/fits will be realised.\n\n## O/ffsetting tax balances\n\nTax assets and liabilities are o/ffset when the Group has a legal right to o/ffset and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nTax consolidation\n\nFor details on the Company's tax consolidated group refer to note 23.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\n## Uncertain tax matters\n\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and foreign jurisdictions and as a result, the calculation of the Group's tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgment in respect of certain items. In addition, there are transactions and calculations relating to the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for potential tax audit issues in deferred tax liabilities based on management's assessment of whether additional taxes may be payable and calculates the provision in accordance with the applicable accounting standards including IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments. Where the /final tax outcome of these matters is di/fferent from the amounts that were initially recorded, these di/fferences impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.",

The cost of manufactured goods is based on a weighted average costing method. For third party sourced goods, cost is net cost into store.\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial measurement they are measured at amortised cost less any provisions for expected impairment losses or actual impairment losses. Credit losses and recoveries of items previously written o/ff are recognised in the pro/fit or loss.\n\nWhere substantially all risks and rewards relating to a receivable are transferred to a third party, the receivable is derecognised.\n\nTo manage cash in/flows which are impacted by seasonality and demand and supply variability, the Group has a nonrecourse receivable purchasing agreement to sell certain receivables to an unrelated entity in exchange for cash. As at 30 September 2022, receivables totalling $94.9m (2021: $124.2m) had been sold under this arrangement. The receivables were derecognised upon sale as substantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables passed to the purchaser.\n\n## Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables are stated at cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of /financial year, which are unpaid at the reporting date.\n\nTo manage the cash /flow conversion cycle on some products\n\nprocured by the Group, and to ensure that suppliers receive payment in a time period that suits their business model, the Group o/ffers some suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain /financing. At 30 September 2022, the balance of the supply chain /finance program was $173.1m (2021: $207.9m). The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the payable continues to have the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classi/fied as borrowings. These indicators include whether the payment terms exceed customary payment terms in the industry. At 30 September 2022, the Group has assessed that on balance the payables subject to supplier /financing arrangements did not meet all of the characteristics to be classi/fied as borrowings and accordingly the balances remained in trade and other payables.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Shareholder returns\n\nFor the year ended 30 September 2022\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nThe expected impairment loss calculation for trade receivables considers the impact of past events, and exercises judgment over the impact of current and future economic conditions when considering the recoverability of outstanding trade receivable balances at the reporting date. In establishing the expected impairment loss provision, the Group also assessed the impact of the global economic challenges and its potential to a/ffect customers' repayment ability. Subsequent changes in economic and market conditions may result in the provision for impairment losses increasing or decreasing in future periods.\n\n## 5.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Capital structure\n\n## For the year ended 30 September 2022\n\n## Franking credits\n\nFranking credits available to shareholders of the Company were $7.3m (2021: $10.1m).\n\n## Key accounting policies\n\nA provision for dividends payable is recognised in the reporting period in which the dividends are paid. The provision is for the total undistributed dividend amount, regardless of the extent to which the dividend will be paid in cash.\n\n## 7. Capital management\n\nCapital is de/fined as the amount subscribed by shareholders to the Company's ordinary shares and amounts advanced by debt providers to any Group entity. The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and invest in business growth, while providing returns to shareholders and bene/fits to other stakeholders.\n\nThe Group's key strategies for maintenance of an optimal capital structure include:\n\n- \u00bb Aiming to maintain an investment grade credit pro/file and the requisite /financial metrics.\n- \u00bb Securing access to diversi/fied sources of debt funding with a spread of maturity dates and su/fficient undrawn committed facility capacity.\n- \u00bb Optimising over the long term, to the extent practicable, the Group's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), while maintaining /financial /flexibility.\n\nIn order to optimise its capital structure, the Group may undertake one or a combination of the following actions:\n\n- \u00bb change the amount of dividends paid to shareholders and/or o/ffer a dividend reinvestment plan with or without a discount and/or with or without an underwriting facility when appropriate;\n- \u00bb return capital or issue new shares to shareholders;\n- \u00bb vary discretionary capital expenditure;\n- \u00bb raise new debt funding or repay existing debt balances; and\n- \u00bb draw down additional debt or sell non-core assets to reduce debt.\n\n## Key /financial metrics\n\nThe Group uses a range of /financial metrics to monitor the e/fficiency of its capital structure, including EBITDA interest cover and Net debt/ EBITDA before individually material items. Financial metric targets are maintained inside debt covenant restrictions. At 30 September the Group's position in relation to these metrics was:\n\n|                              | Target range           |   2022 |   2021 |\n|------------------------------|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net debt/EBITDA (times)  (1) | equal or less than 1.5 |    0.5 |    1.1 |\n| Interest cover (times)       | equal or more than 6.0 |   20.3 |    9.7 |\n\n(1)  Consistent with IPL debt covenants, net debt does not include trade working capital facilities. The Group's capital management framework allows for a short term tolerance of 2.5 times for major growth opportunities.\n\nThese ratios are impacted by a number of factors, including the level of cash retained from operating cash /flows generated by the Group after paying all of its commitments (including dividends or other returns of capital), movements in foreign exchange rates, changes to market interest rates and the fair value of hedges economically hedging the Group's net debt.\n\n## Self-insurance\n\nThe Group also self-insures for certain insurance risks under the Singapore Insurance Act. Under this Act, authorised general insurer, Coltivi Insurance Pte Limited (the Group's self-insurance company), is required to maintain a minimum amount of capital. For the /financial year ended 30 September 2022, Coltivi Insurance Pte Limited maintained capital in excess of the minimum requirements prescribed under this Act.\n\n## Issued capital\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nOrdinary shares issued are classi/fied as equity and are fully paid, have no par value and carry one vote per share and the right to dividends. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any related income tax bene/fit.\n\nIssued capital as at 30 September 2022 amounted to $3,806.2m (1,942,225,029 ordinary shares).",

Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method, with any di/fference between cost and redemption value recognised in the pro/fit or loss over the period of the borrowings.\n\nThe Group derecognises interest bearing liabilities when its obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. Any gains and losses arising on derecognition are recognised in the pro/fit or loss.\n\nInterest bearing liabilities are classi/fied as current liabilities, except for those liabilities where the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the year end, which are classi/fied as non-current.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash includes cash at bank, cash on hand and short term investments, net of bank overdrafts.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs include interest on borrowings and the amortisation of premiums relating to borrowings.\n\nBorrowing costs are expensed as incurred, unless they relate to qualifying assets (refer note 9). In this instance, the borrowing costs are capitalised and depreciated over the asset's expected useful life.",

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, only when it is probable that future economic bene/fits associated with the item will /flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nBorrowing costs in relation to the funding of qualifying assets are capitalised and included in the cost of the asset. Qualifying assets are assets that take more than 12 months to get ready for their intended use or sale. Where funds are borrowed, generally a weighted average interest rate is used for the capitalisation of interest.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is subject to impairment testing. For details of impairment of assets, refer note 12.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, is depreciated on a straight-line basis. Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation rates are calculated to spread the cost of the asset (less any residual value), over its estimated useful life. Residual value is the estimated value of the asset at the end of its useful life.\n\nEstimated useful lives for each class of asset are as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Buildings and improvements\n\n20 - 50 years\n\n- \u00bb Machinery, plant and equipment\n\n3 - 50 years\n\nResidual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted where relevant when changes in circumstances impact the use of the asset.",

The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis in the pro/fit or loss over the lease term.\n\nLease liabilities are recognised by the Group at the commencement date of the lease and are measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. Lease payments include /fixed payments and variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nExtension options - The Group considers whether an option to extend a lease is reasonably certain on a lease-by-lease basis, which considers the importance of the lease to the Group's operations and its economic incentive to extend the lease. The lease term is reassessed upon the occurrence of a signi/ficant event or change in circumstance.\n\nIncremental borrowing rate - To calculate the present value of lease payments, the Group uses an incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date of the lease. The incremental borrowing rate re/flects the duration and the /financing characteristics of the lease. Where the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily available, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate applicable to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics.",

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.\n\n## Brand names\n\nBrand names acquired by the Group have inde/finite useful lives and are measured at cost less accumulated impairment. They are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that they might be impaired.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets acquired by the Group have /finite lives.\n\nThey are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.\n\n## Subsequent expenditure\n\nSubsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic bene/fits of the asset to which it relates. All other such expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n\n## Amortisation\n\nGoodwill and brand names are not amortised.\n\nFor intangible assets with /finite lives, amortisation is recognised in the pro/fit or loss on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets in this category are as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Software\n\n3 - 10 years\n\n- \u00bb Product trademarks\n\n4 - 10 years\n\n- \u00bb Patents\n\n13 - 15 years\n\n- \u00bb Customer contracts\n\n10 - 17 years\n\nUseful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted where relevant.\n\n## 12. Impairment of goodwill and non-current assets\n\n## Impairment testing of goodwill\n\nThe Group performs annual impairment testing as at 30 September for intangible assets with inde/finite useful lives. More frequent reviews are performed for indicators of impairment of all the Group's assets, including operating assets. The 30 September impairment testing resulted in no impairment of any CGU as the recoverable amounts of the CGU's, being Fertilisers APAC, DNAP, DNA and Titanobel exceeded their carrying amounts.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nDetails of the key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculations at 30 September are set out below:\n\n| Key assumptions    | 1 - 5 years   | 1 - 5 years   | Terminal value   (after 5 years)   | Terminal value   (after 5 years)   |\n|--------------------|---------------|---------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                    | 2022          | 2021          | 2022                               | 2021                               |\n|                    | US$           | US$           | US$                                | US$                                |\n| DAP  (1)           | 467 to 786    | 427 to 541    | 560                                | 520                                |\n| Gas (DNA CGU)  (2) | 4.60 to 5.50  | 3.00 to 3.50  | 4.80                               | 3.50                               |\n| Ammonia  (3)       | 528 to 1175   | 356 to 480    | 685                                | 454                                |\n| AUD:USD  (4)       | 0.71 to 0.74  | 0.74 to 0.76  | 0.73                               | 0.74                               |\n\nFor both DNAP and Fertilisers APAC, the gas price assumption for impairment testing purposes for the /first period after the current gas contracts expire, is based on external long term gas production cost forecasts of between $8.64 and $9.63 per gigajoule.\n\nFertiliser prices, foreign exchange rates and natural gas prices are estimated by reference to external market publications and market analyst estimates where available, and are updated at each reporting date.\n\n## Discount and growth rates\n\nThe post-tax discount rate used in the calculations is 9% for the Fertilisers APAC CGU (2021: 9%), 8.5% for the DNA and DNAP CGUs (2021: 8.5%) and 9% for the Titanobel CGU. The rate re/flects the underlying cost of capital adjusted for market and asset speci/fic risks.\n\nThe terminal value growth rate represents the forecast consumer price index (CPI) of 2.5% (2021: 2.5%) for all CGUs. Sensitivity analyses on the discount and growth rates, considering the current volatile market conditions, are provided below.\n\n## Carbon price impact and Investment in Sustainability\n\nThe commodity forecast assumptions used in the impairment models were obtained from external sources which include the impacts of sustainability and carbon costs.\n\nCapital forecasts in the cash /flows used in the impairment models include investment in sustainability related projects that have either commenced or are committed, including the earnings attributable to these capital projects.",

Additional impairment of $209.9m in relation to the Cheyenne and Gibson Island facilities was recognised as an Individually Material Item in the prior year.\n\n## Key accounting policies\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nThe identi/fication of impairment indicators involves management judgment. Where an indicator of impairment is identi/fied, a formal impairment assessment is performed. The Group's annual impairment testing determines whether the recoverable amount of a CGU or group of CGUs, to which goodwill and/or inde/finite life intangible assets are allocated, exceeds its carrying amount.\n\nA CGU is the smallest identi/fiable group of assets that generate cash /flows largely independent of cash /flows of other groups of assets. Goodwill and other inde/finite life intangible assets are allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs which are no larger than one of the Group's reportable segments.\n\n## Determining the recoverable amount\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is determined as the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is a term that means an asset's value based on the expected future cash /flows arising from its continued use in its current condition, discounted to present value. For discounting purposes, a post-tax rate is used that re/flects current market assessments of the risks speci/fic to the asset. The Group has prepared value-in-use models for the purpose of impairment testing as at 30 September 2022, using /five year discounted cash /flow models based on Board approved forecasts. Cash /flows beyond the /five year period are extrapolated using a terminal value growth rate.\n\nTransition of the world's energy systems and sustainability forms part of our strategy and these have been considered in the market data utilised to assess growth rates for each CGU.\n\n## Impairment losses\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset (or its CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the pro/fit or loss.\n\nImpairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated against assets in the following order:\n\n- \u00bb Firstly, against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU.\n- \u00bb Secondly, against the carrying amount of any remaining assets in the CGU.\n\nAn impairment loss recognised in a prior period for an asset (or its CGU) other than goodwill may be reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of the asset (or its CGU) since the last impairment loss was recognised. When this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset (or its CGU) is increased to its recoverable amount.",

Actual cash /flows may therefore di/ffer from forecasts and could result in changes in the recognition of impairment charges in future periods.\n\n## 13.

This estimate is based on a 'present value' calculation, which involves the application of a discount rate to the expected future cash /flows associated with settlement. The discount rate takes into account factors such as risks speci/fic to the liability and the time value of money.\n\n## Employee entitlements\n\nProvisions are made for liabilities to employees for annual leave, long\n\nservice leave and other employee entitlements. Where the payment to employees is expected to take place in 12 months time or later, a present value calculation is performed. In this instance, the corporate bond rate is used to discount the liability\n\nto its present value.\n\n## Restructuring and rationalisation\n\nProvisions for restructuring or rationalisation are only recognised when a detailed plan has been approved and the restructuring or rationalisation has either commenced or been publicly announced.\n\n## Environmental\n\nProvisions relating to the remediation of soil, groundwater, untreated waste and other environmental contamination are made when the Group has an obligation to carry out the clean-up operation as a result of a past event. In addition, a provision will only be made where it is possible to reliably estimate the costs involved.\n\n## Asset retirement\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove an asset and to restore the site on which it is located. The present value of the estimated costs of this process is recognised as part of the asset that is depreciated and also as a provision.\n\nAt each reporting date, the provision is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates and the timing and amount of future estimated cash /flows. Any changes in the provision are added to or deducted from the related asset, other than changes associated with the passage of time. This is recognised as a borrowing cost in the pro/fit or loss.\n\n## Legal and other\n\nThere are a number of legal claims and other exposures, including claims for damages arising from products and services supplied by the Group, that arise from the ordinary course of business. A provision is only made where it is probable that a payment or restitution will be required and the costs involved can be reliably estimated.\n\nFor example, in April 2022, a jury awarded damages of US$46.75m (comprising punitive damages US$30m and compensatory damages US$16.75m) to a plainti/ff in a personal injury legal case in the DNA business in relation to a nitrogen oxide release at one of its plants in 2015. In relation to this particular matter, the Company intends to vigorously pursue all available review and appeal rights.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nProvisions are based on the Group's estimate of the timing and value of out/flows of resources required to settle or satisfy commitments and liabilities known to the Group at the reporting date.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nThe following contingent liabilities are considered unlikely. However the directors consider they should be disclosed:\n\n- \u00bb Under the terms of the ASIC Legislative Instrument, ASIC Corporations (Wholly-owned Companies) Instrument 2016/785, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission dated 17 December 2016, which relieved certain wholly-owned subsidiaries from the requirement to prepare audited /financial statements, IPL and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (identi/fied in note 15) have entered into an approved deed for the cross guarantee of liabilities. No additional liabilities subject to the Deed of Cross Guarantee at 30 September 2022 are expected to arise to IPL or the relevant subsidiaries.\n- \u00bb The Group is regularly subject to investigations and audit activities by the revenue authorities of jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The outcome of these investigations and audits depends upon several factors which may result in further tax payments or refunds of tax payments already made by the Group over and above existing provisions. Refer to note 3 for further details.\n- \u00bb Contingent liabilities arise in the normal course of business and include a number of legal claims, environmental cleanup requirements and bank guarantees.\n\nThe Directors are of the opinion that no additional provisions are required in respect of these matters, as it is either not probable that a future sacri/fice of economic bene/fits will be required or the amount is not capable of reliable measurement.",

Financial risk management\n\nThe Group is exposed to /financial risks including liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk. This note explains the Group's /financial risk exposures and its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks.\n\nThe Board of Directors (the Board ) has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The Board established the Audit and Risk Management Committee ( ARMC ) which is responsible for, amongst other things, the monitoring of the Group's risk management plans. The ARMC is assisted in its oversight role by the Group's Risk Management function. The Risk Management function performs reviews of the Group's risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the ARMC. The ARMC reports regularly to the Board on its activities.\n\nThe Group's /financial risk management framework includes policies to identify, analyse and manage the Group's /financial risks. These policies set appropriate /financial risk limits and controls, identify permitted derivative instruments and provide guidance on how to monitor and report /financial risks and adherence to set limits. Financial risk management policies, procedures and systems are reviewed regularly to ensure they remain appropriate given changes in market conditions and/or the Group's activities.\n\n## Financial risks\n\n## Liquidity risk: The risk that the Group is not able to re/finance its debt obligations or meet other cash out/flow obligations when required.\n\n## Source of risk\n\nExposure to liquidity risk derives from the Group's operations and from the external interest bearing liabilities that it holds.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nLiquidity risk is managed by ensuring there are su/fficient committed funding facilities available to meet the Group's /financial commitments in a timely manner.\n\nThe Group's forecast liquidity requirements are continually reassessed based on regular forecasting of earnings and capital requirements.\n\n## Outstanding /financial instruments\n\nThe Group's exposures to liquidity risk are set out in the tables below:\n\n| 30 September 2022                           | Contractual  cash /flows  (1) $mill   | 0 -

Gains or losses recognised in equity will be reclassi/fied to the pro/fit or loss as the underlying forecast transaction occurs:\n\n| Natural gas price  sensitivity   | +US 10c  per 1  MMBTU  AUD mill  2022   | -US 10c  per 1  MMBTU  AUD mill  2022   |   +US 10c  per 1  MMBTU  AUD mill  2021 | -US 10c   per 1  MMBTU  AUD mill  2021   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Henry Hub USD                    | -                                       | -                                       |                                     0.1 | (0.1)                                    |\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nWhere possible, commodity price risk exposure is managed by entering into long term contracts with customers (i.e Ammonium Nitrate and Ammonia) or derivative contracts for input cost (i.e US natural gas). However, in some instances price risk exposure cannot be economically mitigated by either contractual arrangements or derivative contracts by virtue of the products that the Group sells.\n\nSensitivity to natural gas price movements during the year\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity of the Group's pro/fit before tax to a change of US 10c per MMBTU in the US Henry Hub natural gas price. The sensitivity is based on the average natural gas price, the average AUD:USD exchange rate (excluding the impact of hedging) and the current annual natural gas consumption of the Group's manufacturing operations in the Americas that are exposed to changes in natural gas prices:\n\n| Natural gas price  sensitivity   | +US  10c    per 1  MMBTU  AUD mill  2022   |   -US 10c  per 1  MMBTU  AUD mill  2022 | +US 10c  per 1  MMBTU  AUD mill  2021   |   -US 10c   per 1  MMBTU  AUD mill  2021 |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Henry Hub USD                    | (2.7)                                      |                                     2.7 | (1.7)                                   |                                      1.7 |\n\nSensitivity to fertiliser price and ammonia movements during the year\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity of the Group's pro/fit before tax to a US$10 per tonne change in Ammonium Phosphates, Urea and Ammonia prices. The sensitivity is based on actual tonnes manufactured and sold by the Group that is sensitive to commodity price changes and the average AUD:USD exchange rate (excluding the impact of hedging) for the year:\n\n| Price sensitivity               | + US$10  per tonne  AUD mill   | - US$10   per tonne  AUD mill   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 2022                            |                                |                                 |\n| Granular Urea (FOB Middle East) | 3.4                            | (3.4)                           |\n| DAP/MAP (FOB China/Saudi)       | 10.5                           | (10.5)                          |\n| Urea (FOB NOLA)                 | 2.4                            | (2.4)                           |\n| Ammonia (FOB Tampa)             | 7.9                            | (7.9)                           |\n| 2021                            |                                |                                 |\n| Granular Urea (FOB Middle East) | 4.9                            | (4.9)                           |\n| DAP/MAP (FOB China/Saudi)       | 12.6                           | (12.6)                          |\n| Urea (FOB NOLA)                 | 1.6                            | (1.6)                           |\n| Ammonia (FOB Tampa)             | 4.2                            | (4.2)                           |",

Credit limits are established and monitored for each customer, and these limits represent the highest level of exposure that a customer can reach. Trade credit insurance is purchased when required.\n\nThe Group mitigates credit risk from /financial instrument contracts by only entering into transactions with counterparties that have sound credit ratings and, where applicable, with whom the Group has a signed netting agreement. Given their high credit ratings, the Group does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.\n\n## Fair value\n\nFair value of the Group's /financial assets and liabilities is calculated using a variety of techniques depending on the type of /financial instrument as follows:\n\n- \u00bb The fair value of /financial assets and /financial liabilities traded in active markets (such as equity securities and /fixed interest rate bonds) is the quoted market price at the reporting date.\n- \u00bb The fair value of /financial assets and /financial liabilities not traded in active markets is calculated using discounted cash /flows. Future cash /flows are calculated based on observable forward interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n- \u00bb The fair value of forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward contracts is calculated using discounted cash /flows, re/flecting the credit risk of various counterparties. Future cash /flows are calculated based on the contract rate, observable forward interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n- \u00bb The fair value of option contracts is calculated using the contract rates and observable market rates at the end of the reporting period, re/flecting the credit risk of various counterparties. The valuation technique is consistent with the Black-Scholes methodology and utilises Monte Carlo simulations.\n- \u00bb The fair value of commodity swaps and commodity forward contracts is calculated using their quoted market price, where available. If a quoted market price is not available, then fair value is calculated using discounted cash /flows. Future cash /flows are estimated based on the di/fference between the contractual price and the current observable market price, re/flecting the credit risk of various counterparties. These future cash /flows are then discounted to present value.\n- \u00bb The nominal value less expected credit losses of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short term maturity.\n\n## Credit risk exposure\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 September is the carrying amount, net of any provision for impairment, of the /financial assets as detailed in the table below:\n\n|                             | 2022   $mill   | 2021   $mill   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Trade and other receivables | 785.3          | 517.0          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents   | 763.5          | 651.8          |\n| Derivative assets           | 37.3           | 86.0           |\n|                             | 1,586.1        | 1,254.8        |\n\nFinancial assets and /financial liabilities that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and are intended to be settled on a net basis are o/ffset in the Statement of Financial Position. At 30 September 2022, the amount netted in other /financial assets and other /financial liabilities is $79.8m (2021: nil).\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses /financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method. The di/fferent levels have been de/fined as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u00bb Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- \u00bb Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\n| 2022                              | Level 1  $mill   | Level 2   $mill   | Level 3  $mill   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Derivative /financial assets      | -                | 37.3              | -                |\n| Derivative /financial liabilities | -                | (152.6)           | -                |\n| Investment in Equity Instrument   | -                | -                 | -                |\n\n| 2021                              | Level 1  $mill   | Level 2   $mill   | Level 3  $mill   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Derivative /financial assets      | -                | 86.0              | -                |\n| Derivative /financial liabilities | -                | (93.5)            | -                |\n| Investment in Equity Instrument   | -                | -                 | 3.0              |\n\nFair value of /financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost\n\nCash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost which equals their fair value.\n\nInterest bearing liabilities are carried at amortised cost and have a carrying value of $1,712.0m (2021: $1,668.8m) - refer to note 8. The fair value of the interest bearing /financial liabilities at 30 September 2022 was $1,655.0m (2021: $1,763.5m) and was based on the level 2 valuation methodology.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Risk management\n\nFor the year ended 30 September 2022\n\n## Key accounting policies\n\nForeign currency transactions and balances\n\nThe Group presents its accounts in Australian dollars. Foreign currency transactions are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the date the transaction occurs.\n\nMonetary assets (such as trade receivables) and liabilities (such as trade creditors) denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rate at 30 September. Non-monetary items (for example, plant and machinery) that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not re-translated.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses relating to transactions are recognised in the pro/fit or loss with the exception of gains and losses arising from cash /flow hedges and net investment hedges that are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations are translated at applicable exchange rates at 30 September. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses arising on translation are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve ( FCTR ). If and when the Group disposes of the foreign operation, these gains and losses are transferred from the FCTR to the pro/fit or loss.\n\n## Derivatives and hedging\n\nThe Group uses contracts known as derivative /financial instruments to hedge its /financial risk exposures.\n\nOn entering into a hedging relationship, the Group formally designates and documents details of the hedge, risk management objective and strategy for entering into the arrangement. The Group applies hedge accounting to hedging relationships that are expected to be highly e/ffective in o/ffsetting changes in fair value, i.e. where the cash /flows arising from the hedge instrument closely match the cash /flows arising from the hedged item.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when:\n\n- \u00bb The hedging relationship no longer meets the risk management objective.\n- \u00bb The hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\n- \u00bb The hedge no longer quali/fies for hedge accounting.\n\nDerivatives are measured at fair value. The accounting treatment applied to speci/fic types of hedges is set out below.\n\n## Cash /flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of e/ffective cash /flow hedges are recognised in equity, in the cash /flow hedge reserve. To the extent that the hedge is ine/ffective, changes in fair value are recognised in the pro/fit or loss.\n\nFair value gains or losses accumulated in the reserve are taken to pro/fit or loss when the hedged item a/ffects pro/fit or loss. When the hedged item is a non-/financial asset, the amount recognised in the reserve is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is purchased.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are accounted for in a similar way as cash /flow hedges. Gains or losses on the e/ffective portion of the hedge are recognised directly in equity (in the FCTR) while any gains or losses relating to the ine/ffective portion are recognised in the pro/fit or loss.\n\nOn disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of gains or losses recognised in the FCTR are transferred to pro/fit or loss.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item are recognised in the pro/fit or loss.\n\n## Hedge ine/ffectiveness\n\nThe Group aims to transact only highly e/ffective hedge relationships, and in most cases the hedging instruments have a 1:1 hedge ratio with the hedged items. However, at times, some hedge ine/ffectiveness can arise and is recognised in pro/fit or loss in the period in which it occurs. Key sources of hedge ine/ffectiveness for the Group are as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Maturity dates of hedging instruments not matching the maturity dates of the hedged items.\n- \u00bb Credit risk inherent within the hedging instrument not matching the movement in the hedged item.\n- \u00bb Interest rates of the Group's /financing facilities not matching the interest rates of the hedging instrument.\n- \u00bb Forecast transactions not occurring.\n\n## Classi/fication of /financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments are classi/fied into the following categories:\n\n- \u00bb Amortised cost (cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing liabilities and trade and other receivables and payables).\n- \u00bb Fair value through other comprehensive income (listed equity securities).\n- \u00bb Fair value through pro/fit or loss (derivative /financial instruments except those that are in a designated hedge relationship).",

Share-based payments\n\n## Incentive Plans\n\nThe Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIs) are designed to link reward with the key performance drivers that underpin sustainable growth in shareholder value. With regard to the 2019/22, 2020/23 and 2021/24 LTIs, the performance conditions comprise relative total shareholder return, the delivery of certain long term value metrics, absolute return on invested capital and sustainability conditions for the LTI 2021/24 plan.\n\nCertain Executives have been awarded performance rights under Short Term Incentive Plans (STIs) based on /financial, safety and strategic outcomes.\n\nThese arrangements support the Company's strategy for retention and motivation of its executives.\n\n## Expenses arising from share-based payment transactions\n\nTotal expenses arising from share-based payment transactions recognised during the period as part of employee bene/fit expense were as follows:\n\n2021\n\n|                                                                                        | 2022   $mill   | 2021   $mill   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Accounting value of performance rights issued  under the LTI and STI performance plans | 3.1            | 3.2            |\n|                                                                                        | 2022   Number  | 2021   Number  |\n| Number of performance rights outstanding  under the LTI and STI performance plans      | 5,887,136      | 6,285,054      |\n\nDetails of the movements in LTI and STI performance rights are disclosed in the Remuneration Report.\n\n## Key accounting policies\n\nThe rights to shares granted to employees under the terms of the plans are measured at fair value. The fair value is recognised as an employee expense over the period that employees become unconditionally entitled to the rights. There is a corresponding increase in equity, which is re/flected in the share based payments reserve.\n\nThe amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to re/flect the actual number of rights taken up, once related service and other non-market conditions are met.\n\n## 20.

The following table summarises how the de/fined bene/fit obligation as at 30 September 2022 would have increased/(decreased) as a result of a change in the respective assumption by 1 percentage point:\n\n|                         | 1 percent  increase   |   1 percent  decrease |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Discount rate           | (21.9)                |                  26   |\n| Rate of salary increase | 1.4                   |                   1.3 |\n\n## Key accounting policies\n\nAll employees of the group are entitled to bene/fits from the Group's superannuation plan on retirement, disability or death or can direct the group to make contributions to a de/fined contribution plan of their choice. The Group's superannuation plan has a de/fined bene/fit section and a de/fined contribution section. The de/fined bene/fit section provides de/fined lump sum bene/fits based on years of service and /final average salary. The de/fined contribution section receives /fixed contributions from group companies and the Group's legal or constructive obligation is limited to these contributions.\n\nThe liability or asset recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of de/fined bene/fit superannuation plans is the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.\n\nRemeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n\nChanges in the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments are recognised immediately in pro/fit or loss as past service costs.\n\nContributions to the de/fined contribution section of the Group's superannuation fund and other independent de/fined contribution superannuation funds are recognised as an expense as they become payable.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nThe present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation at the reporting date is based on expected future payments arising from membership of the fund. This is calculated annually by independent actuaries considering the expected future wage and salary levels of employees, experience of employee departures and employee periods of service.\n\nExpected future payments are discounted using market yields on corporate bonds at the reporting date, which have terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash out/flows.",

Events subsequent to reporting date\n\n## Capital Management\n\nOn 15 November 2022, IPL announced a /final dividend of 17 cents per share, 100% franked, to be paid on 21 December 2022. The record date for entitlement to this dividend is 6 December 2022. The total dividend payment will be $330.2m.\n\nOn 15 November 2022, IPL also announced that it intends to undertake an on-market share buy back of up to $400m. The proposed share buy back will be conducted in the ordinary course of trading and the exact amount and timing of share purchases will be dependent on regulatory requirements and market conditions.\n\n## Strategic review of WALA and implications for structural separation of the Explosives and Fertilisers businesses\n\nOn 15 November 2022, IPL announced that it has received a number of unsolicited approaches in relation to a potential acquisition of its ammonia manufacturing facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, USA (WALA). The Company will undertake a review of the strategic options for WALA in the near-term. Under any scenario, IPL intends to maintain the strategic value of long-term supply of ammonia from WALA into the Dyno Nobel Americas business. An estimate of the /financial impact cannot be made at this point.\n\nThe strategic review process will have implications for the timing of the proposed structural separation of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses which was announced on 23 May 2022. It is currently anticipated that the previously communicated target completion date for the separation of early 2023 will likely be extended by 6-12 months, pending the completion of the strategic review process for WALA. There has been no impact on the /financial statements for FY2022 in relation to the proposed structural separation other than the costs incurred to date which have been classi/fied as an individually material item and disclosed in the notes to the /financial statements.\n\nOther than the matters reported on above, the directors have not become aware of any other signi/ficant matter or circumstance that has arisen since the end of the /financial year, that has a/ffected or may a/ffect the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of a/ffairs of the Group in subsequent years, which has not been covered in this report.",

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  our  auditor's  report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group's audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.",
