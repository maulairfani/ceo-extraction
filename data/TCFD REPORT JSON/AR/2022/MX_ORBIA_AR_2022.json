The business group operates the world's largest fluorspar mine and produces intermediates, refrigerants and propellants used in automotive, infrastructure, semiconductor, health, medicine, climate control, food cold chain, energy storage, computing and telecommunications applications.\n\nFor more information on market shares see Section 2, \"The Issuer\", item b, \"Business Description\" for each          business group, of this Annual Report.\n\nRevenues reached a historic high of $9.6 billion in 2022, up 10% from 2021. Revenues increased across all businesses, except  for  Precision  Agriculture.  Primary  drivers  of  the  year-over-year  increase  included  strong  PVC  pricing  in  the Polymer Solutions businesses, particularly during the first half of the year, strong demand in Connectivity Solutions and improved pricing across the Fluorinated Solutions product portfolio.\n\nGeographically, sales growth in North America was 24%, Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA) was 20%, Europe was 1% and South America was flat.\n\nDespite strong sales growth, EBITDA decreased 7% in 2022 to $1.9 billion due to softening demand across certain markets in the second half of the year, coupled with higher input costs. EBITDA margin decreased approximately 350 basis points to 19.8%.\n\nIn 2021, Orbia's net revenues increased 37% to $8.8 billion and EBITDA increased 55% to $2.0 billion as compared to 2020.

EBITDA margin increased 100 basis points to 20.5% in 2020.\n\nThe following graph shows the breakdown of total sales by business group after inter-company eliminations within Orbia.\n\nRevenue by Business Group, 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

The total investment of the joint venture is estimated to be approximately $850 million, and is expected to be funded in part by a grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy of $178 million to Solvay to build a facility in Augusta, Georgia. Solvay and Orbia intend to use two production sites, one for raw materials and the other for finished product, located in the southeastern United States. Both plants are expected to be fully operational by 2026.  Orbia is uniquely positioned to support the PVDF supply chain with its three key raw materials: HF, VCM and chlorine. Commencement of the joint venture is subject to finalizing and entering into definitive agreements between the parties and satisfaction of customary conditions, including obtaining regulatory approvals.\n- \uf0b7 In December 2022, the Company completed an offering of short and long-term notes (Certificados Burs\u00e1tiles), for a total amount of 10 billion Mexican Pesos (MXP) with a 'sustainability-linked bond' feature. The offerings were made under the revolving short and long-term shelf registration program implemented by Orbia and authorized by the National Banking and Securities Commission ( Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores or CNBV )  of  Mexico  in  November  2022.

The $1.0 billion syndicated revolving line of credit bore monthly interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.05%. Under the terms of the amended agreement, the loan principal was payable in a single  installment  upon maturity  on  June  21,  2024. On  March  27,  2020, the  Company  drew  down  the full amount of the available line of credit and repaid it in full during 2020 as follows: $400 million on September 30, $350 million on October 30, $175 million on November 30, and $75 million on December 31.

        "page_content": "## c) Risk Factors\n\nWhen deciding whether to invest in securities issued by Orbia, investors must carefully consider, analyze, and evaluate all the information contained in this Annual Report, and in particular, the risk factors described below, which could have a material adverse effect on Orbia's performance and profitability, its financial situation, or the results of its operations and its liquidity.\n\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not an exhaustive list. Additional risks and uncertainties of which the Company's management have no knowledge could also affect business operations. Any of the following risks, should they  arise,  could  adversely  and  materially  affect  the  business,  it  results  of  its  operations,  prospects  and  financial condition.  In  such  a  case,  the  market  price  of  the  Company's  CEBURES  (Stock  Exchange  Certificates,  if  any  are outstanding), Senior Notes and the shares of ORBIA* may decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\n\n## (a) Risk Factors related to Orbia's business\n\n## The cyclical nature of the global chemical industry can decrease business results and margins\n\nSome industries in which the Company operates, including the markets in which the Company competes, are cyclical. Such industries are sensitive to changes in supply and demand and are affected by the political and economic conditions prevailing in the different countries and regions of the world in which Orbia has a presence. This cyclical trend can reduce the Company's net sales and margins, especially:\n\n- \uf0b7 Unfavorable economic changes in business and the general economy may cause demand for the Company's products  to  fall;  particularly  those  in  the  residential,  commercial  or  industrial  construction  industry  being strongly tied to the stability or instability that prevails in each country;\n- \uf0b7 Considering the competitive environment in which Orbia operates, lower demand can put pressure on the prices of its products;\n- \uf0b7 The market dynamics of supply and demand for both its products and its raw materials, and the other raw materials that  affect them, may result in fluctuations in  the prices  of  some  or  all  of its  products  or its raw materials, which could affect its sales or margins.\n\nDue to the cyclical nature of the global chemical industry, historically the international chemical market has  experienced changing periods of limited supply, which has caused prices to increase and profit margins to increase, followed by an expansion of production capacity, resulting in oversupply with lower prices and profit margins. Orbia sets prices for the products the Company sells based on international market prices. The chemical industries in Europe and Latin America have become increasingly integrated with the global chemical industry for a variety of reasons, including increased demand and consumption of chemicals in these regions, as well as the continued integration of regional and global product markets. The Issuer's net sales and gross margins are tied to global industry conditions that it cannot control. The Company is particularly sensitive to the economic cycles that affect the construction, infrastructure, agricultural and automotive industries.\n\nThroughout  history,  demand  has  been  vulnerable  to  such  circumstances.  This  vulnerability  can  lead  to  significant changes  in the  Issuer's  quarterly  operating  results  or  its  annual  results,  limiting  its  ability  to  forecast  its  operating performance, cash flows and financial position.\n\n## The Company's operations are dependent on industries that can be cyclical.\n\nSome of Orbia's suppliers and customers participate in, or are influenced by, industries that can exhibit significant cyclicality. This includes industries such as energy that have historically undergone periods of slowdown and sometimes recession. The demand for some of its products and services, as well as the supply of some of its raw materials depend on the level of investment by companies in such industries, which in turn depends in part on the overall price levels of oil, natural gas and other energy sources. Oil prices have been highly volatile in recent years. A continued decline in investments in this industry, whether due to a decrease in prices, higher costs or overall less attractive economics, could cause delays in its customers' projects, and thus demand for some of its products and services or a lack of supply of some of the raw materials can cause pressure on the expected prices of its products or costs of its raw materials, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Orbia's operating results, cash flows and financial position. Some of Orbia's customers or suppliers also depend on oil and natural gas production levels. Interruptions or decreases in the production of such supplies, due to various circumstances beyond the Company's control, including adverse weather conditions, accidents, decreased access to the financial system, labor contingencies, work stoppages, strikes, or others, may cause delays in customers' investment projects or increases in the production costs of it's the Company's raw materials which may impact the Company's results from operations, cash flows and financial position.",

Future demand for these products could be lower than projected expectations, adversely impacting the Company's operating results and financial position.\n\nThe  Company's  inability  to  meet  market  needs  due  to  lack  of  development  of  new  products,  production technologies, access to new technologies, or development of substitutes could adversely affect its competitive position.\n\nThe markets for many of the products produced by the Company require continuous improvements in quality and performance. To remain competitive, the Company must develop and market products that meet market needs in a timely manner. Additionally, rapid changes in the marketplace may shorten the life cycle of the Company's existing products, thus impairing the Company's ability to recover its investments in those products. If the Company is unable to keep pace with technological improvements and market demand, its operating results and financial position could be adversely and significantly affected.\n\nIn addition, development of new technologies could result in the creation of new products or raw materials that will replace those we currently produce or use. If the Company is unable to compete with such new products or access new needed raw materials, its results of operations could be adversely and materially affected.\n\n## The Company's business is subject to risks generally associated with international commercial operations and its net earnings and sales could be adversely affected by the economic conditions and outlook in the countries in which it operates\n\nOrbia  markets  its  products  in  more  than  110  countries.  The  Company  participates  in  manufacturing  and  other commercial activities on six continents. As a result, the Company is, and will continue to be, subject to the risks generally associated with international manufacturing and distribution, the adverse economic conditions and other political, social and regulatory conditions in the countries where it conducts business that may impact the demand for its products and, ultimately, its net earnings and sales, including:\n\n- \uf0b7 Government regulations on manufacturing and/or foreign investment activities;\n- \uf0b7 Modifications to policies on customs or trade tariffs on import or export from and to countries;\n- \uf0b7 Changes in social, political and economic conditions;\n- \uf0b7 Freight delays;\n- \uf0b7 Blackouts or shortages of electricity and other public services;\n- \uf0b7 Restrictions on currency conversion and volatility in foreign exchange markets;\n- \uf0b7 Restrictions on skilled labor and changes in local working conditions;\n- \uf0b7 Restrictions related  to  the  sale  of  products, including trademarks,  in  connection  with third party intellectual property rights;\n- \uf0b7 Difficulties in complying with contractual obligations in jurisdictions outside of Mexico, as well as in collecting accounts abroad;\n- \uf0b7 Environmental regulations;\n- \uf0b7 Tax reforms and other laws and regulations;\n- \uf0b7 Recessionary conditions or negative or slow economic growth rates;\n- \uf0b7 Changes in local or international interest rates that affect the exchange rate; and\n- \uf0b7 Austerity  measures  and reduction or  elimination  of  subsidies  and  incentives  to  the  industries  in  which  we operate.\n\nSome  of  the  countries  in  which  Orbia  operates  have  experienced  political  and  social  instability  in  the  past  and interruptions  of  operations may  occur  at  any  of  the  production facilities  or  distribution networks  in  those  countries. Additionally, other potential economic risks include: inflation and monetary policies to support it, high energy and raw material  prices,  supply  disruptions,  global  economic  deceleration  and  potential  recession  in  counties  we  operate, economic deceleration ahead of expectations in some markets, volatility in financial markets, the impact of financial and economic sanctions against Russia, the political uncertainty and geopolitical risks around the world.\n\nThe foregoing factors, as well as government regulations applicable to foreign investment and/or the import, export or sale of products and market protectionist measures could adversely affect sales and operations results, and in the past have  caused  distributors,  intermediaries  and  customers  to  reduce  their  spending  and  to  delay  or  stop  purchasing products, which could have an adverse effect on net sales, operating results, and cash flows.\n\n## Orbia faces intense competition from other suppliers of similar products\n\nThe markets for Orbia  products  are  highly  competitive.  The  Company  generally  has  no  or  limited  control  over  the prevailing pricing on international markets of the chemical products it sells, such as chlorine, caustic soda, resin and fluorite compounds, and fluorite. The competitiveness of these products is based on price, performance, product quality,",

        "page_content": "product delivery,  and  customer service. It is  difficult to  protect  the  Company's market position for many  of its  basic products by differentiating them by being of standardized quality, and the Company may not be able to pass on the cost and price increases associated with those products to customers. In many cases, the competitive environments for its various chemicals may vary significantly at any time, and its ability to adjust the product mix based on market conditions may be limited due to inherent restrictions on production processes.\n\nOrbia's competitors include larger companies or those well positioned within international chemical markets, including those in Europe and Latin America, or companies that have greater competitive advantages due to a combination of several factors, such as greater access to financial resources, benefits derived from integration and economies of scale, availability  of  raw  materials  at  lower  costs,  diversification  and  risk  management.  Its  main  competitors  have  made significant  capital  investments,  which  have  enabled  them  to  obtain  and  maintain  a  significant  market  share.  Such situations, as well as increased competition, may have adverse effects on the Company's operating results, cash flow or financial condition.\n\n## Fluctuations in the prices of the principal raw materials, including natural gas, electric power, sulfur, ethane, ethylene, resins, among others, may adversely affect the Company's business and operating results.\n\nIn recent years, the prices of electricity, natural gas, sulfur, ethane, ethylene, resins, among other raw materials and supplies,  have  experienced  significant  fluctuations  in  local  and  international  markets.  These  fluctuations  cause variations  in  production  and  sales  costs,  which  in  turn  are  reflected  in  the  margins  of  the  products  the  Company manufactures and markets. In addition, prices of petroleum and petroleum products have been volatile, affecting the selling price of products such as ethylene, VCM and PVC, as well as their production and sales costs.\n\nAlthough Orbia generally transfers any price increase in raw materials to its customers, it is not always possible to do so. Future fluctuations in the prices of electric power, natural gas, ethane, ethylene and sulfur, resins, among others, which it uses in manufacturing processes and which have recently experienced volatility, could result in variations in the cost of the supplies the Company uses to produce its products. Similarly, variations in the price of oil could, as they have done in the past, impact the prices of some of its products, which in turn could negatively affect the Company's operating results and financial position.\n\n## Any interruption in the supply of raw materials could affect Orbia's operations\n\nOrbia's ability to achieve its strategic objectives continues to depend, in a large part, on the successful, timely and costeffective acquisition of electric power and raw materials such as natural gas, ethane, ethylene, electricity, VCM, PVC, Polyethylene and other plastic resins. Currently, the Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for the production and delivery of these supplies. Management cannot ensure the stability of the gas supply, nor the availability of supplies at reasonable prices or that suppliers will continue to supply them.\n\nTherefore, in  the  event  of  any  interruption,  discontinuance  or  other  disruption  in  the  markets  or  the  supply  of  raw materials or electric power, including a substantial increase in the costs thereof, could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. Similarly, a decrease in the supply of certain raw materials, or in the number of raw material suppliers, may result in an increase in the prices paid for the supply of these raw materials, in which case Orbia's operating results and financial position could also be adversely affected.\n\n## Production  capacity  improvements, maintenance  and  investment  in  acquired  companies,  generally require significant  expenditures  and  the  Company  cannot  guarantee  it  will  achieve  the  expected  return  on  these actions.\n\nOrbia  has  recently  made  significant  capital  investments  related  to  the  maintenance  of  its  production  capacities, environmental protection and safety, worker and facility safety, efficiency and modernization of its plants. In addition, the Company has made several acquisitions in recent years to support the growth of its businesses.\n\nOrbia may not be able to obtain the expected return on its investments if unfavorable conditions arise in its product markets.  Decisions  regarding  the  timing  or  manner  in  which  such  investments  are  executed  are  based  on  future projections of market demand and other factors that may be inaccurate, and it may not obtain sufficient resources to make certain necessary investments, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's operating results, including expenses due to impairment of assets. Furthermore, the Company may not be able to meet its financing obligations if it does not obtain the expected return on its investments.\n\nCurrent projects may not be completed on time or at all due to factors such as the inability to obtain financing, regulatory changes, lack of compliance or availability of contractors and subcontractors and logistical problems, which could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the Company including the impairment of assets.",

These events could materially affect the Company's financial position and operating results.\n\n## Inability to effectively manage growth could adversely affect the Company's business, operating results and financial position.\n\nAs a result of the acquisition of new companies and organic growth, the Issuer's EBITDA has achieved a significant growth  rate.  In  addition,  the  operating  income  and  cash  flows  have  increased  substantially,  which  provides  the Company's management with flexibility to continue to grow. This growth has resulted, and will continue to result, in significant  demands  on  the  Company's  administrative,  operational  and  financial  infrastructure.  Orbia's  successful achievement of its long-term growth objectives will depend on it's management's ability to effectively manage these factors while continuing to focus on commercial and product development initiatives.\n\n## Orbia is subject to certain restrictive covenants limiting what may or may not be performed by virtue of its credit agreements, which could limit its future business activities\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Issuer had cost bearing debt totaling 4,696 million, with a series of lines of credit and issuances of securities in the local and international markets. Pursuant to the agreements governing long-term credit facilities, the Company is obligated to comply with certain covenants that limit its operations and financial decisions. Compliance  with  its  obligations  under  the  credit  agreements  could  limit  the  ability  to  undertake  future  acquisitions including future financing or refinancing of debt, which could have a negative impact on the Company's operations, operating results and financial position. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, annex to this Annual Report.\n\n## Orbia has recently made and may make important acquisitions that, if not properly integrated, could adversely affect its operating results\n\nOrbia has recently made significant acquisitions, and may consider making additional important acquisitions, to continue its growth. For more information regarding these acquisitions, see section \"Investments made in the last three fiscal years', in Chapter 2, section v), 'General Business Strategy'.\n\nAcquisitions themselves involve risks, including the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 Acquired businesses may not achieve the expected results;\n- \uf0b7 Changes  in  the  economic  context  with  a  growth  expectation  within  the  markets  where  the  acquired companies are present;\n- \uf0b7 Failure to achieve expected synergies ;\n- \uf0b7 Increases in costs, supplies and energy;\n- \uf0b7 Difficulties encountered in the integration of operations, technologies and control systems;\n- \uf0b7 Possible inability to hire or retain key personnel for acquired operations;\n- \uf0b7 Possible inability to achieve the expected economies of scale;\n- \uf0b7 Unforeseen liabilities;\n- \uf0b7 Exercising minority rights in transactions that are not 100% acquired; and\n- \uf0b7 Unforeseen economic competition and regulatory considerations.\n\nThe  Company may face  in the future,  difficulties  in  the  integration  of  operations,  accounting  systems  and  internet technology systems of some of its acquired companies. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate or manage the acquired operations, it may not achieve the expected cost savings, increased revenues and levels of integration necessary to offset the significant expenses associated with the integration of the acquired companies. This could result in lower profitability or impairment charges.\n\n## Orbia is exposed to product risks that could cause harm to third parties\n\nThe Company may be exposed to risks or damages derived from civil liability before third parties, resulting from the use of its products, as well as litigation of the resulting judicial process, regardless of whether said products are used in a manner contrary to what is indicated. The Company may also be exposed to damages related to the use of its products in medical-grade applications and for the food and beverage industries.\n\nOrbia has tailored market standard insurance coverage for this type of product risk. However, the safety measures taken to prevent product risks and insurance coverage may not be adequate to mitigate the risk of all damages that may occur, in which case the Company's operating results or its financial condition could be adversely affected.",

        "page_content": "## Impacts  related  to  climate  change  could  result  in  additional  regulatory  or  legal  requirements,  as  well  as investments not foreseen by the Company\n\nThe Company has carried out different analyses to determine the degree of vulnerability of its operations with the possible effects of climate change.\n\nThe  effects  of  climate  change  identified  within  the  different  areas  where  it  operates  or  has  market  share  are: desertification and drought, rising sea levels, changes in rainfall patterns, decreased water availability and deforestation and disease.  All are phenomena that could affect operating results and financial position, among other factors, due to the need for additional investments to adapt operations to new conditions, the increase in the price of  supplies and energy,  the  closure  of  affected  operations  and  relocation  of  suppliers,  protection  measures  as  a  result  of  natural phenomena (for example: construction of dikes in marine installations, flood or fire protection) and the relocation of facilities to sites with more favorable conditions and higher environmental regulatory requirements.\n\n## Natural disasters, production hazards, extreme weather and other events could adversely affect the Company's operations\n\nNatural disasters,  such  as  storms,  hurricanes  and  earthquakes,  could  disrupt  operations,  damage  infrastructure  or adversely affect the Company's production plants. In addition, Orbia is vulnerable to acts of vandalism or revolts that could  affect  the  infrastructure  and/or  its  distribution  network.  Any  of  these  events  could  increase  its  expenses  or investments and/or result in a force majeure event under some of its contracts and consequently affect its operating results and financial position.\n\nOrbia's operations are subject to hazards such as fires, explosions and other accidents related to the manufacture, storage and transportation of chemicals. These hazards can range from personal injury to loss of life, property damage and/or destruction of equipment and assets, as well as environmental damage. A material incident at one of its plants or storage facilities could result in the temporary suspension of operations and could result in significant compensatory costs and loss of net sales revenue.\n\n## Labor disputes could affect Orbia's operating results\n\nAt the end of fiscal year 2022, approximately 54% of the Company's employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. Over the past three years, it has had no major labor disputes at its plants and has been able to maintain a positive relationship with the unions. However, it cannot guarantee that there will be no temporary suspension, nor that a strike will not take place, before, during the term of, or upon expiration of collective bargaining agreements as a result of political or economic conditions, or for any other reason. In addition, it is unable to estimate the adverse effects, if any, that such temporary suspensions or strikes would have on the Issuer's sales, operating results or financial position. Any temporary suspension, strike or other labor event could have a material adverse effect on its activities, operating results or financial position.\n\n## Orbia is a holding company and does not have significant assets other than the shares in its subsidiaries; as a result, it may not be able to meet its obligations\n\nOrbia is a holding company with no independent operations or substantial assets other than the net worth of its operating companies. It is therefore dependent on the operating results of its subsidiaries. The ability of Orbia to meet its debt and other obligations depends on the generation of cash flow from its subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available in the form of interest payments, debt payments, dividends or otherwise. Each of its subsidiaries is a separate legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit its ability to obtain cash from its subsidiaries. In addition, under Mexican law, Mexican subsidiaries may only pay dividends from retained earnings after  a  legal  reserve  has  been  created  and  all  losses  from  prior  tax  years  have  been  absorbed.  In  addition,  the distribution of dividends may be taxable unless they are made from a profit and loss account that has already been subject to tax. If it does not receive distributions from its subsidiaries, the Company may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on its debt or to pay other obligations. Any adverse change in the financial position or operating results of its subsidiaries could affect its financial position.\n\n## Inability  to  raise  enough  capital  to  finance  acquisitions  or  expansions  could  delay  or  impede  the implementation of the Company's business strategy\n\nThe Issuer expects that the expansion and continued development of its operations may require significant amounts of capital  to  finance  investments  and  operating  expenses,  including  working  capital  requirements,  which  may  not  be obtained in full or at least not on acceptable terms.\n\nIn addition, its operations may not generate enough cash flow to meet its cash needs, or capital requirements may vary significantly from those planned. In such cases, additional funding may be required ahead of schedule, or some of the new development and expansion plans may be delayed, or the Company may miss market opportunities. Future lending",

The inability to obtain additional capital and/or to obtain it on satisfactory terms may delay or prevent Orbia's expansion and adversely affect its operating results, cash flow and financial position.\n\n## Orbia uses financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and/or foreign exchange rates\n\nOrbia is exposed to interest rate risk, because a portion of its debt is at a variable interest rate, as well as foreign exchange  risk,  because  it  has  debt  and  investments  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  The  Company's vulnerability to interest rates is primarily concentrated in the Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIIE), LIBOR, and Secured  Overnight  Financing  Rate  (SOFR)  which  are  reference  rates  used  for  financial  liabilities,  whereas  the Company's exchange rate exposure is primarily due to debt and investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. A stress test is used to determine the Company's exposure to fluctuations in interest rates based on total financial debt linked to floating rates that are not hedged, and exchange rates based on the amounts of principal debt and investments in assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Hedging transactions are regularly evaluated to ensure that they are aligned with interest rates and related risks thereby guaranteeing the most effective hedging strategy is in place, however the Company cannot guarantee hedge effectiveness.\n\n## The Company may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights and may unknowingly infringe on the rights of the others\n\nThe Company may not be able to prevent third parties from using its patents and trademarks without its authorization or from otherwise infringing on its intellectual property rights. The intellectual property laws of the various jurisdictions in which Orbia operates and the enforcement of such laws by the authorities in such jurisdictions may not be efficient, which may affect the Company's ability to protect its rights over its intellectual property. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be successful if it tries to enforce its intellectual property rights. Because the Company believes that its patents and trademarks are one of its competitive advantages, if management is unable to enforce these intellectual property rights, the business could be adversely and substantially affected. In addition, any legal proceedings to enforce Orbia's intellectual property rights could be expensive and accordingly could adversely affect the Company's operating results.\n\nAlthough the Company takes measures to ensure that it does not infringe upon third party intellectual property rights, management cannot guarantee that Orbia's processes and products do not infringe, or have not infringed at any time, on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Additionally, the Company cannot guarantee that third parties will not take any legal action for possible infringement on their intellectual property rights which may be successful.\n\n## The Company is subject to legal and administrative proceedings in certain countries in which its operates, the results of which could adversely affect its business\n\nOrbia is the plaintiff or defendant in multiple judicial or administrative proceedings regarding it its routine operations in various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is fully committed to complying with applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates.\n\nHowever, in the event that such proceedings are initiated and/or the outcome thereof is not in the Company's interests, and the Company is unable to protect its interests, Orbia's operations, operating results or financial position may be adversely affected.\n\n## The costs of breach of environmental, health and safety laws, as well as any contingencies arising in relation to such laws, may increase, adversely affecting Orbia's operations, operating results, cash flows or financial position.\n\nOrbia produces, distributes and transports hazardous materials as part of its operations, which involves risks of leaks and spills that could potentially affect both people and the environment. The Company also produces, distributes and sells products that are dangerous or have certain levels of global warming potential that may be restricted in the future. As a result, the Company is subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, health and safety, among other factors, that govern the generation, storage, handling, use, repair, disposal, transport, emission and discharge of hazardous materials on land, in the air or in water, as well as the health and safety of its employees. In addition, chemical producers are sometimes subject to unfavorable trade perceptions as a result of the environmental impact of their businesses, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's operating results, cash flow and financial position.\n\nGiven the nature of Orbia's products, the Company is required to obtain permits from government authorities for certain operations. The Company cannot guarantee that it has, or will always fully comply with such laws, regulations and permits. If the Company violates or breach these laws, regulations or permits, regulators may fine or otherwise sanction the  company.  The  Company  could  also  be  responsible  for  any  consequences  arising  from  human  exposure  to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.",

        "page_content": "Environmental protection laws are complex, change frequently, and tend to become stricter over time. Although the Company has budgeted for the capital requirements and operating expenses necessary to continue to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, management cannot guarantee that the latter will not change or become stricter in the future, or that regulations applied in certain countries or regions will also be applied and/or adjusted in other countries or regions due to the adoption of international treaties. Subsequent changes in or additions to existing laws or  regulations,  or  the  enforcement  or  application  of  such  laws  or  regulations,  could  cause  the  Company  to  incur significant unforeseen capital expenditures, which could affect future profitability or financial position. Therefore, the Company cannot guarantee that  the  expense  of complying  with,  or the  expenses  arising  from,  stricter  or  different interpretations of applicable and future safety, health and environmental laws, as well as the Company's responsibilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances, will not adversely affect Orbia's business, operating results, cash flow or financial position.\n\n## The use of social networks could adversely affect and impact the Company's reputation\n\nThe use of social networking platforms and similar media, including blogs, social networking sites and other forms of communication via the internet, which allow individual access to a wide audience and interested persons and their influence  as  agents  of  perception  and  opinion,  has  grown  at  a  phenomenal  rate  worldwide.  Inappropriate  and/or unauthorized use of certain social media platforms may result in trademark damage or leakage of information that could have legal implications, including the improper dissemination and/or disclosure of personal data. In addition, negative or inaccurate comments or information involving the Company sent through social networks could damage Orbia's reputation, brand image and goodwill.\n\nConsumers value readily available information about retailers, manufacturers and their assets and services, and often act on that information without further research, verification or considering its veracity. Easy access to information on social networking platforms and mobile devices is virtually immediate, as is its impact. Social networking platforms and mobile devices immediately publish the content that their subscribers and participants input, often without filtering or reviewing the accuracy of content. The opportunities to spread information, including false or inaccurate information, are virtually unlimited. Information that concerns Orbia, or that could seriously affect Orbia, may be transmitted through such platforms and devices at any time. This information could be inaccurate and harmful to the Company and could damage the business. This damage could be immediate and the Company may not have the opportunity to alter it or even correct it. These platforms may also be used to disclose trade secrets or put other valuable assets at risk, and in both cases, damage or affect the Company's business, operating results and financial position.\n\n## Orbia's operations could be affected by a failure, interruption or collapse of its IT (Information technology) system\n\nThe efficient execution of Orbia's operations is based on the implementation of IT-related processes and systems, which are  used  to  effectively  manage  data,  communications,  network  connectivity  and  other  operational  and  business processes.  Although  the  Company  constantly improves its  IT  systems  and  protect  its  data  with  advanced  security measures, system errors, interruptions or security breaches, such as computer viruses or theft of information or data, may occur. These failures, interruptions or collapses could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results or financial position.\n\nSecurity failures  in  Orbia's  information  system  and  technological  systems  and  processes  could  materially affect its subsidiaries, affiliates, suppliers and customers, as well as restrict or adversely affect access to the Company's networks and operating systems, or expose the Company to significant legal, financial, operational and reputational consequences\n\nThe  execution  of  Orbia's  business  requires  the  use  and  storage  of  personally  identifiable  information  (PII)  from customers,  employees  and  business  partners.  This  information  may  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  data,  names, addresses,  telephone  numbers,  e-mail  addresses,  contact  preferences,  tax  identification  numbers,  and  account payment information. Because of Orbia's profile, the amount of PII Orbia handles in its operations, and the amount of strategic industrial and technological information stored in the Company's different internal systems, the Company is vulnerable to cyber-attacks and database infiltration.\n\nOrbia invests a significant amount of resources on network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute protection.   For example, e-mails with executable attachments containing malicious software that, due to their complexity, are difficult to block and modify the delivery pattern, could lead to database infiltration. If the Company's internal systems are infiltrated, and it is unable to protect sensitive or strategic data, such infiltration could cause a material adverse change in the Company's business, relationships with business partners and customers, and its operating results and financial position, and could expose the Company to the risk of claims of violation of current General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).",

        "page_content": "## Cyber-attacks or other disruptions to Orbia's network or information systems could have an adverse effect on the business\n\nCyber-attacks and disruptions to networks and systems, including the introduction of computer viruses, malicious code, denial of service, faulty software and other disruptions or unauthorized access to company systems, have increased in frequency, range and impact in recent years. The preventive actions Orbia takes to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and to protect its network and information may not be enough to stop a massive cyber-attack in the future. The costs associated with a potential massive cyber- attack on Orbia's systems include increased expenses associated with strengthening cyber security measures and  potential losses associated with disruption to the Company's services, lawsuits against the Company, and reputational damage.\n\nCyber-attacks or other disruptions to the Company's security network or information systems could cause equipment failure or disrupt operations. Such failures, even when they occur over a short period of time, could cause significant losses or declines in the market price of Orbia's shares. In addition, potential losses from cyber-attack events and disruptions to Orbia's network could exceed the Company's insurance coverage. Furthermore, cyber-attacks may lead to the distribution, without the Company's consent, of valuable and confidential business financial information and data, including customer data, which in turn could adversely affect operating results, reputation or financial position.\n\n## Orbia's  contracting  model  for  high-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  products  involves  certain  risks  related  to customer retention, which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  financial  and  business situation\n\nOrbia sells a substantial amount of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) products under short-term contractual orders. In addition, the Company has long-term contracts, particularly with agreements for voice and data telecommunications products in the U.S., Europe and India, among others. Most of the Company's agreements contain terms and conditions relating to pricing, including any type of resin transfer provision, and in general Orbia's customers are not required to purchase a minimum volume, and contracts can generally be terminated without cause and at short notice. As a result, customers have the ability to discontinue or substantially reduce the purchase of Orbia's products at any time. The loss of customers representing a significant volume of sales, as well as a significant decrease in customer orders for any reason, including changes in customer manufacturing practices, transfer of part of the business to competitors, an economic recession, or the inability to adapt services to the needs of Orbia's customers, can have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.\n\n## The operations of the Precision Agriculture, Connectivity Solutions and Building and Infrastructure business groups depend on the agriculture, telecommunications and construction industries, respectively\n\nOrbia's Building and Infrastructure, Connectivity Solutions and Precision Agriculture business groups largely depend on  the  viability  of  the  construction,  infrastructure,  telecommunications  and  agricultural  industries,  respectively.  A slowdown in  the  growth  of  these  industries  in  the  countries  in  which  Orbia  operates,  or  a  negative  change  in  the economic  and  demographic  factors  that  influence  these  industries,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\n\n## Changes in investment levels in the voice and data telecommunications industry could affect the production and sales of products in Connectivity Solutions\n\nThe different investments required by telecommunications industry participants to implement fiber optic and broadband communication systems greatly influence this industry, including the markets in which Orbia's Connectivity Solutions Business competes. Investment in this industry depends on a variety of factors, including:\n\n- \uf0b7 Local and federal regulation on foreign investment in telecommunications;\n- \uf0b7 Consumer demand for fiber optics, broadband and wireless networks for products and services;\n- \uf0b7 Regulatory decisions that limit the installation of new networks and improvements to the existing network;\n- \uf0b7 The rights of way, and permits from local and state governments, in the countries where the business operates, required to access the construction of new networks;\n- \uf0b7 The evolution and acceptance of new standards in the industry;\n- \uf0b7 Pressures related to competition in the sector, including prices;\n- \uf0b7 The annual budget cycles;\n- \uf0b7 Investments in private company projects and their investment cycles;\n- \uf0b7 The impact on industry consolidation;\n- \uf0b7 Access to financing and the general economic conditions of the market;\n- \uf0b7 Price levels;\n- \uf0b7 Existence, creation or improvement of alternative products, new technologies, etc., and;\n- \uf0b7 Political stability.",

Government support for farms including financial aid and policies regarding the ability to use water  for  agricultural  irrigation  can  affect  the  demand  for  Orbia's  irrigation  products  and  irrigation  system solutions.\n\nAs farm incomes decline, producers may postpone investments, including the purchase of Orbia's products, or to turn to less expensive irrigation alternatives.\n\nIn  addition,  uncertainty  or  changes  in  government  subsidies,  policies  and  government  support  for  agriculture  may adversely affect Precision Agriculture's business, financial position or operating results.\n\n## The activities of key joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the Company' s business.\n\nIn the course of its business, Orbia enters into strategic partnerships with third parties.\n\nSpecifically, Orbia has a 50:50 strategic alliance joint venture with OxyChem for production of ethylene in a company called Ingleside Ethylene, LLC located in Ingleside, Texas, US.\n\nAdditionally, Orbia owns 80% of the capital stock of its Precision Agriculture business, Netafim, with the remaining 20% owned by Kibbutz Hatzerim.\n\nOrbia cannot make any guarantees as to how OxyChem, Kibbutz Hatzerim, or any of its other strategic partners, may act in the future which and accordingly, the action of such partners may adversely affect Orbia's business and operating results.\n\nOrbia owns 67% of Vectus Industries Limited ('Vectus') as part of the Building and Infrastructure segment.\n\nOrbia's agreements executed with OxyChem, ethane, ethylene and Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) suppliers may be insufficient to meet all of the Company operational and commercial needs, which may affect production costs due to increases in the price of its raw materials or lack of production capacity\n\nThe supply contracts entered into with OxyChem, ethane and/or ethylene suppliers or other VCM suppliers may not be sufficient to meet all of the Company's operational and commercial needs, which could have an effect on production costs due to an increase in the price of raw materials or the services required, or due to a lack of production capacity at Orbia's plants that prevents the Company from absorbing costs efficiently, as well as the loss of opportunities to sell products due to lack of access to the raw material used to manufacture them. Ethane is a raw material used to produce ethylene,  which in  turn is  used  in the  production  of  VCM, the  raw material necessary for  the manufacture  of  PVC. Variations in PVC, caustic soda and/or ethane prices in the future could affect the Company's operating results and hinder or delay the recovery of the Company's investment in Ingleside.\n\nThe  Company's  mining  concessions  may  be  subject  to  being  declared  invalid,  cancellation,  suspension, expropriation or revocation, pursuant to applicable legal provisions and/or the Company may not be able to renew its existing concessions, which could have a material adverse effect on  its operations and financial position\n\nThe  Company  owns the  rights to  several  renewable mining  concessions, mostly  located in  Mexico.  In  Fluorinated Solutions, there are several mining concessions that expire gradually from 2029 to 2061, which are renewable pursuant to the  provisions  of the  Mining  Act in  Mexico.  Fluorinated  Solutions  will take  the  necessary  steps,  pursuant to the deadlines established by law, to ensure the renewal of the concessions that are due to expire soon. However, the Company cannot guarantee that such renewals will be granted. Furthermore, and pursuant to Mexican legislation, Fluorinated Solutions is obligated to verify the investments in exploration and exploitation of these concessions, which to date have been carried out in a timely manner. PMV has a mining concession for the salt dome in Veracruz that expires in 2043.",

        "page_content": "Under  Mexican  law,  mineral  resources  belong  to  the  Mexican  nation,  and  the  Federal  Government  may  grant concessions  to  individuals  to  explore  and  exploit  mineral  reserves.  The  Company's  mining  rights  derive  from concessions granted by the Ministry of Economy. The Company's mining operations are mostly located in Mexico and are subject to the regulations and supervision of the respective governmental agencies. Mexican law stipulates that the Federal Government is entitled to declare the rights to the concessions awarded null, cancelled, suspended or void, and such concessions may be subject to additional conditions, or they may not be renewed upon expiration in the event that certain legal grounds are triggered.\n\nAccordingly, the concessions the Company has in Mexico may be revoked without the right to compensation if the Company is unable to comply with the terms and conditions set forth in the concessions. In addition, the lots of land comprising the mining concessions in Mexico, as well as the related assets of its concessions, could be expropriated in the public interest, with a right to compensation, which could be limited to or less than the market value of the assets. In the event of a dispute regarding the amount of compensation, the Company may request that the judicial authority determine such amount. The compensation shall be covered by the State in Mexican pesos, even if payment in kind is agreed. Pursuant to the Expropriation Act, the government will pay compensation within a period of 45 business days from  the  declaration  of  expropriation,  in  pesos  or  through  the  payment  of  another  asset.  The  Mining  Act  and  its regulations do not set forth that, if a competent court decides to cancel a concession, the State must pay compensation to the concession holder. If the rights to Orbia's concessions are cancelled, terminated, suspended or revoked and the Company is unable  to  ensure  fair  compensation, the  Company's  operating results  and financial  position could  be adversely affected.\n\nSimilarly, Mexican law sets forth that mining concessions will last fifty years, from the date of their registration in the Public Mining Registry and may be extended for the same amount of time subject to certain conditions. Although the Company plans to  apply for  such  renewals  and  will  comply  with  all  the  conditions  necessary  to  obtain  them,  the Company cannot guarantee that the concessions will be renewed because the renewal of concessions is subject to the government's discretion. The Company's inability to renew any of its concessions could have a material adverse effect on its operations, operating results, financial position and outlook.\n\nUnder the terms and conditions of the concessions, the Company is required to comply with certain obligations under the  Mining  Act.  Non-compliance may result in administrative sanctions imposed by the Ministry of the Economy or cancellation of the concessions. This could result in a material adverse effect on Orbia's operations, operating results, financial position and outlook.\n\nTo summarize, in the event of a possible expropriation of mining lots or assets used for the exploitation of mining concessions, or if the rights contained in concessions are declared null, cancelled, suspended or revoked, or if Orbia is unable  to  renew  the  concessions,  or  it  would  not  be  possible  to  receive  adequate  or  timely  compensation,  the Company's operating results and financial position may be adversely affected.\n\n## The volume of fluorite reserves and production rate may be different than expected\n\nThe amount of fluorite reserves in Orbia's mines are determined under standards and practices established for the mining industry, using geological and engineering data to measure the estimated amounts of fluorite deposits that can be economically recovered and processed by mining.\n\nManagement cannot guarantee that estimates of the Company's fluorite reserve quantities will not differ substantially from the quantities of minerals that will be definitively recovered. In addition, fluctuations in market prices and changes in  operating and capital costs may cause some of the fluorite reserves to be economically unviable for exploitation. Should this occur, the Company may be unable to obtain enough raw materials to meet its production targets and other commitments, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and operating results.\n\nEpidemics  in  the  countries  where  the  Company  carry  out  its  production  and  commercial  operations  or pandemics that affect all countries could interrupt operations by suspending activities, breaking supply chains or blocking product distribution chains\n\nOrbia's global operations expose the Company to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus ('COVID-19'). The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated containment efforts have had a serious adverse impact on the global economy, including significant disruptions to supply chains and product distribution.\n\nFuture global health crises could materially affect the Company's ability to adequately staff and maintain its operations, including in the event government authorities impose mandatory closures, work-from-home orders and social distancing protocols, and seek voluntary facility closures and impose other restrictions to mitigate the further spread of disease. A global health crisis could also disrupt the Company's supply chain and materially and adversely impact the Company's ability  to  secure  supplies  for  its  facilities  and  to  provide  personal  protective  equipment  for  employees,  which  could materially and adversely affect its operations.",

These controls restrict access to foreign currencies and limit the possibility of transferring funds outside such countries, including funds for interest or principal payments on outstanding debt. In addition, these controls affect Orbia's capacity to receive dividends and other distributions from subsidiaries in these countries.\n\nIf the Company is prohibited from transferring funds outside of the aforementioned countries or is subject to similar restrictions in other countries in which it operates, Orbia's operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\n\n## Events in Mexico or other countries could adversely affect the Mexican and other Latin American economies, the market value of the securities in which Orbia trades, and its operating results\n\nThe market value of securities of Mexican companies is affected by economic and market conditions in both developed and  emerging  countries.  Although  in  such  countries  they  may  differ  significantly  from  those  presented  in  Mexico, adverse economic conditions could expand regionally or investors' reactions to events in any of these countries could have an adverse effect on the market value of securities of Mexican issuers. In recent years, for example, the prices of Mexican debt and equity securities have on occasion undergone substantial declines as a result of events in Mexico or in other countries and markets.\n\nFurthermore, in recent years, there has been a greater correlation between economic conditions in Mexico and the economic  conditions  in  the  U.S.  and  the  European  Union  as  a  result  of  free  trade  agreements  which  resulted  in increased  economic  activity  between  these  parties.  Accordingly,  the  Mexican  economy  continues  to  be  strongly influenced  by  the  US  and  European  economies  and,  therefore,  the  termination  of  free  trade  agreements,  or  a deterioration in economic conditions in, or delays in the recovery of, the economy in the US or Europe, could affect the economy in Mexico and Latin America. These events could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and income, which could affect its liquidity, financial situation and/or the market price of the securities issued by the Company.\n\n## Foreign exchange fluctuations of the currencies of the countries in which the Company operates, compared to the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect the Company.\n\nBecause Orbia's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the Company must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where Orbia operates will affect the Company's results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of the Company's operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. Furthermore, the Company has exposure to foreign currency movements because  certain  foreign  currency  transactions  need  to  be  converted  to  a  different  currency  for  settlement.  These conversions can have a direct impact on the Company's cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the Company exposed to adverse changes in interest rates.\n\nThe  Company  manages  both  these  risks  through  normal  operating  and  financing  activities  and,  when  deemed appropriate,  through  the  use  of  derivative  instruments.  The  Company  cannot  be  certain,  however,  that  it  will  be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.",

The approval of the Federal Economic Competition Commission in Mexico, and of the authorities of each country on this matter, is required for acquisitions, sales or significant joint ventures to be carried out. Failure to obtain antitrust authority approvals could result in fines, mandatory  divestiture  of  assets,  termination  of  key  acquisition  contracts,  or  the  inability  to  continue  business acquisitions or conclude those already agreed upon.

Therefore, as the Company's operations and market position increase, the risks of limitations from antitrust regulations related to future acquisitions increases, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial and operating results and ability to grow.\n\n## The Mexican Congress and the legislative authorities  of the countries in which Orbia has a  presence may approve legislation that results in increases in tax obligations\n\nIn recent years, the Mexican government and some of the governments of the countries in which the Company operates have  implemented  various  reforms  to  the  tax  laws  applicable  to  companies,  including  Orbia.  Should  the  Mexican government or any of the governments of the countries in which Orbia operates carry out tax law reforms that result in significant increases in tax obligations, Orbia may be required to pay higher amounts pursuant to such changes, which could have a significant negative impact on its operating results.\n\nIn addition, taxation in several of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates or does business is often complex and subject to interpretation. The tax position of the authorities could differ from the Company's current or historical tax position, which could result in the payment of higher taxes on items for which the Company was not previously taxed, in addition to the conduct of audits of previous years and tax payments, as well as the imposition of additional taxes.\n\n## IFRS  differ  in  several  respects  from  U.S.  financial  reporting  standards  or  many  of  the  Financial  Reporting Standards that apply in the countries in which Orbia operates or in which its securities are traded\n\nIn Mexico, the USA and other countries, securities laws and regulations have been enacted to promote full and accurate disclosure of corporate information to investors. However, the Company is not required to comply with most of the securities laws in force in the U.S or other countries and, therefore, the information reported may differ from and be presented in a manner that differs from the information available to companies operating or trading in the U.S. or other countries  that  are  required  to  report  their  information  according  to  securities  listing  standards  pursuant  to  such regulations. The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differ from United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in various respects.\n\n## (b) Risk Factors related to Securities Issued by the Company.\n\n## The market price of outstanding shares can fluctuate significantly\n\nVolatility in the market price of ORBIA* shares could prevent investors from being able to sell their shares at the same price or at a higher price than they paid for them. The market price and market liquidity of ORBIA* shares could be significantly affected by several factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control and are not directly related to the Company's performance. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \uf0b7 Changes in the market valuation of companies offering similar products;\n- \uf0b7 Economic, regulatory, political and market conditions in Mexico, the U.S., Europe and other countries;\n- \uf0b7 Industry conditions or trends;\n- \uf0b7 Emergence of technological innovations that could make products and services less attractive or obsolete;\n- \uf0b7 The introduction of new products and services by the Company or its competitors;\n- \uf0b7 Historical and projected quarterly and annual operating results;\n- \uf0b7 Differences between actual or expected results and analysts' and investors' expectations;\n- \uf0b7 Announcements by the Company or third parties and events affecting operations;\n- \uf0b7 Announcements, results or actions taken by competitors;\n- \uf0b7 Perceptions of the Company investors or of the services it provides;\n- \uf0b7 Changes in financial or economic estimates by securities analysts;\n- \uf0b7 Environmental  events,  consumer  perceptions  of  environmental  issues  and  compliance  with  environmental laws;\n- \uf0b7 The announcement of significant operations or capital commitments made by the Company;",

Broad market and industry factors could materially and adversely affect the price of Shares, regardless of actual operating performance.\n\n## Under Mexican law, shareholders' rights may be more limited, different or vague than in other jurisdictions\n\nThe corporate affairs of the Company are governed by the provisions of its articles of association and Mexican law, which may differ from the legal principles that would apply if it were incorporated in any jurisdiction in the U.S., such as the states of Delaware or New York, or in any jurisdiction other than Mexico. For example, under Mexican law, the protection afforded to minority shareholders and the fiduciary duties of directors and officers are, in some respects, lesser than or different to those in the USA or other jurisdictions. In particular, the legal regime of the fiduciary duties of directors in Mexico is not as comprehensive or developed as it is in the U.S.. In addition, the criteria for determining the independence of directors differ from the criteria applicable under the other laws.\n\nThe rights of holders of the outstanding shares who protect their interests in connection with any act by the Board of Directors, the Company or any of its members or its principal officers due to breach of their duty of loyalty may be limited or vaguer than the rights granted in other jurisdictions. In particular, any action against the Company's officers and directors can only be initiated by holders of at least 5% of the outstanding shares, as opposed to a single shareholder or group of shareholders and are derivative actions on behalf of the Company rather than the affected shareholders. In addition, rules and guidelines on related party transactions and conflicts of interest may not be as well defined in Mexico as they are in the U.S., leaving the shareholders at a possible disadvantage. Furthermore, the duties of loyalty and diligence of directors and officers are defined only in the LMV and have not been interpreted or defined by the competent courts to date; consequently, the judicial interpretation of the meaning and scope of such duties is uncertain. Recently several reforms were published in Mexico that allow for the institution of class actions, however, the procedures for instituting such actions have not been defined. To date, there has not been a sufficient number of claims relating to breach of fiduciary duties, whether through class actions or derivative actions, to give rise to legal claims based on breaches of fiduciary duties or to assist in predicting the outcome of a potential claim. As a result of the foregoing, minority shareholders of the Company have greater difficulty in practice in deciding whether to exercise their rights against the Company or its directors, officers or controlling shareholders than they would have as shareholders of a company incorporated in the United States.\n\n## There can be no guarantee that Orbia will be able to pay or maintain cash dividends, and its dividend policies are subject to change. Payment and the amount of dividends are subject to shareholder approval\n\nThe dividend policy is recommended by the Board of Directors and approved by the Company's Shareholders' Meeting. While Orbia's principal shareholders continue to own a majority of the shares representing the Company's capital stock, such shareholders may determine whether dividends will be paid and the amount of such dividends. As a result of the foregoing, there may be years in which the Company does not distribute dividends and others in which a substantial portion of Orbia's earnings is distributed. If the latter occurs, the Company's growth potential could be limited.\n\nOrbia's  dividend  payment  policy  also  depends  on  the  generation  of  profits,  cash  flow  generation,  and  projected investments in its different business groups. As a result, there are several factors that may affect the availability and intervals of cash dividend payments to Orbia's shareholders.\n\n## If additional shares are issued in the future, shares may be diluted, and the trading price for ORBIA* shares may decrease\n\nAs part of Orbia's business strategy, future acquisitions or corporate requirements and other expenses may be financed by issuing additional capital stock. Any issuance of Orbia's capital stock would result in the dilution of the Company's investors' equity. In addition, future issues of shares or sales by controlling shareholders, or the announcement of such an issue or sale, could result in a decrease in the market price of the Shares. Accordingly, the market price and market liquidity of ORBIA* shares could be affected by the issuance of additional shares for any of these purposes.\n\n## The principal and related shareholders, who control Orbia, may have interests that differ from the rest of the shareholders and the holders of the Notes\n\nAt the time of the issuance of this Annual Report, the Company's principal shareholder is Kaluz, which is controlled by the del Valle Perochena family which owns approximately 44.83% of the voting capital stock. Therefore, the del Valle Perochena family should be considered to be a significantly influential shareholder pursuant to the LMV. The del Valle Perochena brothers individually own 0.47%, while other shareholders related to the del Valle family have 9.27% of the",

Consequently, along with Kaluz, they should be considered a group which will have significant influence over the Issuer, pursuant to the LMV.\n\n## Possible breach of the requirements to maintain a list of securities in the Mexican Stock Exchange or to register them in the National Securities Registry could affect the price of securities.\n\nOrbia, as a result of the registration of its Shares in the RNV and their listing in the BMV, is subject to compliance with various disclosure requirements, among others, in order to maintain such registration and listing. In the event that Orbia is unable to comply with such requirements, the listing of Shares on the BMV could be suspended or even cancelled. In such an event, the market price of the Shares and Notes would be adversely affected.\n\n## The Company holds significant levels of debt\n\nThe Company's level of debt can have significant consequences for the investor. Among other things, it can:\n\n- \uf0b7 Limit the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows, or obtain additional financing, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other future general corporate purposes;\n- \uf0b7 Limit the collaterals and guarantees that the Company can offer to obtain additional financing.\n- \uf0b7 Restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends;\n- \uf0b7 Require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n- \uf0b7 Limit flexibility to plan for or react to changes in operations and industry conditions;\n- \uf0b7 Limit the Company's ability to carry out additional acquisitions;\n- \uf0b7 Place the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its less leveraged competitors; and\n- \uf0b7 Increase the Company's vulnerability to the effects of the adverse economic conditions inherent to the industry.\n\nThe contracts and securities governing the debt, including the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds, contain cross default  provisions  that  may  cause  all  debt  issued  under  such  instruments  to  become  due  and  payable immediately as a result of a default event set forth in another unrelated debt instrument\n\nThe  instruments  governing  the  Notes  and  the  Sustainable  Bonds  contain  certain  obligations  and  the  contracts  or securities  governing  other  loans  also  contain obligations and, in some  cases,  require  Orbia  and its  subsidiaries  to comply  with  and  demonstrate  compliance  with certain  financial  and  non-financial  covenants.  Any  breach  of  these obligations could result in an event of default on the corresponding contract or security, which in turn could result in the related debt or other credits established under different instruments becoming immediately due and payable. In such an event, Orbia would need to obtain financial resources from alternative sources, which it may do under favorable or unfavorable conditions, at the necessary time, or it may not obtain any resources at all. Alternatively, any default event could require Orbia to sell assets or reduce its operations to satisfy its obligations to its creditors.  In the event of a default, it could affect the Company's ability to grow, its financial position or operating results.\n\n## The debt payment guarantees by Orbia's subsidiaries may not be immediately enforceable\n\nEach series of Notes and Sustainable Bonds, as well as other financing, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by certain subsidiaries of Orbia. These guarantees provide creditors with the basis for filing a direct payment  claim  against  such  subsidiaries,  however,  such  guarantees  may  not  be  immediately  enforceable  under applicable law.\n\nIf an attempt was made to legally enforce the guarantees, enforcement could be subject to a court ruling, and because the guarantee had been granted for the direct benefit of the Company, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the guarantor in turn could be incurred for less than their fair value or fair compensation. A court could therefore invalidate the obligations under the guarantees and related agreements and subordinate them to the other debts of the guarantor in turn or take other actions harmful to the holders of the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds.\n\nAlthough courts in different jurisdictions measure insolvency differently, in general, a company would be considered insolvent if the sum of its debts, including contingent and unpaid debts, exceeds the fair value of its assets, or if the current value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay the liabilities of its debts, including contingent and unpaid debts, as they become payable.\n\nIf the guarantees cannot be exercised, the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds would be subordinated to all the liabilities, including the accounts payable, of the guarantor subsidiaries. A court may also issue a judgment against the holders of the Notes ordering them to reimburse any amounts paid to them under such guarantees or to exercise the proceeds of the guarantees. If any guarantee or lien were invalidated, the holders of the Notes or the Sustainable Bonds would no longer have a direct claim against the guarantor subsidiary, but would retain their rights against the Company and any other guarantor subsidiary, even though there was no guarantee that the assets of the respective subsidiaries would be sufficient to pay the Notes or the Sustainable Bonds in full.",

        "page_content": "The provisions of Mexican law may make it difficult for holders of Notes and Sustainable Bonds to convert the amounts paid by the Company to the holders in Mexican pesos into U.S. dollars or to achieve recognition of the full value of such payments\n\nOrbia is required to make payments in respect to Notes, Sustainable Bonds and other loans in U.S. dollars. However, under the Mexican Monetary Law (Ley Monetaria de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos), obligations to make payments in Mexico in foreign currencies, whether by agreement or upon enforcement of a judgment, may be discharged in Mexican pesos at the exchange rate for Mexican pesos prevailing at the time and place of payment or judgement. Pursuant to the foregoing, Orbia will be legally entitled to make payment of amounts due on the Notes, Sustainable Bonds and other loans taken out in currencies other than Mexican pesos, as set forth by the Mexican Monetary Law, and Orbia can make no assurance that the amounts paid will be converted by the beneficiary into U.S. dollars or that, if converted, such amounts paid would be sufficient to acquire U.S. dollars equal to the amount of the principal, interest, or additional payments due from such Notes, Sustainable Bonds, or loans.\n\n## Holders of the Notes and Sustainable Bonds may be limited in their ability to institute proceedings or lawsuits against the Company in Mexican courts\n\nOrbia and some of its guarantor subsidiaries are companies incorporated under the laws of Mexico. Almost all of its directors and key executives, as well as the directors and key executives of many of its guarantor subsidiaries are Mexican citizens and residents. A significant percentage of the Company's assets and those of some of its guarantor subsidiaries are in Mexico, and a very significant percentage of the Company's sales and those of some of the guarantor subsidiaries originate from sources in Mexico. Therefore, it could eventually be difficult for holders of Notes and other debt  instruments  taken  out  by  Orbia  in  currencies  other  than  the  Mexican  peso  to  serve  process  and  bring  legal proceedings or lawsuits against the Company or its guarantor subsidiaries outside of Mexico or against its directors or key executives or to enforce judicial rulings issued by courts or tribunals outside of Mexico's jurisdiction, in all matters relating to civil obligations under laws of jurisdiction outside of Mexico, including proceedings instituted pursuant to the civil provisions of U.S. securities laws or other US laws.\n\nThe payment of the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds, as well as the related guarantees, may be structurally subordinated with respect to the debt obligations of the guarantor subsidiaries as well as subsidiaries who are not guarantors of Orbia, in the same way other debt that does not have the same guarantee structure would be structurally subordinated to that which does\n\nThe Notes constitute part of Orbia's guaranteed debt and their payment preference is equal to that of other debts, but they could be structurally subordinated with respect to the payment of other guaranteed credit obligations and also structurally subordinated to debts contracted by the guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries. Although the holders of the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds have a direct right to claim payment, this right is not guaranteed over the assets and properties of Orbia or of the guarantor subsidiaries; therefore, the payment of the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds is  subordinated  with  respect to  the  debt  of  Orbia  and  its  subsidiaries that  have  a  specific applicable  guarantee  for payment up to the value of such assets. In addition, under Mexican law, the payment obligations of the Notes are subordinated to certain preferences established by law, including wage and salary claims, guaranteed obligations, social security, workers' housing funds, taxes, fees for and expenses of lawsuits. Similar legal preferences may apply in other jurisdictions where subsidiary guarantors have been incorporated. In the event of Orbia's liquidation, such legal payment preferences will prevail over any other claim, including those of any holder of the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds.\n\n## A decrease in Orbia's credit risk rating and/or its loans could adversely affect its ability to access credit markets\n\nIf any of the credit ratings are downgraded by the rating institutions, or if the current ratings are subject to  negative reviews by the rating agencies, the Company's ability to access the credit markets could be seriously affected and the associated costs of financing could increase. Changes in credit ratings could also affect the price of the Company's securities, including the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds.\n\n## d)  Other Securities\n\nThe securities that Orbia has registered in the RNV and trades in the BMV are:\n\n- i. Ordinary, nominal, without stating a nominal value, freely subscribed shares representing the capital stock of Orbia Advance Corporation, S.A.B. de C.V., and which grant full corporate and patrimonial rights to all holders of such shares, listed under the ticker symbol ORBIA*.\n- ii. On December 8, 2022, Orbia issued Cebures ('Certificados Burs\u00e1tiles') for a total amount of $10 billion pesos in two tranches: one of $2.34 billion pesos, with a term of three years with a floating coupon of TIIE-28 + 0.40%, and another of $7.66 billion pesos, with a term of ten years with a fixed coupon of 10.63% under the Program for up to 10 billion pesos authorized by the CNBV on November 15, 2022.",

Company Name and trade name of the Issuer\n\nOrbia or the Company, as it is commercially known, formally operated under the name Mexichem, S.A. de C.V. At the Company's Shareholders' Meeting held on August 26, 2019, the change of the Issuer's corporate name to Orbia Advance Corporation, S.A.B. de C.V. was approved.  The change reflects the new strategy and global reorganization undertaken by the Company, which implies the re-branding of its identity and image in accordance with its mission, vision and philosophy.\n\n## ii. Date and Place of Incorporation and Duration of the Issuer\n\nThe Company was incorporated by means of public deed number 34,080, dated June 30, 1978, issued by Notary Public number 112 in and for the Federal District, the first official transcript of which was recorded in the third book of the Commerce Section of the Public Registry of Property and Commerce for the Federal District, in volume 1066, on page 190 and under number 212.

Historical Events\n\n## Pre-2020\n\nOrbia has seen significant transformation over the years which dates back to 1953 when Cables Mexicanos S.A. was founded by a group of Mexican and American investors to satisfy a growing Mexican market for high carbon steel wire ropes. In 1978, holding company Grupo Industrial Camesa, S.A. de C.V. (GICSA) was incorporated, which controlled Aceros Camesa, S.A. de C.V. and its subsidiaries. GICSA shares were listed in the BMV in the same year it was incorporated.\n\nFrom 1997 through 2019 the Company acquired over 30 companies resulting in a global footprint and its industry leadership in Polymer Solutions, Building and Infrastructure, Precision Agriculture, Connectivity Solutions, and Fluorinated Solutions.\n\nIn 2019 the organization revealed its new name, brand, purpose, and values, reflecting the global nature of the Company and its commitment to being a force for the world.\n\n## 2020\n\nIn January 2020, the Company announced that it was in the process of analyzing divestiture options or strategic  alliances with third parties for its Polymer Solutions business. Orbia did not enter into any binding contract to carry out any specific transaction and has no current plans to do so.\n\nIn  April  2020,  to  better  enable  operational  and  financial  decision  making  and  analysis,  the  Company  redefined  its business  group  structure  from  Vinyl,  Fluor  and  Fluent,  to  Polymer  Solutions,  Building  and  Infrastructure,  Precision Agriculture, Connectivity Solutions, and Fluorinated Solutions.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn early 2021, Orbia announced a partnership with the Resilient Cities Network (R-Cities), the world's leading network of cities. Through the Building and Infrastructure, Precision Agriculture and Connectivity Solutions groups, Orbia works with R-Cities members to develop innovative solutions to current challenges such as transportation infrastructure, water supply, urban food systems and connectivity, which can improve the quality of urban life.

Additionally, since  February  2017,  the  Polymer  Solutions  business group is  approximately  70% integrated  with the ethylene  process  and  has thus  achieved  significant  integration  from  salt  extraction  to  PVC  production,  which  has allowed, and will allow, Orbia to improve profitability through better cost management.\n\nIn addition, Orbia focuses on continuously improving its return on invested capital and maintaining a level above its weighted average cost of capital.\n\nA continuous focus on the development of specialty and value-added products\n\nOrbia uses its competitive advantage to develop new and advanced production processes through its 19 research and development centers. These centers develop new products focused on the needs of their customers, making products available to customers in the markets in which they participate.\n\nOrbia  also  continues  to  develop  and  implement  technologies  and  processes  for  its  own  benefit.  For  example,  the Company has its own technology to produce PVC resins, PVC pipes, compounds, plasticizers, and HF purification. These technologies are applied to produce pipes that uniquely meet customers' requirements for various infrastructure and construction projects. Orbia has also developed solutions based on fluor compounds for the cement industry that allow for the optimization of clinker production that provide economic benefits while also reducing the customer's carbon footprint.\n\nBy continuing to invest in research and development and leveraging the unique products it offers in specialty resins, Polymer Solutions will continue to develop a best-in-class product portfolio by consistently launching customer-focused products and services.\n\n## Maintaining an agile and solid financial structure\n\nOrbia seeks to maintain a solid and flexible financial base that will allow it to achieve its growth objectives. The Company seeks to maintain a net debt/EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.5x or less in the long-term. If at some point Orbia needs to exceed this ratio due to investment in growth projects, the projects must generate value, make strategic sense with the Company's business, meet the profitability conditions required by its corporate governance bodies, and present a plan to return to levels of 2.5x net debt/EBITDA or less in a reasonable period of time. Orbia's financial strategy includes a  conservative  debt profile  and  a  conservative  hedging  structure including  strategies  to  hedge  exposure  to foreign exchange rates.\n\n## Implementing a unique business culture\n\nOrbia's current operations are the result of over 30 business acquisitions executed over an extended period of time that have positioned the Company as a leader in different countries, regions, and markets, through the integration of diverse companies and work cultures. In this regard, the Issuer considers that a unified business culture is important for meeting the objectives set by the Company and the market. Orbia has established a unified mission, vision, values, and Code of Ethics that guide the actions of all of its employees.\n\n## i. Main activity\n\nOrbia is a Mexican public corporation located in the Americas, Europe and in some countries in Asia and Africa. Orbia is a leading provider of products and solutions in multiple sectors, from the construction, infrastructure, agriculture and irrigation, health, transportation, telecommunications, and energy and petrochemical sectors, among others. It is one of the world's largest producers of plastic pipes, fittings and irrigation drippers, as well as fluorite.\n\nOrbia employs more than 24,400 people in 50 countries in which it has 119 production plants, concessions for the exploitation of 2 fluorite mines in Mexico, 8 training academies, and 19 research and development centers. It generated sales of $9.6 billion in 2022.\n\nWith more than 50 years of history and more than 40 years listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange, Orbia applies a business model based on vertical integration, organic growth and strategic acquisitions through which it has direct access to raw materials and its own technology, allowing it to compete in a global environment. As a result, Orbia offers a wide range of materials, products, solutions, and finished products that contribute to the success of its customers and improve people's quality of life.\n\nCompetitive Advantages",

        "page_content": "Orbia focuses on creating value for its stakeholders, including its shareholders, customers, suppliers, communities in which it operates and employees through the development and continuous improvement of its products and services, starting with its basic raw materials. The main competitive advantages are as follows:\n\n## Vertically integrated operations with direct access to raw materials that create economies of scale and reduce operating expenses\n\nOrbia's Polymer Solutions business group is partially integrated with its primary raw material, ethylene, enabling an endto-end production chain from salt extraction to the manufacturing of plastic compounds. Orbia has facilities for salt production  for  industrial  consumption,  as  well  as  for  the  production  of  ethylene,  chlorine,  caustic  soda,  and  their derivatives, including VCM, EDC, and specialty chemicals. The company also produces PVC for general purpose and specialty resins, as well as compounds. Furthermore, the business is integrated with one of the main raw materials used in the manufacture of plasticizers: phthalic anhydride.\n\nFluorinated Solutions is the only fluorine company in the world with a vertically integrated value chain, from the extraction of fluorite, through hydrofluoric acid, to the production and sale of aluminum trifluoride (AlF3), refrigerant gases, medical propellants and fluorinated battery materials in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.\n\nThe main raw materials of the Building and Infrastructure, Connectivity Solutions and Precision Agriculture business groups are PVC resin, polyethylene and, to a lesser extent, propylene. These are supplied at the best price available on the market, either through purchases from third parties or through vertical integration with the Polymer Solutions business  group in  the  case  of  PVC,  which  represents  an  important  competitive  advantage,  particularly  in  times  of shortages such as during the latter half of 2020 and the first half of 2021.\n\n## Leading positions in PVC and plastic pipe markets in Latin America and Europe and the global fluorite market\n\nOrbia is a top-tier player in the global chemical industry, manufacturing both general purpose and specialty PVC resins. The Company is the largest producer of specialty PVC resins and the sixth producer of general purpose PVC resins worldwide. The Company believes that the primary markets for such products in the infrastructure and construction industries could experience sustained growth in over the long term.\n\nThe emerging markets in which Orbia's Building and Infrastructure and Polymer Solutions business groups sells its main products enjoy attractive growth projections in infrastructure and construction due to a significant housing deficit, insufficient infrastructure, lack of access to water and sanitation, electricity, and other factors. In developed countries, Orbia's businesses  address  the  challenges  to  maintain  and  improve  transport,  water,  electricity,  and telecommunications networks extensively and to address the impacts of climate change.\n\nGlobal demand for PVC continues to be stronger compared to global supply, leading to high-capacity utilization in the industry. PVC demand is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.6% from 2022 to 2030. Additionally, Orbia has a strong presence in the American, European, and Asian markets due to its unique position within the Fluorinated Solutions business group. The Issuer has the concession rights for the exploitation and extraction in Mexico from the world's largest fluorite mine, and has facilities in Mexico, United States, the United Kingdom and Japan for the production of hydrofluoric acid and downstream products such as aluminum trifluoride (AlF3), refrigerant gases, medical propellants and fluorinated battery materials. The Company's global positioning is allowing it to expand into high-value, high-growth applications that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable the world's rapid transition to sustainable energy.\n\n## Orbia's  proven  ability  to  integrate  and  operate  acquired  companies  throughout  the  Americas,  Europe,  the Middle East, Asia and Africa\n\nSince  2003,  Orbia  has  grown  rapidly  by  integrating  over  30  acquired  businesses.  Successful  acquisitions  have contributed to the significant growth of Orbia's net sales and EBITDA, making it a leader in the industries in which it operates.\n\nIn this time, Orbia's profile has changed considerably, from a company focused solely on commodities and chemical products, to a company that increasingly provides innovative and specialty products, which has increased its resilience in the face of constant changes and challenges in the global economy.\n\n## A management team with extensive industry experience\n\nOrbia's key executives have extensive experience in leadership positions in top-tier global companies, each with more than  10  years'  experience  in  similar  industries  and  more  than  20  years  of  professional  experience  overall.  The management team has a proven track record of operating successfully in the industry, and identifying and integrating strategic acquisitions to grow and strengthen the businesses.\n\nStrong relationship with major suppliers through long-term contracts",

        "page_content": "Orbia has established long-lasting relationships with its main suppliers through long-term product supply contracts, which allow it to ensure the supply of domestic and foreign raw materials and inputs. Due to its size and geographical footprint,  the  Company  has  positioned  itself  amongst  its  suppliers'  strategic  clients,  providing  the  Company  with  a competitive advantage over its competition.\n\n## Innovation through research, development and patented production processes\n\nOrbia has a product research and development program with people and facilities that allow it to innovate processes and products that are tailored to its customers' needs.\n\nThe Company's 19 research and technology centers located in Mexico, the U.S., the Netherlands, Italy, India, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and Israel focus on the development of new products to meet market demands and the alignment of processes to achieve safety and the optimization of its production chains.\n\nThe Company uses its own proprietary technology for its production processes , giving it the ability to develop unique designs that give it an advantage over its competition.   For example, in the Fluorinated Solutions business group, cutting-edge  technology  for  fluorite  purification  has  been  developed  in  the  hydrofluoric  acid  process  which  has succeeded in lowering the annual production cost of HF.\n\n## Climate Change Summary\n\nThe Company has carried out different analyses to determine the degree of exposure to the possible effects of climate change on its operations.\n\nThe effects of climate change identified within the different areas where Orbia operates or has market presence are desertification and drought, rising sea levels, changes in rainfall patterns, decreased water availability, deforestation and disease. These phenomena could affect operating results and financial position, among other factors, due to the need for additional investments to adapt operations to the new conditions, the increase in the price of supplies and energy,  the  closure  of  affected  operations  and  relocation  of  suppliers,  protection  measures  as  a  result  of  natural phenomena (for example: construction of dikes in marine installations, flood or fire protection) and the relocation of facilities to sites with more favorable conditions and higher environmental regulatory requirements.\n\nSince the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that extreme weather events will tend to grow in intensity and number, Orbia has been designing contingency plans that seek to normalize operations as soon as possible. Redundant transportation options, different routes and logistic means or emergency inventories are some specific areas that are considered in the plans. If Orbia manages to operate with minimal disruption during such events, it will have a clear advantage over competitors that lack these measures.\n\nPlease refer to the Risk Factors section for more details regarding the potential business impacts from severe weather events.\n\nIn addition to the consideration of the risks derived from climate change that can have negative impacts on operations, climate change also presents certain opportunities that align well with Orbia's business model as follows:\n\n- a. Low Impact and resilient operations\n- o Continually identify ways to decarbonize by optimizing manufacturing processes, transitioning to lowcarbon and renewable energy sources, and exploring opportunities in carbon capture and hydrogen. In  parallel,  Orbia's  sites  are  adapting  to  the  physical  risks  of  climate  change,  including  changing weather patterns, as well as business interruption and social disruption.\n- b. Solutions to promote a climate resilient economy:\n- o Orbia's  business  groups  are  constantly  developing  products  and  services  with  better  environmental performance that help its clients make measurable progress against their own climate change goals. The Company's solutions contribute to urban and rural resilience and support the transition to a low carbon and  circular  economy,  including  materials  and  products  that  promote  alternative  energy,  resource efficiency and green buildings. More details are available in the Orbia Impact Report.\n- c. Driving new business for a 'net zero' world:\n- o Orbia's  culture  encourages  the  exploration  of  new  technologies,  companies  and  strategic  acquisition opportunities, investing human and financial capital to support new business models that will have a longterm positive impact. Climate Tech is a focus area of strategic investments made through Orbia Ventures, its corporate venture capital fund.",

        "page_content": "among others. The Vinyl, Compounds and Plasticizing businesses, which comprise the Polymer Solutions business group, represent 38% of Orbia's total sales, including inter-company sales. The largest customer represents only 1.1% of sales, so there is no dependency on any one particular customer. As such, the loss of any one customer would not have a materially adverse effect on the company's financial situation or results of operations.\n\n## (a.2.5) Distribution Channels\n\nThe products of this process are marketed directly to the industries that use them as inputs for the production of other products. Sales of the Compounds and Plasticizers business segment are mainly made through the Company's sales force and through some limited use of distributors.\n\n## (a.2.6) Distribution Contracts\n\nPolymer Solutions business group products are typically sold directly to customers, but there are some distribution agreements for the commercialization of the products, especially in Europe, North America, and Asia.\n\n## (a.2.7) Cyclic behavior\n\nOrbia is the largest producer of general purpose PVC resins in Latin America and the sixth largest in the world. It is also the  largest  producer  of  specialty  PVC  resins  globally.  The  global  market  for  PVC  products  is  closely  tied  to  the construction industry, which is heavily influenced by the expansion or contraction of economies in different regions and countries.\n\nGlobal demand for PVC continues to be stronger compared to global supply, leading to high-capacity utilization in the industry. PVC demand is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.6% from 2022 to 2030 driven by strong construction and infrastructure activity globally, adding ~12 million tons of demand between now and 2030.\n\n## (a.2.8) Competitive Position\n\nThe Company maintains the strategy of vertically integrating its business to be competitive in the markets it serves, investing in projects that have the purposes of ensuring the national and international competitiveness of its products, as well as the development of specialized and differentiated products.\n\nIn the recessionary stages of the national and international economic cycle, demand may be reduced, and oversupply generated, affecting the international prices of the products manufactured by the Company. The products manufactured and traded by the Issuer compete in global markets and are therefore subject to the supply and demand trends of such markets and, therefore, to international prices that may affect profit margins, based on the efficiency levels of each producer. The vertical integration strategy has allowed the Company to consume a high percentage of intermediate products for final processes, reducing the impact of a decrease in the prices of basic products.\n\nThe supply and co-investment contract with OxyChem, and the acquisition of Policyd (a major resin producer in Mexico) have contributed to a strong position in the PVC market. Additionally through Vestolit, Orbia offers specialized products made to measure with high-impact suspension PVC resins (HIS-PVC). Orbia is the only producer that can offer this technology for rigid applications.\n\nThe Company is a leader in the general resins segment in Mexico and Colombia, a leader in the specialty resins segment in Europe and the U.S., and with is the largest producer of specialty resins in the world. The main competitors in the PVC market in Latin America and Europe are Shin-Etsu, Westlake, Formosa, INEOS, and OxyChem.\n\n## (a.1.9) Market Share\n\nIn 2022, Orbia's share of the Mexican PVC resin market was 44% The total PVC demand in Mexico was 536,000 metric tons in 2022.\n\n## PVC resin\n\nPVC is manufactured by polymerizing VCM, which is formed from the joint reaction of ethylene and chlorine. PVC resin has  multiple  applications  such  as  pipes  and  connectors  for  conveying  water  (particularly  for  use  in  housing  and sanitation), profiles, films and sheets, bottles, coating of wires and cables, and floors, among others.\n\nPVC is the third most used plastic in the world after polyethylene and polypropylene. According to Polymer Solutions business group market intelligence, global demand for PVC reached approximately 48.7 million metric tons in 2022, mainly in the construction sector. Pipes represent 45% of all PVC consumption globally.\n\nPVC is a versatile plastic that has numerous everyday applications, including pipes for drinking water and irrigation, coatings  for  electrical  cables,  profiles  for  constructing  windows,  doors,  facades,  and  entire  houses,  tiles,  flooring,",

Failure to implement it can result in the disappearance of non-integrated PVC producers. Moreover, the integration of finished products can affect this industry as well. Nonintegrated PVC producers are expected to face significant challenges when competing with integrated producers, who generally have much lower production costs.\n\nThe PVC industry is highly dependent on energy prices, especially natural gas, from which ethane is derived, the main feedstock for producing ethylene in North America. Meanwhile, crude oil, which is used to produce ethylene in Europe and Asia, is also affected by changes in energy prices, as it supplies different types of naphtha and hydrocarbons.\n\nApart from mature markets such as the United States and Western Europe, Orbia's Polymer Solutions business group focuses on expanding its presence in markets that are growing steadily, including regions with significant infrastructure and construction projects, such as Mexico, Colombia, India, Brazil, and Turkey.\n\nPVC applications in Mexico, Colombia, the United States, India, and Brazil are focused on pipes and fittings while in Western Europe and Turkey, profiles are the most relevant segment, with pipes and fittings ranking second, as shown in the following graphs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Orbia in its strategic association with OxyChem in Ingleside has been producing ethylene since February 2017.\n\n- \uf0b7 VCM Process: VCM is manufactured from chlorine and ethylene. These raw materials are reacted in a catalytic reactor  to  form  an  intermediate  product  called  dichloroethane  (Ethylene  Dichloride  or  EDC).  Purified dichloroethane undergoes thermal decomposition to produce VCM. VCM is produced at Polymer Solutions business group facilities in Germany.\n- \uf0b7 Vinyl Process: Orbia's Polymer Solutions business group employs two processes for PVC resin production: suspension  and  paste.  In  the  suspension  process,  VCM  is  combined  with  water  in  the  presence  of  a suspending agent in a reactor with agitation. The resulting mixture forms a suspension of VCM in an aqueous phase that remains stable until a VCM-soluble starter is added, initiating polymerization. In the paste process, VCM, water,  emulsifier,  and  catalyst  are  loaded  into  a  stainless-steel  reactor  and  stirred  under  controlled pressure and temperature.\n- Orbia's Polymer Solutions business group utilizes only the first two processes, with approximately 79% of its production obtained through suspension polymerization and 21% via paste polymerization.\n- \uf0b7 Compounds: Plastic resins are utilized in the production of compounds by combined them with other additives through a mixing process. This process ensures that the appropriate quantities are integrated into the entire mixture. After this stage, a dry blend is obtained and cooled to a specific temperature. Through various steps and processes, the blend is then converted into pellets suitable for sale.\n\n## (b)  Building and Infrastructure Business Group (Wavin)\n\nBuilding and Infrastructure is a global provider of plastic piping systems and innovative solutions for the construction and infrastructure industries, with a broad product portfolio.

It is the number one player in the Americas and Europe and has a significant presence in Asia Pacific. Fluorinated Solutions sells fluorite to a variety of customers in different industries, including major manufacturers of fluorinated  products,  some of  the  largest  steel mills in  the  world,  and  several of  the  largest  players in the  Latin American cement industry.\n\n## Products\n\nFluorite is produced and consumed in two grades: metallurgical grade and acid grade.\n\nMetallurgical grade, or Metspar, is mineral with a certain natural concentration of fluorine that varies depending on the application. It is a crucial raw material in the production of steel and cement. Metspar enables the removal of impurities, especially sulfur, when added to slag to produce stainless and low carbon steels. It is also a valuable additive in the production of clinker for the cement industry, increasing productivity and product performance. Metspar is a key additive to quality production of steel and cement with lower carbon footprints.\n\nConcentrated fluorite or Acid Grade, has a minimum concentration of 97%, and is obtained through flotation processes from mineral ores with a lower initial concentration. It is primarily used throughout the world to produce hydrofluoric acid, the chemical precursor to most fluorinated products.\n\n## Plants and mines\n\n(See Section 'B \"The Issuer\", item 'X \"Description of its Main Assts\", of this Annual Report).\n\nFluorinated Solutions operates several mining locations in Mexico. Mainly from two locations in the state of San Luis Potos\u00ed, Fluorinated Solutions' mineral production is three times that of the second largest producer of fluorite.\n\nEnvironmental and sustainability are strongly integrated into Fluorinated Solutions' plans for mineral extraction and processing  to  ensure  that  its  environmental  and  social  responsibility  goals  are  achieved.  The  use  of  screening equipment for Metspar has enabled better utilization of the mineral resource, and significant investments have been made in Acid Grade processing to use substantially less water per metric ton produced and go to paste or dry-related instead of the traditional wet-related industry practice.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nThe main suppliers of raw materials for the fluorite operations in Mexico are the National Water Commission (water), Iberdrola and the Federal Electricity Commission (electric energy) and Pemex Transformaci\u00f3n Industrial (natural gas).\n\nSales and marketing",

Six countries, China, Mexico, Mongolia, South Africa, Vietnam and Spain consistently account for more than 90% of the world fluorite production.   World fluorite production is shown in the chart below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: HCA Consulting and internal analysis (2022)\n\nThe dynamics of the fluorite market changed significantly in 2018, as China, the largest producer by country, went from being a net exporter to a net importer of fluorite. However, in 2022, the world fluorite market had to adjust to a shifting supply structure, as China, the largest producer in the world, made large spot sales of acid grade fluorite (acidspar) and ended the year as a net exporter of that grade. Metallurgical grade fluorite (metspar) trade between China and the rest of the world experienced less changes.\n\nIn the medium and long term, several external analysts and internal projections agree that the total global demand for fluorite will continue to grow faster than GDP due to several megatrends, most notably the transition to clean energy and increased digitalization.\n\n## (e.2) Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) and Aluminum Trifluoride (AIF3)\n\nHydrofluoric acid (HF), also known as hydrogen fluoride, provides the primary source of fluorine, which forms the basis of a vast range of industrial, pharmaceutical, polymer, electronics, petroleum, personal care, agrochemical and fine chemical products. Refrigerant gases, fluoropolymers & fluoro-elastomers, and aluminum trifluoride are some of the major applications where HF is directly used. The volume of HF consumed for materials used in lithium-ion batteries is significantly increasing, and it is expected to be a main growth driver for HF demand in the coming years. Fluorinated Solutions is one of the leading producers of hydrofluoric acid.\n\nAluminum trifluoride  is  an  essential  element  for  the  manufacture  of  aluminum,  and  is  produced  by  the  reaction  of hydrofluoric acid (HF) with aluminum hydroxide. From its Matamoros plant, Fluorinated Solutions supplies several of the main global aluminum producers.\n\n## Products\n\nHydrofluoric acid is produced by reacting Acid Grade fluorite with sulfuric acid. Once produced, the hydrofluoric acid is subjected to various stages of distillation until it reaches the required purity to meet the high standards demanded by the market. Sulfuric acid is made by Fluorinated Solutions starting from sulfur, which is converted into sulfuric acid once it comes into contact with air at high temperatures and with water.\n\nHydrofluoric acid is mainly used in (1) the manufacture of refrigerant gases and propellant gases for air conditioning, refrigerators,  freezers  and  medical  applications  for  treatment  of  respiratory  diseases,  (2)  the  manufacture  of fluoropolymers, (3) the manufacture of aluminum trifluoride, (4)  the production of fluorinated salts, which are used in energy storage, (5) the manufacture of high octane gasolines, (6) cleaning of metallic surfaces such as the pickling of",

It is  mainly  used  as  a  flux  in  the  aluminum  smelting  by  fused-salt  electrolysis.  It  is  critical  for  economically  feasible production at almost all aluminum smelters around the world.\n\n## Plants\n\n(See Section 2, \"The Issuer\", item x, \"Description of its Main Assets\", of this Annual Report).\n\nFluorinated Solutions owns and operates one of the largest HF plants in the world, located in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The plant is strategically located to have easy access to its main raw materials in Mexico and exports 97% of its production of hydrofluoric acid, mainly to the USA, as well as 100% of its production of aluminum trifluoride. The Matamoros plant is operated with the highest stewardship standards and in compliance with all applicable regulations. Koura has invested in systems to achieve low SO2 emission in the sulfuric acid production.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nThe main raw materials used in the production of HF are acid grade fluorite and sulfur. Fluorite is supplied from Koura's mine in San Luis Potosi.\n\nSales and marketing of hydrofluoric acid (HF) and aluminum trifluoride\n\nThe  Company  has  several  long-term  HF  supply  contracts  with  its  major  customers  in  North  America.  Aluminum trifluoride is sold to customers through purchase orders or contracts.\n\nFluorinated Solutions Business Group HF and AlF3 Market Share\n\nThe Company estimates that global demand for hydrofluoric acid (HF) in 2022 amounted to 2.7 million metric tons, including just under 1 million metric tons used as a feedstock to produce AlF3. In 2022, global demand for HF was still affected by zero COVID policies in China, but prices recovered compared to the previous year.\n\nThe chart below shows the breakdown of global HF production capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Internal Analysis, HCA Consulting 2022), Roskill Consulting Fluorite Report 2022)\n\nGlobal production capacity of hydrofluoric acid (thousands of metric tons from 2020 to 2022)\n\n|               | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| China         | 2,065  | 2,017  | 2,017  |\n| North America | 212    | 220    | 220    |",

Excluding China, Fluorinated Solutions was the largest producer of HF in the world during 2022 followed by Honeywell, including its US and German plants.\n\nThe majority of Fluorinated Solutions' HF production is exported to the US where it is consumed for the production of fluorocarbons and other applications. The Company competes in the HF market with some major Chinese producers, Honeywell, Chemours, and Solvay. During the last few years Fluorinated Solutions has moved towards increasing its internal HF consumption in downstream products like refrigerant gases, battery materials and other value-added fluorine applications.\n\nAlF3 total consumption was around 1.2 million metric tons in 2022. China consumed 59%, followed by the Middle East with 8%, India and Russia with 7% each.  Koura serves approximately 6% of the global demand for AlF3, either directly or through its distribution network. It is the leader in the Americas and has a strong presence in India, the Middle East and other regions.\n\nCovid-19 affected AlF3 demand in 2020 and the first half of 2021, but the market rebounded in the second half of 2021 following the trends in primary aluminum metal markets. Aluminum markets then faced macroeconomic headwinds in 2022,  with  the  prolonged  war  in  Ukraine,  rising  energy  prices,  low  gas  availability,  high  inflation  and  weakening downstream demand all dampening the outlook for primary aluminum production. The aluminum market estimated a market decline of 300,000 metric tons in 2022, down from 1.6 million metric tons in 2021. Aluminum metal demand will remain robust in the future due to its increased use in more applications, including electric vehicles, and AlF3 demand is also expected to remain strong.\n\n## (e.3) Refrigerant Gases and Medical Propellants\n\nFluorinated or fluorocarbon hydrocarbons are aliphatic compounds that have fluorine atoms or a combination of carbon and fluorine in their structure.  They were originally developed in the 1930s and are widely used for refrigeration, air conditioning, aerosol sprays, foam blowing, fire protection, and solvents. Both pure aqueous solutions and mixtures of fluorocarbons are common in these applications.\n\nFluorinated Solutions is one of the world's leading suppliers of refrigerant gases, mostly marketed under the Klea\u00ae brand. It sells both directly, especially to OEMs, (original equipment manufacturers) and through its distribution network, mainly to the aftermarket segment. It is a leader in Europe and a major player in America, Japan and India.\n\nHFA medical propellants are used to safely deliver a variety of medications in aerosol form, including use in MDIs (metered dose inhalers) for the treatment of asthma and other lung diseases. Fluorinated Solutions produces and sells the product to the regulated medical and pharmaceutical market under its ZEPHEX\u00ae brand, the global brand of medical propellant gases contained in approximately 75% of inhalers produced worldwide.\n\nThe total volume of fluorocarbon refrigerants in 2022 was estimated to be 1.2 million metric tons. China remains the largest producer (73%), followed by the US (21%).\n\nThe total volume of medical propellants in 2022 totaled around 11,000 metric tons. Koura supplies more than 70% of the world's needs for medical propellants. Other producers in China and India also produce medical propellants.\n\nThe demand for medical propellants increased during Covid-19, as certain MDIs were used in the critical care of Covid19 patients. Consumption remained stable during 2021 and 2022, and is expected to continue to grow in the future due to megatrends such as urbanization and the growth of the population with certain medical conditions such as asthma and COPD.\n\n## Products\n\nFluorocarbons combine good thermodynamic properties with a safe nature (low toxicity and  flammability) and noncorrosiveness . They have unique production processes, but all require HF as a key feedstock. In the last decade, the production and demand of Fluorocarbons has been significantly transformed by environmental legislation, which has focused on eliminating the production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to protect the ozone layer and ultimately reduce",

        "page_content": "the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) to reduce global warming. As the use of HFCs is phased out around the world, new generations of refrigerants are being introduced to accelerate the transition to low-carbon solutions. It is important to distinguish between non-feedstock and feedstock applications of fluorocarbons, as the production of some CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs for feedstock use is still permitted with appropriate measures to minimize environmental impact.\n\nFluorinated Solutions is committed to the development of Low Global Warming Potential (LGWP) refrigerant gases, investing significantly in research and development to design a new portfolio that will provide a material improvement on currently available products, benefiting industry and the environment alike, on both a mid and long term basis. Some new LGWP products have already been introduced since 2021, such as Klea \u00ae R473A, R456A, R448A and LFR3, with several more in the pipeline for the next few years.\n\nFluorine-based  medical  propellants  are  used  to  safely  deliver  a  variety  of  medications  in  aerosol  form.  They  are produced by purifying certain HFCs to achieve a medical grade according to pharmaceutical specifications and cGMP standards.\n\nAs  HFC  use  is  being  phased  out  around  the  world,  new  generations  of  medical  propellants  are  being  sought  to accelerate  the  transition  to  low  carbon  solutions.  Koura  is  leading  the  industry  in  this  transition  to  LGWP  medical propellants with the development and commercialization of HFA-152a.\n\n## Plants\n\n(See Section 2, \"The Issuer\", item x, \"Description of its Main Assets\", of this Annual Report).\n\nFluorinated Solutions has two refrigerant production plants, one in St. Gabriel, Louisiana, and the other in Mihara, Japan, for 134a, an HFC used primarily for automotive and stationary refrigeration. Fluorinated Solutions refrigerant portfolio is complemented through alliances and supply agreements with other Fluorocarbon producers.\n\nFluorinated Solutions has a medical grade purification plant for 134a at Runcorn in the UK. This facility is the only one of its kind to have received an FDA audit as well as UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) inspections for cGMP compliance. Fluorinated Solutions sells medical propellants under its ZEPHEX\u00ae brand, supplying most of the world's pharmaceutical companies.\n\nIn  2020,  Fluorinated  Solutions  announced  the  commissioning  of  a  new  Zephex\u00ae  152a  cGMP  medical  propellant production facility, also in Runcorn, which started operations in April 2022.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nThe main raw material used in the production of refrigerant gases is HF, which comes from Koura's plant in the city of Matamoros for production of refrigerant gases at its plant in St. Gabriel in the state of Louisiana, USA, and is mainly imported from third parties for production of refrigerant gases in the city of Mihara, Japan.\n\n## Sales and marketing of refrigerant gases\n\nFluorinated Solutions sells refrigerants worldwide through regional distributors, key to the aftermarket, mainly without a contract or with a short-term contract. It sells directly to OEM's on short- term contracts.\n\nFluorinated Solutions has one of the largest shares of HFC consumption within the European regulation of fluorinated gases. However, this historic legislation, aimed at progressively reducing the consumption of HFCs, is compromised by significant illegal imports of HFC products. Fluorinated Solutions actively participates in the European Fluorocarbons Technical Committee (EFTCC) as one of the member companies working collectively to fight this illegal HFC business and preserve the intent of F-Gas regulation. In recent years, enforcement of these regulations has increased and as a result, there are currently fewer illegal imported products appearing in the European market.\n\nMedical propellants are sold in bulk directly to pharmaceutical companies under contract and packaged for smaller customers through agents and distributors without contract.\n\n## Main customers\n\nThe Fluorinated Solutions Business Group's refrigerant and medical propellants products represents about 5.0% of Orbia's total sales. No single Fluorinated Solutions refrigerant and medical propellants customer represents more than 1% of the Company's total sales and, therefore, there is no dependence on one or more customers, since the loss of such customers would not have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's results of operations or financial position.",

Fluorinated Solutions' strong regional presence in North America and its large HFC consumption quota in Europe also represent significant competitive advantages. In medical propellants, Fluorinated Solutions supplies 70% of the world's needs for medical propellants.\n\nThe announced investments and development in LGWP refrigerant gases and next generation medical propellants will contribute to sustain and expand this competitive position in the future.\n\n## (e.4) Battery Materials\n\nThe journey to net-zero emissions is creating one of the biggest business opportunities to Orbia in the coming years, as it requires significant investments in capital, people, and technological development to effectively reduce carbon emissions. Energy storage applications, especially lithium-ion batteries, are critical enabling technologies in the global conversion of fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.\n\nFluorinated Solutions is developing materials, technologies and solutions that improve battery performance, cost and safety  while  ensuring  a safe  and  reliable battery  supply  chain. It is increasingly  becoming  an important  provider of fluorinated  products to the  energy storage industry,  working  with industry  partners  and researchers to  develop  and manufacture a wide range of advanced fluorine materials including electrolyte salts, binders and high-performance electrolyte additives for lithium-ion batteries.\n\n## Products\n\nIn 2021, Fluorinated Solutions launched its Koflyte\u00ae product line of fluorinated additives and co-solvents and acquired Silatronix, a US company with expertise in fluorosilane additives for Lithium-ion batteries and an industry-wide reputation for developing innovative solutions that deliver improved battery safety and performance in a range of applications, from electric vehicles to stationary, grid-scale storage.\n\nDuring 2022, Fluorinated Solutions signed a license agreement with PrimeStar Technologies and InnoVent Technology for fluoropolymer technology used in the production of solar panels, wind turbines and lithium-ion batteries.\n\nFluorinated Solutions is also leading the technology development for recycled battery materials, having led investment rounds in Ascend Elements (formerly Battery Resourcers), a closed-loop lithium-ion battery recycler and manufacturer. On February 15, 2022, Ascend Elements and Koura announced the launch of a proprietary process technology yielding battery-grade graphite material from spent lithium-ion batteries, with Fluorinated Solutions serving as a development partner  to  Ascend  Elements  to  scale  the  company's  technology  for  commercial  production.  Ascend  Elements' technology is considered a game-changer in the battery recycling and sustainable materials spaces, as it delivers yields of over 99.9% pure graphite and energy capacity and cycle life on par with virgin battery-grade graphite anode material, The process also extends recycling and manufacturing throughput beyond cathode active materials to anode materials as well.\n\nOn November 3, 2022, Solvay and Orbia announced their entry into a joint venture framework agreement to create a partnership for the production of suspension-grade polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The total investment  of the joint venture is estimated to be approximately $850 million, and is expected to be funded in part by a grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy of $178 million to Solvay to build a facility in Augusta, Georgia. Solvay and Orbia intend to use two production sites, one for raw materials and the other for finished product, located in the southeastern United States. Both plants are expected to be fully operational by 2026. Orbia is uniquely positioned to support the PVDF supply chain with its three key raw materials: HF, VCM and chlorine. Commencement of the joint venture is subject to finalizing and entering into definitive agreements between the parties and satisfaction of customary conditions, including obtaining regulatory approvals. Koura also obtained a technology license for the production of emulsion-grade PVDF and is currently building a pilot plant.",

        "page_content": "In 2021, Fluorinated Solutions received an award of $3.1 million in research funding by the US Department of Energy (DOE) to  support  the  development  of  fluorinated  electrolytes  to  extend  the  operating  temperature  range  of  Li-ion batteries while improving safety and fast charge capability for transportation applications.\n\nIn October 2022, Fluorinated Solutions received a $100 million award from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as part of the first set of projects funded by the President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and the electrical grid and for materials and components currently imported from other countries. The grant will enable Koura to build the first U.S. manufacturing plant for LiPF6 on the grounds of Koura's  existing  fluorochemical  production  site  in  St.  Gabriel,  Louisiana.  Once  operational,  the  proposed  plant  will produce up to 10,000MT of LiPF6 per year, which is sufficient to support domestic production of more than one million full electric vehicles annually.\n\n## Industrial Processes\n\nThe different industrial processes of the Fluorinated Solutions Business Group are described below:\n\n## Fluorite Process\n\nFollowing the long-term life of mine plan, Fluorite ore is extracted, along with some impurities such as carbonates and silicates.\n\nFor Metallurgical Grade, the ore extracted from the mine is screened, crushed and sorted according to the desired specifications.\n\nFor Acid Grade, the crushed ore is fed into flotation plants, where the fluorite is concentrated and the impurities are separated.\n\n## Hydrofluoric Acid Process\n\nHydrofluoric acid is produced by reacting Acid Grade fluorite with sulfuric acid. Once produced, the hydrofluoric acid is subjected to various stages of distillation until it reaches the required purity to meet the high standards demanded by the market.\n\nSulfuric acid is obtained from the oxidation of sulfur into sulfur dioxide SO2, to convert it into sulfur trioxide SO3 and subsequently obtain sulfuric acid.\n\n## Aluminum Trifluoride Process\n\nThe production of aluminum trifluoride is based on hydrofluoric acid, which evaporates and overheats before being injected in gaseous form into a pair of double bed fluidized reactors. In the reactors, it contacts and reacts with aluminum hydroxide, which is in solid form, to produce aluminum trifluoride. This product leaves the reactor in solid form at high temperature (700\u00b0C) so it must be cooled before being sent to storage and transport.\n\n## Refrigerant Gas Process\n\nRefrigerant gases have unique production processes, but all require HF as a key feedstock. 134a is produced by the fluoridation  of  trichloroethylene  with  hydrofluoric  acid.  Once  the  reaction  takes  place,  the  hydrochloric  acid  that  is produced as a by-product must be removed and the product must be distilled.\n\nFluorine-based  propellants  are  produced  by  purifying  certain  HFCs  to  achieve  a  medical  grade  according  to pharmaceutical specifications and cGMP standards.\n\nIn total, Fluorinated Solutions has eight operating plants established in Mexico, the United Kingdom, the United States, Taiwan and Japan, of which 6 are certified in accordance with ISO-9001, 4 with ISO-14001, 3 with OHSAS 18001, 1 with  TS  16949,  1  with  Clean  Industry  Certification  by  the  Federal  Attorney's  Office  for  Environmental  Protection (Mexico), 1 with Integral Responsibility certification by ANIQ and 3 with ISRS (International Safety Rating System) levels 5  to  7.

Orbia's largest individual customer represented 5.5% of its total net sales in 2022, so there is no dependence on any one or various customers, since the loss of one of these would not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## v. Applicable Legislation and Tax Situation\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which it operates.\n\n## Orbia\n\nThe shares representative of the Issuer's capital stock are publicly traded on the BMV, and are therefore subject to the following laws and regulations: (i) the Stock Market Act in Mexico; (ii) the General Provisions Applicable to Securities Issuers and Other Participants in the Securities Market issued by the CNBV; (iii) the General Provisions Applicable to Entities  and  Issuers  Supervised  by  the  National  Banking  and  Securities  Commission  (CNBV)  and  that  Engage Independent Audit Services for their Basic Financial Statements; (iv) the Internal Regulations of the BMV; and (v) the General Business Organizations Act.\n\n## Business groups\n\nThe  Company's  five  business  groups  operate  in  50  countries  and  are  subject  to  the  following  general  laws  and regulations in all of them:\n\n- \uf0b7 Regulations of an international, national and local nature, primarily in financial aspects, monetary policies and access to the currency markets. They must comply with administrative requirements to obtain permissions to operate  facilities,  plants,  and  to  import  raw  materials  and  finished  products.  They  must  comply  with  labor regulations at some sites that are influenced by unions and environmental regulations.\n- \uf0b7 Laws regulating  health,  safety,  environment,  unfair  competition  and  monopolies,  municipal  construction  and zoning, local  licenses  and  permits  for  facilities. With  respect to international  commerce,  customs  regulations, control  of imports  and  exports, specifically  related  to  quotas, tariffs  and  anti-dumping  protections,  as  well  as government  policies  and  regulations  related  to  commerce,  product  sales,  manufacturing  operations  and relationships with customers, distributors and competitors.\n- \uf0b7 Finally,  all  of  the  business  groups  comply  with the laws  against  corruption  such  as  the  U.S.  Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and other similar laws.\n\nSpecifically, some of Orbia's business groups may be subject to specific government laws and regulations. Below is a summary of the effects that these laws and regulations have on the development of the Company's business, for each one of its business groups:\n\n## 1. Polymer Solutions (Vestolit and Alphagary)\n\nPolymer Solutions' business is subject to environmental laws and government regulations that require it to carry out its supply, production, transportation, and disposal operations of raw materials and finished products in accordance with a broad range of regulations which are strict; non-compliance can lead to financial losses for the business group.  These laws and regulations include, among others, environmental standards, strict labor regulations (LatAm), and very strict industrial safety requirements. Regulatory requirements apply in 6 main jurisdictions: Germany, the USA, Mexico, Asia, India, the UK, and Colombia.\n\nIn particular, Mexico and Colombia, governments are enacting stricter regulations, and critical individuals in regulating entities are changing.\n\nAdditionally, the current Ukraine-Russia Confrontation may generate new prohibitions or trade sanctions.",

Fluorinated Solutions (Koura)\n\nFluorinated Solutions operates mining projects located in Mexico and that are subject to various laws and government regulations on various matters, including, but not limited to: exploration, development, production, payment of taxes and royalties for extraction, environmental aspects, labor standards, maintenance of claims and mining concessions, land use, territorial claims of local inhabitants, use of water, waste disposal, power generation, protection and remediation of the environment, claims for the conservation of historical and cultural resources, industrial safety, occupational health, and the handling and disposal of toxic substances and explosives.\n\nThe Group's chemical, medical propellants and battery materials operations are located in Mexico, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. The manufacturing processes of these products are subject to the specific health and safety regulations of each country. Koura's refrigerant products are also governed by various environmental laws and regulations. Worldwide, many countries have signed the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which addresses climate  change, limiting  and  progressively  reducing  the impact  of  global  warming caused  by this class  of  products. Regional blocs of countries and some individual countries have also adopted their own regulations in terms of control mechanisms and phase-down schedule. The company also produces a medical propellant that is subject to countryspecific medical regulatory controls, such as those of the US Food and Drug Administration, the EU and the UK. The EU and some other jurisdictions are currently consulting on the definition and possible future control of substances known collectively as PerFluoroAlky Substances (PFAS). Although Fluorinated Solutions does not produce or use PFAS chemicals as they are commonly defined, the company monitors legislative and regulatory processes that may affect its business.\n\n## 3. Connectivity Solutions (Dura-Line)\n\nConnectivity Solutions is present and has operations in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions. In the normal course of its business, Connectivity Solutions is regulated by the general government laws and standards mentioned in the paragraphs above.\n\nThis business group does not report any specific additional standards that affected the development of its operations in 2022.\n\n## 4. Building and Infrastructure (Wavin)\n\nBuilding and Infrastructure is a company with presence and operations in the EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Latin America regions. In the normal course of business, Building and Infrastructure is subject to the general government laws and regulations listed above at the beginning of this Section.\n\nBesides  the  foregoing,  this  business  group  does  not  report  any  additional  specific  standards  that  affected  the development of its operations during 2022.\n\n## 5. Precision Agriculture (Netafim)\n\nPrecision Agriculture is an Israeli company with presence and operations in the AMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. In the regular course of its business, it is subject to general government laws and regulations as described in the preceding paragraphs. However, it is also regulated by specific regulations that have an effect on the operations that Precision Agriculture carries out:\n\n- \uf0b7 Agricultural activity is subject to environmental laws or regulations, which may impact the operations of end users and/or the demand for Precision Agriculture products. The adoption of new environmental laws may require Precision Agriculture to remove or recycle its products or impose obligations related to such climate change concerns on its customers. It may not be possible to recover the potential costs associated with the development of such regulatory scenarios, and therefore could adversely impact the business.\n- \uf0b7 Precision Agriculture operates in countries or regions where laws criminalizing bribery and bribery are strictly enforced. Such laws may conflict with local customs and practices, particularly in markets irrigation of emerging countries, thus impeding the business.\n\n## Income Tax\n\nIncome tax (ISR by its acronym in Spanish) is based on taxable profit, which differs from the  profit reported in the consolidated statements of profits, primarily due to non-deductible expenses, non-taxable income, and other reconciling items pursuant to applicable tax laws. The Company's current tax liability is calculated using the tax rates enacted or substantially approved at the end of the reporting period in the countries in which the Company and its subsidiaries",

The Company maintains a positive relationship with the unions, which is characterized by mutual understanding and support to achieve significant changes for the Group's companies. Unionized workers of the subsidiary companies are affiliated to  the  corresponding unions  and  labor centers  in  each  locality.  In  addition,  each  plant  has  a  specific  function  that coordinates the labor relationships for that site.\n\nOrbia administers its labor relations in accordance with applicable labor legislation in the locations in which it operates and by use of a set of global policies, procedures, and Code of Ethics.\n\nThe Company has transformed its talent management model to implement best market practices to attract, retain, evaluate, develop, compensate, and recognize its talent.

Specifically,  geographic  salary  market  data  and macroeconomic indicators are reviewed periodically to ensure that the Company remains competitive.\n\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company have defined benefit plans funded for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries. Defined benefit plans are administered by a fund legally independent of the Company. There is a pension fund board which is responsible for investment policy in relation to the fund's assets.\n\nIn its Code of Ethics, Orbia includes its position regarding diversity, establishing it as an important pillar for the success and strengthening of the Company. The diversity and inclusion policy launched in 2018 aims to create a culture that incorporates different ideas and perspectives to enable its employees to have the opportunity to perform to their fullest capacity.  Orbia  hopes  to  achieve  this  objective  by  acting  in  accordance  with  applicable  legislation  and  fostering communication, dialogue and collaboration.\n\n## vii.

        "page_content": "Orbia has defined a roadmap that outlines the instruments needed for accelerating  its pathway to become net-zero (scope 1 & 2). This includes replacing electricity sources based on fossil fuels with renewables, phasing out coal-based equipment, increasing energy efficiency, and doubling efforts to understand how to transition and incorporate the use of hydrogen and carbon capture technologies at its operations. This is a work in progress that will incorporate growth in future versions. Orbia acknowledges that a net-zero pathway requires courage to think in innovative ways and implies a robust transformation of how it produces things today. The Company is committed to facing this challenge with balanced growth and profitability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrbia's business groups have a collective focus on ensuring food security, reducing water scarcity, reinventing the future of cities and homes, connecting communities to data and information services, and expanding access to health and wellbeing through the provision of advanced materials, specialty products and innovative human-centered solutions. Orbia has identified five key challenges its businesses can contribute to;\n\n- 1. Sanitation & Water Management\n- 2. Health & Well-Being\n- 3. Food & Water Security\n- 4. Information Access & Connectivity\n- 5. Climate Resilience & Decarbonization\n\nIn order to assess how and to what extent the Company's solutions contribute to the SDGs and their targets, it has carried out an initial identification and evaluation of the value delivered by Orbia's products and solutions, using existing methodologies and definitions as a basis. This process allowed the Company to link its solution portfolio to the SDGs by identifying the revenues of its products that contribute either directly or indirectly to the goals.\n\nIn 2019, the Company completed its first climate-focused risk assessment, including 12 sites across 3 business groups in six countries. The main findings of the analysis were the following:\n\nPhysical risks: The physical risk of Orbia's priority sites is low to medium. This is due to exposure to weather events such as cyclones, floods, fires, extreme temperatures and water stress.\n\nThe analysis was not limited to physical facilities; it also considered the impact on logistics and the flow of raw materials.\n\nMarket, technological and regulatory risks: In  addition  to  the  direct  effects  of  meteorological  phenomena,  other impacts on the business were analyzed regarding government or commercial regulations, new market rules or the emergence of technologies. Using a 2030 horizon, a greater exposure to these risks were projected, with some high business risks derived from a transition to a low-carbon economy. They are likely to include market pressure to use lowcarbon materials, broader regulation of global carbon prices, or increases in the cost of resources, primarily electricity and water by 2030. Higher water stress scenarios, for example, could affect water costs for the Company's operations. Such scenarios, in turn, can impact the supply chain or production processes from a continuity and cost standpoint.\n\nThe selected scenarios for assessing physical risks are those defined by the IPCC corresponding to both the loweremissions scenario (SSP1: Sustainability - Taking the Green Road) and the higher emissions scenario (SSP5: Fossil-",

        "page_content": "fueled Development). For transition risks, Orbia will use the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) climate scenarios. Results of this assessment will be published in its 2023 Impact Report.\n\nOpportunities : In addition to the consideration of risks resulting from climate change, opportunities for Orbia were also analyzed, such as solutions for resilience that allow adaptation to climate change or replacement of products by others with lower carbon footprint. Orbia already has a range of products that provide resilience to high rainfall, for example, or solutions to replace water piping systems or installation of fiber optic ducts, without affecting or minimizing the impact on traffic and operation of a city. It is also the leader in precision agriculture, which, due to the higher productivity per hectare  and  the  efficient  use  of  agrochemicals,  minimizes  the  growth  of  the  agricultural  frontier  and  therefore deforestation, while eliminating  or  minimizing  the  pollution  of  rivers  and  aquifers  by  runoff  and  leaching,  as  well  as greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, it has started an effort to replace propellant and refrigerant gases with others with a  lower greenhouse effect.\n\nWater is a fundamental part of the Company's operations, from the consumption of water in the extraction process and in its operations, to the solutions and products it provides for collection, distribution, sanitation        and irrigation. Therefore, all but one of Building and Infrastructure, Precision Agriculture and Connectivity Solutions plants have a closed circuit. 70% of sites in water-stress areas have a closed-loop system.\n\nPrecision  Agriculture  offers  solutions  for  precision  irrigation  systems  that  help  reduce  water  consumption  in  the agricultural sector which is responsible for about 70% of water consumption.\n\nThe Company's Building and Infrastructure group offers solutions for better water management as well as more efficient building solutions. As an example, its range of rainwater management products can prevent flooding or at least minimize impacts, while also contributing to help replenish urban water tables. In addition, its \"trenchless\" pipe renewal technology helps reduce losses in water distribution networks in large cities.\n\nFinally,  Fluorinated  Solutions  is  developing  products  to  improve  the  performance  and  reusability  of  power  storage batteries.\n\n## Awards, Certifications and Distinctions\n\nOrbia is proud of the recognition for its sustainability efforts and achievements it has received from outside organizations.

        "page_content": "On  August  30,  2022,  Orbia's  Building  and  Infrastructure  business  acquired  the  Bow  Plumbing  Group  ('Bow')  a manufacturer and seller of plastic pipes and fittings headquartered in Quebec and sales in the United States of America and Canada. Bow Plumbing Group Inc., is the defendant in a putative nationwide class action litigation commenced in 2021 in Federal District Court in the District of Alabama (Braswell, Roselyn v. BOW Plumbing Group, Inc.).  The plaintiffs in the case, all located in Alabama, are homeowners alleging that PEX piping manufactured by Bow and installed in their homes leaked as a result of manufacturing and design defects.  In addition to the Federal litigation, three other cases have been brought in Alabama state court, with plaintiffs located in the vicinity of Montgomery, Alabama.  The Federal and state litigations are being handled by Alabama counsel designated by Bow's insurers.\n\nWhile the gathering of evidence and analysis of the case are ongoing, an important near-term event in the case will be the court's decision whether to certify the plaintiffs as a class of similarly situated plaintiffs that is eligible to avail itself of the US Federal class action litigation process, which is currently expected to be made in the second half of 2023.\n\nFor additional details refer to section 3 Financial Reporting 'Contingent liabilities' for summary of all legal matters\n\n## xii.  Shares representing Capital Stock\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company does not have open positions in derivative instruments that can be settled in kind whose underlying assets are ORBIA* shares.\n\nIn the fiscal years 2022 and 2021, Orbia did not modify the number or amount of outstanding shares representing its share capital. The Company's share capital count was 2,010,000,000 shares.\n\nThe fixed portion of the Company's share capital is comprised of Class I registered shares with no right to withdrawal. The variable portion of the Company's share capital is comprised of Class II registered shares with no par value and may not exceed ten times the minimum fixed share capital.\n\nAt the Company's shareholders' meeting held on July 21, 2021, the shareholders agreed to cancel 90,000,000 Class II common  shares,  with  no  par  value,  which  represented  the  variable  portion  of  the  Company's  share  capital.  This cancellation did not result in a share capital decrease since the Company maintained the ownership of those shares as they had been repurchased from its own share capital.\n\nAn analysis of the Company's capital stock as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\n\n| December 31, 2022, and 2021   |                  |                               |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Subscribed capital            | Number of shares | Amount  (Millions of dollars) |\n| Class I                       | 308,178,735      | $37                           |\n| Class II                      | 1,701,821,265    | 219                           |\n| Total                         | 2,010,000,000    | $256                          |\n\n| December 31, 2020  Subscribed capital   | Number of shares   | Amount  (Millions of dollars)   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Class I                                 | 308,178,735        | $37                             |\n| Class II                                | 1,791,821,265      | 219                             |\n| Total                                   | 2,100,000,000      | $256                            |\n\n## xiii. Dividends\n\nDuring the last three years (2020, 2021, and 2022) Orbia has decreed the payment of dividends in cash, as follows:\n\n| General Shareholders'  Meeting   |   Dividend Declared in  millions of USD | Number of  Payments   | Payment  Dates                                                 |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mar-30-21                        |                                     210 | 4 payments            | Apr. 14, 2021, Jul. 14, 2021, Sept. 15, 2021 and  Dec 15, 2021 |",

( See Section 1, \"General Information,\" item c, \"Risk Factors,\" item c, \"Risk Factors Related to Securities Issued by the Company.\")\n\nThe amount and payment of Future Orbia dividends, if any, will be subject to applicable law and depend on a variety of factors that may be considered by the Board of Directors or shareholders, including future operating results, financial condition, capital requirements, investments in potential acquisitions or other growth opportunities, legal and contractual restrictions on current and future debt instruments and the ability to obtain funds from subsidiaries. Such factors may limit  the  ability  to  pay  future  dividends  and  may  be  considered  by  the  Board  of  Directors  in  recommending,  or  by shareholders in approving, the payment of future dividends.\n\nThere is no dividend payment policy, although in recent years Orbia has paid a dividend of approximately 15% of the EBITDA of the corresponding fiscal year. In its 2022 Investor Day, the Company stated an intent to pay a base dividend of $240 million annually going forward, with the intent to increase the amount as underlying income increases.\n\nThe Company's shareholders approved, at an Ordinary General Meeting held on December 2, 2019, the payment of a cash dividend in the amount of $180 million, in four payments. The first was on February 26, 2020, the second on May 27, the third on August 26 and the fourth on November 25, 2020.\n\nThe  Issuer's  General  Ordinary  Shareholders'  Meeting  held  on  March  30,  2021,  authorized  the  payment  of  a  cash dividend in the amount of $210 million payable in four installments in 2021, The first was on April 14, 2021, the second on July 14, the third on September 15 and the fourth on December 15, 2021. These dividends were distributed to the holders of the outstanding shares at each payment date during 2021, minus the amount corresponding to the shares of the share buyback program.\n\nOn April  1,  2022,  the  Company's  shareholders'  approved  the  payment  of  a  cash  dividend  of  $240  million  and  an extraordinary dividend of $60 million applied to retained earnings and the net taxable profits account (CUFIN, by its acronym in Spanish). These dividends were distributed to the holders of the outstanding shares at each payment date during 2022, minus the amount corresponding to the shares of the share buyback program.\n\nOn March 30, 2023, the Company's shareholders approved the payout of a cash dividend of $240 million applied to retained  earnings  and the  net taxable  profits  account  (CUFIN,  by its acronym in  Spanish).  These  dividends  will  be distributed in four equal installments to the holders of the outstanding shares, at each payment date during 2023, less the amount corresponding to the shares of the share buyback program. Dividend payout dates are to be determined by the Company's executive officers.",

Operating Results\n\nOrbia delivered revenue growth in 2022 vs. 2021 but macroeconomic challenges resulted in lower profitability. Orbia generated strong cash flow and maintained a strong balance sheet, demonstrating resilience in its businesses and robust long-term fundamentals.   2022 provided unique challenges for Orbia and the world at large, marked by the war in Ukraine, inflation and rising interest rates. Challenging times have offered Orbia with the opportunity to strengthen its business  fundamentals,  pursue  vertical  integration  and  synergies  between  its  businesses  and  seed  strategic partnerships for sustained value creation.\n\nDuring  2021  Orbia  achieved  record  sales,  EBITDA  and  cash  flows  while  maintaining  a  healthy  balance  sheet  and rewarding its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\n\nThe Company's consolidated statements of income for 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020 are included below.",

Revenues increased across all businesses, except  for  Precision  Agriculture.  Primary  drivers  of  the  year-over-year  increase  included  strong  PVC  pricing  in  the Polymer Solutions businesses, particularly during the first half of the year, strong demand in Connectivity Solutions and improved pricing across the Fluorinated Solutions product portfolio.\n\nBy region, the sales growth in North America was 24%, AMEA was 20%, Europe was 1% and flat in South America in 2022.\n\nOrbia's revenues grew 37% during 2021, reflecting the recovery of the global economy and a growing demand for the Company's products. Primary drivers of the increased included the strong results of Polymer Solutions business due to higher PVC prices and strong demand in Building and Infrastructure.\n\nBy region, the sales growth in Europe was 39%, North America was 40% and South America was 56% in 2021.\n\nThe revenue change by business group was as follows:\n\n- 1. Polymer Solutions: 2022 and 2021 sales grew 8% and 58% to $3.7 billion and $3.4 billion respectively.\n- 2. Building and Infrastructure: 2022 and 2021 sales grew 0.1% and 41% to $2.9 billion in each year.\n- 3. Precision Agriculture: 2022 and 2021 sales decreased 4% to $1.1 billion and grew 16% respectively.\n- 4. Connectivity Solutions: 2022 and 2021 sales grew 38% and 36% to $1.4 billion and $994 million respectively.",

        "page_content": "- 5. Fluorinated Solutions: 2022 and 2021 sales grew 15% and 7% to $852 million and $744 million respectively.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales increased in 15% in 2022 to $7.1 billion primarily due to inflationary pressures resulting in higher raw material, energy, freight and labor costs. Increases in raw materials and manufacturing expenses increased 18% and 17%, respectively.\n\nThe cost of sales grew 32% in 2021 to $6.2 billion, due mainly to the higher cost of raw materials and higher volumes sold, and, to a lesser extent, to increases in freight and labor costs in all business groups.\n\n## Operating Income\n\nOperating  profit  decreased  8%  to  $1.33  billion  in  2022  despite  record  levels  in  Connectivity  Solutions  and  strong performance in Fluorinated Solutions as other business groups were affected by lower pricing and other economic and market pressures.\n\nIn 2021 operating income increased 101% to $1.45 billion due to the significant increase in sales across all businesses. vs. the prior year.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nEBITDA decreased 7% in 2022 to $1.9 billion while EBITDA margin decreased approximately 350 basis points to 19.8%. The decrease in EBITDA and EBITDA margin was due to softening demand across certain markets in the second half of the year, coupled with higher input costs, particularly in Polymer Solutions, Building and Infrastructure, and Precision Agriculture. The decrease was partially offset by higher profitability in Connectivity Solutions, as well as in Fluorinated Solutions.\n\nDuring 2021, EBITDA increased 55% to $2.0 billion compared to 2020 and EBITDA margin increased approximately 280 basis points to 23.3%. The increase in EBITDA during 2021 was mainly due to strong performance in Polymer Solutions and Building and Infrastructure.\n\n## Net financial expense\n\nFinancial costs decreased $136 million to $160 million vs. prior year. The decrease in financial costs was largely driven by adjustments in the valuation of put options due largely to higher discount rates used to value the put option liabilities as a result of rising interest rates. This impact was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange, particularly from devaluations of the Euro and the British Pound.\n\nThe net financial cost of 2021 was $296 million, an increase of 22% compared to 2020, driven by foreign exchange losses related to the depreciation of the Turkish Lira, the Mexican Peso and the Colombian Peso, as well as the impact of the valuation of the put options held by the minority shareholders of the operating entities of Netafim and Shakun Polymers. Additionally, the increase included a non-recurring charge associated with an early debt withdrawal during the year.\n\n## Income tax\n\nThe Company's tax expense decreased 3% to $369 million while the effective tax rate increased 258 basis points to 35.6 compared to 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven by one-time items, including a nondeductible impairment charge of $136 million that lowered earnings before taxes. This impairment charge was due to a higher discount rate used in the impairment analysis, caused by increases in interest rates during the year. The increase in the effective  tax  rate  was  also  due  to  the  strengthening  of  the  Mexican  Peso  and  additional  charges  for  uncertain  tax positions, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances and the impact of non-taxable option revaluation.\n\nDuring 2021, tax expense increased 152% to $381 million vs. 2020, while the effective tax rate increased approximately 160 basis points to 33%. The increase in tax expense and the tax rate was mainly due to the impairment of certain tax assets, an increase in profit before taxes and the geographic mix of profits.\n\n## Majority net income\n\nNet income to majority shareholders decreased 14% to $567 million decreased 14% driven by lower EBITDA and the impact of one-time charges including the $136 million impairment charge discussed above.",

Growth in revenue was driven by the profitability of higher prices  during the  first  half  of the  year,  and  a  particularly  strong  performance  of the  Specialty  PVC  and  Chlor-Alkali businesses over the course of the year.\n\n2021 sales in Polymer Solutions grew 58% to $3.4 billion. Polymer Solutions maintained PVC price leverage, resulting from robust demand in the construction industry and a continued tight supply/demand environment. Sales performance in key markets exceeded pre-pandemic levels, complemented by increased compounds prices and the inclusion of the majority interest of Shakun Polymers beginning in the second quarter of 2021.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nPolymer Solutions cost of sales grew 24.8%, from $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2021 to $2.9 billion in 2022, and it grew as a percentage of sales from 68% in 2021 to 79% in 2021 due to higher raw materials and input costs.\n\nPolymer Solutions cost of sales increased 33%, from $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2020 to $2.3 billion in 2021, and decreased as a percentage of sales from 81% in 2020 to 68% in 2021, as sales prices outpaced the increase in raw material costs.\n\n## Gross profit\n\nThe gross profit of the business group fell by 30%. Weaker profits in 2022 were due to a decrease in demand during the last quarter of the year as well as reduced PVC prices.\n\nThe gross profit of the business increased 169% in 2021 to $1.1 billion while gross margin increased from 19% in 2020 to 32% in 2021 due to higher sales prices that outpaced the increase in raw material costs and higher demand.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses in Polymer Solutions grew 2% in 2022, from $218 million to $222 million, and remained stable as a percentage of sales at 6%.\n\nIn  2021, the  business's  operating  expenses  increased  19%  to  $218 million due  to  higher  compensation incentives, however decreased from 8% as a percentage of sales to 6% in 2021 as the increase in operating expenses did not outpace increases in revenues.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nPolymer Solutions EBITDA decreased 29% to $804 million in 2022, and EBITDA margin decreased to 22%, mainly due to lower prices and volumes and higher feedstock and energy costs in General Purpose PVC resins, particularly in Europe. This was partly offset by strong pricing in Specialty PVC and Chlor-Alkali businesses.\n\nEBITDA increased 145% in 2021 to $1,134 million EBITDA margin increased 1,170 basis points to 33.0% compared to 2020 driven by robust sales and price growth that outpaced cost.\n\nThe Company expects the PVC market to improve over the course of 2023 as China reopens and construction markets worldwide  stabilize.  General  purpose  PVC  prices  appear  to  have  rebounded  from  the  bottom  in  early  2023,  and ultimately,  the  Issuer  expects  general  purpose  PVC  prices  to  settle  above  pre-pandemic  levels.  Ultimately  Orbia believes that PVC industry supply/demand balance will remain tight for the long-term.\n\n## Fluorinated Solutions Business Group",

The growth in sales continue to reflect the favorable position of the business group's product mix and competitive pricing of all product lines, especially during the first half of the year despite lower volumes.\n\nRevenues for 2021 were $744 million, an increase of 7% compared to fiscal 2020. The growth in sales reflected an improvement  in  the  product  mix  and  prices  of  all  product  lines,  especially  in  refrigerants,  hydrofluoric  acid  and metallurgical grade fluorite.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales increased 7% in 2022 from $473 million in 2021 to $506 million in 2022. The increase reflected higher costs of raw materials, logistics and freight.\n\nCost of sales increased 16% in 2021 from $407 million in 2020 to $473 million in 2021. The increase reflected higher costs of raw materials and freight, as well as strategic investments to promote business growth.\n\n## Gross profit\n\nIn 2022 gross profit grew 28% to $346 million and the business group's operating margin grew to 42% driven by strong product pricing which offset lower volumes and higher input costs.\n\nIn 2021, the cost of sales increase exceeded the sales impact of higher prices and a more favorable product mix which caused gross profit to decrease 7% to $271 million and the business groups operating margin to decrease from 42% in 2020 to 36% in 2021.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nFluorinated Solutions operating expenses grew by 13% to $99 million as result of increasing sales in 2022.\n\nOperating expenses decreased 10% in 2021 to $88 million due to lower expenses related to consulting and external services.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nFluorinated Solution's EBITDA grew 24% to $245 million and EBITDA margin grew 300 basis points to 36% compared with 2021, driven by revenue increases and strong pricing of the product portfolio, which helped offset aforementioned lower volumes and higher input costs.\n\nIn 2021 EBITDA decreased 4% to $245 million and EBITDA margin decreased approximately 360 basis points to 32.9% compared to 2020, reflecting the higher raw material and supply chain costs and strategic investments to support the growth of the business.\n\nOrbia  expects  improvements in  the  revenue  and  profitability  across  the  product  portfolio  for  Fluorinated  Solutions, aligned with market strengthening and new regulations, partly offset by incremental costs to invest in long-term growth initiatives.\n\n## Building and Infrastructure Business Group",

The performance was in line with a more normalized market environment, following a period of logistical disruptions and product shortages earlier in the year. Sales volumes during the first half of the year were particularly strong as the business benefited from being able to source PVC through the Polymer Solutions business during this period of raw material shortages. The second half of the year was a return to a more normalized market environment, with increased availability of PVC.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nIn 2022, cost of sales increased  4% to $2.3 billion  compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal  year  2021 in line  with  general inflationary cost pressures on production inputs.\n\nIn 2021, cost of sales increased 39% to $2,183 million compared to $1,565 million in fiscal year 2020 due mainly to higher raw material costs.\n\n## Gross profit\n\nGross profit decreased 12% to $647 million in 2022, and the gross margin of this business group decreased 3% from 24% in 2021 to 22% in 2022 as a result of higher costs.\n\nGross profit increased 46% to $739 million in 2021, and the gross margin of this business group increased from 24% in 2020 to 25% in 2021 as the business group was able to increase sales volumes and prices that outpaced cost increases.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales remained stable at 16% in 2022 as the business group was able to manage costs despite high inflation.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from 18% in 2020 to 16% in 2021 as the business group was able to manage costs during this period of sales growth.\n\n## EBITDA\n\n2022 EBITDA decreased by 29% to $321 million, and EBITDA margin fell by approximately 30 basis points to 12% compared to 2021, as a result of the difficult economic environment faced by the business group.\n\n2021 EBITDA of $452 million increased 62% and EBITDA margin increased approximately 190 basis points to 14.5% compared to 2020, driven by strong sales volumes and effective cost management measures discussed above.\n\nOrbia expects inflationary cost pressures to impact the Building and Infrastructure group through the first half of the year, with conditions improving in the second half. Energy costs in key European countries have come down below pre-war levels but uncertainty remains.  The Company will continue to manage margins and to focus on driving a higher-value sales mix in the business.\n\n## Connectivity Solutions Business Group",

Cost of sales increased 54% in 2021 to $765 million following historically low raw material prices in 2020.\n\n## Gross profit\n\nGross profit grew by 119% to $501 million from $229 million in the previous year, due to stronger demand that was met via previous investments in production capacity.\n\nGross profit decreased 3% in 2021 to $229 million while the gross margin of the business group decreased from 32% in 2020 to 23% in 2021 driven by the lag in pass-through of higher raw material costs, and an unfavorable comparison to a historically low year for raw material cost.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses grew 42% to $180 million, but remained stable at 13% of sales, in line with the general sales growth of  the business.  In  2021  operating  expenses  grew  35% to $127 million in  line  with  the  general  sales  growth  of the business.\n\n## EBITDA\n\n2022 EBITDA grew year-over-year by 168%, driven by higher revenues described above combined with a stabilization of material costs.\n\nThe 2021 EBITDA decrease reflected the lag impact incurred during the first three quarters of the year, during which price adjustments were unable to fully offset the impact of cost increases. These results contrast with the extraordinary levels of the EBITDA margin achieved during 2020, which were due to historically low prices in raw materials.\n\nOrbia expects continued growth throughout 2023, supported by favorable market conditions and continued investments in incremental capacity.\n\n## Precision Agriculture Business Group\n\n|                           | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   |   Year ended December 31, |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Precision Agriculture (1) | 2022                      | 2021                      |                      2020 |\n| Net sales                 | 1,085                     | 1,126                     |                       972 |",

The decrease in revenues was driven by a slowdown in demand  in  most  markets  and  currency  devaluation,  partially  offset  by  strength  in  Latin  America  and  Turkey.  The slowdown in Europe was directly related to economic weakness relating to the war in Ukraine and high energy costs affecting key market segments, especially the greenhouses business.\n\nSales in 2021 increased 16% to $1,126 million, due to growing demand in most parts of the world, with the exception of India,  which  continues  to  show  weakness  due  to  COVID-19.  The  acquisition  of  Gakon  Horticultural  Projects  also contributed to the growth in sales in this year.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales in 2022 decreased by 2% to $790 million due to the decrease in sales partially offset by increasing input cost. Cost of sales in 2021 increased 25% to $804 million due to an increase in raw material costs and freight expenses during the year that was not passed through fully in customer prices.\n\n## Gross profit\n\nThe business group's gross profit decreased 8% during 2022 to $295 million while gross margin decreased to 27% in 2022 from 29% in 2021 due to the adverse impacts on sales and costs discussed above. As a result of increased costs outpacing revenue growth, the business group's gross profit decreased by 2% during 2021 to $322 million while gross margin decreased from 34% in 2020 to 29% in 2021.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nPrecision Agriculture operating expenses remained stable, growing less than 1% to 25% of sales. Operating expenses increased 15% to $275 million in 2021 commensurate with the growth in sales and also impacted by non-recurring items including certain provisions recorded in India.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nPrecision Agriculture 2022 EBITDA was $119 million, representing a decrease of 19%, while EBITDA margin decreased 200 basis points to 11% compared to 2021, as the business experienced a decrease in demand, particularly during the fourth quarter of the year, which was a result of continued destocking in the customer value chain after an inventory build-up in the first half of the year.\n\n2021 EBITDA was $146 million, decreasing 19% and EBITDA margin decreased 570 basis points to 13% compared to 2020 as the business experienced increasing raw material and transportation costs throughout the year, which were not fully reflected in selling prices. Additionally, EBITDA was impacted by approximately $26 million of one-time charges related to a project in Ethiopia and provisions recorded in India due to sustained pressure from COVID-19 and decisions by local governments to delay certain projects. Excluding non-recurring impacts, the EBITDA margin for the year was 15.2%, representing a decrease of approximately 340 basis points compared to 2020.\n\nThe  Company  expects  demand  for  precision  irrigation  products  to  strengthen  in  2023,  supported  by  continued investment in technologies that address water shortages worldwide.\n\n## ii. Financial Condition of the Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOrbia continued to maintain a strong balance sheet in 2022. The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased from 1.34 times to 1.64 times year-over-year due to an increase in borrowings during the year and the reduction in EBITDA. Working capital",

This issue does not impact Dura-Line's Datacom conduit products.\n\nThe natural gas distribution business, now operated through PolyPipe LLC ('PolyPipe'), conducted an analysis and determined that the issue occurred intermittently and estimates it impacted less than 1% of the small diameter NGD pipe produced by Dura-Line at its plant in Gainesville, Texas. Based on the analysis to date, management believes it is highly unlikely that any possibly affected pipe poses a risk of a near-term performance issue.\n\nPolypipe has resumed shipping and sale of small diameter NGD pipe at its plant in Erwin, Tennessee with enhanced monitoring, production, and quality processes. PolyPipe has received demands for compensation from certain direct and indirect customers for costs associated with addressing the issue, including removing and replacing potentially impacted installed pipe. In September 2021 Southern California Gas Company and San Diego Gas & Electric Company filed a complaint against Dura-Line in the California Superior Court of San Diego (subsequently transferred to the Superior Court of Los Angeles), asserting various claims based on allegations that they may have purchased non-conforming pipe manufactured by Dura-Line and seeking unspecified damages. Dura-Line denies liability and intends to vigorously defend the matter.  PolyPipe may receive additional demands for compensation in the future that may result in litigation and could give rise to potential material liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## Wolkaite Project\n\nNetafim Ltd. is currently engaged in a government irrigation project in the Tigray region of Ethiopia called (the Wolkaite project), which is in an advanced stage. The customer is the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation (the ESC). Due to civil unrest, a state of emergency has been in effect in the region since November 4, 2020. In late November 2020, Netafim notified the ESC, the Lender, insurers, and other concerned parties that an event of force majeure had occurred as a result of the ongoing civil unrest, suspending Netafim's obligations under the project agreement.\n\nUnder the original project agreement, if the force majeure conditions were to continue for an extended period, each of the parties would have the right to terminate said agreement.  On July 1, 2021, the parties entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the MOU) which suspended until December 31, 2021, the right to cancel the project agreement due to an ongoing force majeure event. The MOU also establishes a period for the parties to assess the condition of the project and to try to reach an agreement to resume the project. At present, all parties are cooperating and monitoring the situation. In addition to potential costs arising from delays to the project and possible damage to the existing project, it is possible that Netafim could incur additional liabilities under certain scenarios.\n\n## Jain antitrust complaint\n\nIn 2018, Irrigation Inc., Irrigation Design & Construction LLC. (IDC) and Agri Valley Irrigation LLC. (AVI) ('Jain Parties'), brought antitrust claims in a US Federal and State court in California claiming that Orbia's Netafim business, jointly with other manufacturers and distributors participated in a group boycott against the Jain Parties in alleged violation of State and Federal anti-trust laws. Jain withdrew its Federal case in June 2019, but continued to pursue its State antitrust claims. The parties entered into a mutual settlement agreement and this matter was settled and the respective claims withdrawn and released in the fourth quarter of 2022.  In connection with the settlement, Netafim paid an immaterial amount.\n\n## Other issues\n\nIn addition to the matters discussed above, the Company is party to litigation that it considers to be routine and incidental to the business. The Company does not expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Tax debts\n\nNeither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have outstanding tax obligations as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## Relevant Transactions not Recorded in the Balance Sheet and Income Statement\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has no relevant transactions not recorded in the Balance Sheet or the Income Statement of the Company. Orbia does not consolidate acquired companies until the related transactions have closed, subject to approval by competition authorities, when applicable.\n\n## iii. Internal control\n\nOrbia's bylaws provide for the existence of the Audit and Corporate Practices Committees, intermediate corporate bodies constituted in accordance with the Applicable Legislation in order to assist the Board of Directors in the performance of its functions. Through the aforementioned committees and the External Auditor, reasonable assurance is granted that the transactions and acts carried out by the Company are executed and recorded in accordance with the terms and parameters established by the Board of Directors and the governing bodies of Orbia, by the Applicable Legislation and relevant general guidelines, and the criteria and applicable financial information standards (IFRS).\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nOrbia is  governed by corporate governance principles that frame its operations and support its results.

'Management' sub-section c) 'Directors and Shareholders'.\n\n## Information for investors\n\nOne of the Company's fundamental objectives is to ensure that shareholders and investors have sufficient information to be able to evaluate the performance and progress of the organization. The Company accomplishes this through its Investor Relations function and related information provided on its company website. In addition, the shareholders of the Company have various mechanisms to communicate to the Board of Directors through:\n\n- 1) Shareholders' Meeting\n- 2) Investor Relations\n- 3) Conferences in which the Company participates, the presentation of which can be found on the Orbia website\n- 4) Meetings with analysts, banks, shareholders, investors, rating agencies and financial market participant.\n\nThe Company has established guidelines to enable it to meet the following additional objectives:\n\n- \u25cf Protect and increase the assets of investors\n- \uf0b7 Issue reliable, timely and reasonable information\n- \uf0b7 Delegate authority and assign responsibilities to achieve the goals and objectives set\n- \uf0b7 Document the organization's business practices\n- \uf0b7 Provide administrative control methods that help supervise and monitor compliance with policies and procedures\n\nThere are defined controls for policies related to marketing as well as operational guidelines related to human resources, treasury, accounting, legal, tax and IT, among others.\n\nSome of the most critical Internal Control Policies and Procedures are briefly described below:\n\n## Human Resources\n\nThe Company relies on the knowledge, experiences, motivation, skills, attitudes and abilities of its people to achieve its objectives.  Therefore, it has policies and procedures that regulate the recruitment, selection, hiring and induction of all personnel. as well as their training, promotion, compensation and assistance.

Authorization and  responsibility levels  are  defined  for  each  purchase transaction .\n\n## IT Systems\n\nOrbia has information systems in the different regions and countries in which it operates, mainly supported by Resource Planning  Systems  (ERP)  that  support  the  different  operating  processes  of  each  business.  Orbia's  IT  function  is responsible  for  operating  these  information  platforms,  with  the  principles  of  operational  continuity  and  information security,  which  determines  local  and  corporate  policies  and  procedures  in  the  different  countries  in  which  the organization operates.\n\nOrbia has policies and procedures that promote the correct use and protection of systems, computer programs and information relevant to the organization. The organization has support staff and/or help desk to attend to reports on failures or service requirements for systems.\n\n## e) Critical accounting estimates, provisions or reserves\n\nIn the application of the Company's accounting policies described in Note 4 to its Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on amounts recognized about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nThe critical accounting judgements and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.\n\nConsolidation of Ingleside Ethylene LLC: The Company consolidates Ingleside Ethylene LLC for which it owns a 50%  equity  interest  as  a  subsidiary.  The  Company  can  contractually  control  major  operating  decisions  regarding production and sales at the joint venture and accordingly has determined that it has control of this investment.\n\nEstimated impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives: The Company annually performs tests to determine whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are impairment.  For impairment testing purposes, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinites lives are typically allocated to cash generating units (CGUs). The recoverable amounts of each CGU have been determined based on the calculations of their value in use, which require the use of significant estimates including projected cash flows driven from revenues, anticipated gross margins, capital expenditures, and the rate used to discount future cash flows based on the weighted cost of capital of each CGU. Additionally, the Company has utilized an estimation of fair value less cost to dispose (FVLCD) for one of its CGUs in 2022 to calculate an impairment charge for that CGU (see Note 16).   Key assumptions used to calculate the FVLCD of that CGU included the determination of comparable market transactions from which to derive the appropriate valuation multiple as well as the assumed cost to dispose of the CGU.\n\nLong  lived  assets: The  Company  reviews  depreciable  and  amortizable  assets  on  an  annual  basis  for  signs  of impairment, or when certain events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recovered during the remaining useful life of the assets.\n\nAdditionally, the Company estimates the useful lives of long-lived assets in order to determine the depreciation and amortization expenses to be recorded during the reporting period. The useful life of an asset is calculated when the asset is acquired and is based on past experience with similar assets, considering anticipated technological changes or other such changes. When such changes to the anticipated use of an asset occur faster or differently than anticipated, the  useful lives  assigned to these  assets may  need  to  be  reduced.  This  would  lead to  the  recognition  of a  greater depreciation  and  amortization  expense  in  future  periods.  Alternatively,  these  types  of  changes  could  result  in  the recognition of a charge for impairment to reflect the reduction in the expected future economic benefits associated with the assets.\n\nInventory and Receivables: The Company uses estimates to determine the net realizable value of its inventories and its allowance for current expected credit losses for its accounts receivable.  The factors that the Company considers to determine the net realizable value of its inventory are production and sales volumes, and changes in demand for certain products, including expected sales prices and costs. The reserve for current expected credit losses is based on the Company's assessment of the probability of default and estimated recovery rate of its accounts receivable at period end",

        "page_content": "based on a variety of inputs, including collection history and an assessment of current factors that may impact the credit worthiness of its customers or risk of non-collection.\n\nOre  Reserves :  The  Company  periodically  evaluates  the  estimates  of  its  ore  reserves  (fluorite  and  salt),  for  the unexploited amount remaining in its existing mines, that can be produced and sold at a profit. Such estimates are based on engineering evaluations derived from samples, combined with assumptions about market prices and production costs relating to the respective mines. The Company updates the estimate for ore reserves at the beginning of each year.\n\nDefined  Benefit Obligation  Discount  Rate: To  determine  the  carrying  amount  of  the  Company's  defined  benefit obligations,  the  Company must estimate an appropriate discount rate. The Company's defined benefit obligation is discounted using market yields on high-quality government and corporate bonds at the end of the reporting period. Judgement must be used to establish the criteria for the bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived. The most important criteria considered for the selection of the bonds include the size of the issuance of the government and corporate bonds, their rating and the identification of the atypical bonds that have been excluded.\n\nContingent Liabilities: Management makes judgments and estimates in recording provisions for matters relating to claims and litigation.  Specifically, management must determine when a liability is probable to have occurred, and then, if deemed probable, must estimate the cost of the most likely outcome.  Actual costs may vary from these estimates for several reasons, such as changes in cost estimates for resolution of complaints and different interpretations of the law.\n\nRecoverability of Deferred Tax Assets: The Company prepares financial projections for each legal entity over which it  has control in order to determine whether recorded tax assets may be used in the future against available tax loss carryforwards, and relies on these estimated projections to determine if a deferred tax asset is recoverable.\n\nLeases: The determination of the value of the Company's right-of-assets and related lease liabilities require various estimates to be made including the expected term of the lease and the incremental borrowing rate used to discount future lease payments when determining the lease liability.\n\nAssets Acquired in Business Combinations: The application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, inventories, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date and the useful lives of the intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. Estimates of fair value require the use of various valuation techniques. These valuations require the use of management assumptions and estimates, including the value of comparable assets in the market, amount and timing of future cash flows, outcomes and costs of research and development activities, probability of obtaining regulatory approval, long-term sales forecasts, actions of competitors, discount rates and terminal growth rates.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments: The fair value of the financial instruments that are presented in the financial statements  has  been  determined  by the  Company  using the  information  available  in  the  market  or  other  valuation techniques that require judgment to develop and interpret fair value estimates. Additionally, such techniques use inputs based on market conditions as of the reporting date. Consequently, the estimated fair value of the financial instruments presented is not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company could get in the open market. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methods could have a material effect on the fair value calculations.\n\n'Put/Call'  Options  -  Redeemable  non-controlling  interest: The  Company's  calculation  of  the  fair  value  of  its 'Put/Call' options with minority shareholders require certain estimates including the amount and timing of future EBITDA, determination of the discount rates used to calculate the liabilities, terminal growth rates and probability of execution.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions: The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions and tax returns filed in those countries are  subject  to  review  and  examination  by  local tax authorities  with  the rules in  some jurisdictions  being complex  to interpret.\n\nThe Company recognizes uncertain tax positions when it is probable that a relevant taxing authority will not accept the tax treatment as reported in the income tax filing. Estimates have to be made by the Company on the tax treatment of a number of transactions in advance of the ultimate tax determination being certain.\n\nThere is significant judgement and estimation required in determining uncertain tax positions and a risk that all potential tax exposures may not be identified.  However, the Company considers that such uncertain tax positions will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or operating results.\n\n## Main accounting policies\n\nFor  additional  details  regarding  estimates,  provisions  or  critical  accounting  reserves  applied  by  the  Company,  the investing public is recommended to carefully read and analyze Note 4 of the audited consolidated financial statements of Orbia that are included in the Section \"Annexes' of this Annual Report.",

('Deloitte'), with offices in Mexico City, Mexico. Deloitte has provided audit services to Orbia for over 10 fiscal years.\n\nDeloitte  has  confirmed that it  is  an  independent  firm  with respect  to Orbia,  within the meaning  of the  stock market regulations applicable to the latter (Article 343 of the LMV and Article 6 and other applicable provisions of the \"General Provisions Applicable to Entities and Issuers Supervised by the National Banking and Securities Commission that hire services of External Audit of Basic Financial Statements', known as the Single Circular of External Auditors 'CUAE').\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the independent external auditors have not issued qualified or negative opinions, nor have they refrained from issuing any opinion on the Company's financial statements.\n\nThe fees paid by Orbia do not represent 10% of Deloitte's annual revenue. The amount that the external auditors have charged related to the audit as of December 31, 2022 for audit services are $5.4 million dollars, while the other services not related to the audit are approximately $2.3 million dollars, among the main services are those related to transfer pricing studies, legal and tax advice, which represent 30% of the total fees paid.\n\nThe additional services not related to the December 31,  2022 audit do not affect the independence of the  external auditor. These services are permitted since they do not entail the design or implementation of internal controls over financial information, which continue to be the Issuer's responsibility.\n\nThe appointment/ratification of the independent auditors is submitted annually by management to the Company's Audit Committee, which in turn reports thereon to the Board of Directors.\n\n## b) Transactions with Related Persons and Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the past, the Company has entered into, and intends to continue to, enter into certain transactions with related persons or companies, including, but not limited to, the transactions described in this section. The terms of these transactions are reported to, and verified by, the Audit Committee and/or the Responsibility and Compensation Committee (previously called the Corporate Practices and Sustainability Committee), as well as the external auditors, who render their opinion on the transactions reported and follow-up as needed. The Company believes that these transactions are entered into under conditions similar to those it could obtain from unrelated third parties, i.e., representing current market prices.\n\n## Relationships and transactions with related parties\n\nThe companies Kaluz, Elementia, S.A.B. de C.V., Grupo Financiero Ve por M\u00e1s, S.A. de C.V., Grupo Pochteca, S.A.B. de C.V., Banco Ve por M\u00e1s, S.A., Instituci\u00f3n de Banca M\u00faltiple, Grupo Financiero Ve por M\u00e1s, Casa de Bolsa Ve por M\u00e1s S.A.  de  C.V.,  Grupo  Financiero  Ve  por  M\u00e1s  and  Constructora  y  Perforadora  Latina,  S.A.  de  C.V.,  as  well  as subsidiaries of the foregoing, are considered persons or parties related to the Issuer for the purposes of this Report.\n\nAll transactions with related persons or parties are carried out under conditions similar to market conditions.\n\nOrbia  has  several  investment  securities,  trust,  and  bank  and  investment  contracts  with  Banco  Ve  por  M\u00e1s,  S.A., Instituci\u00f3n de Banca M\u00faltiple, Grupo Financiero Ve por M\u00e1s y Casa de Bolsa Ve por M\u00e1s, S.A. de C.V., Grupo Financiero Ve por M\u00e1s (related parties of Orbia), which generate interest at rates similar to market rates.\n\nOrbia and Kaluz, the Company's main shareholder, maintain an advisory services contract, which establishes that Orbia will pay Kaluz monthly the amount equivalent to the total costs and expenses incurred by Kaluz as a result of providing such services, to which a market margin is added.\n\nThe Company recognized revenues from related parties for the years ended 2022, 2021, and 2020 of $6 million, $4 million and $7 million, respectively, and expenses to related parties for the years ended 2022, 2021, and 2020 of $5 million, $5 million, and $7 million respectively. Amounts due to and due from related parties for the years ended 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not material.\n\n## c) Directors and Shareholders\n\nIn accordance with the corporate bylaws, the Company's administration under the charge of a Board of Directors and a General Director who performs the functions established in the LMV. The Board of Directors will be made up of a maximum of 21 Proprietary Directors, as determined by the Ordinary General Assembly of Shareholders that appoints them and, where appropriate, their respective alternates. Of said members, both owners and alternates, at least 25% must be independent. It should be noted that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's Board of Directors in fiscal year 2022 is made up of 12 directors, eight of whom are independent and represent 66.7% of the Board.",

Meetings shall be Ordinary, Extraordinary or Special. The Extraordinary Meetings will be those that meet to deal with any of the matters referred to in Article 182 of the General Corporations Act, as well as Articles 53 and 108 of the LMV.

When expressly authorized by the CNBV, said limit may be extended, in certain exceptional cases.\n\n## Statutory clauses or agreements between shareholders that limit or restrict the management of the issuer or its shareholders\n\nThere is no restriction for the shareholders to participate in the management of the Company, in this regard, the bylaws establish that the shareholders holding shares with voting rights, even limited or restricted, that individually or jointly have the 10 % of the Capital Stock, shall have the right to appoint and revoke a member of the Board of Directors and their respective alternate at the General Shareholders' Meeting, on the understanding that it must always be respected that 25% of the Directors must be independent.

The fixed part of the capital is represented by registered shares of Class I without right of withdrawal. The variable part of the capital is represented by registered shares of Class II, without expression of nominal value. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the number of shares and amount of capital stock is as follows:\n\n| December 31, 2022 Subscribed capital   | Number of actions   | Amount  (Millions of dollars)   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Class I                                | 308,178,735         | $37                             |\n| Class II                               | 1,701,821,265       | 219                             |\n| Total                                  | 2,010,000,000       | $256                            |\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company does not have open positions in derivative instruments that can be settled in kind whose underlying assets are ORBIA* shares.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, Orbia has not changed the number or amount of outstanding shares representing its share capital.\n\nAt the Company's shareholders' meeting held on July 21, 2021, the shareholders agreed to cancel 90,000,000 Class II common  shares,  with  no  par  value,  which  represented  the  variable  portion  of  the  Company's  share  capital.
