NRG brings the power of energy to customers by producing and selling energy and related products and services, nation-wide in the U.S. and Canada in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. NRG sells power, natural gas, and home and power services, and develops innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under the brand names NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green  Mountain  Energy,  Stream,  and  XOOM  Energy.  The  Company  has  a  customer  base  that  includes  approximately 5.4 million Home customers as well as commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers, supported by approximately 16 GW of generation as of December 31, 2022.\n\nOn December 6, 2022, NRG and Vivint Smart Home, Inc. ('Vivint') announced the entry into a definitive agreement under which the Company will acquire Vivint, a smart home platform company, in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition will accelerate the realization of NRG's consumer-focused growth strategy and create a leading essential home services platform fueled by market-leading brands, unparalleled insights, proprietary technologies and complementary sales channels. The close of the acquisition is targeted for the first quarter of 2023 and is subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nNRG sold 155 TWhs of electricity and 1,918 MMDth of natural gas in 2022, making it one of the largest competitive energy retailers in the U.S. As of the end of 2022, NRG had recurring electricity and/or natural gas sales in 24 U.S. states, the District  of  Columbia,  and  8  provinces  in  Canada.  NRG's  retail  brands,  collectively,  have  the  largest  share  of  competitively served residential electric customers in Texas and nationwide.\n\nThe following chart represents NRG's sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy\n\nNRG's strategy is to maximize stakeholder value through the safe production and sale of reliable electricity and natural gas to its  customers in the markets it serves, while positioning the Company to provide innovative solutions to the end-use energy or service customer. This strategy is intended to enable the Company to optimize its integrated model to generate stable and  predictable  cash  flow,  significantly  strengthen  earnings  and  cost  competitiveness,  and  lower  risk  and  volatility. Sustainability is a philosophy that underpins and facilitates value creation across NRG's business for its stakeholders. It is an integral piece of NRG's strategy and ties directly to business success, reduced risks and enhanced reputation.\n\nTo effectuate the Company's strategy, NRG is focused on: (i) serving the energy needs of end-use residential, commercial and industrial, and wholesale counterparties in competitive markets through multiple brands and channels; (ii) offering a variety of energy products and services, including renewable energy solutions, that are differentiated by innovative features, premium service, sustainability, and loyalty/affinity programs; (iii) excellence in operating performance of its assets; (iv) optimal hedging of its portfolio; and (v) engaging in disciplined and transparent capital allocation.\n\n## PART I",

        "page_content": "The Company announced in 2021 a four-year plan, that began in 2022, to spend $2 billion in order to achieve growth through optimization of the Company's core power and natural gas sales, as well as integrated solution sales within its core network in both power and home services. The planned acquisition of Vivint announced in December 2022 will be the primary growth vehicle to achieve this plan.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nThe  Company's  core  business  is  the  sale  of  electricity  and  natural  gas  to  residential,  commercial  and  industrial  and wholesale customers, supported by the Company's wholesale generation. NRG manages its operations based on the combined results of the retail and wholesale generation businesses with a geographical focus.\n\nThe Company's business is segmented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Texas, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in Texas, other than Cottonwood;\n- \u00b7 East, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in the East;\n- \u00b7 West/Services/Other, which primarily includes the following assets and activities: (i) all activity related to customer, plant  and  market  operations  in  the  West  and  Canada,  (ii)  the  services  businesses,  (iii)  activity  related  to  the Cottonwood facility, (iv) the remaining renewables activity, including the Company's equity method investment in Ivanpah Master Holdings, LLC, and (v) activity related to the Company's equity method investment for the Gladstone power plant in Australia; and\n- \u00b7 Corporate activities.\n\nIn  Texas,  the  Company's  generation  supply  is  fully  integrated  with  its  retail  load.  The  integrated  model  provides  the advantage of being able to supply a portion of the Company's retail customers with electricity from the Company's assets, which reduces the need to sell electricity to and buy electricity from other institutions and intermediaries, resulting in stable earnings and cash flows, lower transaction costs and less credit exposure. The integrated model also results in a reduction in actual and contingent collateral through offsetting transactions, thereby reducing transactions with third parties.\n\nThe Company's integrated model consists of three core functions: Customer Operations, Market Operations and Plant Operations, which directly support each other in each geographic region.\n\n## Customer Operations\n\nCustomer Operations is responsible for growing and retaining the customer base and delivering an outstanding customer experience. This includes acquisition and retention of all of NRG's residential, small commercial, government and commercial & industrial customers. NRG employs a multi-brand strategy that leverages a wide array of sales and partnership channels, direct face-to-face sales channels, call centers, websites, and brokers. Go-to-market activities include market strategy planning and development, product innovation, offer design, campaign execution, marketing and creative services, and selling. Customer portfolio  maintenance and retention activities  include  fulfillment,  billing,  payment  processing,  collections,  customer  service, issue resolution, and contract renewals. NRG provides energy and related services at either fixed, indexed or month-to-month prices. Home customers typically contract for terms ranging from one month to five years, while Business contracts are often between one year and five years in length. Throughout all Customer Operations activities, the customer experience is kept at the forefront to inform decision-making and optimize retention, while creating supporters and advocates for NRG's brands in the market. Following the expansion of the customer base with the acquisition of Direct Energy in 2021, Customer Operations now comprises three end-use customer facing teams: NRG Home, which serves residential customers, NRG Business, which serves business customers, and NRG Services, which primarily includes the services businesses acquired.\n\n## Product Offerings\n\nNRG sells a variety of products to residential and small commercial customers, including retail electricity and energy management, natural gas, home security, line and surge protection products, HVAC installation, repair and maintenance, home protection  products,  carbon  offsets,  back-up  power  stations,  portable  power,  portable  solar  and  portable  lighting.  Home  and Services customers make purchase decisions based on a variety of factors, including price, incentive, customer service, brand, innovative  offers/features  and  referrals  from  friends  and  family.  Through  its  broad  range  of  service  offerings  and  value propositions, NRG is able to attract, retain, and increase the value of its customer relationships. NRG's brands are recognized for  exemplary  customer  service,  innovative  smart  energy  and  technology  product  offerings,  and  environmentally-friendly solutions.\n\nThe Company provides power and natural gas to the business-to-business markets in North America, as well as retail services,  including  demand  response,  commodity  sales,  energy  efficiency  and  energy  management  solutions  to  Business customers.  The  Company  is  an  integrated  provider  of  supply  and  distributed  energy  resources  and  focuses  on  distributed products and services as businesses seek greater reliability, cleaner power and other benefits that they cannot obtain from the grid.  These  solutions  include  system  power,  distributed  generation,  renewable  products,  carbon  management  and  specialty services, backup generation, storage and distributed solar, demand response, and energy efficiency and advisory services.",

        "page_content": "## Market Operations\n\nMarket Operations has two primary objectives: to supply energy to customers in the most cost-efficient manner and to maximize the value of the Company's assets after satisfying its customer load requirements. These objectives are intended to reduce supply costs and maximize earnings with predictable cash flows.\n\nPower and natural gas are the two main commercial groups within market operations.\n\n## Power\n\nThe power commercial group is responsible for end-use electricity supply including power plant optimization and certain fuel supply. To meet the market operations objectives, NRG enters into supply, power and gas hedging agreements via a wide range of products and contracts, including (i) physical and financial commodity instruments, (ii) fuel supply and transportation contracts,  (iii)  PPAs  and  Renewable  PPAs  and  (iv)  capacity  and  other  contracted  revenue  or  supply  sources,  as  further discussed below.\n\nIn addition, because changes in power prices in the markets where NRG operates are generally correlated to changes in natural gas prices, NRG uses hedging strategies that may include power and natural gas forward purchases and sales contracts to manage the commodity price risk.\n\n## Physical and Financial Commodity Instruments\n\nNRG trades electric power, natural gas and related commodities, environmental products, weather products and financial products,  including  forwards,  futures,  options  and  swaps.  NRG  enters  into  these  instruments  primarily  to  manage  price  and delivery risk, optimize physical and contractual assets in the portfolio, manage working capital requirements, reduce the carbon exposure in its business and comply with laws.\n\n## Fuel Supply and Transportation Contracts\n\nNRG's fuel requirements consist of various forms of fossil fuel and nuclear fuel. The prices of fossil fuels can be volatile. The  Company  obtains  its  fossil  fuels  from  multiple  suppliers  and  through  multiple  transporters.  Although  availability  is generally  not  an  issue,  localized  shortages,  transportation  availability,  delays  arising  from  extreme  weather  conditions  and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. The preceding factors related to the sources and availability of raw materials are  fairly  uniform  across  the  Company's  business  and  fuel  products  used.  NRG's  primary  fuel  requirements  consist  of  the following:\n\nNatural Gas - NRG operates a fleet of mid-merit and peaking natural gas plants. Fuel needs are managed by the natural gas commercial group, on a spot basis, especially for peaking assets, as the Company does not believe it is prudent to forward purchase natural gas for these types of units as the dispatch is highly unpredictable.\n\nCoal -NRG actively manages its coal requirements based on forecasted generation, market volatility and its inventory on site. The Company believes it is adequately hedged, using forward coal supply agreements, for its domestic coal consumption for  2023.  As  of  December  31,  2022,  NRG  had  purchased  forward  contracts  to  provide  fuel  for  approximately  89%  of  the Company's expected requirements for 2023 and 2024. For the domestic fleet, NRG purchased approximately 15.3 million tons of  coal  in  2022,  almost  all  of  which  was  Powder  River  Basin  coal.  For  fuel  transport,  NRG  has  entered  into  various  rail transportation and rail car lease agreements with varying tenures that will provide for most of the Company's transportation requirements of Powder River Basin coal for the next two years.\n\nNuclear  Fuel -  STP's  owners,  including  NRG,  satisfy  their  fuel  supply  requirements  by:  (i)  acquiring  uranium concentrates  and  contracting  for  conversion  of  the  uranium  concentrates  into  uranium  hexafluoride;  (ii)  contracting  for enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and (iii) contracting for fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. Through its proportionate participation in STPNOC, which is the NRC-licensed operator of STP that is responsible for all aspects of fuel procurement, NRG is party to a number of long-term forward purchase contracts with many of the world's largest suppliers covering STP's requirements  for  uranium  concentrates  of  all  of  STP's  requirements  through  2025  and  75%  for  the  duration  of  the  original operating  license  (through  2027/2028).  Similarly,  STP  has  begun  the  process  of  covering  fuel  supply  requirements  into  the extended license period and has secured a fabrication contract with Westinghouse through 2047/2048. As of December 31, 2022, STP has secured approximately 25% of uranium hexafluoride through 2029. Other fuel requirements such as uranium, conversion and enrichment remain open at this time.\n\n## Renewable PPAs\n\nThe Company's strategy is to procure mid to long-term renewable generation through power purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2022, NRG has entered into Renewable PPAs totaling approximately 2.4 GW with third-party project developers and other counterparties, of which approximately 45% are operational. The average tenure of these agreements is twelve years. The Company expects to continue evaluating and executing similar agreements that support the needs of the business. The total GW entered into through Renewable PPAs may be impacted by contract terminations when they occur.",

        "page_content": "## Capacity and Other Contracted Revenue Sources\n\nNRG's  revenues  and  cash  flows,  primarily  in  the  East  and  West,  benefit  from  capacity/demand  payments  and  other contracted revenue sources, originating from market clearing capacity prices, resource adequacy contracts, tolling arrangements and other long-term contractual arrangements.\n\nThe Company's largest sources of continuing capacity revenues are capacity auctions in PJM. PJM operates a pay-forperformance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time performance and NRG's actual revenues will be the  combination  of  revenues  based  on  the  cleared  auction  MW  plus  the  net  of  any  over-  and  under-performance  of  NRG's respective generation assets.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nThe  natural  gas  commercial  group  is  responsible  for  all  costing,  logistics  and  supply  for  all  of  NRG's  residential, commercial  &  industrial  and  wholesale  customers.  The  Direct  Energy  acquisition,  which  closed  on  January  5,  2021, significantly increased the Company's capabilities and scale across the natural gas value chain. NRG has contractual rights to natural  gas  transportation  and  storage  assets  across  its  footprint  that  allow  for  optimal  supply  economics  in  support  of  its various  businesses.  NRG's  diversified  load  coupled  with  this  asset  portfolio  enables  the  Company  to  deliver  supply economically while providing incremental optimization activities when market conditions allow. The scale of the natural gas operation  extends  from  the  wellhead  (through  its  producer  services  business)  to  end  use  customers  (through  NRG's  various sales channels). This scale, coupled with the Company's associated assets, gas system platform and people, create significant opportunity across North America.\n\n## Plant Operations\n\nThe Company owns and leases a diversified wholesale generation portfolio with approximately 16 GW of fossil fuel, nuclear and renewable generation capacity at 23 plants as of December 31, 2022. The Company's wholesale generation assets are diversified by fuel-type and dispatch level, which helps mitigate the risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand  cycles.  NRG  continually  evaluates  its  generation  portfolio  to  focus  on  asset  optimization  opportunities  and  the locational value of its generation assets in each of the markets where the Company participates, as well as opportunities for the development of new generation.\n\nThe following table summarizes NRG's generation portfolio as of December 31, 2022:\n\n|                                                                                               | (In MW) (a)   | (In MW) (a)   | (In MW) (a)          | (In MW) (a)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|\n| Type                                                                                          | Texas         | East          | West/Services/ Other | Total         |\n| Natural gas    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | 4,721         | 1,881         | 1,279                | 7,881         |\n| Coal  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 4,174         | 1,948         | 605                  | 6,727         |\n| Oil   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | -             | 455           | -                    | 455           |\n| Nuclear   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | 1,132         | -             | -                    | 1,132         |\n| Utility Scale Solar  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | -             | -             | 219                  | 219           |\n| Battery Storage   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 2             | -             | -                    | 2             |\n| Total generation capacity                                                                     | 10,029        | 4,284         | 2,103                | 16,416        |\n\nPlant Operations is responsible for operating the Company's generation facilities at the highest standards of safety and reliability,  and  includes  (i)  operations  and  maintenance,  (ii)  asset  management,  and  (iii)  development,  engineering  and construction.\n\n## Operations & Maintenance\n\nNRG operates and maintains its generation portfolio, as well as approximately 7,800 MW of additional coal, natural gas and wind generation capacity at 12 plants operated on behalf of third parties, as of December 31, 2022, using prudent industry practices  for  the  safe,  reliable  and  economic  generation  of  electricity  in  compliance  with  all  local,  state  and  federal requirements.  The  Company  follows  a  consistent  set  of  operating  requirements,  including  a  solid  base  of  training,  required adherence to specific safety and environmental limits, procedure and checklist usage, and the implementation of continuous process improvement through incident investigations.\n\nNRG  uses  best-in-class  maintenance  practices  for  preventive,  predictive,  and  corrective  maintenance  planning.  The Company's  strategic  planning  process  evaluates  equipment  condition,  performance,  and  obsolescence  to  support  the development of a comprehensive work scope and schedule for long-term performance.",

Measures the percentage of maximum generation available over time as the fraction of net maximum generation that could be provided over a defined period of time after all types of outages and deratings, including seasonal deratings, are taken into account.\n\nNet Heat Rate - The net heat rate represents the total amount of fuel in BTU required to generate one net kWh provided.\n\nNet Capacity Factor - The net amount of electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of time divided by the net amount of electricity it could have produced if it had run at full power over that time period. The net amount of electricity produced is the total amount of electricity generated minus the amount of electricity used during generation by the station.\n\nThe tables below presents these performance metrics for the Company's generation portfolio, including leased facilities, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n\n|                                                  | Year Ended December 31, 2022   | Year Ended December 31, 2022                   | Year Ended December 31, 2022           | Year Ended December 31, 2022   | Year Ended December 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                  |                                |                                                | Fossil and Nuclear Plants  (a)         | Fossil and Nuclear Plants  (a) | Fossil and Nuclear Plants  (a) |\n|                                                  | Net Owned Capacity (MW)        | Net Generation     (In thousands of  MWh)  (a) | Annual Equivalent  Availability Factor | Average Net Heat  Rate BTU/kWh | Net Capacity Factor            |\n| Texas    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 10,027                         | 37,275                                         | 69.5 %                                 | 10,733                         | 41.8 %                         |\n| East   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 4,285                          | 7,282                                          | 78.1 %                                 | 11,959                         | 17.3 %                         |\n| West/Services/Other                              | 1,172                          | 6,676                                          | 84.5 %                                 | 7,442                          | 64.9 %                         |",

Competition\n\nWhile  there  has  been  consolidation  in  the  competitive  retail  space  over  the  past  few  years,  there  is  still  considerable competition  for  customers.  In  Texas,  there  is  healthy  competition  in  deregulated  areas  and  customers  can  choose  providers based on the most appealing offers. Outside of Texas, electricity retailers compete with the incumbent utilities, in addition to other retail electric providers, which can inhibit competition depending on the market rules of the state. There is a high degree of fragmentation, with both large and small competitors offering a range of value propositions, including value, rewards, and sustainability-based offerings.\n\nWholesale generation is highly fragmented and diverse in terms of industry structure by region. As such, there is wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identities of the Company's competitors depending on the market. Competitors include regulated utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, other independent power producers, and power marketers or trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions.\n\n## Seasonality and Price Volatility\n\nThe  sale  of  power  and  natural  gas  to  retail  customers  are  seasonal  businesses  with  the  demand  for  power  generally peaking  during  the  summer,  and  the  demand  for  natural  gas  generally  peaking  during  the  winter.  As  a  result,  net  working capital requirements for the Company's retail operations generally increase during summer and winter months along with the higher  revenues,  and  then  decline  during  off-peak  months.  Weather  may  impact  operating  results  and  extreme  weather conditions could have a material impact. The rates charged to retail customers may be impacted by fluctuations in total power",

Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas, interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility. The preceding factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across the regions in which the Company operates.\n\n## Market Framework\n\nNRG sells electricity, natural gas and related products and services to customers throughout the U.S. and Canada. In most of the states and regions that have introduced retail consumer choice, NRG competitively offers electricity, natural gas, portable power and other value-enhancing services to customers. Each retail consumer choice state or province establishes its own retail competition  laws  and  regulations,  and  the  specific  operational,  licensing,  and  compliance  requirements  vary  by  state  or province.  Regulated  terms  and  conditions  of  default  service,  as  well  as  any  movement  to  replace  default  service  with competitive  services,  as  is  done  in  ERCOT,  can  affect  customer  participation  in  retail  competition.  In  Canada,  NRG  sells energy and related services to residential and commercial customers in the province of Alberta pursuant both to a regulated rate service governed by provincial regulations as well as a competitive service with rates set by market forces. Sales of energy to commercial customers take place in other provinces as well. The attractiveness of NRG's retail offerings may be impacted by the  rules,  regulations,  market  structure  and  communication  requirements  from  public  utility  commissions  in  each  state  and province.\n\nNRG's fleet of power plants which it owns, operates or manages are located in organized energy markets, known as RTOs or  ISOs.  Each  organized  market  administers  day-ahead  and  real-time  centralized  bid-based  energy  and  ancillary  services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT. These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy markets operate, how market participants make bilateral sales with one another and how entities with market-based rates are compensated. Established prices reflect the value of energy at the specific location and time it is delivered, which is known as the Locational Marginal Price. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of locational market power. These market structures facilitate NRG's sale of power and capacity products at market-based rates.\n\nOther  than  ERCOT  and  AESO,  each  of  the  ISO  regions  also  operates  a  capacity  or  resource  adequacy  market  that provides an opportunity for generating and demand response resources to earn revenues to offset their fixed costs that are not recovered in the energy and ancillary services markets. The ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations.\n\n## Texas\n\nNRG's  business  in  Texas  is  subject  to  standards  and  regulations  adopted  by  the  PUCT  and  ERCOT 1 ,  including  the requirement for retailers to be certified by the PUCT in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity. The ERCOT market is one of the nation's largest and, historically, fastest growing power markets. ERCOT is an energy-only market. The majority of the retail load in the ERCOT market region is served by competitive retail suppliers, except certain areas that have not opted into competitive consumer choice and are served by municipal utilities and electric cooperatives.\n\n## East\n\nWhile most of the states in the East region of the U.S. have introduced some level of retail consumer choice for electricity and/or natural gas, the incumbent utilities currently provide default service in most of the states and as a result typically serve the majority of residential customers. NRG's retail activities in the East are subject to standards and regulations adopted by the ISOs, state public utility commissions and legislators, including the requirement for retailers to be certified in each state in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity.\n\nPower plants owned, operated or managed by NRG and NRG's demand response assets located in the East region of the U.S. are within the control areas of PJM, NYISO, ISO-NE and MISO. Each of the market regions in the East region provides for robust competition in the day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, the assets in the East region receive a significant portion of their revenues from capacity markets. PJM and ISO-NE use a forward capacity auction, while NYISO uses a month-ahead capacity auction. MISO has an annual auction. Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters,  as  well  as  additions  of  new  capacity.  PJM  operates  a  pay-for-performance  model  where  capacity  payments  are modified based on real-time generator performance. In such markets, NRG's actual capacity revenues will be the combination of cleared auction prices times the quantity of MW cleared, plus the net of any over-performance \"bonus payments\" and any under-performance charges. Additionally, bidding rules allow for the incorporation of a risk premium into generator bids.",

        "page_content": "## West\n\nIn the West region of the U.S., NRG owns equity interests, operates or manages power plants located entirely within the CAISO footprint.  The  CAISO operates  day-ahead  and  real-time  locational  markets  for  energy  and  ancillary  services,  while managing congestion primarily through nodal prices. The CAISO system facilitates NRG's sale of power, ancillary services and capacity  products  at  market-based  rates,  either  within  the  CAISO's  centralized  energy  and  ancillary  service  markets  or bilaterally. The CPUC also determines capacity requirements for LSEs and for specified local areas utilizing inputs from the CAISO. Both the CAISO and CPUC rules require LSEs to contract with sufficient generation resources in order to maintain minimum levels of generation within defined local areas. Additionally, the CAISO has independent authority to contract with needed resources under certain circumstances, typically either when LSEs have failed to procure sufficient resources, or system conditions change unexpectedly.\n\n## Canada\n\nIn Canada, NRG sells to residential and commercial retail customers in Alberta, within the AESO footprint, under both regulated  rates  approved  by  the  AUC  as  well  as  through  competitive  service.  The  Company's  regulated  rates  are  approved through periodic rate applications that establish rates for power and gas sales as well as for recovery of other costs associated with operating the regulated business. In addition, the Company sells energy to commercial customers in other provinces. All sales and operations are subject to applicable federal and provincial laws.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nAs participants in wholesale and retail energy markets and owners and operators of power plants, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include the CFTC, FERC, NRC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where NRG's generation or distributed generation assets are located. In addition,  NRG  is  subject  to  the  market  rules,  procedures  and  protocols  of  the  various  ISO  and  RTO  markets  in  which  it participates. Likewise, certain NRG entities participating in the retail markets are subject to rules and regulations established by the  states  and  provinces  in  which  NRG  entities  are  licensed  to  sell  at  retail.  NRG  must  also  comply  with  the  mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where NRG operates.\n\nNRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to NRG's ownership interest in STP.\n\n## Federal Energy Regulation\n\nInflation Reduction Act - The IRA allocates $369 billion in spending for energy security and addressing climate change. Much of these investments come through the tax code in the form of clean energy tax credits. In the past, investment tax credits and production tax credits have played a vital role in the growth of wind and solar projects around the U.S., but they have had short lifespans, phaseouts and the uncertainty of extensions. The IRA provides 10-year extensions on these tax credits, which will provide more certainty needed for investment decisions to build out these projects in the long-term. With new renewable generation coming online, renewable energy supply costs will likely become cheaper and more plentiful. NRG Home can also benefit from increased residential usage to charge electric vehicles (\"EV\") and special EV products. The IRA also introduced new  tax  provisions  including  a  corporate  book  minimum  tax  and  an  excise  tax  on  net  stock  repurchases  with  both  taxes effective  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2023  for  NRG.  The  Company  will  continue  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  corporate  book minimum tax  when  the  U.S.  Treasury  and  the  IRS  release  further  guidance.  Additionally,  the  IRA  establishes  a  tax  credit associated with existing nuclear facilities which begins in 2024 and terminates at the end of 2031. The tax credit will fully apply when gross revenues are at or below $25 per MWh and phases out completely at $43.75 per MWh. The U.S. Treasury is in the process of defining the methods by which gross revenues may be calculated pursuant to the IRA.\n\n## State and Provincial Energy Regulation\n\nIllinois  Legislation -  Illinois  enacted  the  Climate  and  Equitable  Jobs  Act  (\"CEJA\")  on  September  15,  2021,  which targets  100% clean energy by 2050. CEJA focuses on (i) decarbonization, (ii) incentives to transition coal plants into clean energy facilities and (iii) nuclear subsidies. A component of CEJA is the Coal-to-Solar Energy Storage Grant Program. On June 1, 2022, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity announced that NRG is eligible to receive almost $160 million over 10 years to develop battery storage at both the Waukegan and Will County power plant sites.\n\n## Regional Regulatory Developments\n\nNRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO regions. For further discussion on regulatory developments see Item 15 -  Note 24, Regulatory Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Texas\n\nPublic Utility Commission of Texas' Actions with Respect to Wholesale Pricing and Market Design In September 2021, the PUCT opened a rulemaking project to evaluate whether it should amend its rules to modify the High System Wide Offer cap (\"HCAP\") and the ORDC, which is intended to ensure prices in the competitive market appropriately reflect the value of operating  reserves  as  the  system  approaches  scarcity  conditions.  This  rulemaking  project  concluded  in  December  2021, resulting in a rule amendment that lowered the HCAP to $5,000 per MWh and which expands the minimum contingency level to 3,000 MW in Phase I. These two changes are broadly offsetting in their effect on overall average energy prices. In 2022, the PUCT has focused  on  the  development  of  a  winter  firm  fuel  product.  The  PUCT  directed  ERCOT  to  issue  a  Request  for Proposal to procure dual fuel capability with on-site fuel storage as part of the initial firm fuel procurement for the winter of 2022 and 2023. The procurement amount was 2,940MW with a total cost of $53 million.\n\nThe PUCT engaged an independent consultant, E3, to evaluate various resource adequacy proposals and recommend a policy  direction  to  increase  incentives  for  investment  in  dispatchable  generation  in  ERCOT.  On  November  10,  2022,  the independent consultant provided a report including various market design options such as a Forward Reliability Market, Load Serving Entity Reliability Obligation, and a new concept called a Performance Credit Mechanism (\"PCM\"). The PCM measures real-time contribution to system reliability and provides compensation for resources to be available. The PUCT staff filed a summary of comments and their recommendations, which support PCM. On January 19, 2023, the Commission approved an order adopting the PCM as their policy direction for resource adequacy in ERCOT, however, implementation is delayed until the legislature reviews.\n\nActivity on Securitization and ERCOT Pricing during Winter Storm Uri The Texas Legislature acted to pass a variety of  securitization  vehicles  to  finance  exceptionally  high  power  and  gas  costs  from  Winter  Storm  Uri,  including  HB  4492. ERCOT subsequently filed  two  applications  requesting  the  PUCT  to  issue  Debt  Obligation  Orders  (\"DOOs\")  based  on  the legislation. On October 13, 2021, the PUCT issued DOOs authorizing ERCOT's securitization of $800 million to cover short payments and reimburse congestion revenue right account holders for amounts related to the default of market participants other than  electric  cooperatives  Brazos  and  Rayburn,  which  are  discussed  below  (the  \"Default  Securitization\")  and  $2.1  billion related to highly priced ancillary service and ORPDA during Winter Storm Uri (the \"Uplift Securitization\").\n\nThe DOOs require ERCOT to issue loans or securitized bonds through a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity as the borrower and distribute the proceeds to affected market participants for default-related short payments and to LSEs for certain ancillary-service and ORDPA costs using an allocation of proceeds based on an LSE's exposure to relevant costs as calculated by the LSE's prevailing load-ratio share during the period of Winter Storm Uri, and a further redistribution of proceeds initially allocated to other LSEs and customers who opt-out of securitization. In turn, ERCOT charges non-bypassable fees related to the Default Securitization and Uplift Securitization to all qualified scheduling entities and to all LSEs (other than those that have opted-out), respectively. The Uplift Securitization provided for a one-time opt-out for certain LSEs or individual transmissionlevel  customers  who  in  exchange  for  foregoing  any  securitization-related  proceeds  likewise  avoid  future  fees  assessed  by ERCOT for the use of repaying ERCOT's debt obligations. However, nearly all competitive REPs were required by the law to participate,  ensuring  the  charge  established  by  the  law  is  competitively  neutral.  The  $2.1  billion  Uplift  Securitization  was disbursed by ERCOT in June 2022, with NRG's LSEs collectively receiving $689 million. NRG's LSEs that assessed customers certain  ancillary-service  and  ORDPA  costs  during  the  period  of  Winter  Storm  Uri  provided  a  refund  or  credit  to  those customers  proportionate  to  the  LSE's  total  recovery.  The  $800  million  Default  Securitization  was  disbursed  by  ERCOT  in November 2021, with NRG receiving $12 million.\n\nElectric Cooperative Bankruptcy and Securitization - Of the defaults in the ERCOT market the majority was attributable to  Brazos,  who  filed  bankruptcy  on  March  1,  2021  following  the  events  of  Winter  Storm  Uri.  Brazos'  bankruptcy  case culminated in a settlement between Brazos and ERCOT that was embodied in Brazos' chapter 11 plan of reorganization. Brazos' chapter 11 plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on November 14, 2022, and the chapter 11 plan became effective on December 15, 2022.\n\nUnder the terms of the Brazos' chapter 11 plan, Brazos and ERCOT are providing market participants a recovery of funds that were short-paid in relation to Brazos based on elections made by each market participant. NRG elected the accelerated cash recovery option and has received 43% of the $68 million of its short pay. NRG expects to receive an additional 22% of its short pay in various installments over the following 12-year period. The plan and ERCOT settlement also provide that there be no default uplift under the current ERCOT protocols in relation to the Brazos short payments.\n\nIn February 2022, Rayburn successfully completed a securitization transaction and fully paid its outstanding obligations to ERCOT.\n\nReliability and Plant Operations Standards - The PUCT created a rulemaking to establish weatherization standards and issued a notice for comments in response to provisions of Texas Senate Bill 3 (\"SB3\") that require mandatory standards for power generators and others within the electric-power sector. On October 21, 2021, Commissioners of the PUCT voted to adopt Phase I of the rule without substantial modifications from the proposal, and those rules are now in effect. On May 26, 2022, the",

        "page_content": "PUCT issued a proposal for publication to repeal Phase I rules and implement Phase II rules. The new rules entail conducting a weather  study  by  ERCOT  and  directing  the  State  Climatologist  to  create  a  percentile-based  standard  of  weatherization  and implement  weatherization  plan  audits  based  on  weather  related  outages  that  occur  during  weather  emergencies.  NRG  filed comments  to  the  rulemaking  on  June  23,  2022.  On  September  29,  2022,  the  PUCT  adopted  the  Phase  II  Weatherization Standards.\n\n## PJM\n\nPJM Delays Base Residual Auction Results and Files to Update Tariff The Base Residual Auction for the 2024/2025 delivery year commenced on December 7, 2022 and closed on December 13, 2022. On December 19, 2022, PJM announced that it  would delay the publication of the auction results. On December 23, 2022, PJM made a filing at FERC to revise the definition of Locational Deliverability Area Reliability Requirement in the Tariff. This would allow PJM to exclude certain resources from the calculation of the Local Deliverability Area Reliability Requirement. If accepted by FERC, the proposal will affect the clearing price of the auction. NRG has protested the filing.\n\nCapacity Performance Penalties and Bonuses from Winter Storm Elliott - PJM experienced approximately 23 hours of Capacity  Performance  events  from  December  23-24,  2022  across  PJM's  entire  footprint.  The  Company  will  be  subject  to penalty  or  bonus  payments  related  to  the  events  with  settlements  to  occur  in  2023.  PJM  anticipates  that  certain  market participants who incurred penalties may encounter challenges in paying penalties levied upon them. This may result in bonus payments being prorated. On February 2, 2023, PJM made a filing at FERC that, if approved, would give PJM the ability to extend the payment period for PJM member who incurred penalties for an additional 9 months.\n\nIndian River RMR Proceeding On June 29, 2021, Indian River notified PJM that it intended to retire Unit 4, effective May 31, 2022, due to expected uneconomic operations. On July 30, 2021, PJM responded to the deactivation notice and stated that PJM had identified reliability violations resulting from the proposed deactivation of Unit 4. NRG filed a cost based RMR rate schedule at FERC on April 1, 2022. FERC accepted the rate schedule with a June 1, 2022 effective date, subject to refund and established hearing and settlement procedures. Multiple parties protested. Parties are currently in settlement negotiations.\n\nPJM Revisions to Minimum Offer Price Rule On July 30, 2021, PJM filed proposed tariff changes at FERC to largely eliminate the current minimum offer price rules (\"MOPR\") except in very narrow cases. The proposal would eliminate: (i) the current MOPR for new entrant natural gas resources effective with the 2023/2024 delivery year and (ii) the expanded MOPR established in FERC's December 2019 Order to address out-of-market subsidies. On September 30, 2021, PJM's proposal went into effect by operation of law because the FERC Commissioners were split 2-2 as to the lawfulness of the change. Multiple parties  filed  motions  for  rehearing  and  ultimately  appealed  to  the  federal  court  of  appeals.  On  December  21,  2021  and December 30, 2021, respectively, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order holding the appeals in abeyance. The Seventh Court appeal is being held in abeyance while the appeal in the Third Court is moving forward with briefing and oral argument. Any changes to the PJM capacity market construct may impact the outcome of future Base Residual Auctions.\n\nPJM's ORDC Filing and Compliance Directives - On May 21, 2020, PJM proposed energy and reserve market reforms to enhance price formation in reserve markets, which included modifying its ORDC and aligning market-based reserve products in  Day-Ahead  and  Real-Time  markets.  In  addition  to  approving  PJM's  proposal,  FERC  also  directed  PJM  to  implement  a forward-looking Energy and Ancillary Services Offset to be used in PJM's capacity markets. After multiple compliance filings, parties filed appeals at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit of FERC's orders, and on August 13, 2021, FERC filed a motion and was granted a voluntary remand of the case back to the agency. On December 22, 2021, FERC issued its order on voluntary remand affirming in part and reversing in part FERC's determination. Specifically, FERC reversed itself and ordered PJM to: (i) eliminate the more robust ORDC curves and reserve penalty adders and maintain the existing (lower) curves and (lower) penalty adders and (ii) restore its tariff provisions related to its prior backward-looking Energy and Ancillary Services Offset.  In  response  to  requests  for  rehearing  of  the  December  2021  order,  FERC  issued  a  notice  denying  the  rehearings  by operation  of  law  and  providing  for  further  consideration  on  February  22,  2022.  Multiple  parties  filed  appeals  in  various appellate courts and those appeals are now all before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals for consideration.\n\nIndependent Market Monitor Market Seller Offer Cap Complaint On March 18, 2021, finding that the calculation of the default Market Seller Offer Cap was unjust and unreasonable, FERC issued an Order, which permitted the current PJM May 2021 capacity auction for the 2022/2023 delivery rule to continue under the existing rules and set a procedural schedule for parties to file briefs with possible solutions. On September 2, 2021, FERC issued an order in response to a complaint filed by the PJM Independent Market Monitor's proposal, which eliminates the Cost of New Entry-based Market Seller Offer Cap and implements  a  limited  default  cap  for  certain  asset  classes  based  on  going-forward  costs  and  provides  for  unit  specific  cost review by the Independent Market Monitor for all other non-zero offers into the auctions. On October 4, 2021, as required by the Order, PJM submitted its compliance tariff and certain parties filed a motion for rehearing, which was denied by operation of law. On February 18, 2022, FERC addressed the arguments raised on rehearing and rejected the rehearing requests. Multiple parties filed appeals at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A decision is pending.",

The proposal would remove certain facilities to be reviewed under the buyer-side mitigation rules to serve the goals of New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, adopt a marginal capacity accreditation market design and adjust the rules surrounding installed and unforced capacity. On February 9, 2022 FERC issued a deficiency notice, focusing on capacity accreditation issues, which NYISO responded. On May 10, 2022, FERC issued an order accepting the NYISO's Comprehensive Mitigation Review. Changes to NYISO's Buyer Side Mitigation rules may impact the outcome of future capacity auctions.\n\n## California\n\nCalifornia  Resource  Adequacy  Proceedings -  As  part  of  the  Integrated  Resource  Procurement  docket,  the  CPUC approved a decision on June 24, 2021 that requires all LSEs to procure a pro rata share of 11.5 GW of new non-fossil resource adequacy  from  2023  to  2026.  In  that  same  docket,  the  CPUC  ordered  the  state's  major  investor-owned  utilities  to  procure additional summer reliability resources through 2023. On June 23, 2022, the CPUC approved a decision that raises the reserve margin from 15 percent to 16 percent in 2023 and at least 17 percent in 2024. SB846 establishes a pathway for PG&E's Diablo Canyon Nuclear power plant, which units are scheduled to close in 2024 and 2025, to remain open for at least five additional years.  Finally,  the  CPUC  completed  a  series  of  2022  stakeholder  meetings  regarding  details  for  implementation  of  a  new Resource Adequacy (\"RA\") program beginning in 2025 which will require procurement to meet needs during every hour of the day.  The  result  of  these  changes  will  likely  keep  RA  prices  elevated  in  the  near  term  and  if  LSEs  cannot  meet  their  RA obligations, penalties may be issued.\n\nMidway-Sunset Reliability Must Run Proceeding San Joaquin Energy, LLC, a subsidiary of NRG, owns a 50%, noncontrolling  interest  in  the  Midway-Sunset  Cogeneration  Company  (\"MSCC\").  MSCC  owns  a  cogeneration  facility  near Fellows, California and submitted mothball notices for the cogeneration facility to the CAISO in the latter half of 2020. On December 17, 2020, the CAISO Board effectively rejected the mothball notices by authorizing its staff to designate the MSCC facility as a reliability must-run (\"RMR\") resource conditioned on execution of a RMR contract. On January 29, 2021, MSCC made its RMR filing at FERC. Multiple parties filed protests and on March 16, 2021, MSCC filed a response to those protests. On April 2, 2021, FERC accepted the RMR filing, suspended it to become effective February 1, 2021, subject to refund and established hearing and settlement judge proceedings. On September 27, 2021, the CAISO gave notice to MSCC extending the term of the reliability designation through December 31, 2022. On April 29, 2022, the participants in the settlement proceeding filed a Joint Offer of Settlement with the FERC, which was approved by FERC on July 28, 2022.\n\n## Environmental Regulatory Matters\n\nNRG is subject to numerous environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of power plants. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and maintained during  operation  of  power  plants.  Federal  and  state  environmental  laws  historically  have  become  more  stringent  over  time. Future  laws  may  require  the  addition  of  emissions  controls  or  other  environmental  controls  or  impose  restrictions  on  the Company's operations. Complying with environmental laws often involves specialized human resources and significant capital and operating expenses, as well as occasionally curtailing operations. NRG decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options, and the expected economic returns on capital.\n\nA number of regulations that affect  the  Company  have  been  revised  recently  and  continue  to  be  revised  by  the  EPA, including  ash  storage  and  disposal  requirements,  NAAQS  revisions  and  implementation  and  effluent  limitation  guidelines. NRG  will  evaluate  the  impact  of  these  regulations  as  they  are  revised  but  cannot  fully  predict  the  impact  of  each  until anticipated revisions and legal challenges are resolved.\n\n## Air\n\nThe  CAA  and  related  regulations  (as  well  as  similar  state  and  local  requirements)  have  the  potential  to  affect  air emissions, operating practices and pollution control equipment required at power plants. Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for certain pollutants including SO 2 , ozone, and PM2.5. Many of the Company's facilities are located in or near areas that are classified  by  the  EPA  as  not  achieving  certain  NAAQS  (non-attainment  areas).  The  relevant  NAAQS  may  become  more stringent.  In  January  2023,  the  EPA  proposed  increasing  the  stringency  of  the  PM2.5  NAAQS.  The  Company  maintains  a comprehensive compliance strategy  to  address  continuing  and  new  requirements.  Complying  with  increasingly  stringent  air regulations could require the installation of additional emissions control equipment at some NRG facilities or retiring of units if installing such controls is not economic. Significant changes to air regulatory programs affecting the Company are described below.\n\nCPP/ACE Rules -The  attention  in  recent  years  on  GHG  emissions  has  resulted  in  federal  and  state  regulations.  In October 2015, the EPA promulgated the CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs. On February 9, 2016, the U.S.",

        "page_content": "Supreme Court stayed the CPP. In July 2019, EPA promulgated the ACE rule, which rescinded the CPP, which had sought to broadly regulate CO 2 emissions from the power sector. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule (but on February 22, 2021, at the EPA's request, stayed the issuance of the portion of the mandate that would vacate the repeal of the CPP). On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the \"generation shifting\" approach in the CPP exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress. The Court did not address the related issues of whether the EPA may adopt only measures applied at each source. The Company anticipates that there will be additional rulemaking by the EPA over the next several years.\n\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule (\"CSAPR\") - In April 2022, the EPA proposed revising the CSAPR to address the goodneighbor provisions of the 2015 ozone NAAQS. If the rule were finalized as proposed, it would apply to 25 states (including Texas) beginning in 2023. In 2023, the revised Group 3 trading program (previously established in the Revised CSAPR Update Rule) would have emission budgets based on NO x emission rates that the EPA says are achievable by existing controls at power plants.  Starting  in  2026,  the  NO x budgets  would  be  reduced  significantly  based  on  levels  achievable  if  SCR  controls  were installed at coal-fueled power plants that do not currently have such controls. Starting in 2025, the budgets would be updated annually to account for retirements, changes to operations, and new units. The proposal also contemplates heightened surrender requirements  for  units  that  exceed  certain  NO x emission  rate  thresholds.  The  Company  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  this proposed  revision  and  anticipates  that  this  rulemaking  will  be  subject  to  legal  challenges  after  it  is  finalized.  The  EPA anticipates finalizing the revised rule in Spring 2023.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions -  NRG emits CO 2 (and  small  quantities  of  other  GHGs)  when  generating  electricity  at  a majority  of  its  facilities.  Nearly  all  (>99%)  of  NRG's  domestic  GHG  emissions  are  subject  to  federal  (U.S.  EPA)  GHG reporting requirements.\n\nNRG's climate goals are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2025, from its current 2014 baseline, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Greenhouse gas emissions include directly controlled emissions, emissions from NRG's purchased  energy,  and  emissions  from  employee  business  travel.  In  early  2021,  NRG's  climate  goals  were  certified  by  the Science Based Targets initiative as aligned with a 1.5 degree Celsius trajectory. From the current 2014 baseline to 2022, the Company's CO 2 e emissions decreased from 60 million metric tons to 35 million metric tons, representing a cumulative 42% reduction. The decrease is attributed to reductions in fleet-wide annual net generation and a market-driven shift away from coal as  a  primary  fuel  to  natural  gas.  The  increase  in  emissions  in  2022,  as  compared  to  2021,  was  primarily  due  to  increased generation  driven  by  power  market  conditions  and  weather.  The  Company  is  continuing  to  target  a  50%  reduction  in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, however, assuming no mitigating events occur, current power market forecasts suggest that the  projected  reduction  in  NRG's  greenhouse  gas  emissions  at  that  time  will  be  less  than  the  targeted  goal.  The  Company expects these forecasts to continue to evolve over time given recent and expected future changes in regulatory policies and prices in electricity and natural gas markets. The Company continues to actively monitor and explore various options to meet the goal when both economically and legally feasible.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, less than 5% of the Company's consolidated revenues were derived from coal-fired operating assets.",

On July 30, 2018, the EPA promulgated a rule that amended the ash rule by extending some of the deadlines and providing more flexibility for compliance. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit found, among other things, that the EPA had  not  adequately  regulated  unlined  ponds  and  legacy  surface  impoundments.  On  August  28,  2020,  the  EPA  finalized  \"A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure,\" which amended the April 2015 Rule to address the August 2018 D.C. Circuit decision and extend some of the deadlines. On November 12, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Closure Part B: Alternative Demonstration for Unlined Surface Impoundments,\" which further amended the April 2015 Rule to,  among  other  things,  provide  procedures  for  requesting  approval  to  operate  existing  ash  impoundments  with  an  alternate liner. NRG anticipates further rulemaking related to the Federal Permit Program and legacy surface impoundments.\n\n## Domestic Site Remediation Matters\n\nUnder certain federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of a facility, including an electric generating facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances  or  petroleum  products.  NRG  may  be  responsible  for  property  damage,  personal  injury  and  investigation  and remediation costs incurred by a party in connection with hazardous material releases or threatened releases. These laws impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several. Cleanup obligations can often be triggered during the closure or decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills during its operations.\n\nJewett Mine Lignite Contract -The Company's Limestone facility historically burned lignite obtained from the Jewett mine. Active mining ceased as of December 31, 2016; however, the Company remains responsible for reclamation activities and is responsible for all reclamation costs. NRG has recorded an adequate ARO liability. The Railroad Commission of Texas has  imposed  a  bond  obligation  of  approximately  $99  million  for  the  reclamation  of  the  Jewett  mine,  which  NRG  supports through  surety  bonds.  The  cost  of  the  reclamation  may  exceed  the  value  of  the  bonds.  NRG  may  provide  additional performance assurance if required by the Railroad Commission of Texas.\n\nNuclear Waste - The federal government's program to construct a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada was  discontinued  in  2010.  Since  1998,  the  U.S.  DOE  has  been  in  default  of  the  federal  government's  obligations  to  begin accepting spent nuclear fuel (\"SNF\"), and high-level radioactive waste (\"HLW\"), under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Owners of  nuclear  plants,  including  the  owners  of  STP,  had  been  required  to  enter  into  contracts  setting  out  the  obligations  of  the owners and the U.S. DOE, including the fees to be paid by the owners for the U.S. DOE's services to license a spent fuel repository. Effective May 16, 2014, the U.S. DOE stopped collecting the fees.\n\nOn February 5, 2013, STPNOC entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. DOE for payment of damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act through December 31, 2013, which has been extended three times through addendums to cover payments through December 31, 2022. There are no facilities for the",

STPNOC currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities on-site. STPNOC plans to continue to assert claims against the U.S. DOE for damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW.\n\nUnder the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980, as amended in 1985, the state of Texas is required to provide, either on its own or jointly with other states in a compact, for the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste generated within the state. Texas is currently in a compact with the state of Vermont, and the compact low-level waste facility located in Andrews County in Texas has been operational since 2012.\n\n## Water\n\nThe  Company  is  required  under  the  CWA  to  comply  with  intake  and  discharge  requirements,  requirements  for technological controls and operating practices. As with air quality regulations, federal and state water regulations have become more stringent and imposed new requirements.\n\nEffluent Limitations Guidelines - I n November 2015, the EPA revised the Effluent Limitations Guidelines (\"ELG\") for Steam  Electric  Generating  Facilities,  which  imposed  more  stringent  requirements  (as  individual  permits  were  renewed)  for wastewater streams from FGD, fly ash, bottom ash and flue gas mercury control. On September 18, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that, among other things, postponed the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA amended the rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA amended the  2015  ELG  rule  by:  (i)  altering  the  stringency  of  certain  limits  for  FGD  wastewater;  (ii)  relaxing  the  zero-discharge requirement for bottom ash transport water; and (iii) changing several deadlines. On July 26, 2021, the EPA announced that it is initiating a new rulemaking to evaluate revising the ELG rule. While the EPA is developing the new rule, the existing rule (as amended in 2020) will stay in place, and the EPA expects permitting authorities to continue to implement the current regulation. The Company anticipates that the EPA will release a proposed rule in the first half of 2023. In October 2021, NRG informed its regulators that the Company intends to comply with the ELG by ceasing combustion of coal by the end of 2028 at its domestic coal units outside of Texas, and installing appropriate controls by the end of 2025 at its two plants that have coal-fired units in Texas.\n\n## Regional Environmental Developments\n\nAsh  Regulation  in  Illinois -  On  July  30,  2019,  Illinois  enacted  legislation  that  required  the  state  to  promulgate regulations regarding coal ash at surface impoundments. On April 15, 2021, the state promulgated the implementing regulation, which  became  effective  on  April  21,  2021.  NRG  has  applied  for  initial  operating  permits  and  has  begun  to  apply  for construction permits (for closure) as required by the regulation.\n\nHouston Nonattainment for 2008 Ozone Standard - During the fourth quarter of 2022, the EPA changed the Houston area's  classification  from  Serious  to  Severe  nonattainment  for  the  2008  Ozone  Standard.  Accordingly,  Texas  is  required  to develop a new control strategy and submit it to the EPA.\n\n## Customers\n\nNRG sells  to  a  wide  variety  of  customers,  primarily  end-use  customers  in  the  residential,  commercial  and  industrial sectors. The Company owns and operates power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers, such as utilities and other intermediaries. The Company had no customer that comprised more than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries had 6,603 employees, approximately 12% of whom were covered by U.S. collective bargaining agreements. During 2022, the Company did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its facilities.\n\nNRG believes  its  employees  are  vital  to  its  success  and  is  committed  to  offering  employees  a  rewarding  career  that provides opportunities for growth and the ability to make valuable contributions toward the achievement of the Company's business objectives. NRG focuses on safety, health and wellness, diversity, equity and inclusion, talent development and total rewards for its employees.",

NRG has achieved its targeted top decile safety record of Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable injury rates in each of the 5 previous years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health and Wellness\n\nFor  several  years,  NRG  has  invested  in  the  health  and  well-being  of  its  employees  and  their  families.  NRG  provides programs  that  holistically  support  its  employees'  physical,  emotional  and  financial  wellness,  allowing  employees  the opportunity to take control of their well-being and focus on what matters most to them for a healthy, secure future.\n\nFor the 2022 plan year, the Company included well-being goals in the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP), ensuring participants are motivated to improve their physical, emotional and financial well-being. Accordingly, certain key employee programs were evaluated and enhanced for 2023: several new programs were added to NRG's voluntary benefits offerings, NRG's retirement savings plan match was increased by 50% in the U.S. and by 100% in Canada, and paid parental leave was increased to 6 weeks regardless of gender.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nNRG is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion (\"DE&I\") as an integral way the Company operates. In 2020, NRG completed a gender and race pay equity study to ensure that the Company's pay decisions were not influenced by gender, race, or other similar factors. The study demonstrated equitable pay practices after accounting for education, experience, performance and location. The Company committed to conduct this study every three years, including in 2023.\n\nIn 2022, the Company used a portion of its cash balances to invest in a money market fund in which a portion of the fund's  fee  is  donated  to  Rio  Bank,  a  Texas-based  minority-owned  financial  institution.  This  commitment  demonstrates  the Company's support for the communities in which it is located and does business .\n\nNRG also held its first company-wide Day of Service in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 2022. Employees were encouraged to participate in events held across multiple states to listen, learn and serve their communities.\n\n## Talent Development\n\nNRG deploys various talent development strategies and programs with the goal of ensuring a pipeline of leadership who can execute on the Company's strategy and drive value for all stakeholders. The Board of Directors regularly engages with management  on  leadership  development  and  succession  planning,  including  providing  feedback  on  development  plans  and bench strength for key senior leader positions.

Achieving  the  anticipated  benefits  of  the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of NRG and Vivint are integrated in an efficient and effective manner. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, lower-than-expected revenues or income generated by the combined company and diversion of management's time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial results and prospects.\n\n## The Company will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the acquisition of Vivint is pending that could adversely affect its financial results.\n\nUncertainty about the effects of the acquisition of Vivint on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect  on  NRG's  business.  Although  the  Company  intends  to  take  steps  designed  to  reduce  any  adverse  effects,  these uncertainties may impair its ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the acquisition is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others to seek to change existing business relationships.\n\nEmployee  retention  and  recruitment  may  be  particularly  challenging  prior  to  the  completion  of  the  acquisition,  as employees  and  prospective  employees  may  experience  uncertainty  about  their  future  roles  with  the  combined  company.  If, despite the Company's retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or fail to accept employment with NRG because of  issues  relating  to  the  uncertainty  and  difficulty  of  integration  or  a  desire  not  to  remain  with  the  combined  company,  the Company's financial results could be affected.\n\nThe pursuit of the acquisition and the preparation for the integration of NRG and Vivint may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn addition, the Company has agreed not to take any actions that would materially delay the satisfaction of any of the closing conditions to the transaction or prevent any of those conditions from being satisfied. This restriction on the Company's actions may prevent it from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities or making other changes to its business prior to the completion of the acquisition or termination of the merger agreement.",

        "page_content": "## Risks Related to the Operation of NRG's Business\n\n## NRG's financial  performance  may  be  impacted  by  price  fluctuations  in  the  retail  and  wholesale  power  and  natural  gas markets, as well as fluctuations in coal and oil markets and other market factors that are beyond the Company's control.\n\nMarket prices for power, capacity, ancillary services, natural gas, coal and oil are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate substantially.  Electric  power  generally  must  be  produced  concurrently  with  its  use.  As  a  result,  power  prices  are  subject  to significant volatility due to supply and demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead and spot markets. Long and short-term power and gas prices may also fluctuate substantially due to other factors outside of the Company's control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in generation capacity in the Company's markets, including the addition of new supplies of power as a result of the development of new plants, expansion of existing plants, the continued operation of uneconomic power plants due to state subsidies, retirement of existing plants or addition of new transmission capacity;\n- \u00b7 environmental regulations and legislation;\n- \u00b7 electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and transmission disruptions;\n- \u00b7 changes in power and gas transmission infrastructure;\n- \u00b7 fuel price volatility and transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;\n- \u00b7 changes in law, including judicial decisions;\n- \u00b7 weather conditions, including extreme weather conditions and seasonal fluctuations, including the effects of climate change;\n- \u00b7 changes in commodity prices and the supply of commodities, including but not limited to natural gas, coal and oil;\n- \u00b7 changes in the demand for power or gas, or in patterns of power or gas usage, including the potential development of demand-side management tools and practices, distributed generation, and more efficient end-use technologies;\n- \u00b7 development of new fuels, new technologies and new forms of competition for the production of power;\n- \u00b7 economic and political conditions;\n- \u00b7 federal, state and provincial power regulations and legislation, and regulations and actions of the ISO and RTOs;\n- \u00b7 changes in prices related to RECs; and\n- \u00b7 changes in capacity prices and capacity markets.\n\nWhile  retail  rates  are  generally  designed  to  allow  retail  sellers  of  electricity  and  natural  gas  to  pass  through  price fluctuations  and  other  changes  to  costs,  the  Company  may  not  be  able  to  pass  through  all  such  changes  to  customers.  For example, serving retail power customers in ISOs that have a capacity market exposes the Company to the risk that capacity costs  can  change  and  may  not  be  recoverable,  or  the  Company  may  engage  in  sales  of  power  at  fixed  prices.  Additionally, increases in wholesale costs to retail customers may cause additional customer defaults or increased customer attrition, or may be impacted by regulatory rules.\n\nFurther, in low natural gas price environments, natural gas can be the more cost-competitive fuel compared to coal for generating electricity. The Company enters into guaranteed supply contracts to provide for the amount of coal needed to operate its base load coal-fired generating facilities. The Company may experience periods where it holds excess amounts of coal if fuel pricing results in the Company reducing or idling coal-fired generating facilities. In addition, the Company may incur costs to terminate supply contracts for coal in excess of its generating requirements.\n\nSuch factors and the associated fluctuations in power prices have affected the Company's wholesale and retail profitability in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.\n\n## Volatile  power  and  gas  supply  costs  and  demand  for  power  and  gas  could  adversely  affect  the  financial  performance  of NRG's retail operations.\n\nNRG's retail power operations purchase a significant portion of their supply from third parties. All of the gas sold by the Company in retail and wholesale markets is purchased from third parties. As a result, financial performance depends on the ability to obtain adequate supplies of power and gas from third parties at prices below the prices NRG charges its customers. Consequently, the Company's earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in any period in which the wholesale power or gas prices rise at a greater rate than the rates the Company can charge to customers. The price of wholesale electricity and gas supply purchases associated with the retail operations' energy commitments can be different than that reflected in the rates charged to customers due to, among other factors:\n\n- \u00b7 varying supply procurement contracts used and the timing of entering into related contracts;\n- \u00b7 subsequent changes in the overall price of natural gas;\n- \u00b7 daily, monthly or seasonal fluctuations in the price of natural gas relative to the 12-month forward prices;",

In addition, many of NRG's generation facilities are exposed to market risk because they operate as \"merchant\" facilities without long-term power sales agreements for some or all of their generating capacity and output. Without the benefit of long-term power sales or purchase agreements, and without long-term load obligations, NRG cannot be sure that it will be able to sell or purchase power at commercially attractive rates or that its generation facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead to future impairments of the Company's property, plants and equipment, the closing of certain of its facilities or the loss of retail customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Competition  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NRG's  results  of  operations,  cash  flows  and  the  market  value  of  its assets.\n\nNRG has numerous competitors in all aspects of its  business,  and  additional  competitors  may  enter  the  industry.  The Company's  retail  operations  specifically  face  competition  for  customers.  Competitors  may  offer  different  products,  lower prices,  and  other  incentives  which  may  attract  customers  away  from  the  Company.  In  some  retail  electricity  markets,  the principal competitor may be the incumbent utility. The incumbent utility has the advantage of long-standing relationships with its customers and strong brand recognition. Furthermore, NRG may face competition from other energy service providers, other energy industry participants, or nationally branded providers of consumer products and services, who may develop businesses that will compete with NRG.\n\nThe Company's plant operations face competition from newer or more efficient plants owned by competitors, which may put some of the Company's plants at a disadvantage to the extent these competitors are able to consume the same or less fuel as the Company's plant. Over time, the Company's plants may be unable to compete with these more efficient plants, which could result in retirements.\n\nNRG's competitors may have greater liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial resources, lower cost structures, more  effective  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  greater  ability  to  incur  losses,  longer-standing  relationships  with customers, greater brand awareness, greater potential for profitability from retail sales or greater flexibility in the timing of their sale of generation capacity and ancillary services than NRG does. Competitors may also have better access to subsidies or other out-of-market payments that put NRG at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nNRG's competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or devote greater resources to marketing of retail energy than NRG can. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share.\n\nThere can be no assurance that NRG will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\n\n## NRG's costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by disruption of its fuel supplies.\n\nNRG relies on natural gas, coal and oil to fuel a majority of its power generation facilities. Grid operations depend on the continuing financial viability  of  contractual  counterparties,  as  well  as  the  infrastructure  (including  rail  lines,  rail  cars,  barge facilities,  roadways,  riverways  and  natural  gas  pipelines)  available  to  serve  generation  facilities  and  to  ensure  that  there  is sufficient power produced to meet retail demand. As a result, the Company's wholesale generation facilities are subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at its generation facilities if no fuel is available at any price, if a counterparty fails to perform or if there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.\n\nNRG routinely hedges both its wholesale sales and purchases to support its retail load obligations. In order to hedge these obligations, the Company may enter into long-term and short-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of fuel. Many of the forward power sales contracts do not allow the Company to pass through changes in fuel costs or discharge the power sale obligations in the case of a disruption in fuel supply due to force majeure events or the default of a fuel supplier or transporter. Disruptions  in  the  Company's  fuel  supplies  or  power  supply  arrangements  may  therefore  require  it  to  find  alternative  fuel",

Any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.\n\nNRG also buys significant quantities of energy and fuel on a short-term or spot market basis. Prices sometimes rise or fall significantly over a relatively short period of time. The price NRG can obtain for the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate, or may not rise at all, to match a rise in fuel or delivery costs. Retail rates may also not rise at the same rate or may not rise at all. This may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.\n\nNRG's plant operating characteristics and equipment, particularly at its coal-fired plants, often dictate the specific fuel quality to be combusted. The availability and price of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions and force majeure. At times, coal of specific quality may not be available at any price or the Company may not be able to transport such coal to its facilities on a timely basis. In this case, the Company may not be able to run the coal facility even if it would be profitable. Operating a coal facility with different quality coal can lead to emission or operating problems. If the Company had sold forward the power from such a coal facility, it could be required to supply or purchase power from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of specific plants and on the Company's results of operations.\n\n## There may be periods when NRG will not be able to meet its commitments under forward sale or purchase obligations at a reasonable cost or at all.\n\nThe  Company  may  sell  fixed  price  gas  as  a  proxy  for  power.  Because  the  obligations  under  most  of  the  Company's forward sale agreements are not contingent on a unit being available to generate power, NRG is generally required to deliver power to the buyer, even in the event of a plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the available capacity of the unit. To the extent that the Company does not have sufficient lower-cost capacity to meet its commitments under its forward sale obligations, the Company would be required to supply replacement power either by running its other, higher cost power plants  or  by  obtaining  power  from  third-party  sources  at  market  prices  that  could  substantially  exceed  the  contract  price.  If NRG fails to deliver the contracted power, it would be required to pay the difference between the market price at the delivery point and the contract price, and the amount of such payments could be substantial.\n\n## NRG's trading operations and use of hedging agreements could result in financial losses that negatively impact its results of operations,  and  NRG's  hedging  activities  may  increase  the  volatility  in  the  Company's  quarterly  and  annual  financial results.\n\nThe Company typically enters  into  hedging  agreements,  including  contracts  to  purchase  or  sell  commodities  at  future dates  and  at  fixed  prices,  to  manage  the  commodity  price  risks  inherent  in  its  business.  The  Company's  risk  management policies and hedging procedures may not mitigate risk as planned, and the Company may fail to fully or effectively hedge its commodity  supply  and  price  risk.  In  addition,  these  activities,  although  intended  to  mitigate  price  volatility,  expose  the Company to other risks. When the Company sells or buys power or gas forward, it gives up the opportunity to buy or sell at the future price, which not only may result in lost opportunity costs but also may require the Company to post significant amounts of cash collateral or other credit support to its counterparties. The Company also relies on counterparty performance under its hedging agreements and is exposed to the credit quality of its counterparties under those agreements. Further, if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner that the Company does not anticipate, or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract, it could harm the Company's business, operating results or financial position.\n\nNRG does not typically hedge the entire exposure of its operations against commodity price volatility. To the extent it does not hedge against commodity price volatility, the Company's results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon movement in commodity prices.\n\nNRG may engage in trading activities, including the trading of power, fuel and emissions allowances that are not directly related to the operation of the Company's generation facilities or the management of related risks. These trading activities take place in volatile markets and some of these trades could be characterized as speculative. The Company would expect to settle these trades financially rather than through the production of power or the delivery of fuel. This trading activity may expose the Company to the risk of significant financial losses which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition.\n\nNRG generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts. These derivatives are accounted for in accordance with the FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815\"), which requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices immediately recognized in earnings, unless the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment or a scope exception. As a result, the Company's quarterly and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by changes in market prices.",

        "page_content": "## NRG may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks effectively.\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  market  risks  through  its  retail  and  wholesale  operations,  which  involve  the  purchase  of electricity  and  natural  gas  for  resale,  the  sale  of  energy,  capacity  and  related  products,  and  the  purchase  and  sale  of  fuel, transmission services and emission allowances. These market risks include, among other risks, volatility arising from location and timing differences that may be associated with buying and transporting fuel, converting fuel into energy and delivering energy to a buyer.\n\nNRG  undertakes  these  market  activities  through  agreements  with  various  counterparties.  Many  of  the  Company's agreements  with  counterparties  include  provisions  that  require  the  Company  to  provide  guarantees,  offset  or  netting arrangements, letters of credit, a first lien on assets and/or cash collateral to protect the counterparties against the risk of the Company's default or insolvency. The amount of such credit support that must be provided typically is based on the difference between the price  of  the  commodity  in  a  given  contract  and  the  market  price  of  the  commodity.  Significant  movements  in market prices can result in the Company being required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in very large amounts. The effectiveness of the Company's strategy may depend on the amount of collateral available to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity requirements may be greater than the Company anticipates or will be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital to post as collateral in support of performance guarantees or as a cash margin, the Company may not be able to manage price volatility effectively or to implement its strategy. An increase in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required to be provided to the Company's counterparties may negatively affect the Company's liquidity and financial condition.\n\nFurther,  if  retail  customers  use  more  power  or  gas  than  expected,  or  if  any  of  NRG's  facilities  experience  unplanned outages,  the  Company  may  be  required  to  procure  additional  power  or  gas  at  spot  market  prices  to  fulfill  contractual commitments.  Without  adequate  liquidity  to  meet  margin  and  collateral  requirements,  the  Company  may  be  exposed  to significant losses, may miss significant opportunities, and may have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets.\n\n## NRG relies on storage, transportation assets and suppliers, which it does not own or control, to deliver natural gas.\n\nThe Company depends on natural gas pipelines and other transportation and storage facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver natural gas to wholesale and retail markets and to provide retail energy services to customers. The Company's ability to provide natural gas for its present and projected customers will depend upon its suppliers' ability to obtain and deliver supplies of natural gas, as well as NRG's ability to acquire supplies directly from new sources. Factors beyond the control of the Company and its suppliers may affect the Company's ability to deliver such supplies. These factors include other parties' control over  the  drilling  of  new  wells  and  the  facilities  to  transport  natural  gas  to  the  Company's  receipt  points,  development  of additional interstate pipeline infrastructure, availability of supply sources competition for the acquisition of natural gas, priority allocations, impact of severe weather disruptions to natural gas supplies and the regulatory and pricing policies of federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as the availability of Canadian reserves for export to the U.S. Energy deregulation legislation may increase competition among natural gas utilities and impact the quantities of natural gas requirements needed for sales service. If supply, transportation or storage is disrupted, including for reasons of force majeure, the ability of the Company to sell and deliver its products and services may be hindered. As a result, the Company may be responsible for damages incurred by its customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates. These conditions could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Operation of power generation facilities involves significant risks and hazards customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on NRG's revenues and results of operations, and NRG may not have adequate insurance to cover these risks and hazards.\n\nThe ongoing operation of NRG's facilities involves risks that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, performance below expected levels of output or efficiency and the inability to transport the Company's products to its customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled  outages  due  to  mechanical  failures  or  other  problems  occur  from  time  to  time  and  are  an  inherent  risk  of  the Company's business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Company's operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce the Company's revenues as a result of selling fewer MWh or incurring non-performance penalties and/or require NRG to incur significant costs as a result of obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market or running one of its higher cost units to satisfy the Company's forward power sales obligations. NRG's inability to operate the Company's plants efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs, and generate earnings and cash flow from the Company's asset-based businesses could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nIn  addition,  NRG  provides  plant  operations  and  commercial  services  to  a  variety  of  third  parties.  There  is  a  risk  that mistakes, mis-operations, or actions taken by these third parties could be attributed to NRG, including the risk of investigation or penalties being assessed to NRG in connection with the services it offers, or that regulators could question whether NRG had the appropriate safeguards in place.",

        "page_content": "Power  generation  involves  hazardous  activities,  including  acquiring,  transporting  and  unloading  fuel,  operating  large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind, other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in the Company's operations. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in NRG being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and property damage and fines and/or penalties.\n\nNRG  maintains  an  amount  of  insurance  protection  that  it  considers  adequate,  obtains  warranties  from  vendors  and obligates contractors to meet certain performance levels, but the Company cannot provide any assurance that these measures will  be  sufficient  or  effective  under  all  circumstances  and  against  all  hazards  or  liabilities  to  which  it  may  be  subject. A successful claim for which the Company is not adequately insured or protected could hurt its financial results and materially harm NRG's financial condition. NRG cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage will continue to be available at all  or  at  rates  or  on  terms  similar  to  those  presently  available.  Any  losses  not  covered  by  insurance  could  have  a  material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Supplier and/or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks.\n\nNRG often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision and transportation of fuel, chemicals and other services required for the operation of certain of its facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform these services, the Company utilizes the marketplace. There can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide these services as, when and where required or at comparable prices.\n\nThe Company may also hedge a portion of its exposure to power and fuel price fluctuations through various physical or financial agreements with counterparties. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations,  and  in  case  of  renewable  generation,  such  counterparties  may  be  subject  to  additional  risks,  such  as  facility development and transmission risks, unfavorable weather and atmospheric conditions, and mechanical or operational failures. NRG may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as its existing agreements, or at all. If the Company is unable to enter into  replacement  purchase  agreements  or  other  replacement  hedging  agreements,  the  Company would be exposed to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price.\n\nThe failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to NRG could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of the Company's facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers.\n\n## Maintenance,  expansion  and  refurbishment  of  power  generation  facilities  involve  significant  risks  that  could  result  in unplanned power outages or reduced output and could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nNRG's  facilities  require  periodic  maintenance  and  repair.  Any  unexpected  failure,  including  failure  associated  with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures could result in reduced profitability.\n\nNRG cannot be certain of the level of capital expenditures that will be required due to changing environmental and safety laws (including changes in the interpretation or enforcement thereof), needed facility repairs and unexpected events (such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks). The unexpected requirement of large capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and financial condition.\n\n## NRG and its subsidiaries have guaranteed the performance of third parties, which may result in substantial costs in the event of non-performance.\n\nNRG  and  its  subsidiaries  have  issued  certain  guarantees  of  the  performance  of  others,  which  obligate  NRG  and  its subsidiaries to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by the third parties, NRG could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees. Such performance guarantees could have a material impact on the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows of the Company.\n\n## NRG  relies  on  power  transmission  and  distribution  facilities  that  it  does  not  own  or  control  and  that  are  subject  to transmission constraints within a number of the Company's core regions.\n\nNRG depends on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by others to deliver power to its customers. If  transmission  or  distribution  is  disrupted,  including  by  force  majeure  events,  or  if  the  transmission  or  distribution infrastructure  is  inadequate,  NRG's  ability  to  deliver  power  may  be  adversely  impacted.  The  Company  also  cannot  predict whether transmission or distribution facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.",

        "page_content": "In  addition,  in  certain  of  the  markets  in  which  NRG  operates,  energy  transmission  congestion  may  occur  and  the Company may be deemed responsible for congestion costs associated with power sales or purchases, or retail sales, particularly where the Company's load is not co-located with its retail sales obligations. If NRG were liable for such congestion costs, the Company's financial results could be adversely affected.\n\n## Rates and terms for service of certain residential and commercial customers in Alberta are subject to regulatory review and approval.\n\nThe  Company  owns  Direct  Energy  Regulated  Services,  which  serves  as  a  regulated  rate  supplier  for  residential  and commercial energy customers in portions of the province of Alberta. It is required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as  a  part  of  the  process  of  establishing  the  terms  and  rates  for  sales  of  power  and  natural  gas.  These  proceedings  typically involve multiple parties,  including  governmental  bodies  and  officials,  consumer  advocacy  groups  and  various  consumers  of energy,  who  have  differing  concerns  but  also  have  the  common  objective  of  limiting  rate  increases  or  even  reducing  rates. Decisions  are  subject  to  appeal,  potentially  leading  to  additional  uncertainty  associated  with  the  approval  proceedings.  The potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient  for  the  Company  to  recover  its  costs  by  the  time  the  rates  become  effective.  Established  rates  are  also  subject  to subsequent  reviews  by  regulators,  whereby  various  portions  of  rates  could  be  adjusted,  subject  to  refund  or  disallowed.  In certain instances, the Company could agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters and other cost recovery elements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the Company to recover its costs or earn an adequate return. In addition, subsequent legislative or regulatory  action  could  alter  the  terms  on  which  the  regulated  business  operates  and  future  earnings  could  be  negatively impacted. The Company also operates a competitive energy supply business in Alberta that is not subject to rate regulation and is  subject  to  stringent  requirements  to  segregate  operations  and  information  relating  to  the  competitive  business  from  the regulated business. Failure to comply with these and other requirements on the business could subject the Company's regulated and competitive businesses in Alberta to fines, penalties, and restrictions on the ability to continue business.\n\n## Because NRG owns less than a majority of the ownership interests of some of its project investments, the Company cannot exercise complete control over their operations.\n\nNRG  has  limited  control  over  the  operation  of  some  project  investments  and  joint  ventures  because  the  Company's investments are in projects where it beneficially owns less than a majority of the ownership interests. NRG seeks to exert a degree  of  influence  with  respect  to  the  management  and  operation  of  projects  in  which  it  owns  less  than  a  majority  of  the ownership  interests  by  negotiating  to  obtain  positions  on  management  committees  or  to  receive  certain  limited  governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. NRG may  be  dependent  on  its  co-venturers  to  operate  such  projects.  The  Company's  co-venturers  may  not  have  the  level  of experience, technical expertise, human resources management or other attributes necessary to operate these projects optimally. The approval of co-venturers also may be required for NRG to receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer the Company's interest in projects.\n\n## NRG may be unable to integrate the operations of acquired entities in the manner expected.\n\nNRG enters into acquisitions that result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions depends on whether the businesses can be integrated into NRG in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of  valuable  employees,  the  disruption  of  NRG's  businesses,  processes  and  systems  or  inconsistencies  in  standards,  controls, procedures,  practices,  policies  and  compensation  arrangements,  any  of  which  could  divert  the  attention  of  management  and adversely  affect  the  Company's  ability  to  achieve  the  anticipated  benefits  of  the  acquisitions.  NRG  may  have  difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could  result  in  increased  costs  or  decreases  in  the  amount  of  expected  revenues  and  could  adversely  affect  NRG's  future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\n\n## Future acquisition or disposition activities could involve unknown risks and may have materially adverse effects and NRG may be subject to trailing liabilities from businesses that it disposes of or that are inactive.\n\nNRG may in the future acquire or dispose of businesses or assets, acquire or sell books of retail customers, or pursue other business activities, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, that involve a number of risks. The acquisition of companies and assets is subject to substantial risks, including the failure to identify material problems during due diligence, the risk of overpaying for assets or customers, the inability to retain customers and the inability to arrange financing for an acquisition as may be required or desired. Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources and, ultimately, the Company's acquisitions may not be successfully integrated. In the case of dispositions, such risks may relate to employment matters, counterparties, regulators and other stakeholders in the disposed business, the separation of disposed assets from NRG's business, the management of NRG's ongoing business, and other financial, legal and operational",

Any such risk may result in one or more costly disputes or litigation. There can be no assurances that any future acquisitions will perform as expected or that the returns from such acquisitions will support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them. There can also be no assurances that NRG will realize the anticipated benefits from any such dispositions. The failure to realize the anticipated returns or benefits from an acquisition or disposition could adversely affect NRG's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nThe operation of the Company's businesses is subject to advanced persistent cyber-based security threats and integrity risk. Attacks  on  NRG's  infrastructure  that  breach  cyber/data  security  measures  could  expose  the  Company  to  significant liabilities,  reputational  damage,  regulatory  action,  and  disrupt  business  operations,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse effect.\n\nNumerous  functions  affecting  the  efficient  operation  of  NRG's  businesses  depend  on  the  secure  and  reliable  storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems, much of  which  is  connected  (directly  or  indirectly)  to  the  internet.  As  a  result,  NRG's  information  technology  systems  and infrastructure, and those of its vendors and suppliers, are susceptible to cyber-based security threats which could compromise confidentiality, integrity or availability. While the Company has controls in place designed to protect its infrastructure, such breaches and threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, requiring continuing evolution of its program. Any such breach, disruption or similar event that impairs NRG's information technology infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations and affect the Company's ability to control its generation assets, maintain confidentiality, availability and integrity of restricted  data,  access  retail  customer  information  and  limit  communication  with  third  parties,  which  could  have  a  material adverse effect on the Company.\n\nAs part of the continuing development of new and modified reliability standards, the FERC has approved changes to its Critical  Infrastructure  Protection  reliability  standards  and  has  established  standards  for  assets  identified  as  \"critical  cyber assets.\"  Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC can impose penalties (up to $1 million per day, per violation) for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards, including standards to protect the power system against potential disruptions from cyber/data and physical security breaches.\n\nFurther, the Company's retail business requires accessing, collecting, storing and transmitting sensitive customer data in the  ordinary  course  of  business.  Concerns  about  data  privacy  have  led  to  increased  regulation  and  other  actions  that  could impact NRG's businesses and changes in data privacy and data protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company's business and financial results. NRG's retail business may need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers who require access to this information in order to provide services, such as call center operations, to the retail business.\n\nAlthough the Company takes precautions to protect its infrastructure, it has been, and will likely continue to be, subject to attempts at phishing and other cybersecurity intrusions. International conflict increases the risk of state-sponsored cyber threats and  escalated  use  of  cybercriminal  and  cyber-espionage  activities.  In  particular,  the  current  geopolitical  climate  has  further escalated  cybersecurity  risk,  with  various  government  agencies,  including  the  U.S.  Cybersecurity  &  Infrastructure  Security Agency, issuing warnings of increased cyber threats, particularly for U.S. critical infrastructure. While the Company has not experienced a cyber/data event causing any material operational, reputational or financial impact, it recognizes the growing threat within the general marketplace and the industry, and there is no assurance that NRG will be able to prevent any such impacts  in  the  future.  If  a  material  breach  of  the  Company's  information  technology  systems  were  to  occur,  the  critical operational capabilities and reputation of its business may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished, and NRG may be subject to substantial legal or regulatory scrutiny and claims, any of which may contribute to potential legal or regulatory actions against the Company, loss of customers and otherwise have a material adverse effect. Any loss or disruption of critical operational capabilities to support the Company's generation, commercial or retail operations, loss of customers, or loss of confidential or proprietary data through a breach, unauthorized access, disruption, misuse or disclosure could adversely affect NRG's reputation, expose the Company to material legal or regulatory claims and impair the Company's ability to execute its  business  strategy,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect.  In  addition,  NRG  may  experience  increased  capital  and operating  costs  to  implement  increased  security  for  its  information  technology  infrastructure.  NRG  cannot  provide  any assurance  that  such  events  and  impacts  will  not  be  material  in  the  future,  and  the  Company's  efforts  to  deter,  identify  and mitigate future breaches may require additional significant capital and may not be successful.\n\n## Negative publicity may damage NRG's reputation or its brands.\n\nNRG's  reputation  and  brands  could  be  damaged  for  numerous  reasons,  including  negative  views  of  the  Company's environmental  impact,  sustainability  goals,  supply  chain  practices,  product  and  service  offerings,  sponsorship  relationships, charitable giving programs and public statements made by Company officials. The Company may also experience criticism or backlash from media, customers, employees, government entities, advocacy groups and other stakeholders that disagree with positions  taken  by  the  Company  or  its  executives.

In addition, significant  weather  events  or  terrorist  actions  could  damage  or  shut  down  the  power  or  gas  transmission  and  distribution facilities upon which the Company is dependent, which may reduce retail volume for extended periods of time. Power or gas supply may be sold at a loss if these events cause a significant loss of retail customer demand.\n\n## The  Company has made investments,  and  may  continue  to  make  investments,  in  new  business  initiatives  predominantly focused on consumer products and in markets that may not be successful, may not achieve the intended financial results or may result in product liability and reputational risk that could adversely affect the Company.\n\nNRG continues to pursue growth in its existing businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain. Such initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current  operations,  inadequate  return  on  capital,  and  unidentified  issues  not  discovered  in  the  diligence  performed  prior  to launching an initiative or entering a market.\n\nAs  part  of  these  initiatives,  the  Company  may  be  liable  to  customers  for  any  damage  caused  to  customers'  homes, facilities, belongings or property during the installation of Company products and systems, such as home back-up generators and residential HVAC system repairs, installation and replacements. Where such work is performed by independent contractors, such as repairs performed under the Company's home warranty and protection plan products, the Company may nonetheless face  claims  and  costs  for  damage.  In  addition,  shortages  of  skilled  labor  for  Company  projects  could  significantly  delay  a project  or  otherwise  increase  its  costs.  The  products  that  the  Company  sells  or  manufactures  may  expose  the  Company  to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Although the Company maintains liability insurance, the Company cannot be certain that its coverage will be adequate  for  liabilities  actually  incurred  or  that  insurance  will  continue  to  be  available  to  the  Company  on  economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, any product liability claim or damage caused by the Company could significantly impair the Company's brand  and  reputation,  which  may  result  in  a  failure  to  maintain  customers  and  achieve  the  Company's  desired growth initiatives in these new businesses.\n\n## Changes in technology may impair the value of NRG's power plants and the attractiveness of its retail products, and the Company may potentially be affected by emerging technologies that may over time affect change in capacity markets and the energy industry overall with the inclusion of distributed generation and clean technology.\n\nResearch and development activities are ongoing in the industry to provide alternative and more efficient technologies to produce  power,  including  wind,  photovoltaic  (solar)  cells,  hydrogen,  energy  storage,  and  improvements  in  traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient gas turbines. Advances in these or other technologies could reduce the costs of power production to a level below what the Company has currently forecasted, which could adversely affect its cash flows, results of operations or competitive position. Technology, including distributed technology or changes in retail rate structures, may also have a material impact on the Company's ability to retain retail customers.\n\nSome emerging technologies,  such  as  distributed  renewable  energy  technologies,  broad  consumer  adoption  of  electric vehicles and energy storage devices, could affect the price of energy. These emerging technologies may affect the financial viability of utility counterparties and could have significant impacts on wholesale market prices, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on NRG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## NRG's business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized employees or inability to replace employees as they retire.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 12% of NRG's employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event that the Company's union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strife or disruption, NRG would be responsible for procuring replacement labor or the Company could experience reduced power  generation  or  outages.  Although  NRG's  ability  to  procure  such  labor  is  uncertain,  contingency  staffing  planning  is completed as part of each respective contract negotiation. Strikes, work stoppages or the inability to negotiate future collective",

        "page_content": "bargaining agreements on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, a number of the Company's employees at NRG's plants are close to retirement. The Company's inability to replace retiring workers could create potential knowledge and expertise gaps as such workers retire.\n\n## Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Laws\n\nNRG's  business  is  subject  to  substantial  energy  regulation  and  may  be  adversely  affected  by  legislative  or  regulatory changes,  as  well  as  liability  under,  or  any  future  inability  to  comply  with,  existing  or  future  energy  regulations  or requirements.\n\nNRG's business is subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and foreign laws. Compliance with, or changes to, the requirements under these legal regimes may cause the Company to incur significant additional costs, reduce the Company's ability  to  hedge  exposure  or  to  sell  retail  power  within  certain  states  or  to  certain  classes  of  retail  customers,  or  restrict  the Company's marketing practices, its ability to pass through costs to retail customers, or its ability to compete on favorable terms with competitors, including the incumbent utility. Retail competition and home warranty services are regulated on a state-bystate or at the province-by-province level and are highly dependent on state and provincial laws, regulations and policies, which could  change  at  any  moment.  Failure  to  comply  with  such  requirements  could  result  in  the  shutdown  of  a  non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability.\n\nPublic  utilities  under  the  FPA  are  required  to  obtain  FERC  acceptance  of  their  rate  schedules  for  wholesale  sales  of electricity.  Except  for  ERCOT  generation  facilities  and  power  marketers,  all  of  NRG's  non-qualifying  facility  generating companies and power marketing affiliates in the U.S. make sales of electricity in interstate commerce and are public utilities for purposes  of  the  FPA.  FERC  has  granted  each  of  NRG's  generating  and  power  marketing  companies  that  make  sales  of electricity outside of ERCOT the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. FERC's orders that grant NRG's generating and  power  marketing  companies  market-based  rate  authority  reserve  the  right  to  revoke  or  revise  that  authority  if  FERC subsequently determines that NRG can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, NRG's market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of NRG's generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated those rules, they are subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority. If NRG's generating and power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain FERC's acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have a material adverse effect on the rates NRG charges for power from its facilities.\n\nSubstantially  all  of  the  Company's  generation  assets  are  also  subject  to  the  reliability  standards  promulgated  by  the designated  Electric  Reliability  Organization  (currently  NERC)  and  approved  by  FERC.  If  NRG  fails  to  comply  with  the mandatory  reliability  standards,  NRG  could  be  subject  to  sanctions,  including  substantial  monetary  penalties  and  increased compliance obligations. NRG is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules that occur in the existing ISOs. The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power  markets  impose,  and  in  the  future  may  continue  to  impose,  mitigation,  including  price  limitations,  offer  caps,  nonperformance penalties and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these  markets.  These  types  of  price  limitations  and  other  regulatory  mechanisms  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the profitability of NRG's generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.\n\nThe regulatory  environment  is  subject  to  significant  changes  due  to  state  and  federal  policies  affecting  wholesale  and retail competition and the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable generation and, in some cases,  transmission.  These  changes  are  ongoing,  and  the  Company  cannot  predict  the  future  design  of  the  wholesale  power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on NRG's business. In addition, in some of these  markets,  interested  parties  have  proposed  material  market  design  changes.  If  competitive  restructuring  of  the  electric power markets is reversed, discontinued, or delayed, the Company's business prospects and financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, there have been a number of reforms to the regulation of the derivatives markets, both in the United States and internationally. These regulations, and any further changes thereto, or adoption of additional regulations, including any regulations relating to position limits on futures and other derivatives or margin for derivatives, could negatively impact NRG's  ability  to  hedge  its  portfolio  in  an  efficient,  cost-effective  manner  by,  among  other  things,  potentially  decreasing liquidity  in  the  forward  commodity  and  derivatives  markets  or  limiting  NRG's  ability  to  utilize  non-cash  collateral  for derivatives transactions.\n\n## NRG's business may be affected by interference in the competitive wholesale marketplace.\n\nNRG's  generation  and  competitive  retail  operations  rely  on  a  competitive  wholesale  marketplace.  The  competitive wholesale marketplace may be impacted by out-of-market subsidies, including bailouts of uneconomic nuclear plants, imports of power from Canada, renewable mandates or subsidies, mandates to sell power below its cost of acquisition and associated costs  as  well  as  out-of-market  payments  to  new  or  existing  generators.  These  out-of-market  subsidies  to  existing  or  new",

If these measures continue, capacity and energy prices may be suppressed, and the Company may not be successful in its efforts to insulate the competitive market from this interference. The Company's retail operations may be materially impacted by rules or regulations that allow regulated utilities to participate in competitive retail markets or own and operate facilities that could be provided by competitive market participants.\n\n## Additions or changes in tax laws and regulations could potentially affect the Company's financial results or liquidity.\n\nNRG is subject to various types of tax arising from normal business operations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Any additions or changes to tax legislation, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NRG's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations,  including  income  tax provision and accruals reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The Inflation Reduction Act, enacted on August 16, 2022, includes the implementation of a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax ('CAMT') effective in 2023. The CAMT may lead to volatility in the Company's cash tax payment obligations, particularly in periods of significant commodity or currency variability resulting from potential changes in the fair value of derivative instruments. There remains unanswered questions on how the operative rules for CAMT will be implemented and interpreted. The Company continuously monitors and assesses proposed tax legislation that could negatively impact its business.\n\n## The integration of the Capacity Performance product into the PJM market could lead to substantial changes in capacity income  and  non-performance  penalties,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NRG's  results  of  operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nPJM  operates  a  pay-for-performance  model  where  capacity  payments  are  modified  based  on  real-time  generator performance.  Capacity  market  prices  are  sensitive  to  design  parameters,  as  well  as  additions  of  new  capacity.  NRG  may experience substantial changes in capacity income and incur non-performance penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## NRG's ownership interest in a nuclear power facility subjects the Company to regulations, costs and liabilities  uniquely associated with these types of facilities.\n\nUnder the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (\"AEA\"), ownership and operation of STP, of which NRG indirectly owns a 44% interest, is subject to regulation by the NRC. Such regulation includes licensing, inspection, enforcement, testing, evaluation  and  modification  of  all  aspects  of  nuclear  reactor  power  plant  design  and  operation,  environmental  and  safety performance,  technical  and  financial  qualifications,  decommissioning  funding  assurance  and  transfer  and  foreign  ownership restrictions. The current facility operating licenses for STP expire on August 20, 2047 (Unit 1) and December 15, 2048 (Unit 2).\n\nThere are unique risks to owning and operating a nuclear power facility. These include liabilities related to the handling, treatment, storage, disposal, transport, release and use of radioactive materials, particularly with respect to spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties regarding the ultimate, and potential exposure to, technical and financial risks associated with modifying or decommissioning a nuclear facility. The NRC could require the shutdown of the plant for safety reasons or refuse to permit restart of the unit after unplanned or planned outages. New or amended NRC safety and regulatory requirements may give rise to additional operation and maintenance costs and capital expenditures. Additionally, aging equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading  and  improvement.  Any  unexpected  failure,  including  failure  associated  with  breakdowns,  forced  outages,  or  any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability. STP will be obligated to continue storing spent nuclear fuel if the U.S. DOE continues to fail to meet its contractual obligations to STP made pursuant to the U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept and dispose of STP's spent nuclear fuel. Costs associated with these risks could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, financial condition or cash flow to the extent not covered by the Decommissioning Trusts or recovered from ratepayers. In addition, to the extent that all or a part of STP is required by the NRC to permanently or temporarily shut down or modify its operations, or is otherwise subject to a forced outage, NRG may incur additional costs to the extent it is obligated to provide power from more expensive alternative sources - either NRG's own plants, third-party generators or the ERCOT - to cover the Company's then existing forward sale obligations. Such shutdown or modification could also lead to substantial costs related to the storage and disposal of radioactive materials and spent nuclear fuel.\n\nWhile STP maintains property and liability insurance for losses related to nuclear operations, there may be limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available. See also Item 15 -Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies , Nuclear Insurance .  An  accident  at  STP  or  another  nuclear  facility  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NRG's  financial condition,  its  operational  results,  reputation,  or  liquidity  as  losses  may  exceed  the  insurance  coverage  available  and/or  may result in the obligation to pay retrospective premium obligations.",

        "page_content": "NRG is subject  to  environmental  laws  that  impose  extensive  and  increasingly  stringent  requirements  on  the  Company's ongoing  operations,  as  well  as  potentially  substantial  liabilities  arising  out  of  environmental  contamination.  These environmental requirements and liabilities could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nNRG is subject to the environmental laws of foreign and U.S., federal, state and local authorities. The Company must comply with numerous environmental laws and obtain numerous governmental permits and approvals to build and operate the Company's plants. Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent over time. Should NRG fail to comply with any environmental requirements that apply to its operations, the Company could be subject to administrative, civil and/or criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take other actions seeking to curtail the Company's operations. In  addition,  when  new  requirements  take  effect  or  when  existing  environmental  requirements  are  revised,  reinterpreted  or subject to changing enforcement policies, NRG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\n## NRG's businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change, and policies  at  the  national,  regional  and  state  levels  to  regulate  GHG  emissions  and  mitigate  climate  change  which  could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nFluctuations in weather and other environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation levels, may affect consumer demand for electricity or natural gas. In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt NRG's operations and supply chain, and cause it  to  incur  significant  costs  in  preparing  for  or  responding  to  these  effects.  These  or  other  changes  in  climate  could  lead  to increased operating costs or capital expenses. NRG's customers may also experience the potential physical impacts of climate change and may incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these efforts, including changing the fuel mix and resiliency of their energy solutions and supply.\n\nHazards customary to the power production industry include the potential for unusual weather conditions, which could affect fuel pricing and availability, the Company's route to market or access to customers, i.e., transmission and distribution lines, transportation and delivery, or critical plant assets. The contribution of climate change to the frequency or intensity of weather-related events could affect NRG's operations and planning process.\n\nClimate change could also affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for the continued operation of NRG's generation plants. NRG monitors water supply risk carefully. If it is determined that a water supply risk exists that could impact projected generation levels at any plant, risk mitigation efforts are identified and evaluated for implementation.\n\nFurther, demand for NRG's energy-related services could be similarly impacted by consumers' preferences or market or regulatory factors favoring energy efficiency, lower carbon energy sources or reduced electricity or natural gas usage.\n\nNRG's GHG emissions reduction  targets  can  be  found  in  Item  1, Business  -Environmental  Regulatory  Matters .  The Company's ability to achieve these targets depends on many factors, including the ability to retire high emitting assets, ability to reduce  emissions  based  on  technological  advances  and  innovation,  and  ability  to  source  energy  from  less  carbon  intense resources. In addition, any future decarbonization efforts may increase costs, or NRG may otherwise be limited in its ability to apply  them.  The  cost  associated  with  NRG's  GHG  emissions  reduction  goals  could  be  significant.  Failure  to  achieve  the Company's emissions targets could result in a negative impact on access to and cost of capital, changing investor sentiment regarding investment in the Company or reputation harm.\n\n## Enhanced data privacy and data protection laws and regulations or any non-compliance with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect NRG's business and financial results.\n\nThe consumer privacy landscape continues to experience momentum for greater privacy protection and reform at the state and federal level in response to precedents set forth by the General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\"). The development and evolving nature of domestic and international privacy regulation and enforcement could impact and potentially limit how NRG processes personally identifiable information. Beginning January 1,  2023,  California  residents  have  increased  access  rights  (including  the  right  to  limit  the  use  and  disclosure  of  sensitive personal information), which are enforced by a new state privacy regulator, resulting in more scrutiny of business practices and disclosures. Additional states including Virginia, Utah, Connecticut, Colorado, and Nevada have similarly adopted enhanced data privacy legislation effective in 2023 and patterned after the standards set forth by CCPA, including broader data access rights,  with  Virginia  going  a  step  further  requiring  businesses  to  perform  data  protection  assessments  for  certain  processing activities.\n\nAs new laws and regulations are created, requiring businesses to implement processes to enable customer access to their data  and  enhanced  data  protection  and  management  standards,  NRG  cannot  forecast  the  impact  that  they  may  have  on  the Company's  business.  Any  non-compliance  with  laws  may  result  in  proceedings  or  actions  against  the  Company  by",

Moreover,  any  inquiries  or  investigations,  government  penalties  or  sanctions,  or  civil actions  by  individuals  may  be  costly  to  comply  with,  resulting  in  negative  publicity,  increased  operating  costs,  significant management time and attention,  and  may  lead  to  remedies  that  harm  the  business,  including  fines,  demands  or  orders  that existing business practices be modified or terminated.\n\n## NRG's retail operations are subject to changing rules and regulations that could have a material impact on the Company's profitability.\n\nThe competitiveness of NRG's retail operations partially depends on regulatory policies that establish the structure, rules, terms and conditions on which services are offered to retail customers. These policies can include, among other things, controls on the retail rates that NRG can charge, the imposition of additional costs on sales, restrictions on the Company's ability to obtain new customers through various marketing channels and disclosure requirements. The Company's retail operations may be materially impacted by rules or regulations that allow regulated utilities to participate in competitive retail markets or own and  operate  facilities  that  could  be  provided  by  competitive  market  participants.  Additionally,  state,  federal  or  provincial imposition of net metering or RPS programs can make it more or less expensive for retail customers to supplement or replace their reliance on grid power.\n\n## The  Company's  international  operations  are  exposed  to  political  and  economic  risks,  commercial  instability  and  events beyond  the  Company's  control  in  the  countries  in  which  it  operates,  which  risks  may  negatively  impact  the  Company's business.\n\nThe  Company's  international  operations  depend  on  products  manufactured,  purchased  and  sold  in  the  U.S.  and internationally.  In  some  cases,  these  countries  have  greater  political  and  economic  volatility  and  greater  vulnerability  to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in NRG's other markets. Operating a business in a number of different regions and countries  exposes  the  Company  to  a  number  of  risks,  including:  multiple  and  potentially  conflicting  laws,  regulations  and policies that are subject to change, imposition of currency restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints, imposition of  burdensome  tariffs  or  quotas,  national  and  international  conflict,  including  terrorist  acts  and  political  and  economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.\n\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Risks Related to the Economic and Financial Market Conditions, and the Company's Indebtedness\n\nNRG's level  of  indebtedness  could  adversely  affect  its  ability  to  raise  additional  capital  to  fund  its  operations  or  return capital to stockholders. It could also expose it to the risk of increased interest rates and limit its ability to react to changes in the economy or its industry.\n\nNRG's substantial debt could have negative consequences, including:\n\n- \u00b7 increasing NRG's vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n- \u00b7 requiring a substantial portion of NRG's cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing NRG's ability to pay dividends or to use its cash flow to fund its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n- \u00b7 limiting NRG's ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support;\n- \u00b7 limiting NRG's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n- \u00b7 limiting NRG's ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who have less debt; and\n- \u00b7 exposing NRG to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of its borrowings are at variable rates of interest, primarily through its Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nThe Company's credit documents contain financial and other restrictive covenants that may limit the Company's ability to return  capital  to  stockholders  or  otherwise  engage  in  activities  that  may  be  in  its  long-term  best  interests.  NRG's  failure  to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all  of  the  Company's  indebtedness.  The  Company's  corporate  credit  agreement  includes  a  sustainability-linked  metric  and sustainability-linked bonds, which could result in increased interest expense to the Company if the sustainability metrics set forth therein are not met. Furthermore, financial and other restrictive covenants contained in any project level subsidiary debt may limit the ability of NRG to receive distributions from such subsidiary.\n\nIn addition, NRG's ability to arrange financing, either at the corporate level, a non-recourse project-level subsidiary or otherwise, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on numerous factors, including: general economic and capital market conditions;  credit  availability  from  banks  and  other  financial  institutions;  investor  confidence  in  NRG,  its  partners  and  the",

The failure to obtain additional capital from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its business and operations.\n\n## Adverse  economic  conditions  could  adversely  affect  NRG's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash flows.\n\nAdverse  economic  conditions,  including  inflation,  and  declines  in  wholesale  energy  prices,  partially  resulting  from adverse economic conditions, may impact NRG's results of operations. The breadth and depth of negative economic conditions may have a wide-ranging impact on the U.S. business environment. In addition, adverse economic conditions also reduce the demand for energy commodities. Reduced demand from negative economic conditions continues to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets NRG serves. In general, economic and commodity market conditions will continue to impact NRG's unhedged  future  energy  margins,  liquidity,  earnings  growth  and  overall  financial  condition.  In  addition,  adverse  economic conditions, declines in wholesale energy prices, reduced demand for energy and other factors may negatively impact the trading price of NRG's common stock and impact forecasted cash flows, which may require NRG to evaluate its goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment. Any such impairment could have a material impact on NRG's financial condition.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets that NRG has recorded in connection with its acquisitions are subject to impairment evaluations and, as a result, the Company could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill and other intangible assets, which may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nGoodwill  is  not  amortized  but  is  reviewed  annually  or  more  frequently  for  impairment.  Other  intangibles  are  also reviewed at least annually or more frequently, if certain conditions exist, and are amortized. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect NRG's reported results of operations and financial position in future periods.\n\n## Risks Related to Public Health Threats\n\n## Public  health  threats  or  outbreaks  of  communicable  diseases  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's operations and financial results .\n\nThe  Company  may  face  risks  related  to  public  health  threats  or  outbreaks  of  communicable  diseases.  A  widespread healthcare  crisis,  such  as  an  outbreak  of  a  communicable  disease,  could  adversely  affect  the  global  economy  and  the Company's  ability  to  conduct  its  business  for  an  indefinite  period  of  time.  For  example,  the  ongoing  global  COVID-19 pandemic  negatively  impacted  local  and  global  economies,  disrupted  financial  markets  and  international  trade,  resulted  in increased  unemployment  levels  and  impacted  local  and  global  supply  chains,  all  of  which  also  negatively  impacted  the electricity industry and the Company's business. Federal, state, and local governments have implemented, and may continue to implement, various mitigation measures, including travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, shelterin-place  orders  and  limitations  on  business  activities.  Although  the  operations  of  the  Company  are  considered  an  essential service, some of these measures may adversely impact the ability of NRG employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other business partners to conduct business activities. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, risk exposure and liquidity.",

A discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2020 may be found in Part II, Item 7 -Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nNRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a consumer services company built on dynamic retail brands. NRG brings the power of energy to customers by producing and selling energy and related products and services, nation-wide in the U.S. and  Canada  in  a  manner  that  delivers  value  to  all  of  NRG's  stakeholders.  NRG  sells  power,  natural  gas,  home  and  power services, and develops innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under the brand names NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green  Mountain  Energy,  Stream,  and  XOOM  Energy.  The  Company  has  a  customer  base  that  includes  approximately 5.4 million Home customers as well as commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers, supported by approximately 16 GW of generation as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## Business Environment\n\nThe industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company, its businesses, and the retail energy and power generation industry in 2022 and for the future medium term include:\n\nMarket Dynamics -  The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates. Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, global LNG demand, exports of natural gas, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas customers and producers. In 2022, the average natural gas price at Henry Hub was 73% higher than in 2021.\n\nNRG may experience impacts to gross margins due to significant, rapid changes in current natural gas prices and the lag in its ability to make a corresponding adjustment to the retail rates it charges customers on term and month to month contracts. The Company hedges its load commitments in order to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices, and as a result, these gross margin impacts would be realized in future periods until it is able to make the corresponding adjustments to the retail customer rates.\n\nThe  relative  price  of  natural  gas  as  compared  to  coal  is  the  primary  driver  of  coal  demand.  Coal  commodity  prices decreased in 2022 although supply chain disruptions are still affecting coal deliveries, as further discussed below in Global Supply Chain Disruptions.\n\nElectricity Prices - The price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the Company. Many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the  Company's  profitability.  An  increase  in  supply  cost  volatility  in  the  competitive  retail  markets  may  result  in  smaller companies choosing to exit the market, which may result in further consolidation in the competitive retail space. The following table  summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which NRG operates for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The average on-peak power prices decreased significantly in Texas due to Winter Storm Uri's impact on 2021 pricing. East and West average on-peak prices increased as a result of higher natural gas prices.",

As a result, policymakers and regulators at regional, national, sub-national and local levels of government, both in the U.S. and other parts of the world, are increasingly focused on actions to combat climate change.\n\nNRG actively monitors climate change related developments that could impact its business and regularly engages with a diverse set of stakeholders on these issues. Such engagement helps the Company identify and pursue potential opportunities both to decarbonize its business and better serve its customers. NRG is committed to providing transparent disclosures of its climate  risks  and  opportunities  to  stakeholders.  The  Company  was  an  early  supporter  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\") recommendations after they were issued in 2017, published a TCFD mapping disclosure in December 2020 and issued a stand-alone TCFD report in December 2021.\n\nLower Carbon Infrastructure Development - Policy mechanisms at the state and federal level, including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, RPS, and carbon trading plans, have supported  and  continue  to  support  the  development  of  renewable  generation,  demand-side  and  smart  grid,  and  other  lower carbon infrastructure technologies. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, is intended to further support  the  deployment  of  lower  carbon  energy  technologies.  As  costs  associated  with  the  development  of  lower  carbon infrastructure,  such  as  wind  and  solar  generating  facilities,  continue  to  evolve  and  impact  development  of  lower  carbon infrastructure in the markets where the Company participates, it may impact the ability of the Company's generating facilities to participate in those markets. According to ERCOT, 41% of 2022 energy consumption in the ERCOT market was generated from carbon emission-free resources, with wind power contributing 25%. In addition, as subsidies and incentives contribute to increases in renewable power sources, customer awareness and preferences are shifting toward sustainable solutions. Increased demand for sustainable energy products from both residential and commercial customers creates opportunities for diversified product offerings in competitive retail markets.\n\nDigitization and Customization -  The electric industry is experiencing major technology changes in the way power is distributed and consumed by end-use customers. The electric grid is shifting from a centralized analog system, where power is generated  from  limited  sources  and  flows  in  one  direction,  to  a  decentralized  multidirectional  system,  where  power  can  be generated from a number of distributed resources and stored or dispatched on an as-needed basis. In addition, customers are seeking new ways to engage with their power providers. Technologies like smart thermostats, smart appliances and electric vehicles are giving individuals more choice and control over their electricity usage.\n\nWeather -  Weather  conditions  in  the  regions  of  the  U.S.  in  which  NRG  conducts  business  influence  the  Company's financial  results.  Weather  conditions  can  affect  the  supply  and  demand  for  electricity  and  fuels  and  may  also  impact  the availability of the Company's generating assets. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Company's results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter. However, all regions of the U.S. typically do not experience  extreme  weather  conditions  at  the  same  time,  thus  NRG's  operations  are  typically  not  exposed  to  the  effects  of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once.",

These supply chain disruptions are due in part to a number of factors outside the Company's control including geopolitical conflicts, public  policy  of  the  federal  government,  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  labor  shortages  and  extreme  weather  events  in  the  U.S. These factors are impacting the dispatch of generation facilities, as well as the costs to serve retail customers. The Company expects that supply chain disruptions will continue throughout the remainder of 2023. NRG is working closely with its suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts of these events. The Company will continue to actively monitor all direct and indirect potential impacts of the supply chain disruptions, and will seek to mitigate and minimize their impact on business.\n\nOther  Factors -  A  number  of  other  factors  significantly  influence  the  level  and  volatility  of  prices  for  energy commodities and related derivative products for NRG's business. These factors include:\n\n- \u00b7 seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;\n- \u00b7 extreme peak demands;\n- \u00b7 performance of renewable generation;\n- \u00b7 available supply resources;\n- \u00b7 transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;\n- \u00b7 location of NRG's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;\n- \u00b7 procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and\n- \u00b7 changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.\n\nThese factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:\n\n- \u00b7 weather conditions;\n- \u00b7 market liquidity;\n- \u00b7 capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;\n- \u00b7 local transportation systems; and\n- \u00b7 the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.\n\nEnvironmental Matters, Regulatory Matters and Legal Proceedings - Details of environmental matters are presented in Item 15 -  Note 25, Environmental Matters , to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1 -Business, Environmental Matters .

The Company will pay $12 per share, or approximately $2.8 billion in  cash,  and  expects  to  fund  the  acquisition  using  proceeds  from  newly  issued  debt  and  preferred  equity,  drawing  on  its Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facilities, and through cash on hand. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2023, NRG increased its Revolving Credit Facility by $600 million to meet the additional liquidity requirements related to the acquisition. Close of the acquisition is targeted for the first quarter of 2023 and is subject to customary closing conditions. See Item 15 -Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\n## Astoria\n\nOn January 6, 2023, NRG closed on the sale of land and related assets from the Astoria site, within the East region of operations, for initial proceeds of $212 million subject to transaction fees of $3 million and certain indemnifications. As part of the transaction, NRG entered into an agreement to lease the land back for the purpose of operating the Astoria gas turbines through the  planned  April  30,  2023  retirement  date.  The  operating  lease  agreement  is  expected  to  end  six  months  after  the facility's actual retirement date. See Item 15 -Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.",

        "page_content": "## Sale of Watson\n\nOn June 1, 2022, the Company closed on the sale of its 49% ownership in the Watson natural gas generating facility for $59 million. NRG recognized a gain on the sale of $46 million.\n\n## Retirement of Joliet\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, the results of the PJM Base Residual Auction for the 2023/2024 delivery year were released leading the Company to revise its long-term view of certain facilities and announce the planned retirement of the Joliet generating facility on June 1, 2023. Impairment losses of $20 million and $130 million were recorded on the PJM generating assets and Midwest Generation goodwill, respectively.\n\n## W.A. Parish Extended Outage\n\nIn  May  2022,  W.A.  Parish  Unit  8  came  offline  as  a  result  of  damage  to  the  steam  turbine/generator.  Based  on  work completed to date, NRG is targeting to return the unit to service by the end of the second quarter of 2023. The Company is working with its insurers related to claims surrounding the outage and has received partial settlements in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n## Limestone Unit 1 Return to Service\n\nIn early July 2021, Limestone Unit 1 came offline as a result of damage to the duct work associated with the FGD system. The extended forced outage ended in April of 2022 and the unit has returned to service.\n\n## ERCOT Securitization Proceeds\n\nDuring February 2021, Texas experienced unprecedented cold temperatures for a prolonged duration as a result of Winter Storm Uri, resulting in a power emergency, blackouts, and an estimated all-time peak demand of 77 GW (without load shed). In 2021, the Texas Legislature passed HB 4492 for ERCOT to mitigate exceptionally high price adders and ancillary service costs incurred by LSEs during Winter Storm Uri. HB 4492 authorized ERCOT to obtain $2.1 billion of financing to distribute to LSEs that were charged and paid to ERCOT those highly priced ancillary service and ORDPA during Winter Storm Uri. The Company accounted for the proceeds as a reduction to cost of operations within its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the 2021 annual period for which the proceeds were intended to compensate. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Winter Storm Uri's pre-tax financial impact to the Company was a loss of $380 million, which reflects the recovery of $689 million of cost of operations as a result of the proceeds. The Company received the proceeds of $689 million from ERCOT in June 2022.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nIn December 2021, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase $1.0 billion of its common stock, of which $44 million was repurchased in 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased $601 million of shares at an average price of $40.50 per share, including $6 million of equivalent shares purchased in lieu of tax withholdings on equity compensation issuances. The remaining $355 million repurchases under the $1.0 billion authorization are expected to be repurchased in 2023, subject to the availability of excess cash and full visibility of the achievement of the Company's 2023 targeted credit metrics. . See Item 15 - Note 16, Capital Structure , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\n## Renewable Power Purchase Agreements\n\nThe Company's strategy is to procure mid to long-term renewable generation through power purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2022, NRG has entered into Renewable PPAs totaling approximately 2.4 GW, of which approximately 45% are operational. The average tenor of these agreements is twelve years. The Company expects to continue evaluating and executing similar  agreements  that  support  the  needs  of  the  business.  The  total  GW  entered  into  through  Renewable  PPAs  may  be impacted by contract terminations when they occur.\n\n## Dividend Increase\n\nIn  the  first  quarter  of  2022,  NRG  increased  the  annual  dividend  to  $1.40  from  $1.30  per  share.  In  2023,  NRG  further increased the annual dividend to $1.51 per share, representing an 8% increase from 2022. The Company expects to target an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in subsequent years.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nWhile the pandemic presented risks, as further described in Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, to the Company's  business,  there  was  not  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  Company's  results  of  operations  for  the  years  ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.",

Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not  a  substitute  for  the  Company's  presentation  of  gross  margin,  which  is  the  most  directly  comparable  GAAP  measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to  investors  as  it  is  a  key  operational  measure  reviewed  by  the  Company's  chief  operating  decision  maker.  Economic  gross margin is defined as the sum of retail revenue, energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels, purchased energy and other cost of sales. Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities,  contract  amortization, emission credit amortization, depreciation and amortization, operations and maintenance, or other costs of operations.",

The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged.\n\nThe reversals of acquired gain or loss positions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition date.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the $83 million loss in revenues from economic hedge positions was driven by a decrease  in  the  value  of  open  positions  as  a  result  of  increases  in  power  prices  across  all  segments,  partially  offset  by  the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period. The $1.3 billion gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of  increases  in  natural  gas  and  power  prices  across  all  segments  partially  offset  by  the  reversal  of  previously  recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the $164 million loss in revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by a decrease in the value of open positions as a result of increases in East and West/Services/Other power prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period. The $2.9 billion gain in  operating  costs  and  expenses  from  economic  hedge  positions  was  driven  primarily  by  an  increase  in  the  value  of  open positions as a result of increases in natural gas and power prices across all segments as well as the reversal of acquired contracts that settled during the year.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy  commodities  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022  and  2021.

Concurrently, Fitch assigned NRG a first-time issuer Default Rating of BB+ with a stable outlook. There was no change to Moody's rating during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's current credit ratings:\n\n|                                                                                                          | S&P          | Moody's    | Fitch      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------|------------|\n| NRG Energy, Inc.   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | BB+ Negative | Ba1 Stable | BB+ Stable |\n| 3.75% Senior Secured Notes, due 2024                                                                     | BBB-         | Baa3       | BBB-       |\n| 2.00% Senior Secured Notes, due 2025                                                                     | BBB-         | Baa3       | BBB-       |\n| 2.45% Senior Secured Notes, due 2027                                                                     | BBB-         | Baa3       | BBB-       |\n| 6.625% Senior Notes, due 2027   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | BB+          | Ba2        | BB+        |\n| 5.75% Senior Notes, due 2028   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | BB+          | Ba2        | BB+        |\n| 3.375% Senior Notes, due 2029   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | BB+          | Ba2        | BB+        |\n| 4.45% Senior Secured Notes, due 2029                                                                     | BBB-         | Baa3       | BBB-       |\n| 5.25% Senior Notes, due 2029   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | BB+          | Ba2        | BB+        |\n| 3.625% Senior Notes, due 2031   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | BB+          | Ba2        | BB+        |\n| 3.875% Senior Notes, due 2032   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | BB+          | Ba2        | BB+        |\n| Revolving Credit Facility, due 2024   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | BBB-         | Baa3       | BBB-       |\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe principal sources of liquidity for NRG's operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived from cash on hand,  cash  flows  from  operations  and  financing  arrangements.  As  described  in  Item  15  Note  13, Long-term  Debt  and Finance Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist mainly of the Senior Notes, Convertible Senior Notes, Senior Secured First Lien Notes, Revolving Credit Facility, and tax-exempt bonds.\n\nThe Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized  by  the  following:  (i)  market  operations  activities;  (ii)  debt  service  obligations,  as  described  more  fully  in Item 15 -  Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases , to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including  maintenance,  repowering,  development,  and  environmental;  and  (iv)  allocations  in  connection  with  acquisition opportunities, debt repayments, share repurchases and dividend payments to stockholders, as described in Item 15 -  Note 16, Capital Structure , to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company remains committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and continues to work to achieve investment grade credit metrics over time primarily through debt reduction and the realization of growth initiatives.\n\n## ERCOT Securitization Proceeds\n\nDuring February 2021, Texas experienced unprecedented cold temperatures for a prolonged duration as a result of Winter Storm Uri, resulting in a power emergency, blackouts, and an estimated all-time peak demand of 77 GW (without load shed). In 2021, the Texas Legislature passed HB 4492 for ERCOT to mitigate exceptionally high price adders and ancillary service costs incurred by LSEs during Winter Storm Uri. HB 4492 authorized ERCOT to obtain $2.1 billion of financing to distribute to LSEs that were charged and paid to ERCOT those highly priced ancillary service and ORDPA during Winter Storm Uri. The Company accounted for the proceeds as a reduction to cost of operations within its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the 2021 annual period for which the proceeds were intended to compensate.

These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (e.g. buying fuel before receiving  energy  revenues);  and  (iv)  initial  collateral  for  large  structured  transactions.  As  of  December  31,  2022,  market operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $260 million and $4.0 billion outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its market activities. As of December 31, 2022, total funds deposited by counterparties were $1.7 billion in cash and $888 million of letters of credit.\n\nThe Company has entered into long-term contractual arrangements to procure certain fuel and transportation services for the  Company's  generation  assets.  As  of  December  31,  2022,  the  Company  had  minimum  payment  obligations  under  such outstanding agreements of $452 million, with $110 million payable within the next 12 months. Additionally, the Company has long-term  contractual  commitments  related  to  electricity  and  natural  gas  products,  including  power  purchases,  gas",

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had minimum purchased energy commitments under long-term contracts of $4.3 billion, with $908 million payable within the next 12 months, and an additional  $1.5  billion  of  short-term  purchase  energy  commitments.  For  further  discussion,  see  Item  15  Note  23, Commitments and Contingencies .\n\nFuture liquidity requirements may change based on the Company's hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the Company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.\n\n## First Lien Structure\n\nNRG has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of the Company's assets, subject to various exclusions  including  NRG's  assets  that  have  project-level  financing  and  the  assets  of  certain  non-guarantor  subsidiaries,  to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its  obligations  under  out-of-the-money  hedge  agreements  for  forward  sales  of  power  or  MWh  equivalents.  The  first  lien program does not limit the volume that can be hedged or the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. The first lien program also does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. The first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.\n\nThe Company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. As of December 31, 2022, all hedges under the first liens were out-of-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  amount  of  MW  hedged  against  the  Company's  coal  and  nuclear  assets  and  as  a percentage  relative  to  the  Company's  coal  and  nuclear  capacity  under  the  first  lien  structure  as  of  December  31,  2022:\n\n| Equivalent Net Sales Secured by First Lien Structure  (a)                                                                                                                    | 2023   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| In MW  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 608    |\n| As a percentage of total net coal and nuclear capacity  (b)     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                      | 17%    |\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  Company's  capital  expenditures  for  maintenance,  environmental  and  growth investments for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                                            | Maintenance   | Environmental   | Growth  Investments (a)   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|---------|\n| Texas  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | $  (205)  $   | (1)  $          | (67)  $                   | (273)   |\n| East   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (3)           | -               | (4)                       | (7)     |\n| West/Services/Other   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .            | (23)          | -               | (14)                      | (37)    |\n| Corporate    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | (4)           | -               | (46)                      | (50)    |\n| Total cash capital expenditures for 2022    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                      | (235)         | (1)             | (131)                     | (367)   |\n| Investments    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | -             | -               | (118)                     | (118)   |\n| Total capital expenditures and investments                                                               | $  (235)  $   | (1)  $          | (249)  $                  | (485)   |\n\nGrowth investments for the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  include  expenditures  for  small  book  acquisitions,  service acquisitions, integration operating expenses, as well as the Encina site improvements classified as ARO payments.

For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  the  Company  utilized  U.S.  federal  NOLs  of $206 million due to current year taxable income, and tax credits of $8 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has cumulative U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $8.2 billion, which do not have an expiration date, and cumulative state NOL carryforwards of $5.3 billion for financial statement purposes. NRG also has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $382 million, most of which have no expiration date. In addition to the above NOLs, NRG has a $270 million indefinite carryforward for interest deductions, as well as $393 million of tax credits to be utilized in future years. As a result of the Company's tax position, including the utilization of federal and state NOLs, and based on current forecasts, the Company anticipates income tax payments, due to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, of up to $59 million in 2023.\n\nThe Company has $22 million of tax effected uncertain federal and state tax benefits for which the Company has recorded a non-current tax liability of $24 million (including accrued interest) until such final resolution with the related taxing authority.\n\nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2019. With few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2014.\n\n## Guarantor Financial Information\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company's outstanding registered senior notes consisted of $375 million of the 2027 Senior Notes and $821 million of the 2028 Senior Notes, as shown in Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases .  These Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of NRG's current and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries, or guarantor subsidiaries (the 'Guarantors'). See Exhibit 22.1 for a listing of the Guarantors. These guarantees are both joint and several.\n\nNRG  conducts  much  of  its  business  through  and  derives  much  of  its  income  from  its  subsidiaries.  Therefore,  the Company's ability to make required payments with respect to its indebtedness and other obligations depends on the financial results and condition of its subsidiaries and NRG's ability to receive funds from its subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of any of the Guarantors to transfer funds to NRG. Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either NRG Energy, Inc. or the Guarantors (such subsidiaries are referred to as the 'Non-Guarantors'). The Non-Guarantors include all of NRG's foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries.\n\nThe tables below present summarized financial information of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with Rule 3-10 under the SEC's Regulation S-X. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with U.S. GAAP.",

In  addition,  in  order  to  mitigate  foreign  exchange  rate  risk  primarily  associated  with  the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\n\nNRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are  recognized  on  the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value  and  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these  derivative  financial  instruments  are recognized in earnings.\n\nThe tables below disclose the activities that include both exchange and non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair  value  in  accordance  with  ASC  820, Fair  Value  Measurements  and  Disclosures (\"ASC  820\").  Specifically,  these  tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2022, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2022. For  a  full  discussion  of  the  Company's  valuation  methodology  of  its  contracts,  see Derivative  Fair  Value  Measurements in Item 15 -  Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments , to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n| Derivative Activity Gains/(Losses)                                                                                                                                      | (In millions)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Fair value of contracts as of December 31, 2021  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  | $  2,341        |\n| Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period                                                                                                               | (1,225)         |\n| Changes in fair value   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 2,437           |\n| Fair value of contracts as of December 31, 2022  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  | $  3,553        |\n\n| (In millions)                                                                | Fair Value of Contracts as of December 31, 2022 Maturity   | Fair Value of Contracts as of December 31, 2022 Maturity   | Fair Value of Contracts as of December 31, 2022 Maturity   | Fair Value of Contracts as of December 31, 2022 Maturity   | Fair Value of Contracts as of December 31, 2022 Maturity   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fair value hierarchy Gains                                                   | 1 Year or Less                                             | Greater Than 1  Year to 3 Years                            | Greater Than 3  Years to 5  Years                          | Greater Than 5 Years                                       | Total Fair Value                                           |\n| Level 1  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | $  219                                                     | $  427                                                     | $  22                                                      | $  17                                                      | $  685                                                     |\n| Level 2  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 1,354                                                      | 794                                                        | 186                                                        | 29                                                         | 2,363                                                      |\n| Level 3  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 118                                                        | 74                                                         | 88                                                         | 225                                                        | 505                                                        |\n| Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  1,691                                                   | $  1,295                                                   | $  296                                                     | $  271                                                     | $  3,553                                                   |",

        "page_content": "The Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. Also, collateral received or posted on the Company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Company's portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Commodity Price Risk , NRG measures the sensitivity of the Company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict  risk  of  loss  based  on  market  price  and  volatility.  NRG's  risk  management  policy  places  a  limit  on  one-day  holding period VaR, which limits the Company's net open position. As the Company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of NRG's hedging activity. As of December 31, 2022, NRG's net derivative asset was $3.6 billion, an increase to total fair value of $1.2 billion as compared to December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by gains in fair value, partially offset by roll-off of trades that settled during the period.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in an increase of approximately $1.4 billion in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a decrease of approximately $1.4 billion in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe  Company's  discussion  and  analysis  of  the  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  are  based  upon  the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory  challenges,  and  the  fair  value  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities.  These  judgments,  in  and  of  themselves,  could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the accounting guidance has not changed.\n\nNRG evaluates these estimates, on an ongoing basis, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.\n\nThe Company identifies its most critical accounting estimates as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal  of  the  Company's  financial  position  and  results  of  operations,  and  require  the  most  difficult,  subjective,  and/or complex judgments by management about matters that are inherently uncertain.",

environments and requirements\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe  Company  follows  the  guidance  of  ASC  815, Derivatives  and  Hedging  \"(A SC  815\"),  to  account  for  derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires the Company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize fair  value  change  in  earnings,  unless  they  qualify  for  the  NPNS  exception.  ASC  815  applies  to  NRG's  energy  related commodity contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.\n\nFor purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, the Company uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value. These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.\n\nIn order to mitigate foreign exchange risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\n\nCertain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that the Company has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on expected load requirements, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives  that  are  considered  to  be  NPNS  are  exempt  from  derivative  accounting  treatment  and  are  accounted  for  under accrual  accounting.  If  it  is  determined  that  a  transaction  designated  as  NPNS  no  longer  meets  the  scope  exception  due  to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.",

        "page_content": "## Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  NRG's  deferred  tax  assets  were  primarily  the  result  of  U.S.  federal  and  state  NOLs,  the difference  between  book  and  tax  basis  in  property,  plant,  and  equipment,  and  tax  credit  carryforwards.  The  realization  of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. The evaluation of deferred tax  assets  requires  judgment  in  assessing  the  likely  future  tax  consequences  of  events  that  have  been  recognized  in  the Company's financial statements or tax returns and forecasting future profitability by tax jurisdiction.\n\nThe Company evaluates its deferred tax assets quarterly on a jurisdictional basis to determine whether adjustments to the valuation  allowance  are  appropriate  considering  changes  in  facts  or  circumstances.  As  of  each  reporting  date,  management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, when determining the future realization of the Company's deferred tax assets. Given the Company's current level of pre-tax earnings and forecasted future pre-tax earnings, the Company expects to generate income before taxes in the U.S. in future periods at a level that would fully utilize its U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and the majority of its state NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration.\n\nThe Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of $224 million as of December 31, 2022 against deferred tax assets  consisting  of  state  net  operating  losses  and  foreign  NOL  carryforwards  in  jurisdictions  where  the  Company  does  not currently believe that the realization of deferred tax assets is more likely than not. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's valuation allowance balance was $248 million.\n\nConsiderable  judgment  is  required  to  determine  the  tax  treatment  of  a  particular  item  that  involves  interpretations  of complex tax laws. The Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction  and  various  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions,  including  operations  located  in  Australia  and  Canada.  The  Company continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions.\n\nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2019. With few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2014.\n\nNRG does not intend, nor currently foresee a need, to repatriate funds held at its international operations into the U.S. These funds are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in its foreign operations and the Company has not changed its assertion with respect to distributions of funds that would require the accrual of U.S. income tax.\n\n## Evaluation of Assets for Impairment\n\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (\" ASC 360\"), the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events include:\n\n- \u00b7 Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n- \u00b7 Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;\n- \u00b7 Adverse business climate;\n- \u00b7 Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amounts originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;\n- \u00b7 Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and\n- \u00b7 Change in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold, or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n\nRecoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power and natural gas prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques, such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\n\nFor assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets heldfor-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by",

        "page_content": "their nature, subjective. The Company considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence  of  such  information,  NRG  may  consider  prices  of  similar  assets,  consult  with  brokers,  or  employ  other  valuation techniques. The Company will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative  of  the  risk  involved  with  such  an  investment  or  asset.  The  use  of  these  methods  involves  the  same  inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in NRG's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\n\nAnnually, during the fourth quarter, the Company revises its views of power and fuel prices including the Company's fundamental view for long-term prices, forecasted generation and operating and capital expenditures, in connection with the preparation of its annual budget. Changes to the Company's views of long-term power and fuel prices impact the Company's projections of profitability, based on management's estimate of supply and demand within the sub-markets for its operations and the physical and economic characteristics of each of its businesses.\n\nFor further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 11 , Asset Impairments .\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company reported goodwill of $1.7 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion from the acquisition of Direct  Energy in 2021 and $408 million for retail operations acquisitions, including Stream Energy, which was acquired in 2019.\n\nThe Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations (\"ASC 805\"), and ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\" ASC 350\") to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted-average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized.  Goodwill  is  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  or  more  frequently  whenever  an  event  or  change  in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the  Company's  operating  segments  constitute  businesses  for  which  discrete  financial  information  is  available  and  whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment  assessment  as  of  December  31  or  when  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  fair  value  of  the reporting unit may be below the carrying amount. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing to its book value. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, the Company's goodwill will be impaired at that time.\n\nFair  value  determinations  require  considerable  judgment  and  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  underlying  assumptions  and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\n\nFor further discussion, see Evaluation of Assets for Impairment caption above, and Item 15 - Note 11 , Asset Impairments .\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nNRG accounts for business acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting prescribed under ASC 805. Under this method,  the  Company  is  required  to  record  on  its  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  the  estimated  fair  values  of  the  acquired company's assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant estimates and judgments. Fair value is determined based on the estimated price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities that involved the most subjectivity in determining fair value consisted of the trade names, customer relationships and derivative contracts.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  trade  names  and  customer  relationships  are  measured  using  income-based  valuation  methodologies, which include  certain  assumptions  such  as  forecasted  future  cash  flows,  customer  attrition  rates,  royalty  rates  and  discount rates. The trade names are amortized to depreciation and amortization, on a straight line basis. The customer relationships are amortized to depreciation and amortization, ratably based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nIn  measuring  the  fair  value  of  derivative  contracts  for  Direct  Energy,  a  significant  portion  of  the  fair  value  of  the derivative portfolio was based on price quotes from brokers in active markets who regularly facilitate those transactions and the Company believes such price quotes are executable. The Company does not use third-party sources that derive price based on proprietary models or market surveys. The remainder of the assets and liabilities represents contracts for which external sources or observable market quotes are not available. These contracts were valued based on various valuation techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. The fair value of each contract was discounted using a risk free interest rate. In addition, the Company",

NRG describes in detail its acquisitions in Item 15 -  Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions , to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Contingencies\n\nNRG records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and  the  amount  of  the  loss,  or  range  of  loss,  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Gain  contingencies  are  not  recorded  until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 -  Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments\n\nSee  Item  15  Note  2, Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies, to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  a discussion of recent accounting developments.\n\n## Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nNRG is exposed to several market risks in the Company's normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may  result  from  market  changes  associated  with  the  Company's  retail  operations,  merchant  power  generation,  or  with  an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transactions. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency exchange risk. In order to manage these risks, the Company uses  various  fixed-price  forward  purchase  and  sales  contracts,  futures  and  option  contracts  traded  on  NYMEX  and  other exchanges, and swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter financial markets to:\n\n- \u00b7 Manage and hedge fixed-price purchase and sales commitments;\n- \u00b7 Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices, and\n- \u00b7 Hedge fuel requirements for the Company's generating facilities.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nCommodity  price  risks  result  from  exposures  to  changes  in  spot  prices,  forward  prices,  volatilities,  and  correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal, oil, and emissions credits. NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Company's load servicing obligations and merchant generation operations by entering into various derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales and purchases of power and fuel. NRG measures the risk of the Company's portfolio using several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests, scenario tests, stress tests, position reports and VaR. NRG uses a Monte Carlo simulation based VaR model to estimate the potential loss in the fair value of its energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, gas transportation and storage assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions, based on historical and forward values for factors such as customer demand, weather, commodity availability and commodity prices. The Company's VaR model is based on a one-day holding period at a 95% confidence interval for the forward 36 months, not including the spot month. The VaR model is not a complete picture of all risks that may affect the Company's results.

        "page_content": "financial instruments calculated using the diversified VaR model for the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset management and trading was $413 million as of December 31, 2022, primarily driven by asset-backed transactions.\n\n## Retail Customer Credit Risk\n\nNRG is exposed to retail credit risk related to its Business and Home customers. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and the  loss  of  in-the-money  forward  value.  NRG  manages  retail  credit  risk  through  the  use  of  established  credit  policies  that include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures, such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  Company's  retail  customer  credit  exposure  to  Home  and  Business  customers  was diversified  across  many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. Current economic conditions may affect the Company's customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead  to  an  increase  in  credit  losses.  The  Company's  provision  for  credit  losses  resulting  from  credit  risk  was  $11  million, $698 million and $108 million for the years ending December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for credit losses included the Company's loss mitigation efforts recognized as income of $126 million related to Winter Storm Uri. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the provision for credit losses included $596 million of expenses due to the impacts of Winter Storm Uri.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Company's activities and the management of the Company's assets and liabilities. The Company is currently exposed to additional collateral posting if natural gas prices decline, primarily due to the long natural gas equivalent position at various exchanges used to hedge NRG's retail supply load obligations.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis for power and gas positions under marginable contracts as of December 31, 2022, a $0.50 per  MMBtu  decrease  in  natural  gas  prices  across  the  term  of  the  marginable  contracts  would  cause  an  increase  in  margin collateral posted of approximately $811 million and a 1.00 MMBtu/MWh decrease in heat rates for heat rate positions would result in an increase in margin collateral posted of approximately $380 million. This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin-related contract provisions as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established  credit  approval  process;  (ii)  a  daily  monitoring  of  counterparties'  credit  limits;  (iii)  the  use  of  credit  mitigation measures  such  as  margin,  collateral,  prepayment  arrangements,  or  volumetric  limits;  (iv)  the  use  of  payment  netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the  amount  and  timing  of  expected  cash  flows.  The  Company  seeks  to  mitigate  counterparty  risk  by  having  a  diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  counterparty  credit  exposure,  excluding  credit  exposure  from  RTOs,  ISOs,  and  registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term agreements, was $2.7 billion, of which the Company held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of $1.0 billion resulting in a net exposure of $1.7 billion. NRG periodically receives collateral from counterparties in excess of their exposure. Collateral amounts shown include such excess while net exposure shown excludes excess collateral received. Approximately 80% of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off  by  the  end  of  2024.  The  following  table  highlights  the  net  counterparty  credit  exposure  by  industry  sector  and  by counterparty  credit  quality.  Net  counterparty  credit  exposure  is  defined  as  the  aggregate  net  asset  position  for  NRG  with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market, NPNS, and non-derivative  transactions.  As  of  December  31,  2022,  the  aggregate  credit  exposure  is  shown  net  of  collateral  held,  and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.\n\n| Category                                                                                                                                                               | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Utilities, energy merchants, marketers and other                                                                                                                       | 62 %                                 |\n| Financial institutions   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | 38                                   |\n| Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |",

Changes  in  hedge  positions  and  market  prices  will  affect  credit  exposure  and  counterparty concentration.\n\nDuring Winter Storm Uri, in February 2021, the Company experienced nonperformance by a counterparty in one of its bilateral financial hedging transactions, resulting in exposure of $403 million. During December 2022, the Company received $70 million as part of the Company's loss mitigation efforts related to this exposure.\n\n## RTOs and ISOs\n\nThe Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in these markets is approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, approved by the PUCT and include credit  policies  that,  under  certain  circumstances,  require  that  losses  arising  from  the  default  of  one  member  on  spot  market transactions  be  shared  by  the  remaining  participants.  As  a  result,  the  counterparty  credit  risk  to  these  markets  is  limited  to NRG's applicable share of the overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.\n\n## Exchange Traded Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  commodity  transactions  on  registered  exchanges,  notably  ICE,  NYMEX  and  Nodal.  These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Long-Term Contracts\n\nCounterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long-term contracts, primarily solar under Renewable PPAs. As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company  values  these  contracts  based  on  various  techniques  including,  but  not  limited  to,  internal  models  based  on  a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. Based on these valuation techniques, as of December 31, 2022, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately $1.1 billion for the next five years.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company's debt fair value was $7.0 billion and carrying value was $8.1 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Company's long-term debt by $480 million.\n\n## Credit Risk Related Contingent Features\n\nCertain of the Company's hedging and trading agreements contain provisions that entitle the counterparty to demand that the Company post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in the Company's credit quality, generally termed 'adequate assurance' under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there were a downgrade in the Company's credit rating. The collateral potentially required for contracts with adequate assurance clauses that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2022, was $1.5 billion. The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements under which it has a net liability position, but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which was approximately $195 million as of December 31, 2022. In the event of a downgrade in the Company's credit rating and if called for by the counterparty, $30 million of additional collateral would be required for all contracts with credit rating contingent features as of December 31, 2022.",

Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the Company's functional currency or the functional currency  of  an  applicable  subsidiary.  NRG  hedges  a  portion  of  its  forecasted  currency  transactions  with  foreign  exchange forward contracts. As of December 31, 2022, NRG is exposed to changes in foreign currency primarily associated with the purchase of U.S. dollar denominated natural gas for its Canadian business and entered into foreign exchange contracts with notional amount of $569 million.\n\nThe Company is subject to translation exchange rate risk related to the translation of the financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily the Canadian and Australian dollars. A hypothetical 10% appreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2022, would have resulted in an increase of $17 million to net income within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\n## Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThe financial statements and schedules are included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Item 9 - Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 9A - Controls and Procedures\n\n## Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of NRG's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, NRG conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on  this  evaluation,  the  Company's  principal  executive  officer,  principal  financial  officer  and  principal  accounting  officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- 1. Pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and dispositions of the Company's assets;\n- 2. Provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and\n- 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nInternal  control  over  financial  reporting  cannot  provide  absolute  assurance  of  achieving  financial  reporting  objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also, projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania February 23, 2023",

        "page_content": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n## To the Board of Directors and Stockholders\n\nNRG Energy, Inc.:\n\n## Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal  Control -Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenues\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  3  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  had  $31.543  billion  of  revenues. Revenue is derived from various revenue streams in different geographic markets and the Company's processes and related information technology (IT) systems used to record revenue differ for each of these revenue streams.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenues as a critical audit matter which required a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment  due  to  the  number  of  revenue  streams  and  IT  systems  involved  in  the  revenue recognition process. This included determining the revenue streams over which procedures were to be performed and evaluating the nature and extent of evidence obtained over the individual revenue streams as well as revenue in the aggregate. It also included the involvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in the performance of certain procedures.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We, with the assistance of IT professionals, applied auditor judgment to determine the revenue streams over which procedures were performed as well as the nature and extent of such procedures. For each revenue stream over which procedures were performed, we",

In addition, we evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenues by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of such evidence.\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2004.\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania February 23, 2023",

        "page_content": "## Note 1 Nature of Business\n\n## General\n\nNRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a consumer services company built on dynamic retail brands. NRG brings the power of energy to customers by producing and selling energy and related products and services, nation-wide in the U.S. and  Canada  in  a  manner  that  delivers  value  to  all  of  NRG's  stakeholders.  NRG  sells  power,  natural  gas,  home  and  power services, and develops innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under the brand names NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green  Mountain  Energy,  Stream,  and  XOOM  Energy.  The  Company  has  a  customer  base  that  includes  approximately 5.4 million Home customers as well as commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers, supported by approximately 16 GW of generation.\n\nOn December 6, 2022, NRG and Vivint Smart Home, Inc. announced the entry into a definitive agreement under which the Company will acquire Vivint, a smart home platform company, in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition will accelerate the realization  of  NRG's  consumer-focused  growth  strategy  and  create  a  leading  essential  home  services  platform  fueled  by market-leading  brands,  unparalleled  insights,  proprietary  technologies  and  complementary  sales  channels.  Close  of  the acquisition is targeted for the first quarter of 2023 and is subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nThe Company manages its operations based on the combined results of the retail and wholesale generation businesses with a geographical focus.\n\nThe Company's business is segmented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Texas, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in Texas;\n- \u00b7 East, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in the East;\n- \u00b7 West/Services/Other, which includes the following assets and activities: (i) all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in the West and Canada, (ii) the Services businesses (iii) activity related to the Cottonwood facility, (iv)  the  remaining  renewables  activity,  including  the  Company's  equity  method  investment  in  Ivanpah  Master Holdings, LLC, and (v) activity related to the Company's equity method investment for the Gladstone power plant in Australia; and\n- \u00b7 Corporate activities.\n\n## Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.  The  ASC, established by the FASB, is the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental entities. In addition, the rules  and  interpretative  releases  of  the  SEC  under  authority  of  federal  securities  laws  are  also  sources  of  authoritative  U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include NRG's accounts and operations and those of its subsidiaries in which the Company  has  a  controlling  interest.  All  significant  intercompany  transactions  and  balances  have  been  eliminated  in consolidation. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity.  However,  a  controlling  financial  interest  may  also  exist  through  arrangements  that  do  not  involve  controlling  voting interests. As such, NRG applies the guidance of ASC 810, Consolidations, or  ASC 810, to determine when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or not controlled through its voting interests, referred to as a VIE, should be consolidated.\n\n## Winter Storm Uri Uplift Securitization Proceeds\n\nThe Texas Legislature passed HB 4492 in May 2021 for ERCOT to mitigate exceptionally high price adders and ancillary service costs incurred by LSEs during Winter Storm Uri. HB 4492 authorized ERCOT to obtain $2.1 billion of financing to distribute  to  LSEs  that  were  charged  and  paid  to  ERCOT  those  highly  priced  ancillary  service  and  ORDPA  during  Winter Storm Uri.\n\nIn December 2021, ERCOT filed with the PUCT a calculation of each LSE's share of proceeds based on the settlement methodology. The Company accounted for the proceeds by analogy to the contribution model within ASC 958-605, Not-forProfit Entities- Revenue Recognition and the grant model within IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance , as a reduction to expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the 2021 annual period for which the proceeds were intended to compensate. The Company received proceeds of $689 million from ERCOT in June 2022.\n\n## NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

        "page_content": "## Credit Losses\n\nIn accordance with ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , or ASU No. 2016-13, retail trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet net of the allowance for credit losses. The Company accrues an allowance for current expected credit losses based on (i) estimates of uncollectible revenues by analyzing accounts receivable aging and current and reasonable forecasts of expected economic factors including, but  not  limited  to,  unemployment  rates  and  weather-related  events,  (ii)  historical  collections  and  delinquencies,  and  (iii) counterparty  credit  ratings  for  commercial  and  industrial  customers.  The  Company  writes  off  customer  contract  receivable balances against the allowance for credit losses when it is determined a receivable is uncollectible.\n\nThe following table represents the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n\n|                                                                                  | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                    | 2022                      | 2021                      | 2020                      |\n| Beginning balance   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | $  683                    | $  67                     | $  43                     |\n| Acquired balance from Direct Energy                                              | -                         | 112                       | -                         |\n| Provision for credit losses (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 11                        | 698                       | 108                       |\n| Write-offs   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (593)                     | (224)                     | (101)                     |\n| Recoveries collected   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | 32                        | 30                        | 17                        |\n| Ending balance (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | $  133                    | $  683                    | $  67                     |\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for credit losses included the Company's loss mitigation efforts recognized as income of $126 million related to Winter Storm Uri. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the provision for credit  losses  included  $596  million  of  expense  due  to  the  impacts  of  Winter  Storm  Uri.  The  increase  in  write-offs  for  the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to the resolution of credit losses that occurred during Winter Storm Uri.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.\n\n## Funds Deposited by Counterparties\n\nFunds deposited by counterparties consist of cash held by the Company as a result of collateral posting obligations from its counterparties. Though some amounts are segregated into separate accounts, not all funds are contractually restricted. Based on the Company's intention, these funds are not available for the payment of general corporate obligations; however, they are available  for  liquidity  management.  Depending  on  market  fluctuations  and  the  settlement  of  the  underlying  contracts,  the Company will refund this collateral to the hedge counterparties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying trades. Since collateral requirements fluctuate daily and the Company cannot predict if any collateral will be held for more than twelve months,  the  funds  deposited  by  counterparties  are  classified  as  a  current  asset  on  the  Company's  balance  sheet,  with  an offsetting liability for this cash collateral received within current liabilities.\n\n## Restricted Cash\n\nThe  following  table  provides  a  reconciliation  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  funds  deposited  by counterparties reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                 | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                                                   | 2022                      | 2021                      | 2020                      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                    | $  430                    | $  250                    | $  3,905                  |\n| Funds deposited by counterparties    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                        | 1,708                     | 845                       | 19                        |\n| Restricted cash  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                            | 40                        | 15                        | 6                         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties and restricted  cash shown in the statements of cash flows   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  2,178                  | $  1,110                  | $  3,930                  |\n\nRestricted cash consists primarily of funds held to satisfy the requirements of certain financing agreements and funds held within the Company's projects that are restricted in their use.",

        "page_content": "## Inventory\n\nInventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market, and consists principally of natural gas, fuel oil, coal, spare parts, and finished goods. The Company removes natural gas inventory as goods are delivered to customers and as they are used in the production of electricity or steam. The Company removes fuel oil and coal inventories as they are used in the production of electricity. Spare parts inventory is valued at weighted average cost. The Company removes these inventories when they are used for repairs, maintenance or capital projects. The Company expects to recover the natural gas, fuel oil, coal and spare parts costs in the ordinary course of business. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined on a first in first out basis for finished goods and weighted average cost method for all other inventories. The Company removes these inventories as they are sold to customers. Sales of inventory are classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost or, in the case of business acquisitions, fair value; however, impairment adjustments  are  recorded  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  their  carrying  values  may  not  be recoverable. NRG also classifies nuclear fuel related to the Company's 44% ownership interest in STP as part of the Company's property, plant, and equipment. Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized as incurred, while repairs  and  maintenance  that  do  not  improve  or  extend  the  life  of  the  respective  asset  are  charged  to  expense  as  incurred. Depreciation, other than nuclear fuel, is computed using the straight-line method, while nuclear fuel is amortized based on units of production over the estimated useful lives. Certain assets and their related accumulated depreciation amounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting gain or loss included in cost of operations in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Business Interruption Insurance\n\nThe Company carries insurance policies to cover insurable risks including, but not limited to, business interruption. As a result of damage at the Limestone 1 and W.A. Parish 8 units, the Company recorded business interruption insurance settlements of $81 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Business interruption insurance is recorded to cost of operations in the consolidated statements of operations and cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Asset Impairments\n\nLong-lived  assets  that  are  held  and  used  are  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable. Such reviews are performed in accordance with ASC 360. An impairment loss is  indicated if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from an asset are less than its carrying value. An impairment charge is measured by the difference between an asset's carrying amount and fair value with the difference recorded in  operating  costs  and  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Fair  values  are  determined  by  a  variety  of valuation methods, including third-party appraisals, sales prices of similar assets and present value techniques.\n\nInvestments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 323, InvestmentsEquity Method and Joint Ventures ,  or  ASC  323,  which  requires  that  a  loss  in  value  of  an  investment  that  is  an  other-thantemporary  decline  should  be  recognized.  The  Company  identifies  and  measures  losses  in  the  value  of  equity  method investments based upon a comparison of fair value to carrying value. For further discussion of these matters, refer to Note 11, Asset Impairments .\n\n## Debt Issuance Costs\n\nDebt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest expense on a basis that approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt. Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt, or as an asset if the issuance costs relate to revolving debt agreements or certain other financing arrangements.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible  assets  represent  contractual  rights  held  by  the  Company.  The  Company  recognizes  specifically  identifiable intangible assets including emission allowances, customer and supply contracts, customer relationships, marketing partnerships, trade names and fuel contracts when specific rights and contracts are acquired. These intangible assets are amortized based on expected volumes, expected delivery, expected discounted future net cash flows, straight line or units of production basis. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had accumulated amortization related to its intangible assets of $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.\n\nEmission allowances held-for-sale, which are included in other non-current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, are not amortized; they are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360.",

        "page_content": "## Goodwill\n\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ,  or  ASC 350, the Company recognizes goodwill for the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. NRG performs goodwill impairment tests annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nThe Company first assesses qualitative factors to  determine  whether  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, there is no goodwill impairment.\n\nIn the absence of sufficient qualitative factors indicating that it is more-likely-than-not that no impairment occurred, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value to its book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between book value and fair value.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill impairment losses recognized refer to Note 11, Asset Impairments .\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  using  the  liability  method  in  accordance  with  ASC  740, Income  Taxes, or ASC 740, which requires that the Company use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant temporary differences.\n\nThe Company has two categories of income tax expense or benefit - current and deferred, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Current income tax expense or benefit consists solely of current taxes payable less applicable tax credits, and\n- \u00b7 Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability, excluding amounts charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income\n\nThe Company reports some of its revenues and expenses differently for financial statement purposes than for income tax return purposes, resulting in temporary and permanent differences between the Company's financial statements and income tax returns. The tax effects of such temporary differences are recorded as either deferred income tax assets or deferred income tax liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company measures its deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities using income tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the deferred tax is realized.\n\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which applies to all tax positions related to  income  taxes.  Under  ASC  740,  tax  benefits  are  recognized  when  it  is  more-likely-than-not  that  a  tax  position  will  be sustained  upon  examination  by  the  authorities.  The  benefit  recognized  from  a  position  is  the  amount  of  benefit  that  has surpassed  the  more-likely-than-not  threshold,  as  it  is  more  than  50%  likely  to  be  realized  upon  settlement.  The  Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n\nIn  accordance  with  ASC 740 and as discussed further in Note 20, Income Taxes ,  changes  to  existing  net  deferred  tax assets or valuation allowances or changes to uncertain tax benefits, are recorded to income tax (benefit)/expense.\n\n## Contract and Emission Credit Amortization\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  recognized  through  acquisitions  related  to  the  purchase  and  sale  of  energy  and  energy-related products  in  future  periods  for  which  the  fair  value  has  been  determined  to  be  significantly  less  or  more  than  market  are amortized  to  revenues  or  cost  of  operations  over  the  term  of  each  underlying  contract  based  on  actual  generation  and/or contracted volumes.\n\nEmission credits represent the right to emit a specified amount of certain pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide, over a compliance period. Emission credits held for use are amortized to cost of operations based on the weighted average cost of the allowances held.\n\n## Gross Receipts and Sales Taxes\n\nIn  connection  with  its  retail  sales,  the  Company  records  gross  receipts  taxes  on  a  gross  basis  in  revenues  and  cost  of operations  in  its  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  During  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022,  2021,  and  2020,  the Company's revenues  and  cost  of  operations  included  gross  receipts  taxes  of  $218  million,  $184  million,  and  $107  million, respectively.  Additionally,  the  Company  records  sales  taxes  collected  from  its  taxable  retail  customers  and  remitted  to  the various governmental entities on a net basis; thus, there is no impact on the Company's consolidated statement of operations.",

        "page_content": "## Cost of Operations\n\nCost of operations includes cost of fuel, purchased energy and other costs of sales, mark-to-market for economic hedging activities, contract and emission credit amortization, operations and maintenance, and other cost of operations.\n\n## Cost of Fuel, Purchased Energy and Other Cost of Sales\n\nCost of fuel is primarily the costs associated with procurement, transportation and storage of natural gas, nuclear fuel, oil and coal to operate the generation portfolio, which is expensed as the fuel is consumed. Purchased energy primarily relates to purchases  to  supply  the  Company's  customer  base,  which  includes  spot  market  purchases,  as  well  as  contracts  of  various quantities and durations, including Renewable PPAs with third-party developers, which are accounted for as NPNS (see further discussion in Derivative Instruments below). Other cost of sales primarily consists of TDSP expenses.\n\nThe cost of fuel is based on actual and estimated fuel usage for the applicable reporting period. The cost to deliver energy and related services to customers is based on actual and estimated supply volumes for the applicable reporting period. A portion of the cost of energy, $202 million, $189 million, and $98 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, was accrued and consisted of estimated transmission and distribution charges not yet billed by the transmission and distribution utilities.\n\nIn  estimating  supply  volumes,  the  Company  considers  the  effects  of  historical  customer  volumes,  weather  factors  and usage by customer class. Transmission and distribution delivery fees are estimated using the same method used for electricity sales and services to retail customers. In addition, ISO fees are estimated based on historical trends, estimated supply volumes and initial ERCOT ISO settlements. Volume estimates are then multiplied by the supply rate and recorded as cost of operations in the applicable reporting period.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Company accounts for derivative instruments under ASC 815, which requires the Company to record all derivatives on  the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value  and  changes  in  fair  value  in  earnings,  unless  they  qualify  for  the  NPNS  exception.  The Company's primary derivative instruments are power and natural gas purchase or sales contracts, fuels purchase contracts and other energy related commodities used to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuation in market prices. In addition, in order  to  mitigate  foreign  exchange  risk  associated  with  the  purchase  of  USD  denominated  natural  gas  for  the  Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company did not have derivative instruments that were designated as cash flow or fair value hedge.\n\nRevenues and expenses on contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is delivered. While these contracts are considered derivative instruments under ASC 815, they are not recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the related contract is recorded on the balance sheet and immediately recognized through earnings.\n\nNRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in earnings.\n\n## Mark-to-Market for Economic Hedging Activities\n\nNRG enters into derivative instruments to manage price and delivery risk, optimize physical and contractual assets in the portfolio  and  manage  working  capital  requirements.  The  mark-to-market  for  economic  hedging  activities  are  recognized  to revenues or cost of operations during the reporting period.\n\n## Operations and Maintenance and Other Cost of Operations\n\nOperations and maintenance costs include major and other routine preventative (planned outage) and corrective (forced outage) maintenance activities to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the Company's generation portfolio in compliance with all local, state and federal requirements. Operations and maintenance costs are also costs associated with retaining and maintaining the Company's customer base, such as call center support, portfolio maintenance and data analytics. Other cost of operations primarily includes gross receipts taxes, insurance, property taxes and asset retirement obligation expense.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses\n\nThe local currencies are generally the functional currency of NRG's foreign operations. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates of exchange. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows are translated at the weighted-average  rates  of  exchange  for  the  period.  The  resulting  currency  translation  adjustments  are  not  included  in  the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the period, but are accumulated and reported as a separate component of",

        "page_content": "stockholders' equity until sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign entity takes place. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are reported within other income/(expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2022, amounts recognized as foreign currency transaction losses were $(7) million. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, amounts recognized as foreign currency transaction gains/ (losses) were immaterial. The Company's cumulative translation adjustment balances as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $55 million, $(8) million, and $(2) million, respectively.\n\n## Concentrations of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trust funds, accounts receivable, notes receivable, derivatives, and investments in debt securities. Trust funds are held in accounts managed by experienced investment advisors. Certain accounts receivable, notes receivable, and derivative instruments are concentrated within entities engaged in the energy industry. These industry concentrations may impact the Company's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other  conditions.  Receivables  and  other  contractual  arrangements  are  subject  to  collateral  requirements  under  the  terms  of enabling  agreements.  However,  the  Company  believes  that  the  credit  risk  posed  by  industry  concentration  is  offset  by  the diversification  and  creditworthiness  of  its  customer  base.  See  Note  5, Fair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments, for  a  further discussion of derivative concentrations.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. See Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for a further discussion of fair value of financial instruments.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  AROs  in  accordance  with  ASC  410-20, Asset  Retirement  Obligations, or  ASC  410-20. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets included within the scope of ASC 410-20 are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws, statutes, and written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and for which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. ASC 410-20 requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.\n\nUpon initial recognition of a liability for an ARO, the Company capitalizes the asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount. Over time, the liability is accreted to its future value, while the  capitalized  cost  is  depreciated  over  the  useful  life  of  the  related  asset.  See  Note  14, Asset Retirement Obligations, for  a further discussion of AROs.\n\n## Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\n\nThe  Company  offers  pension  benefits  through  a  defined  benefit  pension  plan.  In  addition,  the  Company  provides postretirement  health  and  welfare  benefits  for  certain  groups  of  employees.  The  Company  accounts  for  pension  and  other postretirement  benefits  in  accordance  with  ASC  715, Compensation  -  Retirement  Benefits ,  or  ASC  715 . The  Company recognizes the funded status of the Company's defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position and records an offset for gains and losses as well as all prior service costs that have not been included as part of the Company's net periodic benefit cost  to  other  comprehensive  income.  The  determination  of  the  Company's  obligation  and  expenses  for  pension  benefits  is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions. These assumptions determined by management include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases. The Company's actuarial consultants assist in determining assumptions for such items as retirement age. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results, which may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by the Company.\n\nThe Company measures the fair value of its pension assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  its  stock-based  compensation  in  accordance  with  ASC  718, Compensation  -  Stock Compensation, or ASC 718 . The fair value of the Company's performance stock units is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo  valuation  model.  NRG  uses  the  Company's  common  stock  price  on  the  date  of  grant  as  the  fair  value  of  the Company's deferred stock units. The fair value of the Company's restricted stock units is derived from the closing price of NRG's  common  stock  at  the  grant  date.  Forfeiture  rates  are  estimated  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  Company's  historical forfeitures,  employment  turnover,  and  expected  future  behavior.  The  Company  recognizes  compensation  expense  for  both graded and cliff vesting awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.",

        "page_content": "## Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method\n\nThe Company has investments in various domestic energy projects, as well as one Australian project. The equity method of accounting is applied to such investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and partnerships, because the ownership structure prevents the Company from exercising a controlling influence over the operating and financial policies of the projects. Under this method, equity in pre-tax income or losses of domestic partnerships and, generally, in the net income or losses of its Australian project, are reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Distributions from equity method investments that represent earnings on the Company's investment are included within cash flows from operating activities and distributions from  equity  method  investments  that  represent  a  return  of  the  Company's  investment  are  included  within  cash  flows  from investing activities.\n\n## Tax Equity Arrangements\n\nThe Company's redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries represented third-party interests in the net assets under certain tax equity arrangements, which were consolidated by the Company, that had been entered into to finance the cost of solar  energy  systems  under  operating  leases.  The  amounts  reported  as  redeemable  noncontrolling  interests  represented  the amounts the investors that were party to the tax equity arrangements would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the contractual agreements, assuming the net assets of the funding structures were liquidated at their recorded amounts. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased its partners' equity interest, which was the Company's last remaining tax equity arrangement.\n\n## Sale-Leaseback Arrangements\n\nNRG is party to sale-leaseback arrangements that provide for the sale of certain assets to a third-party and simultaneously leases back the same asset to the Company. If the seller-lessee transfers control of the underlying assets to the buyer-lessor, the arrangement is accounted for under ASC 842-40, Sale-Leaseback Transactions. These arrangements are classified as operating leases on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10, Leases, for further discussion.\n\n## Marketing and Advertising Costs\n\nThe Company expenses its marketing and advertising  costs  as  incurred  and  includes  them  within  selling,  general  and administrative expenses. The costs of tangible assets used in advertising campaigns are recorded as fixed assets or deferred advertising costs and amortized as advertising costs over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the advertising campaign. The  Company  has  several  long-term  sponsorship  arrangements.  Payments  related  to  these  arrangements  are  deferred  and expensed over the term of the arrangement. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $82 million, $109 million, and $74 million, respectively.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, which requires an acquirer to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date. The Company also recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase in the business combination. In addition, transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nIn recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations, the Company uses estimates based on the best information  available.  Estimates  are  used  for  such  items  as  plant  depreciable  lives,  tax  provisions,  uncollectible  accounts, actuarially determined benefit costs, the valuation of energy commodity contracts, environmental liabilities, legal costs incurred in connection with recorded loss contingencies, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair value of impaired  assets.  As  better  information  becomes  available  or  actual  amounts  are  determinable,  the  recorded  estimates  are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect results from operations, net assets or cash flows.",

The guidance in ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock.  In  addition,  ASU  2020-06  improves and amends the related earnings per share guidance. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective approach. As a result of the provisions of the amended guidance, the  Company  recorded  a  $100  million  decrease  to  additional  paid-in  capital,  a  $57  million  decrease  to  debt  discount,  a $57 million increase to retained earnings, and a $14 million decrease to long-term deferred tax liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the Company's statements of operations, statements of cash flows or earnings per share amounts.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments - Guidance Not Yet Adopted\n\nASU 2021-08 - In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for  Contract  Assets  and  Contract  Liabilities  from  Contracts  with  Customers ,  or  ASU  2021-08.  Under  current  GAAP,  an acquirer generally recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract  liabilities  arising  from  revenue  contracts  with  customers  and  other  similar  contracts  that  are  accounted  for  in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ,  or  ASC 606, at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU 2021-08 requires that an entity recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606. At the acquisition date, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with ASC 606 as if it had originated the contracts, which should generally result in an acquirer recognizing and measuring the acquired  contract  assets  and  contract  liabilities  consistent  with  how  they  were  recognized  and  measured  in  the  acquiree's financial  statements.  This  update  also  provides  certain  practical  expedients  for  acquirers  when  recognizing  and  measuring acquired  contract  assets  and  contract  liabilities  from  revenue  contracts  in  a  business  combination.  The  amendments  in  this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years and should  be  applied  prospectively  to  business  combinations  occurring  on  or  after  the  effective  date  of  the  amendments.  The Company will evaluate the impacts of the amendments for business combinations occurring after the effective date.\n\n## Note 3 -Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's policies with respect to its various revenue streams are detailed below. The Company generally applies the invoicing practical expedient to recognize revenue for the revenue streams detailed below, except in circumstances where the invoiced amount does not represent the value transferred to the customer.\n\n## Retail Revenue\n\nGross revenues for energy sales and services to retail customers are recognized as the Company transfers the promised goods and services to the customer. For the majority of its electricity and natural gas contracts, the Company's performance obligation with the customer is satisfied over time and performance obligations for its electricity and natural gas products are recognized as the customer takes possession of the product. The Company also allocates the contract consideration to distinct performance  obligations  in  a  contract  for  which  the  timing  of  the  revenue  recognized  is  different.  Additionally,  customer discounts and incentives reduce the contract consideration and are recognized over the term of the contract.\n\nEnergy sales and services that have been delivered but not billed by period end are estimated. Accrued unbilled revenues are based on estimates of customer usage since the date of the last meter reading provided by the independent system operators, utilities, or electric distribution companies. Volume estimates are based on daily forecasted volumes and estimated customer usage  by  class.  Unbilled  revenues  are  calculated  by  multiplying  these  volume  estimates  by  the  applicable  rate  by  customer class. Estimated amounts are adjusted when actual usage is known and billed.\n\nAs contracts for retail electricity and natural gas can be for multi-year periods, the Company has performance obligations under these contracts that have not yet been satisfied. These performance obligations have transaction prices that are both fixed and variable, and that vary based on the contract duration, customer type, inception date and other contract-specific factors. For the fixed price contracts, the amount of any unsatisfied performance obligations will vary based on customer usage, which will depend on factors such as weather and customer activity and therefore it is not practicable to estimate such amounts.\n\n## Energy Revenue\n\nBoth physical and financial transactions consist of revenues billed to a third-party at either market or negotiated contract terms to optimize the financial performance of the Company's generating facilities. Electric energy revenue is recognized upon transmission  to  the  customer  over  time,  using  the  output  method  for  measuring  progress  of  satisfaction  of  performance obligations. Physical transactions, or the sale of generated electricity to meet supply and demand, are recorded on a gross basis in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company applies the invoicing practical expedient in recognizing energy revenue. Under the practical expedient, revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is equal to the value",

        "page_content": "to the customer of NRG's performance obligation completed to date. Financial transactions used to hedge the sale of electricity are recorded net within revenues in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with ASC 815.\n\nAncillary revenues, included in Other revenue, are recognized over time as the obligation is fulfilled, using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of performance obligations.\n\n## Capacity Revenue\n\nThe  Company's  largest  sources  of  capacity  revenues  are  capacity  auctions  in  PJM,  ISO-NE  and  NYISO.  Capacity revenues  also  include  revenues  billed  to  a  third-party  at  either  market  or  negotiated  contract  terms  for  making  installed generation and demand response capacity available in order to satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements. Capacity revenues are recognized over time, using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of performance obligations. The Company applies the invoicing practical expedient in recognizing capacity revenue. Under the practical expedient, revenue is  recognized  based  on  the  invoiced  amount  which  is  equal  to  the  value  to  the  customer  of  NRG's  performance  obligation completed to date.\n\n## Performance Obligations\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, estimated future fixed fee performance obligations are $77 million, $23 million, and $2 million for fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. These performance obligations are for cleared auction MWs in the PJM, NYISO and MISO capacity auctions and are subject to penalties for non-performance.\n\n## Disaggregated Revenue\n\nThe  following  tables  represent  the  Company's  disaggregation  of  revenue  from  contracts  with  customers  for  the  years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n\n|                                                                                                                   | For the Year Ended December 31, 2022   | For the Year Ended December 31, 2022   | For the Year Ended December 31, 2022   | For the Year Ended December 31, 2022   | For the Year Ended December 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                     | Texas                                  | East                                   | West/Services/ Other                   | Corporate/ Eliminations                | Total                                  |\n| Retail revenue                                                                                                    |                                        |                                        |                                        |                                        |                                        |\n| Home (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                       | $  6,388                               | $  2,088                               | $  2,286                               | $  (1)  $                              | 10,761                                 |\n| Business    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                       | 3,229                                  | 13,768                                 | 1,964                                  | -

The change in deferred revenue balances during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was primarily due to the usage of customer bill credits by certain C&I customers, which were as a result of power pricing during Winter Storm Uri.\n\nThe Company's customer acquisition costs consist of broker fees, commission payments and other costs that represent incremental costs of obtaining the contract with customers for which the Company expects to recover. The Company amortizes these amounts over the estimated life of the customer contract. As a practical expedient, the Company expenses the incremental costs of obtaining a contract if the amortization period of the asset would have been one year or less.",

Generally,  the  Company  will  recognize  revenue  from contract liabilities in the next period as the Company satisfies its performance obligations.\n\n## Note 4 Acquisitions and Dispositions\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## 2023 Anticipated Acquisition\n\n## Vivint Smart Home Acquisition\n\nOn December 6, 2022, the NRG and Vivint Smart Home, Inc. announced the entry into a definitive merger agreement under which the Company will acquire Vivint, a smart home platform company, in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition will accelerate the realization of NRG's consumer-focused growth strategy and create a leading essential home services platform fueled by market-leading brands, unparalleled insights, proprietary technologies and complementary sales channels. Close of the acquisition is targeted for the first quarter of 2023 and is subject to customary closing conditions. The Company will pay $12 per share, or approximately $2.8 billion in cash, and  expects to fund the acquisition using proceeds from newly issued debt and preferred equity, drawing on its Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facilities, and through cash on hand.  Additionally,  in  the  first  quarter  of  2023,  NRG  increased  its  Revolving  Credit  Facility  by  $600  million  to  meet  the additional liquidity requirements related to the acquisition. For further discussion see Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases.\n\nIn connection with the merger agreement, NRG entered into a commitment letter for a senior secured 364-day bridge term loan facility in a principal amount not to exceed $2.1 billion for the purposes of financing the Vivint acquisition, paying fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition, and certain other third-party payments in respect of arrangements of Vivint.\n\nAcquisition costs of $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 are included in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in the Company's Consolidated Statement of operations.\n\n## 2021 Acquisitions\n\n## Direct Energy Acquisition\n\nOn January 5, 2021, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Direct Energy, which had been a North American subsidiary of Centrica. Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and  business  energy  related  products  and  services  in  North  America,  with  operations  in  all  50  U.S.  states  and  8  Canadian provinces. The acquisition increased NRG's retail portfolio by over 3 million customers and strengthened its integrated model. It  also  broadened  the  Company's  presence  in  the  Northeast  and  into  states  and  locales  where  it  did  not  previously  operate, supporting NRG's objective to diversify its business.\n\nThe  Company  paid  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $3.625  billion  in  cash  and  total  purchase  price  adjustment  of $99 million, resulting in an adjusted purchase price of $3.724 billion.\n\nAcquisition  costs  of  $25  million  and  $17  million  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively,  are included in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.\n\nThe  acquisition  has  been  recorded  as  a  business  combination  under  ASC  805  with  identifiable  assets  acquired  and liabilities assumed recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The purchase price was allocated as follows as of December 31, 2021:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                      | (In millions)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Current Assets                                                                                                                                                       |                 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .            | $  152          |\n| Funds deposited by counterparties   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                | 21              |\n| Restricted cash   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 9               |\n| Accounts receivable, net  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | 1,802           |\n| Inventory    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 106             |\n| Derivative instruments   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 1,014           |\n| Cash collateral paid in support of energy risk management activities   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                   | 233             |\n| Prepayments and other current assets  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  | 173             |\n| Total current assets   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .           | 3,510           |",

        "page_content": "## Fair Value Accounting under ASC 820\n\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability  to  access  as  of  the  measurement  date.  NRG's  financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  1  inputs  include active exchange-traded securities, energy derivatives, and trust fund investments.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or  indirectly  observable  through  corroboration  with  observable  market  data.  NRG's  financial  assets  and  liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, exchange-based derivatives, and over the counter derivatives such as swaps, options and forward contracts.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability only used when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset  or  liability  at  the  measurement  date.  NRG's  financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  3  inputs  include infrequently-traded,  non-exchange-based  derivatives  and  commingled  investment  funds,  and  are  measured  using present value pricing models.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement in its entirety falls, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n\n## Recurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nDebt  securities,  equity  securities,  and  trust  fund  investments,  which  are  comprised  of  various  U.S.  debt  and  equity securities, and derivative assets and liabilities, are carried at fair market value.\n\nThe following tables present assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                    | As of December 31, 2022 Fair Value   | As of December 31, 2022 Fair Value   | As of December 31, 2022 Fair Value   | As of December 31, 2022 Fair Value   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                                                                      | Total                                | Level 1                              | Level 2                              | Level 3                              |\n| Investments in securities (classified within other current and non-current  assets)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  19                                | $  -

These  trust  fund investments hold debt and equity securities directly and equity securities indirectly through commingled funds. The fair values of equity securities held directly by the trust funds are based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized in Level 1. In addition, U.S. government and federal agency obligations are categorized as Level 1 because they trade in a highly liquid and transparent market. The fair values of corporate debt securities are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2. Certain equity securities, classified as commingled funds, are analogous to mutual funds, are maintained by investment companies,  and  hold  certain  investments  in  accordance  with  a  stated  set  of  fund  objectives.  The  fair  value  of  the  equity securities classified as commingled funds are based on net asset values per fund share (the unit of account), derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying equity securities. However, because the shares in the commingled funds are not  publicly  quoted  and  not  traded  in  an  active  market,  the  commingled  funds  are  measured  using  net  asset  value  practical expedient. See also Note 7, Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund.\n\n## Derivative fair value measurements\n\nA  portion  of  the  Company's  contracts  are  exchange-traded  contracts  with  readily  available  quoted  market  prices.  A majority  of  NRG's  contracts  are  non-exchange-traded  contracts  valued  using  prices  provided  by  external  sources,  primarily price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter and on-line exchanges. For the majority of NRG markets, the Company receives quotes from multiple sources. To the extent that NRG receives multiple quotes, the Company's prices reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices obtained from all sources that NRG believes provide the most liquid market for the commodity. If the Company receives one quote, then the mid-point of the bid-ask spread for that quote is used. The terms for which such price information is available vary by commodity, region and product. A significant portion of the fair value of the Company's  derivative  portfolio  is  based  on  price  quotes  from  brokers  in  active  markets  who  regularly  facilitate  those transactions and the Company believes such price quotes are executable. The Company does not use third-party sources that derive price based on proprietary models or market surveys. The remainder of the assets and liabilities represents contracts for which external sources or observable market quotes are not available. These contracts are valued based on various valuation techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable  market  data  with  similar  characteristics.  Contracts  valued  with  prices  provided  by  models  and  other  valuation techniques make up 10% of derivative assets and 9% of derivative liabilities. The fair value of each contract is discounted using a  risk  free  interest  rate.  In  addition,  the  Company  applies  a  credit  reserve  to  reflect  credit  risk,  which  for  foreign  exchange contracts is calculated utilizing the bilateral method based on published default probabilities. For commodities, to the extent that NRG's net exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset, the Company uses the counterparty's default swap rate. If the exposure under a specific master agreement is a liability, the Company uses NRG's default swap rate. For foreign exchange contracts  and  commodities,  the  credit  reserve  is  added  to  the  discounted  fair  value  to  reflect  the  exit  price  that  a  market participant  would be willing to receive to assume NRG's liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for NRG's assets. As of December 31, 2022, the credit reserve resulted in a $9 million decrease primarily within cost of operations. As of December 31, 2021, the credit reserve resulted in $11 million decrease primarily within cost of operations.\n\nThe fair values in each category reflect the level of forward prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2022 and may change as a result of changes in these factors. Management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts NRG holds and sells. These estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over-thecounter price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit exposure. It is possible, however, that future market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities from energy marketing and trading activities and such variations could be material.\n\nNRG's significant positions classified as Level 3 include physical and financial natural gas and power contracts executed in illiquid markets as well as financial transmission rights, or FTRs. The significant unobservable inputs used in developing fair value include illiquid natural gas and power location pricing, which is derived as a basis to liquid locations. The basis spread is based  on  observable  market  data  when  available  or  derived  from  historic  prices  and  forward  market  prices  from  similar observable markets when not available. For FTRs, NRG uses the most recent auction prices to derive the fair value.",

may choose to offset cash collateral posted or received against the fair value of derivative positions executed with the same counterparties under the same master netting agreements. The Company has chosen not to offset positions as defined in ASC 815. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $260 million of cash collateral posted and $1.7 billion of cash collateral received on its balance sheet.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nIn addition to the credit risk discussion as disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , the following item is a discussion of the concentration of credit risk for the Company's financial instruments. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii)  a  daily  monitoring  of  counterparties'  credit  limits;  (iii)  the  use  of  credit  mitigation  measures  such  as  margin,  collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements  that  allow  for  the  netting  of  positive  and  negative  exposures  of  various  contracts  associated  with  a  single counterparty.  Risks  surrounding  counterparty  performance  and  credit  could  ultimately  impact  the  amount  and  timing  of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. The",

Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.\n\n## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  counterparty  credit  exposure,  excluding  credit  exposure  from  RTOs,  ISOs,  and  registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term agreements, was $2.7 billion and NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of $1.0 billion, resulting in a net exposure of $1.7 billion. NRG periodically receives collateral from counterparties in excess of their exposure. Collateral amounts shown include such excess while net exposure shown excludes excess collateral received. Approximately 80% of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of 2024. Counterparty credit exposure is valued through observable market quotes and discounted at a risk free interest rate. The following  tables  highlight  net  counterparty  credit  exposure  by  industry  sector  and  by  counterparty  credit  quality.  Net counterparty  credit  exposure  is  defined  as  the  aggregate  net  asset  position  for  NRG  with  counterparties  where  netting  is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market and NPNS, and non-derivative transactions. The exposure is shown net of collateral held and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.\n\n| Category                                                                                                                                                               | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Utilities, energy merchants, marketers and other                                                                                                                       | 62 %                                 |\n| Financial institutions   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | 38                                   |\n| Total    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |\n| Category                                                                                                                                                               | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n| Investment grade   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | 65 %                                 |\n| Non-Investment grade/Non-Rated  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  | 35                                   |\n| Total    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |\n\nThe Company currently has no exposure to wholesale counterparties in excess of 10% of the total net exposure discussed above as of December 31, 2022. Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration.\n\nDuring Winter Storm Uri, in February 2021, the Company experienced nonperformance by a counterparty in one of its bilateral financial hedging transactions, resulting in exposure of $403 million. During December 2022, the Company received $70 million as part of the Company's loss mitigation efforts related to this exposure.\n\n## RTOs and ISOs\n\nThe Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, AESO, IESO, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in the majority of these markets is approved by FERC, whereas in the case of ERCOT, it is approved by the PUCT, and whereas in the case of AESO and IESO, both exist provincially with AESO primarily subject to Alberta Utilities Commission and the IESO to the Ontario Energy Board. These ISOs may include credit policies that, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. As a result, the counterparty credit risk to these markets is limited to NRG's share of the overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.\n\n## Exchange Traded Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  commodity  transactions  on  registered  exchanges,  notably  ICE,  NYMEX  and  Nodal.  These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Long-Term Contracts\n\nCounterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long term contracts, primarily solar  under  Renewable  PPAs.  As  external  sources  or  observable  market  quotes  are  not  always  available  to  estimate  such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. Based on these valuation techniques, as of December 31, 2022, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately $1.1 billion for the next five years.",

        "page_content": "## Retail Customer Credit Risk\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  retail  credit  risk  through  the  Company's  retail  electricity  and  gas  providers,  which  serve Home and Business customers. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and the loss of in-the-money forward value. The Company manages retail credit risk through the use of established credit policies that include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  Company's  retail  customer  credit  exposure  to  Home  and  Business  customers  was diversified  across  many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. Current economic conditions may affect the Company's customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in credit losses. The Company's provision for credit losses was $11 million, $698 million, and $108 million for  the  years  ending  December  31,  2022,  2021,  and  2020,  respectively.  During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  the provision  for  credit  losses  included  the  Company's  loss  mitigation  efforts  recognized  as  income  of  $126  million  related  to Winter Storm Uri. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the provision for credit losses included $596 million of expenses due to the impacts of Winter Storm Uri.\n\n## Note 6 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nASC 815 requires the Company to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and to measure them at fair value each reporting period unless they qualify for a NPNS exception. The Company may elect to designate  certain  derivatives  as  cash  flow  hedges,  if  certain  conditions  are  met,  and  defer  the  change  in  fair  value  of  the derivatives to accumulated OCI, until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in the fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Certain derivative instruments may qualify for the NPNS exception and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment. ASC 815 applies to NRG's energy related commodity contracts and foreign exchange contracts.\n\nAs the Company engages principally in the trading and marketing of its generation assets and retail operations, some of NRG's  commercial  activities  qualify  for  NPNS  accounting.  Most  of  the  retail  load  contracts  either  qualify  for  the  NPNS exception or fail to meet the criteria for a derivative and the majority of the retail supply and fuels supply contracts are recorded under mark-to-market accounting. All of NRG's hedging and trading activities are subject to limits within the Company's Risk Management Policy.\n\n## Energy-Related Commodities\n\nTo  manage  the  commodity  price  risk  associated  with  the  Company's  competitive  supply  activities  and  the  price  risk associated with wholesale power sales from the Company's electric generation facilities and retail power and gas sales from NRG's  retail  operations,  NRG  enters  into  a  variety  of  derivative  and  non-derivative  hedging  instruments,  utilizing  the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Forward contracts, which commit NRG to purchase or sell energy commodities or fuels in the future;\n- \u00b7 Futures contracts, which are exchange-traded standardized commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial instrument;\n- \u00b7 Swap agreements, which require payments to or from counterparties based upon the differential between two prices for a predetermined contractual, or notional, quantity;\n- \u00b7 Option contracts, which convey to the option holder the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell a commodity; and\n- \u00b7 Weather derivative products used to mitigate a portion of lost revenue due to weather.\n\nThe objectives for entering into derivative contracts designated as hedges include:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated power and gas purchases for the Company's retail sales;\n- \u00b7 Fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales that provides an acceptable return on the Company's electric generation operations; and\n- \u00b7 Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of the Company's power plants.\n\nThese contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.",

        "page_content": "As of December 31, 2022, NRG's derivative assets and liabilities consisted primarily of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Forward and financial contracts for the purchase/sale of electricity and related products economically hedging NRG's generation assets' forecasted output or NRG's retail load obligations through 2036;\n- \u00b7 Forward and financial contracts for the purchase of fuel commodities relating to the forecasted usage of NRG's generation assets through 2024;\n- \u00b7 Other energy derivatives instruments extending through 2029.\n\nAlso, as of December 31, 2022, NRG had other energy-related contracts that did not meet the definition of a derivative instrument or qualified for the NPNS exception and were therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Load-following forward electric sale contracts extending through 2036;\n- \u00b7 Load-following forward natural gas purchase and sale contracts extending through 2032;\n- \u00b7 Power tolling contracts through 2038;\n- \u00b7 Coal purchase contracts through 2024;\n- \u00b7 Power transmission contracts through 2028;\n- \u00b7 Natural gas transportation contracts through 2034;\n- \u00b7 Natural gas storage agreements through 2027; and\n- \u00b7 Coal transportation contracts through 2029.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Contracts\n\nIn order to mitigate foreign exchange risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements through 2026.\n\n## Volumetric Underlying Derivative Transactions\n\nThe following table summarizes the net notional volume buy/(sell) of NRG's open derivative transactions broken out by commodity, excluding those derivatives  that  qualified  for  the  NPNS  exception  as  of  December  31,  2022  and  2021.  Option contracts are reflected using delta volume. Delta volume equals the notional volume of an option adjusted for the probability that the option will be in-the-money at its expiration date.\n\n| (In millions)                  |                                                                        | Total Volume      | Total Volume      |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Commodity                      | Units                                                                  | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021 |\n| Emissions                      | Short Ton   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 1                 | 1                 |\n| Renewables Energy Certificates | Certificates                                                           | 15                | 13                |\n| Coal                           | Short Ton   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 11                | 19                |\n| Natural Gas                    | MMBtu   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 422               | 813               |\n| Oil                            | Barrels    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 1                 | 1                 |\n| Power                          | MWh  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 192               | 185               |\n| Foreign Exchange               | Dollars    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 569               | 279               |\n\n## Fair Value of Derivative Instruments\n\nThe following table summarizes the fair value within the derivative instrument valuation on the balance sheet:\n\n|                                                                                                                                        | Fair Value         | Fair Value         | Fair Value             | Fair Value             |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                        | Derivative Assets  | Derivative Assets  | Derivative Liabilities | Derivative Liabilities |\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                          | December 31,  2022 | December 31,  2021 | December 31,  2022     | December 31,  2021     |\n| Derivatives Not Designated as Cash Flow or Fair  Value Hedges :                                                                        |                    |                    |                        |                        |\n| Foreign exchange contracts - current   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                 | $  11              | $  -               | $  1                   | $  1                   |\n| Foreign exchange contracts - long-term  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                    | 7                  | 1                  | 1                      | -                      |\n| Commodity contracts- current   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                               | 7,875              | 4,613              | 6,194                  | 3,386                  |\n| Commodity contracts- long-term   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                 | 4,101              | 2,526              | 2,245                  | 1,412                  |\n| Total Derivatives Not Designated as Cash Flow or Fair  Value Hedges  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  11,994          | $  7,140           | $  8,441               | $  4,799               |",

The roll-off amounts were offset by realized gains or losses at the settled prices and are reflected in revenue or cost of operations during the same period.\n\nThe gains from open economic hedge positions of $2.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily the result of an increase in value of forward positions as a result of increases in natural gas and power prices.\n\nThe loss from open economic hedge positions of $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily the result of a decrease in the value of forward positions as a result of decreases in ERCOT power prices and heat rate contraction, partially offset by an increase in value of forward positions as a result of decreases in New York capacity prices.\n\n## Credit Risk Related Contingent Features\n\nCertain of the Company's hedging and trading agreements contain provisions that entitle the counterparty to demand that the Company post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in the Company's credit quality, generally termed 'adequate assurance' under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there were a downgrade in the Company's credit rating. The collateral potentially required for contracts with adequate assurance clauses that are in net liability positions as of December 31, 2022 was $1.5 billion. The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements under which it has a net liability position, but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which was approximately $195 million as of December 31, 2022. In the event of a downgrade in the Company's credit rating and if called for by the counterparty, $30 million of additional collateral would be required for all contracts with credit rating contingent features as of December 31, 2022.\n\nSee Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for discussion regarding concentration of credit risk.",

        "page_content": "## Note 7 Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund\n\nNRG's  Nuclear  Decommissioning  Trust  Fund  assets,  which  are  for  the  decommissioning  of  STP,  are  comprised  of securities classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value based on actively quoted market prices. Although NRG is responsible  for  managing  the  decommissioning  of  its  44%  interest  in  STP,  the  predecessor  utilities  that  owned  STP  are authorized by the PUCT to collect decommissioning funds from their ratepayers to cover decommissioning costs on behalf of NRG. NRC requirements determine the decommissioning cost estimate, which is the minimum required level of funding. In the event  that  funds  from  the  ratepayers  that  accumulate  in  the  nuclear  decommissioning  trust  are  ultimately  determined  to  be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities, the utilities will be required to collect through rates charged to rate payers all additional amounts, with no obligation from NRG, provided that NRG has complied with PUCT rules and regulations regarding decommissioning trusts. Following completion of the decommissioning, if surplus funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, any excess will be refunded to the respective ratepayers of the utilities.\n\nNRG accounts for the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations , or ASC 980, because the Company's nuclear decommissioning activities are subject to approval by the PUCT, with regulated rates that are  designed  to  recover  all  decommissioning  costs  and  that  can  be  charged  to  and  collected  from  the  ratepayers  per  PUCT mandate. Since the Company is in compliance with PUCT rules and regulations regarding decommissioning trusts and the cost of  decommissioning  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Texas  ratepayers,  not  NRG,  all  realized  and  unrealized  gains  or  losses (including other-than-temporary impairments) related to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund are recorded to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust liability and are not included in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income, consistent with regulatory treatment.\n\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate fair values and unrealized gains and losses for the securities held in the trust funds, as well as information about the contractual maturities of those securities.\n\n|                                                                                        | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2022                 | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| (In millions, except otherwise noted)                                                  | Fair Value                | Unrealized Gains          | Unrealized Losses         | Weighted- average maturities (in years) | Fair Value                | Unrealized Gains          | Unrealized Losses         | Weighted- average maturities (in years) |\n| Cash and cash equivalents   . . . . . . . .                                            | $  15                     | $  -                      | $  -                      | -                                       | $  33                     | $  -                      | $  -                      | -                                       |\n| U.S. government and federal agency  obligations    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 86                        | -                         | 5                         | 11                                      | 112                       | 5                         | 1                         | 10                                      |\n| Federal agency mortgage-backed  securities  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 101                       | -                         | 11                        | 26                                      | 100                       | 2                         | -                         | 25                                      |\n| Commercial mortgage-backed  securities  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | 35                        | -                         | 4                         | 30                                      | 44                        | 1                         | -                         | 27                                      |\n| Corporate debt securities   . . . . . . . . .                                          | 114                       | -                         | 13                        | 12                                      | 122                       | 7                         | 1                         | 14                                      |\n| Equity securities  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                     | 486                       | 346                       | 3                         | -                                       | 593                       | 456                       | -                         | -                                       |\n| Foreign government fixed income  securities  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 1                         | -                         | -                         | 17                                      | 4                         | -                         | -                         | 13                                      |\n| Total   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                              | $  838                    | $  346                    | $  36                     |                                         | $ 1,008                   | $  471                    | $  2                      |                                         |\n\nThe following table summarizes proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities and the related realized gains and losses from these sales.

Depreciation expense of property, plant and equipment recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $291 million, $384 million and $295 million, respectively.\n\n## Note 10 -Leases\n\nThe Company leases generating facilities, land, office and equipment, railcars, fleet vehicles and storefront space at retail stores. Operating leases with an initial term greater than twelve months are recognized as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company made an accounting policy election, as permitted by ASC 842, for all asset classes not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for its short-term leases, which are leases that have a lease term of twelve months or less. For the initial measurement of lease liabilities, the discount rate that the Company uses is either the rate implicit in the lease, if known, or its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term an amount equal to the payments for the lease. The Company recognizes lease expense for all operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In the future, should another systematic basis become more representative of the pattern in which the lessee expects to consume the remaining economic benefit of the right-of-use asset, the Company will use that basis for lease expense.\n\nThe Company considers a contract to be or to contain a lease when both of the following conditions apply: 1) an asset is either explicitly or implicitly identified in the contract and 2) the contract conveys to the Company the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time. The Company has the right to control the use of the identified asset when the Company has both the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used throughout the period of use.\n\nLease payments are typically fixed and payable on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. Lease payments under certain agreements may escalate over the lease term either by a fixed percentage or a fixed dollar amount. Certain leases may provide for variable lease payments in the form of payments based on unit availability, usage, a percentage of sales from the location under lease, or index-based (e.g., the U.S. Consumer Price Index) adjustments to lease payments. The Company has no leases which contain residual value guarantees provided by the Company as a lessee.",

As a result, the Company impaired $43 million of Astoria project spend in the East segment. For further discussion of the transaction, see Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions .\n\nPJM Asset Impairments -  During  the  second  quarter  of  2022,  the  results  of  the  PJM  Base  Residual  Auction  for  the 2023/2024 delivery year were released leading the Company to revise its long-term view of certain facilities and announce the planned retirement of the Joliet generating facility. The Company considered the near-term retirement date of Joliet and the decline in PJM capacity prices to be a trigger for impairment and performed impairment tests on the PJM generating assets and the goodwill associated with Midwest Generation. The Company measured the impairment losses on the PJM generating assets and  Midwest  Generation  goodwill  as  the  difference  between  the  carrying  amount  and  the  fair  value  of  the  PJM  generating assets and Midwest Generation reporting unit, respectively. Fair values were determined using an income approach in which the Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for the plants and reporting unit. Significant inputs impacting the income approach include the Company's long-term view of capacity and fuel prices, projected generation, the physical and economic characteristics of each plant and the reporting unit as a whole, and the discount rate applied to the after-tax cash flow projections. Impairment losses of $20 million and $130 million were recorded in the East segment on the PJM generating assets and Midwest Generation goodwill, respectively.\n\nOther Impairments - The Company  additionally recorded impairment losses of $13 million in the East segment.\n\n## 2021 Impairment Losses\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed its annual budget and analyzed the corresponding impact on estimated  cash  flows  associated  with  its  long-lived  assets.  The  fair  value  of  the  assets  was  determined  using  an  income approach  by  applying  a  discounted  cash  flow  methodology  to  the  long-term  budget  for  the  facility.  The  income  approach utilized  estimates  of  after-tax  cash  flows,  which  were  Level  3  fair  value  measurements,  and  included  key  inputs  such  as forecasted power prices, fuel costs, operating and maintenance costs, plant investment capital expenditures and discount rates.\n\nJoliet -The Company recognized an impairment loss of  $213 million in the East segment as a result of changes in the long-term outlook of the Joliet facility prompted by market conditions and an assessment of various alternatives for the longterm operational landscape of the facility including the impact of the CEJA in Illinois, which concluded with the annual budget process.\n\nOther Impairments -  The  Company additionally recorded impairment losses of $16 million and $9 million related to various power plants in the East and West/Service/Other segments, respectively.\n\nThe Company also recorded the following impairment in 2021 based on a specific triggering event that occurred using the same methodology previously discussed:\n\nPJM Asset Impairments During  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  the  results  of  the  PJM  Base  Residual  Auction  for  the 2022/2023 delivery year were released leading the Company to announce the near-term retirement of a significant portion of its PJM  coal  generating  assets  in  June  2022.  The  Company  considered  the  decline  in  PJM  capacity  prices  and  the  near-term retirement dates of certain assets to be a trigger for impairment and performed impairment tests on the PJM generating assets and the goodwill associated with Midwest Generation. Impairment losses of $271 million and $35 million were recorded in the East segment on the PJM generating assets and Midwest Generation goodwill, respectively.\n\n## 2020 Impairment Losses\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company completed its annual budget and revised its view of long-term power and fuel prices and the corresponding impact on estimated cash flows associated with its long-lives assets. The Cottonwood facility had estimated cash flows that were lower than its carrying amount and the assets were considered impaired. The fair value of the assets was determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budget for the facility. The income approach utilized estimates of after-tax cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and included key inputs such as forecasted power prices, fuel costs, operating and maintenance costs, plant investment capital expenditures and discount rates.\n\nThe Cottonwood facility is being leased through 2025 and the Company recognized an impairment loss of $32 million in 2020  in  the  West/Services/Other  segment  associated  with  the  Company's  long-term  services  agreement  and  related  lease payments, as the carrying amounts of the assets from the contract were higher than the estimated operating cash flow though the remaining lease period.",

Emission  allowances  held-for-sale  are included in other non-current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are not amortized, but rather expensed as sold.  As  of  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  the  value  of  emission  allowances  held-for-sale  was  $8  million  and  $15  million, respectively, within the Corporate segment. Once transferred to held-for-sale, these emission allowances are prohibited from moving back to held-for-use.\n\n## Note 14 Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nThe  Company's  AROs  are  primarily  related  to  the  environmental  obligations  for  nuclear  decommissioning,  mine reclamation, ash disposal, site closures, fuel storage facilities and future dismantlement of equipment on leased property. In addition, the Company has also identified conditional AROs for asbestos removal and disposal, which are specific to certain power generation operations.\n\nSee Note 7, Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund, for a further discussion of the Company's nuclear decommissioning obligations. Accretion for the nuclear decommissioning ARO and amortization of the related ARO asset are recorded to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Liability to the ratepayers and are not included in net income, consistent with treatment per ASC 980, Regulated Operations .\n\nThe  following  table  represents  the  balance  of  ARO  obligations  as  of  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  along  with  the additions,  reductions  and  accretion  related  to  the  Company's  ARO  obligations  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022:\n\nNuclear\n\n| (In millions)                                                                                               | Decommission   | Other (a)   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------|---------|\n| Balance as of December 31, 2021  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                    | $  321         | $  399      | $  720  |\n| Revisions in estimates for current obligations                                                              | -              | 38          | 38      |\n| Additions  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | -              | 1           | 1       |\n| Spending for current obligations  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                 | -              | (33)        | (33)    |\n| Accretion  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 19             | 19          | 38      |\n| Other   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | -              | (6)         | (6)     |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2022  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                    | $  340         | $  418      | $  758  |",

        "page_content": "## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nOn February 14, 2023 (the 'Revolving Credit Facility Amendment Effective Date'), the Company amended its Revolving Credit  Facility  to:  (i)  increase  the  existing  revolving  commitments  thereunder  by  $600  million  (the  'Incremental Commitment'), (ii) extend the maturity date of a portion of the revolving commitments thereunder to February 14, 2028, (iii) transition the benchmark rate applicable to revolving loans from LIBOR to SOFR and (iv) make certain other amendments to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility for purposes of, among other things, providing additional flexibility.\n\nAfter  giving  effect  to  the  Incremental  Commitment  on  the  Revolving  Credit  Facility  Amendment  Effective  Date,  the Company will have a total of $4.275 billion of revolving commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. The full amount of the Incremental Commitment was made available from and after the Revolving Credit Facility Amendment Effective Date but will  be  reduced  by  $500  million  if  the  Vivint  acquisition  is  not  consummated.  A  portion  of  the  non-extended  revolving commitments will terminate on July 5, 2023, with the remaining portion terminating on May 28, 2024, in each case, unless otherwise extended.\n\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by NRG's existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries, with customary and agreed-upon exceptions, for, among other exceptions, unrestricted subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries, project subsidiaries, immaterial subsidiaries, captive insurance subsidiaries and securitization vehicles. The Revolving Credit Facility is also secured by  a  first  priority  perfected  security  interest  in  a  substantial  portion  of  the  property  and  assets  owned  by  NRG  and  its subsidiaries  that  are  guarantors  under  the  Revolving  Credit  Facility,  subject  to  certain  exceptions  that  include,  among  other things, the capital stock of certain specified subsidiaries, including unrestricted subsidiaries and certain excluded subsidiaries, equity interests in excess of 66% of the total outstanding voting equity interests of certain foreign subsidiaries, equity interests the pledge of which is prohibited by applicable agreements binding on such subsidiaries and other assets that may be designated by NRG as excluded from the collateral that, when taken together with all other assets so designated since the Revolving Credit Facility Amendment Effective Date, have an aggregate fair market value not exceeding $750 million. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured on a pari passu basis with certain interest rate, foreign currency and commodity hedging obligations of NRG, the Senior Secured Notes and certain other indebtedness.\n\nThe  Revolving  Credit  Facility  contains  customary  covenants,  which,  among  other  things,  require  NRG  to  maintain  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum first lien leverage ratio on a consolidated basis and limit NRG's ability to:\n\n- \u00b7 incur indebtedness and liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions;\n- \u00b7 make investments, loans and advances;\n- \u00b7 return capital to shareholders;\n- \u00b7 repay subordinated indebtedness;\n- \u00b7 consummate mergers, consolidations and asset sales;\n- \u00b7 enter into affiliate transactions; and\n- \u00b7 change its fiscal year-end.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings and there were $1.6 billion in letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n## Senior Notes\n\n## Issuance of 2032 Senior Notes\n\nOn August 23, 2021, the Company issued $1.1 billion of aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2032. The 2032 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NRG and are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries. Interest is paid semi-annually beginning on February 15, 2022 until the maturity date of February 15, 2032. The 2032 Senior Notes were issued under NRG's Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework, which sets out certain sustainability targets, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to meet such sustainability targets will result in a 25 basis point increase to the interest rate payable on the 2032 Senior Notes from and including August 15, 2026. The proceeds of the 2032 Senior Notes, along with cash on hand, were used to fund the redemption of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 7.250% Senior Notes due 2026 and $355 million aggregate principal amounts of the 6.625% Senior Notes due 2027.",

The  carrying  amount  of  the  liability  component  was  initially calculated  by  measuring  the  fair  value  of  similar  liabilities  that  do  not  have  an  associated  convertible  feature.  The  carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Convertible Senior Notes. This difference represented the debt discount that was amortized to interest expense over seven years, which was determined to be the expected life of the Convertible Senior Notes, using the effective interest rate method. The equity component was recorded in additional paid-in capital and was not remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification.\n\nFollowing the adoption of ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2022, the Company no longer records the conversion feature of its  convertible  senior  notes  in  equity.  Instead,  the  Company  combined  the  previously  separated  equity  component  with  the liability  component,  which  together  is  now  classified  as  debt,  thereby  eliminating  the  subsequent  amortization  of  the  debt discount as interest  expense.  As  a  result  of  the  provisions  of  the  amended  guidance,  the  Company  recorded  a  $100  million decrease to additional paid-in capital, a $57 million decrease to debt discount, a $57 million increase to retained earnings, and a $14 million decrease to long-term deferred tax liabilities. For more information on the adoption of ASU 2020-06, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n\nModification to Convertible Senior Notes -  On  February  22,  2022,  the  Company irrevocably elected to eliminate the right  to  settle  conversions  only  in  shares  of  the  Company's  common  stock,  such  that  any  conversion  after  such  date,  the Company  will  pay  cash  per  $1,000  principal  amount  and  will  settle  in  cash  or  a  combination  of  cash  and  the  Company's common stock for the remainder, if any, of the Company's conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount.\n\nConvertible Senior Notes Features - As of  December 31, 2022, the Convertible Senior Notes were convertible, under certain circumstances, into cash or a combination of cash and the Company's common stock at a price of $43.46 per common share, which is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately 23.0116 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2021, the Convertible Senior Notes were convertible at a price of $44.89 per common share, which is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately 22.2761 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes. The net carrying amounts of the Convertible Senior Notes as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $570 million and $512 million, respectively. The Convertible Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2048, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. The Convertible Senior notes are convertible at  the  option  of  the  holders  under  certain  circumstances.  Prior  to  the  close  of  business  on  the  business  day  immediately preceding December 1, 2024, the Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods, and thereafter during specified periods as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 from December 1, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before June 1, 2025; and\n- \u00b7 from  December  1,  2047  until  the  close  of  business  on  the  second  scheduled  trading  day  immediately  before  the maturity date",

The indentures also provide for customary events of default, which include, among others: nonpayment of principal  or  interest;  breach  of  other  agreements  in  the  indentures;  defaults  in  failure  to  pay  certain  other  indebtedness;  the rendering of judgments to pay certain amounts of money against NRG and its subsidiaries; the failure of certain guarantees to be  enforceable;  and  certain  events  of  bankruptcy  or  insolvency.  Generally,  if  an  event  of  default  occurs,  the  Trustee  or  the Holders of at least 25% or 30% (depending on the series of Senior Notes) in principal amount of the then outstanding series of Senior Notes may declare all of the Senior Notes of such series to be due and payable immediately. The terms of the indentures, among other things, limit NRG's ability and certain of its subsidiaries' ability to return capital to stockholders, grant liens on assets to lenders and incur additional debt. Interest is payable semi-annually on the Senior Notes until their maturity dates.\n\n## 2027 Senior Notes\n\nNRG may redeem some or all of the 2027 Senior Notes at redemption prices expressed as percentages of principal amount as set forth in the following table, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes redeemed to the first applicable redemption date:\n\n| Redemption Period                                                                                                                                             | Redemption Percentage   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| July 15, 2022 to July 14, 2023                                                                                                                                | 102.208 %               |\n| July 15, 2023 to July 14, 2024                                                                                                                                | 101.104 %               |\n| July 15, 2024 and thereafter  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100.000 %               |",

Pursuant to the Performance Guaranty, the Company has guaranteed, for the benefit of NRG Receivables and the Lenders, the payment and  performance  by  each  indirect  subsidiary  of  its  respective  obligations  under  the  Receivables  Facility.  The  accounts receivables remain on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and any amounts funded by the Lenders to NRG Receivables LLC will be reflected as short-term borrowings. Cash flows from the Receivables Facility are reflected as financing activities in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company will continue to service the accounts receivables sold in exchange for a servicing fee.\n\nOn  July  26,  2022,  NRG  Receivables  LLC,  a  wholly-owned  indirect  subsidiary  of  the  Company,  entered  into  an amendment to its Receivables Facility dated September 22, 2020 with a group of conduit lenders and banks and Royal Bank of Canada, as Administrative Agent to, among other things, (i) extend the scheduled termination date by one year, (ii) increase the aggregate  commitments  from  $800  million  to  $1.0  billion,  (iii)  increase  the  letter  of  credit  sublimit  to  equal  the  aggregate commitments, (iv) replace LIBOR with Term SOFR as the benchmark for borrowings and (v) add new originators. Borrowings by NRG Receivables LLC under the Receivables Facility bear interest as defined under the Receivables Financing Agreement. The weighted average interest rate related to usage under the Receivables Facility as of December 31, 2022 was 0.844%. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings and there were $721 million in letters of credit issued under the Receivables Facility.\n\n## Repurchase Facility\n\nIn  2020,  the  Company  entered  into  the  Repurchase  Facility  related  to  the  Receivables  Facility.  Under  the  Repurchase Facility, the Company can borrow up to $75 million, collateralized by a subordinated note issued by NRG Receivables LLC to NRG  Retail  LLC  in  favor  of  the  originating  entities  representing  a  portion  of  the  balance  of  receivables  sold  to  NRG Receivables LLC under the Receivables Facility.\n\nOn February 9, 2022, the Company entered into amendments to its existing Repurchase Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the size of the facility from $75 million to $150 million and (ii) replace LIBOR with term SOFR as the benchmark for the pricing rate. On July 26, 2022, the Company renewed its existing Repurchase Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to  July  26,  2023.  The  Repurchase  Facility  has  no  commitment  fee  and  borrowings  will  be  drawn  at  SOFR  + 1.30%. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Repurchase Facility.\n\n## Bilateral Letter of Credit Facilities\n\nOn April 29, 2022, May 27, 2022 and October 13, 2022, the Company increased the size of the facilities by $100 million, $50 million and $50 million respectively, to provide additional liquidity, allowing for the issuance of up to $675 million of letters of credit.

The fair value of the common/collective trust investments is valued at fair value which is equal to the sum of the market value of all of the fund's underlying investments. Certain common/collective trust investments have readily determinable fair value as they publish daily net asset value, or NAV, per share and are categorized as Level 2. Certain other common/collective trust investments and partnerships/joint ventures use NAV per share, or its equivalent, as a practical expedient for valuation, and thus have been removed from the fair value hierarchy table.\n\nThe following table presents the significant assumptions used to calculate NRG's benefit obligations:\n\n|                                                                                 | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                                 | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits |\n| Weighted-Average Assumptions                                                    | 2022                 | 2021                 | 2022                          | 2021                          |\n| Discount rate   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 5.18 %               | 2.89 %               | 5.19 %                        | 2.89 %                        |\n| Interest crediting rate  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 5.21 %               | 3.07 %               | 4.00 %                        | 1.94 %                        |\n| Rate of compensation increase                                                   | 3.06 %               | 3.06 %               | - %                           | - %                           |\n| Health care trend rate    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | -                    | -                    | 7.0% grading  to 4.4% in 2031 | 6.8% grading to  4.4% in 2028 |\n\nThe following table presents the significant assumptions used to calculate NRG's benefit expense:\n\n|                                                     | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                     | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits |\n| Weighted-Average  Assumptions                       | 2022                 | 2021                 | 2020                 | 2022                          | 2021                          | 2020                          |\n| Discount rate   . . . . . . .                       | 2.89%/4.71%/5.41%    | 2.55 %               | 3.26 %               | 2.82 %                        | 2.81 %                        | 3.26 %                        |\n| Interest crediting rate  .                          | 3.07 %               | 3.13 %               | 3.66 %               | 1.94 %                        | 1.62 %                        | 2.28 %                        |\n| Expected return on  plan assets   . . . . . . .     | 4.99 %               | 5.62 %               | 5.93 %               | -                             | -                             | -                             |\n| Rate of compensation  increase    . . . . . . . . . | 3.06 %               | 3.06 %               | 3.00 %               | -                             | -                             | -                             |\n| Health care trend rate                              | -                    | -                    | -                    | 6.9% grading  to 4.4% in 2028 | 7.0% grading  to 4.4% in 2028 | 7.5% grading to  4.5% in 2028 |",

        "page_content": "NRG  uses  December  31  of  each  respective  year  as  the  measurement  date  for  the  Company's  pension  and  other postretirement benefit plans. The Company sets the discount rate assumptions on an annual basis for each of NRG's defined benefit retirement plans as of December 31. The discount rate assumptions represent the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at December 31. The Company utilizes the Aon AA Above Median, or AA-AM, yield curve and the AON Canada yield curve to select the appropriate discount rate assumption for its retirement plans. The AA-AM yield curve is a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 6 months to 99 years. Under the AA-AM yield curve, each bond issue used to build this yield curve must be non-callable, and have an average rating  of  AA  when  averaging  available  Moody's  Investor  Services,  Standard  &  Poor's  and  Fitch  ratings.  The  AON Canada yield curve is based on high quality corporate bonds. Under the AON Canada yield curve, expected plan cash flows were discounted using the yield curve, and then a single rate is determined which produces an equivalent present value.\n\nNRG employs a total return investment approach, whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize  the  long-term  return  of  plan  assets  for  a  prudent  level  of  risk.  Risk  tolerance  is  established  through  careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. The Investment Committee reviews the asset  mix  periodically  and  as  the  plan  assets  increase  in  future  years,  the  Investment  Committee  may  examine  other  asset classes such as real estate or private equity. NRG employs a building block approach to determining the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets, with proper consideration given to diversification and rebalancing. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.\n\nThe target allocations of NRG's pension plan assets were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n\n| U.S. equity   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 21 %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Non-U.S. equity                                                                                                                                                                 | 14 %   |\n| Non-core assets    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | 18 %   |\n| Fixed Income   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | 47 %   |\n\nPlan  assets  are  currently  invested  in  a  diversified  blend  of  equity  and  fixed-income  investments.  Furthermore,  equity investments are diversified across U.S., non-U.S., global, and emerging market equities, as well as among growth, value, small and large capitalization stocks.\n\nInvestment risk and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly portfolio reviews of each asset fund class to a related performance benchmark, if applicable, and annual pension liability measurements.

STPNOC, which operates and maintains STP, provides its employees a defined benefit pension plan, as well as postretirement health and welfare benefits. Although NRG does not sponsor the STP plan, it reimburses STPNOC for 44% of the contributions made towards its retirement plan obligations. The STPNOC defined benefit pension plan was frozen to all employees during 2021.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, NRG reimbursed STPNOC $18 million and $17 million, respectively, for its contribution to the plans. In 2023, NRG expects to reimburse STPNOC $10 million for its contribution to the plan.\n\nThe Company has recognized the following in its statement of financial position, statement of operations and accumulated OCI related to its 44% interest in STP:\n\n|                                                                                                              | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                              | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits |\n| (In millions)                                                                                                | 2022                 | 2021                 | 2022                          | 2021                          |\n| Funded status - STPNOC benefit plans    . . . . . . . . . .                                                  | $  (7)  $            | (50)  $              | (13)  $                       | (18)                          |\n| Net periodic benefit cost/(credit)    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                        | 2                    | 17                   | (4)                           | (4)                           |\n| Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations  recognized in other comprehensive income   . . . . . . | (27)                 | (51)                 | 1                             | 4                             |\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nNRG's employees are also eligible to participate in defined contribution 401(k) plans.\n\nThe Company's contributions to these plans were as follows:\n\n|                                                     | Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020   | Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020   | Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                       | 2022                                |                                     |                                     |\n| Company contributions to defined contribution plans | $  26                               | 25                                  | 22                                  |",

In 2021, 2022 and 2023, NRG increased the annual dividend to $1.30, $1.40 and $1.51 per share, respectively, representing an 8% increase each year. The long-term capital allocation policy targets an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in subsequent years. The Company's common stock dividends are subject  to  available  capital,  market  conditions,  and  compliance  with  associated  laws,  regulations  and  other  contractual obligations.\n\nOn January 20, 2023, NRG declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.3775 per share, or $1.51 per share on an annualized basis, payable on February 15, 2023, to stockholders of record as of February 1, 2023.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan -  The  Company offers participation in the ESPP, which allows eligible employees to elect to withhold between 1% and 10% of their eligible compensation to purchase shares of NRG common stock at the lesser of 95% of its market value on the offering date or 95% of the fair market value on the exercise date. An offering date will occur each April 1 and October 1. An exercise date will occur each September 30 and March 31. As of December 31, 2021, there remained 2,493,374 shares of treasury stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nIn December 2021, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized $1 billion for share repurchases as part of NRG's Capital Allocation policy. The program began with $44 million of repurchases in December 2021, and an incremental $601 million was repurchased in 2022. The balance of $355 million under the current program is expected to be repurchased in 2023, subject to the availability of excess cash and full visibility of the achievement of the Company's 2023 targeted credit metrics.\n\nIn October 2022, the Company announced its 2023 capital allocation plan which, consistent with NRG's stated strategy of returning  50%  of  cash  available  for  allocation  to  shareholders,  included  $600  million  incremental  share  repurchases  to  be completed in 2023. In connection with the anticipated Vivint acquisition, the Company updated its 2023 capital allocation plan by  reallocating  2023  capital  primarily  to  fund  the  Vivint  acquisition,  dividend  payments  and  debt  reduction.  Following  the completion of the Vivint acquisition, the Company plans to further update its 2023 capital allocation plan.",

Shares issued and treasury shares repurchased during the year are weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding. Diluted income per share is computed in a manner consistent with that of basic income per share, while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period.\n\nDilutive effect for equity compensation and other equity instruments - The relative performance stock units, non-vested restricted  stock  units,  market  stock  units  and  non-qualified  stock  options  are  not  considered  outstanding  for  purposes  of computing basic income per share. However, these instruments are included in the denominator for purposes of computing diluted income per share under the treasury stock method for periods when there is net income. The Convertible Senior Notes are convertible, under certain circumstances, into cash or combination of cash and Company's common stock. Prior to adoption of ASU 2020-06, there was no dilutive effect for the Convertible Senior Notes due to the Company's expectation to settle the liability in cash. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, on January 1, 2022, the Company is including the potential share settlements, if any, in the denominator for purposes of computing diluted income per share under the if converted method for periods when there is net income. The potential shares settlements are calculated as the excess of the Company's conversion obligation over the aggregate principal amount (which will be settled in cash), divided by the average share price for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2022, there was no dilutive effect for the Convertible Senior Notes since there were no potential share settlements for the period.\n\nThe reconciliation of NRG's basic income per share to diluted income per share is shown in the following table:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions, except per share amounts)                                                                                                                                                                    | 2022                      | 2021                      | 2020                      |\n| Basic income per share attributable to NRG Energy, Inc;                                                                                                                                                    |                           |                           |                           |\n| Net income attributable to NRG Energy, Inc. common stockholders  . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                       | $  1,221                  | $  2,187                  | $  510                    |\n| Weighted average number of common shares outstanding-basic   . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                     | 236                       | 245                       | 245                       |\n| Income per weighted average common share - basic  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                  | $  5.17                   | $  8.93                   | $  2.08                   |\n| Diluted income per share attributable to NRG Energy, Inc;                                                                                                                                                  |                           |                           |                           |\n| Net income attributable to NRG Energy, Inc. common stockholders  . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                       | $  1,221                  | $  2,187                  | $  510                    |\n| Weighted average number of common shares outstanding-basic   . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                     | 236                       | 245                       | 245                       |\n| Incremental shares attributable to the issuance of equity compensation (treasury  stock method)    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | -                         | -                         | 1                         |\n| Weighted average number of common shares outstanding-diluted    . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                      | 236                       | 245                       | 246                       |\n| Income per weighted average common share - diluted  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                    | $  5.17                   | $  8.93                   | $  2.07                   |\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company had an insignificant number of outstanding equity instruments that are anti-dilutive and were not included in the computation of the Company's diluted income per share.",

The  Company  will continue  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  corporate  book  minimum  tax  when  the  U.S.  Treasury  and  the  IRS  release  further guidance. Additionally, the IRA establishes a production tax credit associated with existing nuclear facilities which begins in 2024 and terminates at the end of 2031. The production tax credit will fully apply when gross revenues are at or below $25 per MWh and phases out completely at $43.75 per MWh. The U.S. Treasury is in the process of defining the methods by which gross revenues may be calculated pursuant to the IRA.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the Senate passed the CARES Act to provide emergency relief related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act contains federal income tax provisions which, among other things: (i) increases the amount of interest expense that businesses are allowed to deduct by increasing the adjusted taxable income limitation from 30% to 50% for tax years that begin  in  2019  and  2020;  (ii)  permits  businesses  to  carry  back  to  each  of  the  five  tax  years  NOLs  arising  from  tax  years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2020; and (iii) temporarily removes the 80% limitation on NOLs until tax years beginning after 2020. The CARES Act provisions did not have a material impact on the tax positions of the Company.\n\nThe following represented the domestic and foreign components of income before income taxes:\n\n|                                                                                                                   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                     | 2022                      | 2021                      | 2020                      |\n| U.S.    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  1,436                  | $  2,759                  | $  749                    |\n| Foreign   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 227                       | 100                       | 12                        |\n| Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | $  1,663                  | $  2,859                  | $  761                    |",

 As  of December  31,  2022  and  2021,  NRG  recorded  a  net  deferred  tax  asset,  excluding valuation allowance, of $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. The Company believes certain state net operating losses may not  be  realizable  under  the  more-likely-than-not  measurement  and  as  such,  a  valuation  allowance  was  recorded  as  of December 31, 2022 as discussed below.\n\nNOL carryforwards -  As  of December 31, 2022, the Company had tax-effected cumulative U.S. NOLs consisting of carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $1.7 billion and $315 million, respectively. In addition, NRG has tax-effected  cumulative  foreign  NOL  carryforwards  of  $104  million.  The  majority  of  NRG's  NOL  carryforwards  have  no expiration date.",

        "page_content": "Valuation allowance -  As of December 31, 2022, the Company's tax-effected valuation allowance was $224 million, consisting of state NOL carryforwards and foreign NOL carryforwards. The valuation allowance was recorded based on the assessment  of  cumulative  and  forecasted  pre-tax  book  earnings  and  the  future  reversal  of  existing  taxable  temporary differences.\n\n## Taxes Receivable and Payable\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  NRG  recorded  a  current  net  federal  receivable  of  $5  million  and  a  current  net  foreign receivable of $13 million due to filings of Canadian amended returns as well as prepayments of estimated taxes.\n\n## Uncertain tax benefits\n\nNRG has identified uncertain tax benefits with after-tax value of $22 million and $13 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, for which NRG has recorded a non-current tax liability of $24 million and $14 million, respectively. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company recognized $1 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, an immaterial amount for the year ended 2021 and $1 million for the year ended 2020. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, NRG had cumulative interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax benefits of $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\n\nTax jurisdictions - NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including operations located in Australia and Canada.\n\nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2019. With few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2014.\n\nThe following table summarizes uncertain tax benefits activity:\n\n|                                                                                                                                     | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                       | 2022                 | 2021                 |\n| Balance as of January 1   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  13                | $  15                |\n| Increase due to current year positions   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | 9                    | 4                    |\n| Increase due to acquired balance from Direct Energy                                                                                 | -                    | 9                    |\n| Settlements, payments and statute closure  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .            | -                    | (15)                 |\n| Uncertain tax benefits as of December 31   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .            | $  22                | $  13                |\n\n## Note 21 Stock-Based Compensation\n\n## NRG Energy, Inc.

Fair  value  of  the  DSUs,  which  is  based  on  the  closing  price  of  NRG  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant,  is  recorded  as compensation expense in the period of grant.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's outstanding DSU awards and changes during the year:\n\n|                                                                                                                                 | Units    | Weighted Average Grant  Date Fair Value per Unit   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2021   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                | 384,128  | $  26.11                                           |\n| Granted   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 52,865   | 45.49                                              |\n| Converted to Common Stock   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                 | (18,979) | 39.27                                              |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2022                                                                                                | 418,014  | 27.63                                              |\n\nThe  aggregate  intrinsic  values  for  DSUs  outstanding  as  of  December  31,  2022,  2021  and  2020  were  approximately $13 million, $17 million and $13 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values for DSUs converted to common stock for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $1 million, $1 million and $2 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of DSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $45.49, $32.27 and $35.59, respectively.\n\n## Relative Performance Stock Units\n\nRPSUs entitle the recipient to stock upon vesting. The amount of the award is subject to the Company's achievement of certain performance measures over the vesting period. RPSUs are restricted grants where the quantity of shares increases and decreases alongside the Company's Total Shareholder Return, or TSR, relative to the TSR of the Company's current proxy peer group and the total returns of select indexes, or Peer Group. For RPSU's granted in 2022 and forward, the peer group consists of the  companies  that  comprise  the  Standard  &  Poor's  500  Index  on  the  first  day  of  the  performance  period.  Each  RPSU represents the potential to receive NRG common stock after the completion of the performance period, typically three years of service from the date of grant. The number of shares of NRG common stock to be paid (if any) as of the vesting date for each RPSU will depend on the Company's percentile rank within the Peer Group. The number of shares of common stock to be paid as  of  the  vesting  date  for  each  RPSU  is  linearly  interpolated  for  TSR  performance  between  the  following  points:  (i)  0%  if ranked below the 25th percentile; (ii) 25% if ranked at the 25th percentile; (iii) 100% if ranked at the 55th percentile (or the 65th percentile if the Company's absolute TSR is less than negative 15%); and (iv) 200% if ranked at the 75th percentile or above.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's non-vested RPSU awards and changes during the year:\n\n|                                                                                                                                   | Units     | Weighted Average Grant- Date Fair Value per Unit   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Non-vested at December 31, 2021   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                 | 730,505   | $  47.40                                           |\n| Granted   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 291,852   | 57.41                                              |\n| Forfeited   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (54,392)  | 46.68                                              |\n| Vested  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (172,630) | 45.77                                              |\n| Non-vested at December 31, 2022                                                                                                   | 795,335   | 50.23                                              |\n\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of RPSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, was $57.41, $46.78 and $23.75, respectively.\n\nThe fair value of RPSUs is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and expensed over the service  period,  which  equals  the  vesting  period.

Minimum purchase commitment obligations are as follows as of December 31, 2022:\n\n| Period                                                                                                                                                                              | (In millions)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 2023  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | $  908          |\n| 2024  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 1,050           |\n| 2025  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 662             |\n| 2026  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 396             |\n| 2027  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 296             |\n| Thereafter                                                                                                                                                                          | 987             |\n| Total (a)         . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  4,299        |\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the costs of purchased energy were $18.8 billion, $12.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.\n\n## First Lien Structure\n\nNRG has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of property and assets owned by NRG and the guarantors of its senior debt. NRG uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedges. To the extent  that  the  underlying  hedge  positions  for  a  counterparty  are  out-of-the-money  to  NRG,  the  counterparty  would  have  a claim under the first lien program. As of December 31, 2022, hedges under the first lien were out-of-the-money for NRG on a counterparty aggregate basis.\n\n## Nuclear Insurance\n\nSTP  maintains  required  insurance  coverage  for  liability  claims  arising  from  nuclear  incidents  pursuant  to  the  PriceAnderson Act. The current liability limit per incident is $13.7 billion, subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and  the  number  of  licensed  reactors.  An  inflation  adjustment  must  be  made  at  least  once  every  five  years  with  the  next adjustment expected to be effective no later than November 1, 2023. Under the Price-Anderson Act, owners of nuclear power plants in the U.S. are required to purchase primary insurance limits of $450 million for each operating site. In addition, the Price-Anderson Act requires an additional layer of protection through mandatory participation in a retrospective rating plan for power  reactors  resulting  in  an  additional  $13.2  billion  in  funds  available  for  public  liability  claims.  The  current  maximum",

        "page_content": "assessment per incident, per reactor, is approximately $138 million, taking into account a 5% adjustment for administrative fees,  payable  at  approximately  $21  million  per  reactor,  per  incident,  per  year.  NRG  would  be  responsible  for  44%  of  the maximum assessment, or $9 million per reactor, per incident, per year, and a maximum of $61 million per incident, per reactor. In  addition,  the  U.S.  Congress  retains  the  ability  to  impose  additional  financial  requirements  on  the  nuclear  industry  to  pay liability  claims  that  exceed  $13.7  billion  for  a  single  incident.  The  liabilities  of  the  co-owners  of  STP  with  respect  to  the retrospective premium assessments for nuclear liability insurance are joint and several.\n\nSTP purchases insurance for property damage and site decontamination cleanup costs from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, or NEIL, and European Mutual Association for Nuclear Insurance, or EMANI, both of which are industry mutual insurance companies, of which STP is a member. STP has purchased $2.8 billion in limits for nuclear events and $1.0 billion in limits for non-nuclear events. The nuclear event limit remains the maximum available from NEIL. The upper $1.3 billion in nuclear events limits (excess of the first $1.5 billion in nuclear events limits) is a single limit blanket policy shared with two Diablo Canyon nuclear reactors, which have no affiliation with the Company. This shared limit is not subject to automatic reinstatement in the event of a loss. The NEIL primary policy covers both nuclear and non-nuclear property damage events, and a NEIL companion policy provides Accidental Outage coverage for the co-owners of STP's lost revenue following a property damage event, at a weekly indemnity limit of $3 million per unit up to a maximum of $274 million nuclear per unit and $183 million non-nuclear per unit, and is subject to an eight-week waiting period. NRG also purchases an Accidental Outage policy from NEIL, which provides protection for lost revenue due to an insurable event. This coverage allows for reimbursement up to $2 million per week per unit up to a maximum of $216 million nuclear and $144 million non-nuclear, and is subject to an eightweek waiting period. Accidental Outage coverage amounts decrease in the event more than one unit at a station is out of service due to a common accident. Under the terms of the NEIL and EMANI policies, member companies may be assessed up to ten and six times their annual premiums, respectively, if the NEIL or EMANI Board of Directors determines their surplus has been depleted due to the payment of property losses at any of the licensed reactors in a single policy year. NEIL and EMANI require that their members maintain an investment grade credit rating or ensure their annual retrospective obligation by providing a financial  guarantee,  letter  of  credit,  deposit  premium,  or  an  insurance  policy.  NRG  has  purchased  an  insurance  policy  from NEIL and EMANI to guarantee the Company's obligation; however note the NEIL aspect of this insurance will only respond to retrospective  premium  adjustments  assessed  within  twenty-four  months  after  the  policy  term,  whereas  NEIL's  Board  of Directors can make such an adjustment up to 6 years after the policy expires. All insurance coverage is subject to various sub limits and significant deductibles.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nThe Company's material legal proceedings are described below. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to these legal proceedings and intends to defend them vigorously. NRG records accruals for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. As  applicable,  the  Company  has  established  an  adequate  accrual  for  the  applicable  legal  matters,  including  regulatory  and environmental matters as further discussed in Note 24, Regulatory Matters , and Note 25, Environmental Matters . In addition, legal costs are expensed as incurred. Management has assessed each of the following matters based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, considering the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought, and the probability of success. Unless specified below, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings  or  reasonably  estimate  the  scope  or  amount  of  any  associated  costs  and  potential  liabilities.  As  additional information becomes available, management adjusts its assessment and estimates of such contingencies accordingly. Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the Company's liabilities and contingencies could be at amounts that are different from its currently recorded accruals and that such difference could be material.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  legal  proceedings  noted  below,  NRG  and  its  subsidiaries  are  party  to  other  litigation  or  legal proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  In  management's  opinion,  the  disposition  of  these  ordinary  course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n## Environmental Lawsuits\n\nSierra club et al. v. Midwest Generation LLC - In 2012, several environmental groups filed a complaint against Midwest Generation  with  the  Illinois  Pollution  Control  Board  (\"IPCB\")  alleging  violations  of  environmental  law  resulting  in groundwater  contamination.  In  June  2019,  the  IPCB  found  in  an  interim  order  that  Midwest  Generation  violated  the  law because it had improperly handled coal ash at four facilities in Illinois and caused or allowed coal ash constituents to impact groundwater.  On  September  9,  2019,  Midwest  Generation  filed  a  Motion  to  Reconsider  numerous  issues,  which  the  court granted  in  part  and  denied  in  part  on  February  6,  2020.  The  IPCB  will  hold  hearings  to  determine  the  appropriate  relief. Midwest Generation has been working with the Illinois EPA to address the groundwater issues since 2010.",

The underlying claims of each case are similar and the  Company  continues  to  deny  the  allegations  and  is  vigorously  defending  these  matters.  These  matters  were  known  and accrued for at the time of each acquisition.\n\n## XOOM Energy\n\nXOOM Energy is a defendant  in  a  putative  class  action  lawsuit  pending  in  New  York.  This  case  is  in  the  summary judgment phase.\n\n## Direct Energy\n\nThere are four putative class actions pending against Direct Energy: (1) Linda Stanley v. Direct Energy (S.D.N.Y Apr. 2019) - The parties mediated in June 2021 and agreed on a settlement. In April 2022, the Court granted final approval of the settlement, which was primarily paid during the second quarter of 2022. This matter is complete and final; (2) Martin Forte v. Direct Energy (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 2017) - In December 2017, the Court granted Direct Energy's Motion for summary judgment effectively ending the matter at the district court level. Forte appealed. Direct Energy participated in oral argument on January 12,  2023.  The  Second Circuit Court of Appeals recently issued an opinion in Direct Energy's favor; (3) Richard Schafer v. Direct Energy (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 2019; on appeal 2nd Cir. N.Y.) - The Second Circuit sent the matter back to the trial court in December 2021. After discovery, Direct Energy filed summary judgement. Direct Energy won summary judgment and Schafer appealed. The parties are now briefing the appeal. Given the result in the Forte case, the trial court's summary judgment will be upheld and Direct Energy is expected to prevail; and (4) Andrew Gant v. Direct Energy and NRG (D.N.J. Aug. 2022) - Direct Energy and NRG filed a Motion to Dismiss on October 18, 2022.\n\nTelephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\") Cases - In the cases set forth below, referred to as the TCPA Cases, such actions involve consumers alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, as amended, by receiving calls,  texts  or  voicemails  without  consent  in  violation  of  the  federal  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule,  and/or  state  counterpart legislation.  The  underlying  claims  of  each  case  are  similar.  The  Company  denies  the  allegations  asserted  by  plaintiffs  and intends to vigorously defend these matters. These matters were known and accrued for at the time of the acquisition.\n\nThere are two putative class actions pending against Direct Energy: (1) Holly Newman v. Direct Energy, LP (D. Md Sept 2021) - Direct Energy filed its Motion to Dismiss asserting the ruling in the Brittany Burk v. Direct Energy (S.D. Tex. Feb 2019) preempts the Plaintiff's ability to file suit based on the same facts. The Court denied Direct Energy's motion stating the Court does not have the benefit of all of the facts that were in front of the Burk court to issue a similar ruling. On October 19, 2022, Direct Energy filed a Motion to Transfer Venue asking the Court to transfer the case to the Southern District where the Burk case was filed. Direct Energy will await the court's ruling before moving forward with written discovery; and (2) Matthew Dickson v. Direct Energy (N.D. Ohio Jan. 2018) - The case was stayed pending the outcome of an appeal to the Sixth Circuit based on the unconstitutionality of the TCPA during the period from 2015-2020. The Sixth Circuit found the TCPA was in effect  during  that  period  and  remanded  the  case  back  to  the  trial  court.  Direct  Energy  refiled  its  motions  along  with supplements.  On  March  25,  2022,  the  Court  granted  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  Direct  Energy  and  dismissed  the  case. Dickson appealed. The Court held oral arguments on January 17, 2023. Direct Energy anticipates a ruling within the next six months.\n\n## Winter Storm Uri Lawsuits\n\nThe Company has been named in certain property damage and wrongful death claims that have been filed in connection with  Winter  Storm  Uri  in  its  capacity  as  a  generator  and  a  REP.  Most  of  the  lawsuits  related  to  Winter  Storm  Uri  are consolidated into a single multi-district litigation matter in Harris County District Court. NRG's REPs have since been severed from the multi-district litigation and will be seeking dismissal in any remaining cases. As a power generator, the Company is named in various cases with claims ranging from: wrongful death; personal injury only; property damage and personal injury; property  damage  only;  and  subrogation.  The  case  is  currently  stayed  pending  appeal  by  other  parties  on  other  issues.  The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters.",

        "page_content": "## Indemnifications and Other Contractual Arrangements\n\nWashington-St. Tammany and Claiborne Electric Cooperative v. LaGen On June 28, 2017, plaintiffs Washington-St. Tammany Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Claiborne Electric Cooperative, Inc. filed a lawsuit against LaGen in the United States District  Court  for  the  Middle  District  of  Louisiana.  The  plaintiffs  claimed  breach  of  contract  against  LaGen  for  allegedly improperly charging the plaintiffs for costs related to the installation and maintenance of certain pollution control technology. Plaintiffs  sought  damages  for  the  alleged  improper  charges  and  a  declaration  as  to  which  charges  were  proper  under  the contract. In February 2020, the federal court dismissed this lawsuit without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On March  17,  2020,  plaintiffs  filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  Nineteenth  Judicial  District  Court  for  the  Parish  of  East  Baton  Rouge  in Louisiana alleging substantially the same matters. On February 4, 2019, NRG sold the South Central Portfolio, including the entities subject to this litigation. However, NRG has agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain losses suffered in connection therewith.\n\n## Note 24 Regulatory Matters\n\nNRG operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to regulation by various federal, state and provincial agencies. As such, NRG is affected by regulatory developments at the federal, state and provincial levels and in the regions in which NRG operates. In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which NRG participates. These power markets are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory changes that may impact NRG's wholesale and retail operations.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory proceeding noted below, NRG and its subsidiaries are parties to other regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or have other regulatory exposure. In management's opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nCalifornia  Station  Power  As  the  result  of  unfavorable  final  and  non-appealable  litigation,  the  Company  accrued  a liability associated with consumption of station power at the Company's Encina power plant facility in California after August 30, 2010. The Company has established an appropriate accrual pending potential regulatory action by San Diego Gas & Electric regarding the Company's Encina facility.\n\n## Note 25 Environmental Matters\n\nNRG is subject  to  a  wide  range  of  environmental  laws  in  the  development,  construction,  ownership  and  operation  of power  plants.  These  laws  generally  require  that  governmental  permits  and  approvals  be  obtained  before  construction  and maintained  during  operation  of  power  plants.  The  electric  generation  industry  has  been  facing  increasingly  stringent requirements  regarding  air  quality,  GHG  emissions,  combustion  byproducts,  water  discharge  and  use,  and  threatened  and endangered species. In general, future laws are expected to require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or to impose additional restrictions on the operations of the Company's facilities, which could have a material effect on the  Company's  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  or  cash  flows.  The  Company  has  elected  to  use  a $1 million disclosure threshold, as permitted, for environmental proceedings to which the government is a party.\n\n## Air\n\nCPP/ACE Rules - On July 8, 2019, the EPA promulgated the ACE rule, which rescinded the CPP, which had sought to broadly regulate CO 2 emissions  from the power sector. The ACE rule required states that have coal-fired EGUs to develop plans to seek heat rate improvements from coal-fired EGUs. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule (but on February 22, 2021, at the EPA's request, stayed the issuance of the portion of the mandate that would vacate the repeal of the CPP). On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the \"generation shifting\" approach in the CPP exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress. The Court did not address the related issues of whether the EPA may adopt only measures applied at each source. The Company anticipates that there will be additional proceedings at the D.C. Circuit and additional rulemaking by the EPA over the next several years.\n\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule (\"CSAPR\") - In April 2022, the EPA proposed revising the CSAPR to address the goodneighbor provisions of the 2015 ozone NAAQS. If the rule were finalized as proposed, it would apply to 25 states (including Texas) beginning in 2023. In 2023, the revised Group 3 trading program (previously established in the Revised CSAPR Update Rule) would have emission budgets based on NO x emission rates that the EPA says are achievable by existing controls at power plants.  Starting  in  2026,  the  NO x budgets  would  be  reduced  significantly  based  on  levels  achievable  if  SCR  controls  were installed at coal-fueled power plants that do not currently have such controls. Starting in 2025, the budgets would be updated annually to account for retirements, changes to operations and new units. The proposal also contemplates heightened surrender requirements  for  units  that  exceed  certain  NO x emission  rate  thresholds.  The  Company  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  this proposed  revision  and  anticipates  that  this  rulemaking  will  be  subject  to  legal  challenges  after  it  is  finalized.  The  EPA anticipates finalizing the revised rule in Spring 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Water\n\nEffluent Limitations Guidelines - In November 2015, the EPA revised the ELG for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from FGD, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control. On September 18, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that, among other things, postponed the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA amended the rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA amended the 2015 ELG rule by: (i) altering the stringency of certain limits for FGD wastewater; (ii) relaxing the zero-discharge requirement for bottom ash transport water; and (iii) changing several deadlines. On July 26, 2021, the EPA announced that it is initiating a new rulemaking to evaluate revising the ELG rule. While the EPA is developing the new rule, the existing rule (as amended in 2020) will stay in place, and the EPA expects permitting authorities to continue to implement the current regulation. The Company anticipates that the EPA will release a proposed rule in the first half of 2023. In October 2021, NRG informed its regulators that the Company intends to comply  with  the  ELG  by  ceasing  combustion  of  coal  by  the  end  of  2028  at  its  domestic  coal  units  outside  of  Texas,  and installing appropriate controls by the end of 2025 at its two plants that have coal-fired units in Texas.\n\n## Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination\n\nIn April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. On July 30, 2018, the EPA promulgated a rule that amended the ash rule by extending some of the deadlines and providing more flexibility for compliance. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit found, among other things, that the EPA had  not  adequately  regulated  unlined  ponds  and  legacy  surface  impoundments.  On  August  28,  2020,  the  EPA  finalized  \"A Holistic Approach to Close Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure,\" which amended the April 2015 Rule to address the August 2018 D.C. Circuit decision and extend some of the deadlines. On November 12, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to  Closure  Part  B,\"  which  further  amended  the  April  2015  Rule  to,  among  other  things,  provide  procedures  for  requesting approval to operate existing impoundments with an alternative liner. NRG anticipates further rulemaking related to the Federal Permit Program and legacy surface impoundments.\n\n## Note 26 Cash Flow Information\n\nDetail of supplemental disclosures of cash flow and non-cash investing and financing information was:\n\n|                                                                                                              | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                | 2022                      | 2021                      | 2020                      |\n| Interest paid, net of amount capitalized   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | $  383                    | $  433                    | $  340                    |\n| Income taxes paid, net of refunds    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 66                        | 32                        | 24                        |\n| Non-cash investing activities:                                                                               |                           |                           |                           |\n| Decreases to fixed assets for accrued capital expenditures                                                   | (68)                      | (16)                      | (6)                       |\n\n## Note 27 Guarantees\n\nNRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine part of the Company's business activities. Examples of these contracts include asset purchases and sale agreements, commodity sale  and  purchase  agreements,  retail  contracts,  joint  venture  agreements,  EPC  agreements,  operation  and  maintenance agreements, service agreements, settlement agreements, and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties, as well as affiliates. These contracts generally indemnify the counterparty for tax, environmental liability, litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties and covenants set forth in these agreements. The Company is obligated with respect to customer deposits associated with the Company's retail operations. In some cases, NRG's maximum potential liability cannot be estimated, since the underlying agreements contain no limits on potential liability.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  maximum  potential  exposures  that  can  be  estimated  for  NRG's  guarantees, indemnities, and other contingent liabilities by maturity:\n\n| (In millions)                                                     | By Remaining Maturity at December 31, 2022   | By Remaining Maturity at December 31, 2022   | By Remaining Maturity at December 31, 2022   | By Remaining Maturity at December 31, 2022   | By Remaining Maturity at December 31, 2022   | By Remaining Maturity at December 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Guarantees                                                        | Under 1 Year                                 | 1-3 Years                                    | 3-5 Years                                    | Over 5 Years                                 | Total                                        | 2021 Total                                   |\n| Letters of credit and surety bonds                                | $  5,211                                     | $  -                                         | $  -                                         | $  -                                         | $  5,211                                     | $  4,095                                     |\n| Asset sales guarantee obligations    . . . . . . . . . .          | 270                                          | 25                                           | 34                                           | 80                                           | 409                                          | 414                                          |\n| Other guarantees   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | -                                            | -                                            | -                                            | 15                                           | 15                                           | 93                                           |\n| Total guarantees  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  5,481                                     | $  25                                        | $  34                                        | $  95                                        | $  5,635                                     | $  4,602                                     |",

        "page_content": "Letters of credit and surety bonds - As of  December 31, 2022, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently obligated for a total of $5.2 billion under letters of credit and surety bonds. Most of these letters of credit and surety bonds are issued in support of the Company's obligations to perform under commodity agreements and obligations associated with future closure and maintenance of ash sites, as well as for financing or other arrangements. A majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds expire within one year of issuance, and it is typical for the Company to renew them on similar terms.\n\nThe material indemnities, within the scope of ASC 460, are as follows:\n\nAsset  sales -  The  purchase  and  sale  agreements  which  govern  NRG's  asset  or  share  investments  and  divestitures customarily contain guarantees and indemnifications of the transaction to third parties. The contracts indemnify the parties for liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty by the indemnifying party, changes in tax laws or for pre-existing  environmental  matters.  These  obligations  generally  have  a  discrete  term  and  are  intended  to  protect  the  parties against  risks  that  are  difficult  to  predict  or  estimate  at  the  time  of  the  transaction.  In  several  cases,  the  contract  limits  the liability of the indemnifier. NRG has no reason to believe that the Company currently has any material liability relating to such routine indemnification obligations included in the table above, except for the California property tax indemnity for estimated increases in California property taxes of certain solar properties that the Company agreed to indemnify NRG Yield for, as part of the agreement to sell NRG Yield and the Renewables Platform. The California property tax indemnity is estimated to be $141 million as of December 31, 2022 and is included in the above table under asset sales guarantee obligations.\n\nOther guarantees - NRG has issued other guarantees of obligations including payments under certain agreements with respect to certain of its unconsolidated subsidiaries, payment or performance by fuel providers and payment or reimbursement of credit support and deposits. The Company does not believe that it will be required to perform under these guarantees.\n\nOther  indemnities -  Other  indemnifications  NRG  has  provided  cover  operational,  tax,  litigation  and  breaches  of representations, warranties and covenants. NRG has also indemnified, on a routine basis in the ordinary course of business, consultants or other vendors who have provided services to the Company. NRG's maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications  can  range  from  a  specified  dollar  amount  to  an  indeterminate  amount,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the transaction. Total maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications is not estimable due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved. NRG does not have any reason to believe that the Company will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.\n\nBecause many of the guarantees and indemnities NRG issues to third parties and affiliates do not limit the amount or duration of its obligations to perform under them, there exists a risk that the Company may have obligations in excess of the amounts described above. For those guarantees and indemnities that do not limit the Company's liability exposure, it may not be able to estimate what the Company's liability would be, until a claim is made for payment or performance, due to the contingent nature of these contracts.\n\n## Note 28 Jointly Owned Plants\n\nCertain  NRG  subsidiaries  own  undivided  interests  in  jointly-owned  plants,  as  described  below.  These  plants  are maintained and operated pursuant to their joint ownership participation and operating agreements. NRG is responsible for its subsidiaries'  share  of  operating  costs  and  direct  expenses  and  includes  its  proportionate  share  of  the  facilities  and  related revenues and direct expenses in these jointly-owned plants in the corresponding balance sheet and income statement captions of the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  NRG's  proportionate  ownership  interest  in  the  Company's  jointly-owned  facilities:\n\n## (In millions unless otherwise stated)\n\n| As of December 31, 2022                                        | Ownership Interest   |   Property, Plant & Equipment | Accumulated Depreciation   |   Construction in Progress |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| South Texas Project Units 1 and 2, Bay City, TX                | 44.00 % $            |                           478 | $  (235)  $                |                          7 |\n| Cedar Bayou Unit 4, Baytown, TX    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 50.00 %              |                           229 | (118)                      |                          7 |",
