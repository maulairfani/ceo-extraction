We have delivered strong growth and earnings in a volatile market environment by leveraging the strength of our well-diversified portfolio, unique production capabilities and broad market presence. We are delivering on our strategy 'Unlocking growth powered by biotech', and we are confident that we will achieve our long-term ambition of doubling our sales by 2030. We expect to unlock additional growth opportunities and accelerate our strategic ambition by the proposed combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen to create a leading global biosolutions partner. Together, we will be able to continue the momentum of the two companies and further leverage growth synergies from cross-selling and strong innovation capabilities.\n\nWe are very excited about the potential of this combination. By bringing together these two high performing, complementary companies with a shared purpose and advanced capabilities, we can unleash the full potential of biosolutions and generate significant value for our customers, employees, shareholders and society at large.\n\n## 2022 performance\n\nIn 2022, our organic sales growth came in at 9%, and our reported EBIT margin was at a solid 26.0%, and 26.4% before special items, which are costs related to the proposed combination with Chr. Hansen. Our free cash flow before acquisitions was DKK 1.1 billion, and we are executing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy highlights\n\ndiligently on our strategy to provide long-term shareholder value.\n\nWe delivered double-digit growth across three out of five business areas. Bioenergy saw strong growth across regions and solutions, driven by our innovative and impactful portfolio in a favorable market environment. We delivered a broad-based growth in Food, Beverages & Human Health, led by innovation, consumers focusing on healthy choices, and an environment focused on optimization. Our strong performance in Grain & Tech Processing was driven by innovation and favorable market conditions. Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition saw a solid performance, and Household Care was in line with expectations.\n\nOur consistent growth in 2022 shows that our strategy is more relevant than ever. It is rooted in our ability to use the power of biotech to address some of the world's biggest challenges, while unlocking sustainable growth for our customers, our investors, societies and our company.\n\nDuring the year, we grew our core business and expanded into areas where we see a strong growth potential. We applied the value of our technologies across multiple application areas, especially in emerging markets where we delivered 9% organic growth. Our biosolutions were in demand as they enabled our customers to improve profitability while reducing their impact on the environment, and to deliver products that meet the growing consumer demand for healthier foods and beverages.\n\nWe are very excited about the potential of the Novozymes-Chr. Hansen combination. By bringing together these two high performing, complementary companies with a shared purpose and advanced capabilities, we can unleash the full potential of biosolutions and generate significant value for our customers, employees, shareholders and society at large.\n\nWe launched 26 biosolutions to meet customer needs, including our Innova\u00ae yeasts, which enable bioenergy customers to make their production processes more efficient and to maximize ethanol yields, and our Frontia\u00ae solution, which enables corn starch and sweetener manufacturers to increase yields, save energy and cut CO2 emissions. We supported our household care customers in meeting consumer needs by expanding our freshness platform and launching new biosolutions, including our Carezyme\u00ae solutions which extend the lifetime of clothes and help reduce textile waste. Through the DSM-Novozymes Alliance, we launched HiPhorius\u2122 to help poultry producers achieve a more sustainable and profitable protein production.\n\nUsing our biotech capabilities, we accelerated growth in BioHealth and Human Nutrition. We realized synergies by cross-selling and combining capabilities between our recent acquisitions and",

We launched biosolutions that help consumers address digestive and oral health concerns, including BioFresh\u2122 Clean, a unique enzymatic combination that enables consumers to clean and protect teeth, and maintain a healthy oral microbiome.\n\nDuring the year, we also strengthened our commercial leadership and capabilities to become an even stronger partner for our customers. We invested in new competences and equipment to co-create with our customers in the food and health space, and we have strengthened our investment in consumer and market insights to increasingly align our innovation agenda with unmet consumer needs. Due to overall input cost increases, our commercial organization also engaged with customers on pricing to ensure that we capture a fair share of value from our biosolutions. We saw a visible impact from our pricing discussions and expect this to accelerate into 2023.\n\nOur results in 2022 were made possible thanks to our employees who have shown commitment and adaptability during times of change. The Board of Directors and the Executive Leadership Team are proud of and thankful for our Zymers and their contribution to Novozymes' strategy and purpose.\n\n## Biotech for a healthier planet\n\nWe saw a strong pull towards sustainability in 2022. Our customers looked for ways to increase\n\ncrop yields while protecting the environment, produce more efficiently, use raw materials better and reduce carbon emissions. They were also keen on improving the performance of their products to meet consumer needs for healthier and more nutritious foods and beverages.\n\nWe were able to meet all these needs with our biosolutions. In the transport sector alone, we helped save 65 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2022 by enabling the production of low-carbon fuels - that is the equivalent of taking 27 million cars off the road. Going forward, the number of passenger cars will continue to increase, and while electric cars are gaining more momentum, low-carbon fuels will play an important role in decarbonizing transportation, including in the marine and aviation sectors.\n\nOur biosolutions also play a role in transforming food systems to ensure nutritious foods and beverages for a growing population. For example, we enable the production of tastier plant-based foods at affordable prices, including proteins produced by fermentation, which can reduce carbon emissions by up to 90% compared to animal protein.\n\nThe potential is significant, and now is the time to shift from a paradigm that relies on fossil energy sources to a greener and more resilient paradigm. Novozymes is working hard to catalyze this change. Guided by our purpose 'Together we find biological answers for better lives in a growing world - Let's rethink tomorrow' we work with our\n\ncustomers, consumers, governments, academia and many others to enable a healthier planet. We are committed to accelerating a climate-neutral society, transforming food systems and enabling healthier lives, and more than 90% of our revenue in 2022 came from biosolutions that contributed to one or more of these three commitments. Going forward, we will continue to expand the reach of our biosolutions and maximize the percentage of our sales that enables a better world.\n\n## Making a difference, together\n\nSustainability is in our DNA, and Novozymes succeeds by combining our financial and nonfinancial performance. In 2022, we concluded our nonfinancial milestone targets and have set new targets for 2025 for our operations, employees and society.\n\nDuring the year, we continued to develop our organization, nourish our culture, and ensure a thriving, diverse and inclusive community. We are very proud to have employees who are engaged, believe that Novozymes has a great culture, and who are excited about our company's future. As a result, we achieved a score of 83 on our Zymer Spirit Index, which was +2 above our target and among the 10% highest scoring companies in an external market benchmark.\n\nWe also continued to nurture a diverse and inclusive organization and achieved a score of 86 on our Nuture Diversity Index, which was in alignment with our target. Our senior management\n\nconsisted of 33% women and 67% men, and we are on track to achieve gender balance by 2030. Guided by our new nonfinancial targets, we will continue to promote a workplace where employees can stay safe, thrive, grow, and contribute their worktime to community outreach activities.\n\nAs a global leader, we are committed to help building a net-zero future. In 2022, we reduced the CO2 emissions from our operations by 63%, from a 2018 baseline, and we sourced 82% of our electricity from renewable sources. Additionally, we have taken bold steps to reduce carbon emissions from our entire supply chain with the aim of reaching net-zero by 2050. We are proud to be among the first companies in the world to have our net-zero target across scopes 1, 2 and 3 validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.\n\nBeyond our own walls, we engage with many stakeholders to demonstrate how biosolutions can accelerate a green transition, create sustainable growth and generate low-carbon jobs. In 2022, we participated in the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting, the U.N. General Assembly and COP27 to advocate for biosolutions as a means of limiting the global temperature increase and supporting a just and equitable transition to a green economy. We will keep up this important work in 2023, including by continuing to collaborate with The B Team, The World Economic Forum, the U.N. Global Compact, International Chamber of Commerce, the U.N. Foundation and many others.",

They help farmers produce more crops per acre, improve the nutrition and health of livestock and enable food and ingredient producers to make better use of raw materials. They also help consumers to reduce food waste, get access to nutritious products with added benefits and enjoy tastier plantbased foods and beverages.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Higher yields from the same crops\n\nTo transform global food systems, it is important to look at the way we grow food for people and animals. In 2022, climate change and severe weather once again impacted crops and agricultural supply chains.\n\nBiosolutions can help make crops more resilient to climate change, increase crop yields, reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers and lower CO2 emissions. If our biosolutions were applied to all of U.S. cornfields and all of U.S. chicken production, they would save carbon emissions equivalent to taking 18 million U.S. cars off the road. To add context, there are currently 16.5 million electric cars on the roads globally.\n\n## Making better use of raw materials\n\nIn 2022, the world experienced shortages of raw materials, spurred on by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts. By July on Earth Overshoot Day, we had used all the resources that the planet generates during an entire year. With biosolutions, we can make better use of the raw materials available, for example by gaining more starch and protein from corn and getting more vegetable oil from the same volume of feedstocks.\n\n## Reducing food waste\n\nIt is important to tackle food waste in order save scarce resources, reduce carbon emissions and tackle hunger. One approach to reducing food waste is by extending the shelf-life of baked goods. Our biosolutions help retain the freshness\n\nof baked goods such as breads, flatbreads, tortilla wraps, and cakes for longer periods of time. For example, our fresh-keeping solutions for bread have saved approximately 80 billion loaves of bread from being thrown away. If stacked up, those loaves would reach to the moon and back ten times.\n\n## Plant-based products\n\nTo feed a growing population, the world also needs to look at different sources of protein. In fact, if 10% of protein demand was replaced with alternative proteins, it would bring enough grain savings to free up 50% of arable land in Europe.\n\nConsumers are increasingly turning to plant-based foods, but the taste, mouthfeel and price must be right to make these products go mainstream. Our biosolutions help improve the taste and texture of plant-based foods and beverages, for example by giving plant-based drinks the smooth feel that consumers want.\n\nProteins produced by fermentation can also enhance the taste, texture, and nutritional profile of plant-based meats, and they have the potential to reduce carbon emissions by up to 90% compared to animal protein. Novozymes is investing heavily in an advanced protein production facility to meet the growing demand for plant-based protein.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Applying a venture mindset, we worked on maturing a number of these long-term growth areas, such as fertilizer replacement and solutions for biocontrol, carbon capture and biological plastic recycling.\n\nWe are working to develop biological fertilizer alternatives in agriculture, including solutions for both nitrogen and phosphate. Our first phosphate replacement product was launched in 2022 together with Anuvia Plant Nutrients, and we are working on several solutions for the coming years. We are also working with partners to develop biosolutions that can protect crops, such as corn and soy, against fungal diseases. In addition, we are exploring the development of biosolutions to combat post-harvest waste.\n\nDuring the year, we matured our collaboration with Saipem in enzymatic carbon capture, which is a cleaner and more cost-effective method of carbon capture compared to traditional processes. Saipem's demo plant in Canada has proven the capabilities of the technology and potential of enzyme-based carbon capture.\n\nWe also advanced our collaboration with Carbios on biological recycling of PET plastic to address the challenge of plastic pollution. We have delivered commercial enzymes to Carbios' demonstration unit, which met performance expectations. Going forward, we will continue our partnership to further develop, optimize, and produce enzymes for the world's first biological PET-recycling plant that Carbios intends to build in France. The plant is to be operational in 2025 and will be able to process 50,000 tonnes of waste per year.",

The full year growth is expected to be driven by a combination of stronger pricing relative to 2022 as well as volume growth. Positive pricing across business areas is expected to contribute more than half of the total organic sales growth, whereas innovation and increased market penetration will be the main components of the volume growth. The outlook assumes no major changes to the current state of the global economic situation. Overall, modest growth is expected in the beginning of the year as the comparator from last year in Food, Beverages & Human Health was impacted by strong sales across subareas, and there was a positive timing impact from a large sales order. Additionally, the Q1 comparator in 2022 for Household Care include sales to Russia and Ukraine. Sales in reported DKK including currencies are forecasted to be roughly 2 percentage points lower than the expected organic sales growth range for 2023.\n\n## Business areas\n\nHousehold Care (organic 1% in 12M 2022) organic sales growth is expected to be driven by a combination of pricing and increased penetration in emerging markets. As commodity prices continue to fluctuate and consumers' buying habits adapt to the rising inflation, an expectation of volume contraction in North America and Europe is included, particularly for the first half of the year. Emerging markets are expected to continue to grow, while the market penetration with Freshness solutions will continue. The full-year indication for organic sales in Household Care is to grow in the low single digits.\n\nFood, Beverages & Human Health (organic 10% in 12M 2022) organic sales growth is expected across all subareas, driven by Food and Human Health. Solutions focused on health and increased quality as well as clean label will continue to be the main drivers while market conditions favoring industrial bread consumptions, demand for locally sourced products and raw material optimization are expected to support growth. Human Health is estimated to grow\n\norganically in the solid double digits, driven by innovation, cross-selling and segment expansion, supported by the acquisitions of Synergia, Microbiome Labs and PrecisionsBiotics Group. Pricing will be a strong component of growth across all subareas. Organic sales are indicated to grow in the high single digits.\n\nBioenergy (organic 25% in 12M 2022) organic sales growth is expected to be driven by pricing, market penetration enabled by innovation, capacity expansion of corn-based ethanol production in Latin America, and market penetration with enzymatic solutions for biodiesel production. Organic growth will also be supported to a degree by growing sales of solutions for 2G ethanol production. Bioenergy is indicated to grow by a mid-tohigh single digit rate. The mid-point of the range assumes flat to slightly declining performance in U.S. ethanol production.\n\nGrain & Tech Processing (organic 10% in 12M 2022) organic sales growth is expected to be driven by pricing and growth in Grain led by market penetration in vegetable oil processing and innovation in starch. Tech is expected to decline, driven by reduced sales of enzymes for COVID-19 test kits and a soft textile market. The sales development in Grain & Tech Processing is indicated to grow by a low-to-mid-single digit rate.\n\n## Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition\n\n(organic 8% in 12M 2022) organic sales growth is expected to be broad-based with solid growth in both Agriculture and Animal Health & Nutrition. Pricing will be a solid component of growth, and innovation and a more diversified commercial model are enablers for increased market penetration of sustainable BioAg solutions. Growth in Animal Health & Nutrition will primarily be driven by pricing, innovation and end-market growth. The indication for Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition is for growth at a rate in the mid-to-high single digits.",

Compared to 2022, the EBIT margin will benefit from price increases, sales growth and productivity improvements.

The gross margin is expected to be at a similar level as in 2022, as the positive impact from price increases and productivity improvements are expected to be offset by higher input costs.\n\n|                                     |       | 2023 outlook***   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------|-------------------|\n| Sales performance, organic          | %     | 4-7               |\n| EBIT margin before special  items*  | %     | 25-26             |\n| ROIC** before special items*        | %     | 16-17             |\n| For modeling purposes:              |       |                   |\n| Special items*                      | DKKbn | 0.3-0.7           |\n| Net financial costs                 | DKKm  | ~250              |\n| Effective tax rate                  | %     | ~23               |\n| Free cash flow before  acquisitions | DKKbn | 1.8-2.4           |\n| Net investments                     | DKKbn | 2.1-2.4           |\n\nIn 2023, we will continue working towards our long-term commitments to a healthy planet by investing in the development of biosolutions that improve our climate, water and waste footprints, transform food systems and enable healthier\n\nlives.

Through the past six years, J\u00f8rgen has served as the Chair of the Novozymes' Board of Directors.

The Board is highly appreciative of J\u00f8rgen's instrumental role in the process leading up to the proposed combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen.\n\nAdditionally, the Board also wishes to express its gratitude for J\u00f8rgen's strong\n\ncommitment to sustainability and his long-standing impact on Novozymes.\n\nThe Board proposes the election of Cornelis (Cees) de Jong as the new Chair of the Board.

Novozymes follows 39 of the 40 recommendations, the one exception being:\n\n- \u00b7 Due to the limitations imposed by the Novo Nordisk Foundation's Articles of Association and Novozymes' ownership structure, the Board of Directors reserves the right in certain circumstances to reject takeover bids without consulting the shareholders. (Recommendation 1.3.1).\n\nIn addition, under the Danish Financial Statements Act (sections 99a), it is mandatory for large companies to report on corporate social responsibility. The Notes on Environmental data and Social and governance in this report meet the requirements of section 99a in the Danish Finan-\n\ncial Statements Act. The mandatory reporting is placed in the Notes as the content is provided with reasonable assurance by our auditors.\n\nNovozymes has a data ethics policy, which sets out the overall principles for the ethical management of data by Novozymes and supplements our commitment to integrity and compliance.

        "page_content": "Each year, one of the responsibilities of the Board of Directors is to assess whether the capital and share structure of Novozymes is optimal. In 2022, the Board of Directors assessed that the share structure with A and B common stock continues to be the best way to safeguard Novozymes' longterm strategy and development for the benefit of the company's shareholders and other stakeholders. Regarding its capital structure, Novozymes will continue to favor a rather modestly leveraged balance sheet, as reflected by a target for net\n\ninterest-bearing debt of around 1x EBITDA. Thus, the capital structure is in line with the target.\n\nNovozymes is party to several partnership contracts that can be terminated by the other party in the event of significant changes to the ownership or control of Novozymes. A few of these contracts contain provisions that restrict Novozymes' licenses to use specific forms of technology in such situations.\n\n## Evaluation of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors conduct an annual evaluation, and every three years, the evaluation is conducted by an external third party, last time being in 2021. In 2022, the evaluation of the Board of Directors was conducted by the Chair who interviewed each member of the Board and the Executive Leadership Team. The evaluation revealed an overall good performance by the Board and good collaboration between the Board the Executive\n\nLeadership Team. The recommendations from the interviews included continuing the strong focus on BioHealth and Human Nutrition, maintaining a good balance between working in the board committees versus the full Board of Directors, and ensuring a continued interplay between sustainability, culture, business investments and prioritizations. In addition, the Board continued to focus on the results from the external evaluation from 2021.\n\n| Board member               | Audit Committee  member   | Nomination and Remuneration  Committee member   | Innovation   Committee member   | Board meetings  attended %   | Board tenure                         | End of  Board tenure              | Share trading  in 2022   | Number of shares  end of 2022   |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| J\u00f8rgen Buhl Rasmussen  1,2 |                           | (Chair)                                         |                                 | 100                          | 2011                                 | 2023                              | -                        | 5,500                           |\n| Cees de Jong  1,2          |                           |                                                 |                                 | 100                          | 2020                                 | 2023                              | -                        | 2,000                           |\n| Heine Dalsgaard  1         | (Chair)                   |                                                 |                                 | 100                          | 2020                                 | 2023                              | -                        | 3,000                           |\n| Sharon James  1,2          |                           |                                                 | (Chair)                         | 100                          | 2020                                 | 2023                              | -                        | -                               |\n| Kasim Kutay  1             |                           |                                                 |                                 | 89                           | 2017                                 | 2023                              | -                        | 217                             |\n| Kim Stratton  1,2          |                           |                                                 |                                 | 100                          | 2017                                 | 2023                              | -                        | -                               |\n| Morten Sommer  1,2,5       |                           |                                                 |                                 | 83                           | 2022                                 | 2023                              | -                        | -                               |\n| Mathias Uhl\u00e9n  1,4         |                           |                                                 |                                 | /five.tlf/zero.tlf           | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/zero.tlf/seven.tlf | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/two.tlf | -                        | -                               |\n| Anders Hentze Knudsen  3   |                           |                                                 |                                 | 100                          | 2013                                 | 2025                              | -                        | -                               |\n| Anne Breum  3              |                           |                                                 |                                 | 93                           | 2021                                 | 2025                              | -                        | 319                             |\n| Preben Nielsen  3          |                           |                                                 |                                 | 100                          | 2021                                 | 2025                              | -                        | 426                             |\n| Jens \u00d8bro  3               |                           |                                                 |                                 | 100                          | 2021                                 | 2025                              | -                        | 557                             |\n\n1.

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nNovozymes operates in a global environment across many industries, which means that our business is exposed to different risks. We have a risk management framework in place to identify, assess, and mitigate business risks that may impact our ability to grow our business sustainability and be a reliable partner to our customers and the communities we operate in.\n\nIn addition to addressing key business risks, which could potentially materialize in the short term (within the next three years), we also identify long-term and strategic risks across categories such as sustainability and technology. We seek to have an integrated and holistic approach to assessing and prioritizing financial and nonfinancial risks on similar terms.\n\n## 2022 risk updates\n\nGeopolitical tensions intensified in 2022, spurred by the war in Ukraine. This led to increased volatility in energy and raw material costs and global supply chain disruptions. Novozymes is impacted by these factors, and we therefore include them into a combined business risk for 2023.\n\nClimate-related risks, such as extreme weather events, are important factors when we look at the\n\nrisks to our business. We address them in a structured way where they are identified, managed, and reported at different levels of our organization in the same manner as other business risks. In 2022, we focused on further integrating and developing climate change risk management in our risk management framework, in alignment with our commitment to TCFD (Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures). In 2023, we will continue to work on how to further strengthen the management of ESG risks to our business. Read more about our reporting to TCFD here.\n\n## Risk management process\n\nThe Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for overseeing risks and for maintaining a robust risk management and internal control system. Novozymes operates an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process in which key enterprise risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(financial and nonfinancial) are identified, assessed, reported on, and mitigated at different levels of the organization. Each key risk is assigned to a risk owner from the Executive Leadership Team and a Risk Responsible.\n\nThe Risk Management & Controls department is responsible for ensuring that senior management\n\npromotes risk awareness, engagement, and ownership across the organization. Risks are assessed based on a two-dimensional heat map rating system that estimates the potential impact of a given risk on financials and reputation, and the likelihood of that risk materializing. The most significant key risks are reviewed and assessed by the Executive Leadership Team and the Board of Directors.",

        "page_content": "## Key business risks for 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Volatility of agriculture-related business\n\n## Description of risk\n\nSeveral of our businesses may potentially be affected by agriculture-related events such as weather, volatile commodity prices or economic recession in one or more geographical regions, all of which can impact several sectors of the agricultural value chain.\n\nA substantial economic downturn could pressure commodity prices and lead to lower demand and margins in commodity-related business areas where we operate, such as in grain and oil processing and bioethanol production. For example, reduced economic activity in North America or Europe could lead to reduced demand for bioethanol production and starch processing. A significant upward pressure on commodity prices due to shortages could also impact our customers' ability to source and process commodities such as grains. This could put pressure on our sales of biosolutions.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nOur biosolutions are more relevant than ever at a time of increased and more volatile commodity prices. They enable producers to generate more yield from the same input, and therefore create more value for many of our customers across the agriculture value chain.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to work with grain, oil, and ethanol customers to maximize their yields and to diversify their businesses by enabling alternative value streams. In addition to making production processes more effective, our biosolutions can also help customers to produce more protein, oil and more fiber. We also continued to explore opportunities to use bioenergy feedstocks for other products, such as renewable fuels for heavy transport and as building blocks for renewable chemicals.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to leverage our expertise to help customers address agricultural challenges with biosolutions and to diversify their revenue streams. We will also work to continually optimize our internal commercial competences, including technical sales support and digital tools for process optimization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cyberattacks and information theft\n\n## Description of risk\n\nThe threat of cyberattacks is high due to increased digitalization and the lack of internet regulations and legislation.\n\nNovozymes' business is fully IT-supported, and our supply chain, logistics and production functions are highly digitalized. Cyberattacks could have a negative impact on our productivity if systems are not accessible for an extended period of time. In addition, new mergers and acquisitions could increase our vulnerability to cyberattacks.\n\nOur business could also be adversely impacted if information about our unique technologies or production strains is disclosed. It is extremely important that we ensure that our business continues to run, and that we safeguard sensitive business data and critical assets against this global threat.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIt is a key focus area for Novozymes to increase our ability to identify, protect, detect and respond to cyberattacks. In 2022, we tested and implemented several initiatives to strengthen our IT emergency response. We also increased our focus on measuring our actual security level and getting better transparency in infrastructure and system management.\n\nTo protect our business opportunities from the threat of global theft, we maintain a strong focus on patents and IP management, as exemplified by our more than 6,500 granted or pending patents. A dedicated cyber defense unit in Novozymes has greatly enhanced our ability to rapidly detect and respond to cyber and information security incidents. We will continue to expand our capabilities with new data sources and intelligence in 2023.\n\nWe will also retest our cyberattack resilience and measure our security level to gain actionable data. We will also improve our ability to access devices in our network to apply protection in selected areas and isolate zones in case of cyberattacks. As our business expands, we will increase our focus on mitigating IT risks across new business areas.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The war in Ukraine led to sanctions, which impacted trade conditions and imposed uncertainties to the global economy and financial markets.\n\nIn addition, the war has led to increased volatility in raw material and energy prices, as well as energy security issues in the EU - see next risk. These conditions combined could impact our business and make it difficult for Novozymes to optimize decisions beyond the short-term.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIn 2022, Novozymes closely monitored the political and economic developments with an agile mindset to ensure that fast action can be taken when needed. We also deployed global versus local scenarios and considerations in short- and long-term capacity planning, e.g. shifting production from one site to another.\n\nWe continue to champion the benefits of globalization and a shared commitment to sustainability on the global stage, such as at the U.N. General Assembly and COP27. We also collaborate with many valuable partners to drive a responsible business agenda, such as the World Economic Forum, the International Chamber of Commerce, The B Team, the U.N. Foundation and Business Fights Poverty.\n\nIn 2023, we will continue to closely follow political and economic developments and identify scenarios and potential preparatory actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Description of risk\n\nThe world faced challenging market conditions in 2022 following the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on global supply and logistics, and the impact from the war in Ukraine. These include high, volatile energy and raw material prices and supply chain disruptions.\n\nThese ongoing conditions could mean that prices remain volatile and at higher price levels than previously, exposing Novozymes to significant price fluctuations. This could imply a risk to our gross margin level, amongst others. In addition, continued geopolitical unrest and the European energy crisis could lead to supply disruptions for Novozymes.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIn 2022, we worked closely with customers on pricing actions based on price trends in the market to ensure that we capture a fair share of value from our biosolutions. Our biosolutions enable customers to get more from the same raw materials, which is a key benefit in today's environment.\n\nThroughout 2022, we also continued to monitor our production and supply, prepared potential substitution with alternative raw materials if needed, and reduced our dependency on critical and single-sourced raw materials. Our safety stocks ensure that we can continue to produce.\n\nIn 2022, we ensured that our production sites in Europe are independent of natural gas. We continue to focus on our decarbonization journey and purchased 82% renewable electricity in 2022. We have a target to purchase 100% renewable electricity by 2025, which was previously set to 2030.\n\nDuring times of change, predictability and agility are key to mitigate business risks. In 2023, we will continuously focus on mitigating price fluctuations and secure supply.",

Through our integrated sustainability trendspotting exercise, we identify long-term risks and opportunities, and the risks are jointly assessed through our Enterprise Risk Management process.\n\nWe engage with relevant stakeholders in a timely manner to develop strategies and ensure that we are prepared to take adequate action and respond to key long-term risks.\n\nBased on our 2022 risk assessment, the following continue to be some of the most significant longterm risks:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New and emerging technologies\n\n## Description of risk\n\nIndustrial biotech is a key enabling technology for the delivery of low-carbon and biobased solutions. Novozymes' research and business are based on innovation and delivering biosolutions that can tackle some of the biggest challenges of today and tomorrow.\n\nGoing forward, we expect to see the emergence of new technologies and innovative uses of current technologies, including gene editing, to find safe and innovative answers for carbon capture, sustainable food systems or replacing chemicals with biodegradable solutions.\n\nNew or rapidly changing technologies could pose a risk to Novozymes' technology base if we do not stay updated.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe continuously monitor and assess new technologies, and we apply and promote safe and responsible use of biotech. We are committed to continuously learn and share our knowledge about the potential of biotech and its safe use.\n\nThrough proactive engagement with influencers and policy makers, we broaden the understanding of biotech, paving the way for future solutions to pressing challenges. We advocate for science-based and innovation-friendly policy frameworks for the introduction of solutions based on new gene technologies.\n\nThrough our cooperation with the Novo Nordisk Foundation, we are exploring ways to provide new documentation and insights into biotech. We engage with the World Economic Forum's community and to promote biosolutions, and we drive the innovation agenda through business and industry organizations to ensure that we do our best when searching for better answers.\n\nWe will accelerate the actions above in the coming years in order to mitigate any potential impacts.\n\nLearn more in our position statement on Industrial Biotechnology.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, the effect of climate change on water access through extreme weather events is currently a top concern.\n\nOur technology is dependent on the availability of fresh water across our value chain as many of our raw materials are agricultural and water-intensive to produce. Increased long-term pressure on fresh water is a key risk driven by climate change. A severe drought, reduced water supply, poor water quality, or flooding all lead to water stress and limit our ability to meet customer demand by directly impacting our own operations or our supply chain.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe continue addressing this long-term risk through our water stewardship strategy that is guided by SDG #6, and we use a science-based approach to manage water according to local conditions at our production sites.\n\nWe have developed context-based water programs for our sites*, and we intend to pursue a science-based approach for addressing water quality and quantity challenges at our priority sites. We also aim to improve our freshwater withdrawal, by focusing on recycling within our own operations. Learn more about our nonfinancial targets here.\n\nTo help achieve overall water security in the basins where our production sites are located, we work with external stakeholders to address relevant water challenges. In 2022, we initiated water restoration projects at our sites in China that aim to improve ecosystem services as well as water security through wetland restoration. At our site in Mumbai, India, we work with local communities to solve water, sanitation and hygiene challenges.\n\nWe disclose more details annually in CDP's Climate Change and Water Security questionnaires.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *  The targets do not include sites with activities not considered to have a significant environmental impact, e.g. sales offices, R&D labs, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## EU Taxonomy Regulation reporting\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation is a classification system that encompasses a standard set of definitions for sustainable activities. The aim of the Regulation is to help the EU in investing in sustainable activities by requiring companies to report on the part of revenue, capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX), which are associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities. The defined activities are centered around six environmental objectives (climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems).\n\nFor 2022, only the first two objectives - climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation - are in scope for reporting. This means that companies should make an assessment if they have economic activities that can qualify as eligible under the Regulation ('eligible activities'). For the eligible activities, it is required to report on Revenue, CAPEX and OPEX and to make an assessment to identify the alignment to the regulation.\n\nDespite the positive environmental impact of Novozymes' biosolutions and our focus on minimizing our environmental footprint, Novozymes' core activities do not fall within the scope of the activities defined in the EU Taxonomy. However, we have screened our non-core activities to identify the extent of any eligible activities.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy is still under development and technical annexes on the other four objectives are still to be published. Due to evolving aspect of the Regulation, we expect that reporting will change and evolve over the coming years. Therefore, Novozymes' will reassess the reporting requirement on an annual basis.\n\n## Revenue\n\nWe screened the activities listed in the technical annexes under the Delegated Act 2021/2139 and identified no material eligible revenues. Revenue is defined as revenue included in the consolidated financial statements for the year 2022,  see the Note on Revenue.\n\n## Capital expenditures (CAPEX)\n\nWe screened the activities listed in the technical annexes under the Delegated Act 2021/2139 and identified 6% eligible capital expenditures. The\n\nTaxonomy-eligible CAPEX includes activities related to renewal of wastewater collection and treatment, and material recovery from non-hazardous waste. Of the eligible activities, none was assessed as Taxonomy-aligned. CAPEX is defined as additions of tangible assets as included in the consolidated financial statements for the year 2022. Please see the Note on Property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Operational expenditures (OPEX)\n\nWe screened the activities listed in the technical annexes under the Delegated Act 2021/2139 and identified no material eligible operational expenditures. Operating expenditures as per the EU Taxonomy are defined as in 2022 directly incurred, non-capitalizable cost relating to research and development, building renovations, short term leases, and the repair and maintenance of property, plant and equipment.\n\n| 2022                                                   | Revenue   | CAPEX   | OPEX   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|--------|\n| Taxonomy-eligible activities                           | 0%        | 6%      | 0%     |\n| Taxonomy-non-eligible activities                       | 100%      | 94%     | 100%   |\n| The taxonomy-eligible activities  were assessed to be: |           |         |        |\n| Taxonomy-aligned activities                            | n/a       | 0%      | n/a    |\n| Taxonomy-non-aligned activities                        | n/a       | 100%    | n/a    |\n\nFurther information on the EU Taxonomy reporting (e.g., full reporting table) can be found at Novozymes.com\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Summary of the Remuneration Report\n\nIn 2022, Novozymes delivered a strong organic sales growth of 9% and a solid EBIT margin of 26.0% despite a volatile market environment. Furthermore, we concluded our nonfinancial milestone targets for 2022 with an improvement in the environmental impact of our operations, increased employee engagement, and we enabled our customers to reduce their CO2 emissions. At the end of the year we announced the proposed combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen as another step on our strategic journey and to create a leading global biosolutions partner.\n\nEach year Novozymes issues the Novozymes Remuneration Report as a separate report. The content of the Remuneration Report has been prepared to meet the requirements of section 139b of the Danish Companies Act and holds information and details on the remuneration of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management. The Novozymes Remuneration Report 2022 will be presented for an advisory vote at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2023. The Novozymes Remuneration Report 2021 was approved at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in March 2022 without any comments.\n\nAll remuneration of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management in 2022 has been in line with the scope of the approved remuneration policy.\n\nThe following is a summary of the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2022.\n\n## General remuneration policy\n\nNovozymes' remuneration policy for managers and other employees is designed to both encourage strong individual performance and support Novozymes' overall value creation. Remuneration consists of a base salary, pension contributions, a\n\ncash bonus and stock-based incentive programs. These components are linked to employees' individual performance and to the level of achievement of Novozymes' financial, social and environmental targets. The remuneration policy aims to provide managers and other employees with a competitive financial package, which we review regularly against external benchmarks.\n\n## Remuneration of the Board of Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Board of Directors comprises a fixed fee and is not incentive-based. This ensures that the Board of Directors safeguards the company's long-term interests without taking into consideration what these may mean in terms of the value of incentive-based remuneration. The Board of Directors' fee is set at a market-conformant level that reflects the competencies and efforts required of the role, given the complexity of the Novozymes Group, the scope of the work, and the number of Board meetings held.\n\nThe fixed base fee was raised from DKK 510,000 to DKK 522,000 in 2022, which corresponds to a 2.3% increase. The Chair receives a fee that is three times the base fee, and the Vice Chair a fee that is two times the base fee.\n\nFor committee work, the committee Chair and other committee members receive a further base fee and half a base fee respectively. However, the Chair and the Vice Chair of the Board do not receive such additional fee if appointed to the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board of Directors consists of 11 members, seven of whom are shareholder-elected members, while four are employee-elected. The total remuneration paid to the Board of Directors in 2022 amounted to DKK 10.2 million compared to DKK 9.8 million in 2021. The increase is a result of the increase in the fixed base fee. Despite significant extra workload and responsibilities related to the proposed combination with Chr. Hansen, the Board does not recommend any additional pay or fee to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe individual board members' fees and their shareholdings can be found in the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Good performance will result in target payout (65%) while maximum payout is only achieved for delivering an extraordinary performance. Maximum payout equals 9.5 months'  salary.\n\nIn 2022, the targets for the STIP were split on the financial performance of the company at 60% weight (sales 40% weight and EBIT margin 20% weight), and a target for strategy contribution at 10% weight. Individual performance targets are set for each executive accounting for the remaining 30%.\n\nThe strong sales performance of Novozymes in 2022 exceeded the target and led to a payout of 100%. The EBIT margin achieved in 2022 met the target and resulted in a payout of 65%. The level of achievement of the contribution to strategy was 82.5% based on an assessment of progress on the company's must-win battles.\n\nThe level of achievement of individual performance targets, and thus the size of remuneration payment to the individual executive, is determined by the Board of Directors based on recommendations from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nBased on its assessment, the Board determined that the pay-out based on individual targets are 100% for Ester Baiget and 90% for Lars Green.",

This allows the Board of Directors to reassess targets for each annual grant cycle to ensure the targets are sufficiently demanding, incentivizing and aligned with the strategy.\n\nThe new LTIP for the Executive Management covering the performance period 2022-2024 took effect in 2022. The LTIP consists of 50% shares\n\nand 50% share options, similar to the LTIP 2021. The targets of LTIP 2022 reflects 40% weight on organic sales growth, 20% weight on EBIT margin, 20% weight on ROIC, and 20% weight on nonfinancial targets. Compared to the LTIP in previous years, the EBIT and ROIC performance have been included in the targets, while economic profit generation has been excluded. Nonfinancial targets are set on four parameters covering environmental and social perspectives: Climate, water, circular, workplace and diversity.\n\nThe annual LTIP cannot exceed 19 months' base salary. Further, the program includes a maximum-value clause allowing the Board of Directors to choose to limit the total allocation of stock options and stock if the intrinsic value exceeds twice the annual conditional grant.\n\nThe LTIP program covering the performance period 2020-2022 was finally allocated in 2022. As described in the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2021, the targets for sales growth and economic profit have been adjusted to exclude the 2020 performance due to the extraordinary impact of COVID-19, and the allocations related to these targets have been reduced by one third. Average organic sales growth during the two-year period (2021-2022) was 7.5%, resulting in 100% of the target being met (26.5% of the total program). The accumulated economic profit generated in the two-year period resulted in 100% of the economic profit pool (26.5%% of the total program) being awarded. 80% of the nonfinancial targets were reached (20% of the total program). In total 69% of the max allocation is being awarded.\n\nFor the Executive Management this means that a total of 19,693 shares will be released in January 2023. The number of stock options granted for the three-year period is 143,605 reflecting the realized target achievement.\n\nThe members of the Executive Management have contracts of employment containing standard conditions for executive officers of Danish listed\n\ncompanies, including the periods of notice that both parties are required to give and noncompetition clauses. If an executive officer's contract of employment is terminated by the company without any misconduct on the part of the executive officer, the executive officer has a notice period of 12 months. In addition to the notice period, the executive officer has a right to termination compensation of 12 months' base salary and pension contributions.\n\nFurther details on the Executive Management's remuneration and their shareholdings etc. can be found in the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2022.\n\n## Remuneration of senior leadership\n\nThe remuneration of Novozymes' senior leadership (206 vice presidents and directors) is consistent with the general remuneration policy. Incentive programs for vice presidents and directors have been established for the 2022-2024 period. The programs follow the same mechanisms as the program for the Executive Management. The realized target achievement for the LTIP program covering the period 2020-2022 is the same as for the Executive Management and thus 69% of the program is being awarded.\n\nFurther information on the incentive programs for these employee groups can be found in Note on Stock-based payment to the consolidated financial statements, which also includes an overview of outstanding stock options.",

In 2022, Household Care was impacted by the war in Ukraine as well as volume softness in Europe. Food, Beverages & Human Health delivered double-digit growth supported by customers' focus on raw material optimization. Bioenergy's strong double-digit sales growth was driven by innovation and supported by expansion of corn-based ethanol production in Latin\n\n## Sales and sales growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSales growth, organic (%)\n\nAmerica and growth in solutions for biodiesel production. Solid growth in Grain & Tech Processing was supported by favorable market conditions. Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition delivered solid performance driven by demand for yield-enhancing solutions.\n\n## Gross profit and margin\n\nGross profit increased by 11% to DKK 9,577 million from DKK 8,623 million in 2021. The gross margin was 54.6%, down from 57.7% in 2021. The decrease was mainly due to higher input, energy and logistics costs, partly offset by productivity improvements and operating leverage and a positive impact from pricing and currencies.\n\n## Operating costs\n\nOperating costs increased by 9% to DKK 5,224 million. Operating costs as a percentage of sales were 30%.\n\n- \u00b7 Sales and distribution costs increased by 17%, accounting for 13% of sales.\n- \u00b7 Research and development costs were flat, accounting for 11% of sales.\n- \u00b7 Administrative costs increased by 11%, accounting for 5% of sales.\n\nThe increase in operating costs in 2022 was mainly due to increased commercial activities, higher logistics costs, higher administrative costs and currencies.\n\n## Other operating income\n\nOther operating income was DKK 276 million, compared with DKK 188 million in 2021. Other operating income in 2022 was positively impacted by DKK 201 million from the non-cash accounting gain related to the 21 st .BIO transaction.\n\n## Special items and EBIT before special items\n\nEBIT before special items was DKK 4,629 million for 2022 corresponding to a margin of 26.4%. Special items amounted to DKK 68 million, consisting entirely of transaction costs related to the proposed combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen.\n\n## EBIT and EBIT margin\n\nEBIT increased by 14% to DKK 4,561 million, up\n\nfrom DKK 4,007 million in 2021. The EBIT margin ended at 26.0%, down from 26.8% in 2021. Adjusted for the non-cash gain from the 21 st .BIO transaction and special items, the EBIT margin in\n\n2022 was 25.2%.\n\n## Net finance\n\nNet financial income was DKK 2 million in 2022, compared to net financial costs of DKK 79 million in 2021. In 2022 a net loss of DKK 330 million on currency hedging/revaluation and other foreign\n\n## EBIT and EBIT margin\n\nDKK million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEBIT\n\nEBIT margin (%)\n\nexchange losses was realized. This was more than offset by the gain from the divestment of Albumedix of DKK 267 million and a fair value adjustment of the contingent consideration related to Microbiome Labs of DKK 223 million. Financial costs also include costs for the refinancing facility related to the proposed combination.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe effective tax rate was 19.1%, down from 19.9% in 2021. The tax rate was positively impacted by 3.3% because non-recurring gains were tax-exempt.\n\n## Earnings per share (diluted)\n\nEarnings per share (diluted) were DKK 13.19, compared with DKK 11.23 in 2021.",

The increase was mainly driven by net investments, an increase in net working capital, partly offset by amortization and depreciation.\n\n## Invested capital\n\nInvested capital increased from DKK 18,118 million in 2021 to DKK 20,703 million in 2022. This was mainly a result of an increase in net investments.\n\n## ROIC and average invested capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ROIC and ROIC before special items\n\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC), including goodwill, was 17.6%, down 1.7 percentage points from 19.3% in 2021. ROIC before special items was 17.9%. The decrease in ROIC was mainly due to the increase in invested capital.\n\n## Net working capital\n\nNovozymes' net working capital increased to DKK 4,244 million, up from DKK 3,535 million in 2021, due to an increase in inventories and trade receivables, partly offset by higher other payables.\n\n## Net working capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net interest-bearing debt\n\nNovozymes had net interest-bearing debt of DKK 5,807 million at December 31, 2022, compared with DKK 5,225 million at December 31, 2021.\n\nNet interest-bearing debt was impacted by cash outflows from stock buybacks of DKK 500 million, dividend payments of DKK 1,525 million and the investment in the new production line in Blair, Nebraska, U.S.\n\n## Net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) and net interest-bearing debt-to-EBITDA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net interest-bearing debt-to-EBITDA\n\nNet interest-bearing debt-to-EBITDA was 1.0x at December 31, 2022, unchanged from 1.0x at December 31, 2021.",

Renewable electricity made up 82% of the total in 2022, up from 68% in 2021. As for climate change, the major contributor was the procurement of green electricity for Novozymes' site in Hongda, China.\n\n## Water\n\nNovozymes' water withdrawal increased by 2%, from 8,538,000 m3 in 2021 to 8,720,000 m3 in 2022.\n\nThe total volume of wastewater generated in 2022 increased by 2% compared to 2021.\n\nIn 2022, 100% of our biomass was re-circulated as compost, fertilizer, feedstock for biogas or the like, compared to 99% in 2021.\n\nFor non-biomass waste, the rate of recycling across our global production sites increased to 63%, from 62% in 2021.\n\n## Environmental compliance\n\nThe number of breaches of regulatory limits recorded worldwide in the Novozymes organization increased to 21 in 2022 from 13 in 2021. Most of them were related to wastewater discharge and air emission requirements.\n\nNovozymes is addressing these incidents.\n\nNovozymes received 23 neighbor complaints in 2022, compared to seven received in 2021. Most of them pertained to odor cases associated with the treatment of biomass in a newly installed biomass handling system. Mitigation actions are being carried out.",

Hansen to combine and create a leading global biosolutions partner\n\nNovozymes and Chr. Hansen announced on December 12, 2022, the proposed combination of the two companies to create a leading global biosolutions partner.\n\nAs a consequence of the proposed combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen, special items are presented in the income statement for 2022. Reference is made to Note 2.6 for further information.\n\nSe Note 5.1 for information on undrawn commited credit facilities and Note 6.3 on contractual commitments related to the proposed combination.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nNovozymes does not have any significant business activities in Russia and Ukraine, and while sales to Russia have been discontinued and the sales office in Russia has been closed, this has not resulted in any significant impairment of assets. Reference is made to Notes 2.2, 3.2.and 4.2 for further details.\n\nThe uncertainty regarding energy supply - with Russian gas being cut off - has led to investments in oil-based energy generators to mitigate the gas shortage and secure production stability. See note 7.2 for further information.\n\nNovozymes and our employees have supported refugees and families impacted by the war through multiple initiatives. See note 8.6 for further information.\n\n## Significant transactions\n\nIn 2022, Novozymes Biotechnology merged with 21 st .BIO and a non-cash accounting gain was realized. Following the transaction, Novozymes obtained significant influence in 21 st .BIO, and 21 st .BIO is recognized as an associated company of Novozymes. Reference is made to Note 2.5 for further details.\n\nAdditionally, Novozymes' minority ownership in Albumedix has been divested, leading to a financial gain. Reference is made to Note 5.2 for more details.",

Accounting policies and critical accounting estimates and judgments are described in the notes to which they relate to enhance understanding. The descriptions of accounting policies in the notes form part of the overall description of accounting policies.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Novozymes A/S (the Parent Company) and subsidiaries controlled by Novozymes A/S, prepared in accordance with\n\nGroup accounting policies. The consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining items of a uniform nature and subsequently eliminating intercompany transactions, internal stockholdings and balances, and unrealized intercompany profits and losses.\n\nNon-controlling interests' share of subsidiaries' net profit for the year and equity are included in the Group's net profit and total equity, but are disclosed separately.\n\nConsolidation of the environmental, social and governance data follows the same principles as the financial reporting.\n\n## Translation of foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK), which is also the functional and presentation currency of the parent company.\n\nExchange rate differences arising between exchange rates at the transaction date and the reporting date are recognized as Financial income or Financial costs.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency defined for each company using the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.\n\nFinancial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into DKK at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date for assets and liabilities, and at average exchange rates for income statement items.\n\nThe following exchange rate differences, arising from translation using the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date, are recognized in Other comprehensive income:\n\n- \u00b7 Translation of foreign subsidiaries' net assets at the beginning of the year.\n- \u00b7 Translation of foreign subsidiaries' income statements from average exchange rates.\n\n## iXBRL reporting\n\nNovozymes is required to file its annual report in the European Single Electronic Format ('ESEF') and The Novozymes Report is therefore prepared\n\nin the XHTML format that can be displayed in a standard browser. The primary statements and notes in the consolidated financial statements are tagged using inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL). The iXBRL tags comply with the ESEF taxonomy, which is included in the ESEF Regulation and developed based on the IFRS taxonomy published by the IFRS Foundation. Where a financial statement line item or note disclosure is not defined in the ESEF taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy has been created. Extensions are anchored to elements in the ESEF taxonomy, except for extensions which are subtotals.\n\nThe Novozymes Report submitted to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority consists of the XHTML document together with certain technical files, all included in a file named NOVOZYMES2022-12-31-en.zip.",

The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe application of the Group's accounting policies may require Management to make judgments that can have a significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Management judgment is required in particular when assessing the substance of transactions that have a complicated structure or legal form.\n\nThe critical accounting estimates and judgments could potentially have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based, or if more detailed information becomes available. Such changes are recognized in the period in which the estimate in question is revised.\n\nThe table shows critical accounting estimates and judgments and their level of potential impact on the consolidated financial statements:\n\n| Note/uni00A0                                                     | Critical accounting  estimates and judgments/uni00A0   | Estimate/  judgment/uni00A0   | Potential impact from  estimates and judgments/uni00A0   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2.2 Revenue/uni00A0                                              | Revenue recognition/uni00A0                            | Estimate/uni00A0              |                                                          |\n| 2.6 Special items                                                | Classification of   special items                      | Judgment                      |                                                          |\n| 2.7 Tax/uni00A0                                                  | Group tax charge/uni00A0and  deferred tax assets       | Estimate/uni00A0              |                                                          |\n| 3.1  Intangible assets and  impairment test of goodwill/uni00A0  | Impairment of intangible  assets and goodwill/uni00A0  | Estimate/uni00A0              |                                                          |\n| 3.5  Business acquisitions 3.6  Contingent consideration/uni00A0 | Fair value measurement                                 | Estimate                      |                                                          |\n| 6.5  Non-controlling interests                                   |                                                        |                               |                                                          |\n| 4.1 Inventories/uni00A0                                          | Cost of work in progress  and finished goods/uni00A0   | Estimate                      |                                                          |\n| 4.2   Trade receivables and  contract assets/uni00A0             | Allowances for doubtful  trade receivables/uni00A0     | Estimate                      |                                                          |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The financial year for the Group is January 1 December 31.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, with the exception of derivatives, securities, contingent consideration and share purchase liability, which are measured at fair value. The accounting policies are unchanged from last year.\n\nThe consolidated environmental, social and governance data have been prepared in accordance with policies that adhere to internationally recognized voluntary reporting standards and principles such as the UN Global Compact (UNGC). Novozymes is a signatory to the UNGC, a voluntary policy initiative for businesses committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of\n\nhuman rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. We also take inspiration from the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework for climate-related disclosures.\n\nOur reporting and materiality assessments were also inspired by the GRI framework.\n\nThe policies are unchanged from last year.\n\n## Introduction of special items in the income statement\n\nAs a consequence of the proposed combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen, special items are presented in the income statement from 2022.\n\nIntroduction of special items has been made to provide a more transparent view of Novozymes' recurring activities and to separate the income and costs from the proposed combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen from Novozymes' operating profit.\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.6 for more information.\n\n## Defining materiality\n\nThe Novozymes Report is based on the concept of materiality, to ensure that the content is material and relevant.\n\nIf items are individually immaterial, they are aggregated with other items of a similar nature in the statements or in the notes. Novozymes provides the specific disclosures required by IFRS unless the information is considered immaterial to the economic decision-making of the readers of The Novozymes Report.\n\nAs for environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, we disclose information on issues that are identified by our materiality assessment. The disclosures in the notes include information on our management approach, targets, initiatives, and related progress.\n\nNovozymes' materiality assessment is a systematic and rigorous process that has been aligned with the principles of double materiality. It allows us both to evaluate whether Novozymes has an impact on the environment and society and to identify how ESG issues affect the creation of\n\nlong-term value. We have established a twophased process comprising a comprehensive assessment every three years and a refresh (light-assessment) every year. The process integrates input from external stakeholders, trend analyses and internal engagement with relevant departments including Investor Relations, Risk Management & Controls, Quality, Sustainability and our commercial divisions. This process results in a materiality matrix of economic and ESG issues. The matrix reflects the importance of those issues to our key stakeholders versus their impact on Novozymes, and it is used to guide our strategy and reporting.\n\nAs a result of the refresh performed in 2022, no new issues were added to our materiality matrix.",

However, measures are taken to ensure that at least 97% of the total Novozymes quantity of the measured environmental parameter is included in the reported numbers.\n\n## Impact of new accounting standards\n\nNovozymes has adopted the following new or amended standards and interpretations from January 1, 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations clarifying the prohibition for recognizing contingent assets acquired in a business combination and replacing outdated references to the Framework.\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 37 - Provisions Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets specify that the 'cost of fulfilling' a contract comprises the 'costs that relate directly to the contract' whether being incremental costs of fulfilling that contract or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts.\n- \u00b7 Amendment to IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment prohibiting deductions from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment of any proceeds from selling items\n\nproduced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, proceeds from selling such items, and the cost of producing those items, must be recognized in profit or loss.\n\n- \u00b7 Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2018-2020) contains minor changes to four standards.\n\nThe adoption of the new and amended standards and interpretations has not had a significant impact on recognition, measurement, or disclosures in the consolidated financial statements for 2022 and is not anticipated to have a significant impact on future periods.\n\n## New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nIASB has issued new or amended accounting standards and interpretations that have not yet become effective and have consequently not been implemented in the consolidated financial statements for 2022. Novozymes expects to adopt the accounting standards and interpretations as they become mandatory. None of the new or amended standards or interpretations are expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.",

This setup consolidates functions by type, and Management reviews the results of the Group as a whole to assess performance. Thus, there is only one operating segment.\n\n## Worldwide operations\n\nThe Group operates in four geographical regions: Europe, Middle East & Africa, North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America. From a revenue perspective, U.S. is the largest single country,\n\ncontributing ~31% of the Group's revenue (2021: ~29%).\n\nThe geographical distribution of revenue is based on the country in which the goods are delivered. For a number of customers, central deliveries are made to specified locations and the final destination is unknown. The stated geographical distribution of revenue may therefore vary from one year to the next if delivery destinations for these customers change.\n\nMost of the Group's intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are located in Denmark, U.S., India and China.\n\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, largest  single countries:   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Denmark                                                                           | 40%    | 44%    |\n| U.S.                                                                              | 33%    | 25%    |\n| India                                                                             | 11%    | 13%    |\n| China                                                                             | 9%     | 10%    |\n\n## Revenue 2022 (2021)\n\n## DKK million\n\n- Denmark 211 (207)\n- Rest of Europe, Middle East & Africa 5,884 (5,474)\n- North America 5,829 (4,683)\n- Latin America 2,063 (1,578)\n- Asia Pacific 3,566 (3,009)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 2022 (2021)\n\nDKK million\n\n- Denmark 6,747 (6,647)\n- Rest of Europe, Middle East & Africa 788 (828)\n- North America 5,804 (4,019)\n- Latin America 121 (108)\n- Asia Pacific 3,312 (3,607)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net investments 2022 (2021)\n\nDKK million\n\n- Denmark 754 (431)\n- Rest of Europe, Middle East & Africa 3 (-32)\n- North America 1,941 (517)\n- Latin America 26 (22)\n- Asia Pacific 138 (178)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Rest of the world is considered as emerging markets.\n\nMost of Novozymes' revenue is derived from the sale of goods to customers, with revenue being recognized when the goods are delivered.\n\nAt January 1, 2022, contract liabilities amounted to DKK 129 million (2021: DKK 67 million), of which DKK 81 million was recognized as revenue in 2022 (2021: DKK 43 million).\n\nAs a consequence of the war in Ukraine, Novozymes has discontinued all sales to customers in Russia. This is estimated to have had a negative impact on the organic sales growth in 2022 of around 1%.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nNovozymes has entered into various sales agreements, including agreements where Novozymes manufactures and sells products to a partner, who undertakes the sales to end customers, and where the profit on products sold to end customers is shared between the partner and Novozymes based on\n\npredetermined profit-sharing mechanisms. Recognition of revenue requires judgment and estimates by Management in connection with determining the appropriate revenue recognition as well as the timing of recognition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Net operating profit after tax\n\n## 2.2 Revenue (continued)\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nNovozymes produces a wide range of industrial enzymes, microorganisms and probiotics. Revenue includes the sale of goods and related services and royalties, and is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which Novozymes expects to be entitled. Revenue from the straightforward sale of goods to customers is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, i.e. when goods are delivered. Variable considerations are included in revenue to the extent that they are not subject to significant uncertainty.\n\nThe performance obligations in the contracts are to deliver enzymes, microorganisms and probiotics to customers, and each batch delivered is considered a separate performance obligation, as each batch is distinct.\n\n## Rebates\n\nEnzymes, microorganisms and probiotics are sometimes sold at a rebate. A rebate agreement can be set up in various ways, but common to all agreements is that revenue is\n\nrecognized based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated rebate. The rebates are estimated based on experience, as well as information related to expected orders 3-12 months in advance. The estimated rebates are reassessed at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## Returns\n\nA few of Novozymes' markets are granted a right of return. No revenue is recognized for the goods expected to be returned, as a refund liability is recognized. Estimates of the expected level of returns are based on analysis of historical returns and knowledge of the relevant markets/products. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period. As the goods returned are usually scrapped, no inventory asset is recognized.\n\n## Profit split\n\nNovozymes has entered into partnerships where Novozymes manufactures and sells products to a partner, who undertakes the sales to end customers. The profit on products\n\nsold to end customers is shared between the partner and Novozymes based on predetermined profit-sharing mechanisms.\n\nRevenue from these arrangements consists of sales of products to the partner and the shared profit, and is recognized in full when the goods are delivered to the other contracting party. This is done by calculating the expected profit based on insights, experience and other input factors. The calculated profit is recognized as a contract asset or contract liability until an invoice is issued. The profit realized is settled periodically.\n\n## Commission\n\nNovozymes has entered into commission agreements where agents undertake sales to third parties in return for a commission on realized sales. Revenue from such agreements is recognized when the goods are delivered, as the nature of the performance obligation is to provide the specified goods.\n\n## Other\n\nRevenue collected on behalf of third parties is not recognized as revenue.\n\nNovozymes' obligation to provide a refund for products that are not of the agreed quality or according to agreed specifications under the standard warranty terms is recognized as contract liabilities.\n\nA trade receivable is recognized when the customer obtains control of the goods and an invoice is issued, as this is the point in time when the consideration becomes unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payment is due. Typical payment terms are around 60 days.\n\nContract liabilities consist of advance payments, deferred revenue and liabilities for refund goods. The contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as the performance obligations under the contracts are fulfilled.",

These items are classified separately in the income statement as Special items in order to provide a more transparent view of Novozymes' operating profit.\n\nThe use of special items entails management judgement in the separation from other items in the income statement.\n\nManagement considers individual items in order to ensure that special items include significant non-recurring income or costs not related to Novozymes' recurring operating profit.\n\nSpecial items include income or costs from the proposed combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen.\n\n## 2.7 Tax\n\n## Tax risks\n\nIn many markets, Novozymes operates through sales companies and distributors, whereas production is located in only a few countries. This leads to transactions between group companies. Novozymes follows the OECD principles in setting internal transfer prices for these transactions. This is a complicated area and entails a tax risk, because the transactions are subject to judgment in each country. The tax controversy risk for Novozymes is significantly reduced through the use of bilateral advance pricing agreements (APAs).\n\n## Bilateral APAs\n\nAs stated in our tax policy, Novozymes proactively engages in bilateral APAs negotiated at competent authority level to increase predictability and to mitigate transfer pricing risks. Most of the intercompany transaction value within the Novozymes Group is covered by bilateral APAs.\n\nAn APA is an agreement between a taxpayer and a tax authority determining the transfer pricing methodology for pricing the taxpayer's international transactions for future years.\n\nThe methodology is applied for a certain period based on the fulfilment of certain terms and conditions (called critical assumptions). An APA can be unilateral or bilateral. Novozymes only enters into bilateral APAs, meaning that they are negotiated between the competent tax authorities of the two countries involved in the transaction. An APA provides assurance with respect to the tax outcome of our international transactions, by determining in advance arm's length pricing and the pricing methodology to be applied to the international transactions.\n\nNovozymes has entered into bilateral APAs with the tax authorities in the countries where internal transactions are most significant. Included in APA-covered transactions are group internal transactions between Denmark and the U.S., China and India, respectively.",

As the market value of Novozymes is significantly higher than its equity, no further key assumptions are used to determine whether impairment of goodwill exists (2021: no impairment).",

        "page_content": "Invested capital\n\n## 3.3 Leases (continued)\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Lease assets\n\nLease assets are 'right-of-use assets' from lease agreements. If, at inception, it is assessed that a contract contains a lease, a lease asset is recognized. Lease assets are initially measured at the present value of future lease payments, plus the cost of obligations to refurbish the asset. Payments include fixed payments, variable lease payments depending on an index or a rate and the exercise price of purchase options that are reasonably certain to be excercised.\n\nLease assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the expected lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset. Lease assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired.\n\nLease assets are depreciated as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Buildings: 1-12 years\n- \u00b7 Land: 10-90 years\n- \u00b7 Plant and machinery: 1-10 years\n- \u00b7 Other equipment: 1-10 years\n\nShort-term leases and leases of low value are recognized as expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nNovozymes' portfolio of leases covers leases of land, buildings, plant and machinery and other equipment such as cars and transportation containers.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are initially recognized at the present value of future lease payments including payments from extension or purchase options that are considered reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe lease liability is measured using the implicit borrowing rate in the contracts or, where this is not available, the marginal borrowing rate in the countries in which Novozymes operates. Novozymes applies a single discount rate to portfolios of leases in the countries in which Novozymes operates based on contract currency and loan periods.\n\nIf a lease contract is modified, the lease liability is remeasured. For building leases, lease terms are estimated taking the size of the building and its strategic importance into consideration. Novozymes has entered into several open-ended building leases and building leases with extension options. Lease terms of such agreements are estimated based on the strategic importance of the buildings and the estimated time frame necessary to vacate the premises. The estimated lease term is reassessed at each reporting date. The estimated lease terms for such contracts do not exceed 12 years.",

Novozymes aims for its production sites not to have a negative environmental impact. These liabilities relate to established circumstances, and the costs are expected to be incurred either when concrete measures are implemented or when a site is vacated. The expected costs and timing are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Legal and other obligations\n\nNovozymes is involved in a number of ongoing legal disputes, and provisions are made for the estimated costs based on a current evaluation of the outcomes. Current ongoing cases are expected to be finalized in 2023-2024. In Management's opinion, the outcomes of these cases are not expected to give rise to any significant losses beyond the amounts provided for at December 31, 2022.\n\nOther obligations include other long-term employee benefits and other contractual obligations.\n\nIn 2021, Additions from business acquisitions of DKK 50 million were related to the acquisition of Synergia Life Sciences. In 2022, the provisions in the final opening balance of Synergia Life Sciences were reduced by DKK 35 million.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProvisions are recognized where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is probable that it will lead to an outflow of financial resources. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expected expenditure required to settle the obligation.\n\nIn 2021, contingent consideration of DKK 62 million related to the divestment of a pharmarelated royalty was recognized in Other operating income. The remaining consideration was reversed because certain patent registrations were not obtained in 2021.\n\nOther long-term employee benefits account for only a minor amount, as most of Novozymes' pension plans are defined contribution plans, covering approximately 99% of employees. These obligations are mainly expected to be incurred over a relatively long period of time.",

The final opening balance mainly includes changes to Property, plant and equipment, Deferred tax liabilities and Financial and other liabilities as provisionally presented in The Novozymes Report 2021.\n\nIn 2021, the most probable sales and EBITDA related to PrecisionBiotics Group were reassessed. This led to an increase of DKK 44 million in the fair value of contingent consideration and goodwill at the acquisition date.\n\n## Acquisitions in 2021\n\n## Synergia Life Sciences\n\nOn December 10, 2021, Novozymes acquired 60% of the shares in Synergia Life Sciences.\n\nSynergia Life Sciences is a leading player within spore probiotics and vitamin K2-7. Synergia Life Sciences has a global footprint and adds strong developing and manufacturing capabilities in spore probiotics and vitamin K2-7 from three production sites in India. Synergia Life Sciences\n\nis a producer and supplier to Microbiome Labs, which was acquired by Novozymes early in 2021.\n\nThe vitamin K2-7 portfolio is a strong complementary enabler to support growth in Novozymes' BioHealth platform. The acquisition offers a scientifically proven spore strain portfolio that strengthens Novozymes' human health business and accelerates its functional food offerings.\n\nThe purchase price led to the recognition of goodwill of DKK 505 million and intangible assets of DKK 991 million. Goodwill is attributable to expected synergies with Novozymes' existing business operations and technologies within spore probiotics for human health and is highly synergistic to the previous acquisition of Microbiome Labs within the human health business. The goodwill is not tax deductible.\n\nThe following valuation techniques have been applied in the fair value assessment of significant assets acquired:\n\n- \u00b7 Technology; the Relief from Royalty (RfR) method\n- \u00b7 Customer relationships; The Multi-period Excess Earnings Method (MEEM)\n- \u00b7 Brands; The Relief from Royalty (RfR) method",

Reference is made to Note 6.5 concerning Noncontrolling interests.\n\nThe purchase price includes a deferred consideration of DKK 77 million, which was paid in 2022.\n\nFor further details, please refer to Note 3.5 in The Novozymes Report 2021.\n\n## Microbiome Labs\n\nOn January 7, 2021, Novozymes acquired all shares in Microbiome Labs at a purchase price of DKK 1,107 million. Microbiome Labs offers a comprehensive suite of proprietary probiotic and microbiome solutions targeting gastrointestinal, immune, metabolic, and cognitive health. The solutions are marketed under both the company's own supplement brands and in private label products. The branded products are sold exclusively through the company's access to an\n\nextensive network of healthcare practitioners predominately consisting of medical doctors, nutritionists and naturopaths.\n\nThe purchase price led to the recognition of goodwill of DKK 338 million and intangible assets of DKK 718 million. Goodwill is attributable to expected synergies with Novozymes' existing business operations and technologies within probiotics and enzymes for human health. The goodwill is tax deductible.\n\nThe purchase agreement includes a contingent consideration of up to DKK 825 million at the acquisition date. The consideration is contingent on the achievement of sales targets for 2022 and is recognized at the anticipated fair value of DKK 338 million at the acquisition date. Fair value is assessed by using the earn-out from the most probable sales estimates in 2022 discounted at a rate of 8%.\n\nFor further details, please refer to Note 3.5 in The Novozymes Report 2021.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nFair value measurement of the acquired assets and liabilities as well as contingent consideration requires Management to make estimates and use assumptions, as observable\n\nmarket prices are not available. The determined fair values are associated with uncertainty and may be subject to subsequent adjustments.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nOn acquisition of companies, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date. The consideration transferred includes the fair value at the acquisition date of any contingent consideration arrangement.\n\nNon-controlling interests in an acquired company is recognized either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquired company's net identifiable assets.\n\nThis decision is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.\n\nGoodwill may subsequently be adjusted for changes in the fair value of the consideration transferred and/or changes in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired until 12 months after the acquisition date, to the extent such changes relate to facts and circumstances present at the acquisition date. Acquired companies are consolidated from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.",

Indirect production costs are assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure reliable measurement of employee costs, capacity\n\nutilization, cost drivers and other relevant factors. Changes in these parameters may have an impact on the gross margin and the overall valuation of Work in progress and Finished goods.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost determined on a first-in first-out basis and net realizable value.\n\nThe cost of Work in progress and Finished goods comprises direct production costs such as raw materials and consumables, energy and labor directly attributable to production as well as indirect production costs such as employee costs, maintenance and depreciation of plants, etc.\n\nIf the expected selling price less any completion costs and costs to execute the sale (net realizable value) of inventories is lower than the carrying amount, inventories are written down to net realizable value.\n\nNovozymes has entered into a few agreements where Novozymes supplies goods to a customer's premises but retains title to the inventory until the goods are consumed in the customer's production. Such goods are derecognized from inventories in the period when they are consumed in the customer's production.",

        "page_content": "## 5.1 Financial risk factors and risk management\n\nDue to the international nature of Novozymes' operations, our earnings and financial position are exposed to a number of financial risk factors. Financial risks are managed centrally for the entire Group. The Treasury Policy is approved by the Board of Directors and sets the limits for the various financial risks and the derivatives used to hedge risk. The Treasury Policy is adjusted on an ongoing basis and adapted to the market situation. It contains rules on which derivatives can be used for hedging, which counterparties can be used, and the risk profile that is to be applied.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCurrency risk arises due to imbalances between income and costs in each individual currency and because Novozymes has more assets than liabilities in foreign currencies in connection with global operations.\n\nHedging of currency risk is carried out in the currencies in which Novozymes has the largest exposures. Hedging is managed by entering into derivatives such as forward contracts, currency options and swaps. Loans and deposits in foreign currencies are also utilized for hedging purposes. Hedge effectiveness is assessed on a regular basis by comparing changes in the timing and value of the expected exposure in the relevant\n\ncurrencies with the timing and value changes for the designated cash flow hedging transaction.\n\nWhere deemed appropriate, currency risk related to net investments in foreign subsidiaries is hedged by taking out loans and entering into swaps. Currently, there are no open transactions used to hedge equity investments.\n\n## Foreign exchange sensitivity - 2022\n\nThe sensitivity analysis shows the impact on net profit and other comprehensive income of a 5% change in DKK versus the key currencies to which Novozymes was exposed on December 31, 2022. For other comprehensive income, the analysis shows the impact on currency translation of net investments and does not include the impact of cash flow hedges, as these relate to future commercial transactions.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis reflects transaction and translation risk, and assumes that exchange rates change on December 31, 2022, while all other variables remain constant. The table shows the effect of an increase in exchange rates. A decrease in the exchange rates would have the opposite effect.\n\n## Foreign exchange sensitivity analysis\n\n|             |                            | 2022                 | 2022                                  | 2021                 | 2021                                  |\n|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| DKK million | Increase in exchange rates | Change in net profit | Change in other  comprehensive income | Change in net profit | Change in other  comprehensive income |\n| INR         | 5.0%                       | 4                    | 51                                    | 4                    | 57                                    |\n| CNY         | 5.0%                       | (5)                  | 127                                   | (1)                  | 127                                   |\n| USD         | 5.0%                       | (3)                  | 325                                   | 1                    | 244                                   |\n| Other       | 5.0%                       | 4                    | 64                                    | (6)                  | 108                                   |\n| Total       |                            | -                    | 567                                   | (2)                  | 536                                   |\n\n## Foreign exchange sensitivity - 2023 estimate\n\nOperating profit (EBIT) is exposed to exchange rate developments, as the effect of hedges is included in financial income/costs. EBIT is mainly exposed to USD and EUR. A movement of 5% in the USD/DKK exchange rate would result in a change in the expected EBIT for 2023 of around DKK 130-160 million (2022: DKK 130-160 million). A 5% movement in the EUR/DKK exchange rate would result in a change in expected EBIT for 2023 of around DKK 200 million (2022: DKK 200 million).\n\nOf the expected USD cash flows for 2023, 88% has been hedged by forward contracts at an average rate of DKK 6.98. As a result, the impact on net profit from changes in the USD/DKK exchange rate has been reduced significantly compared with the impact on EBIT.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises in relation to interestbearing assets and liabilities. In accordance with Novozymes' Treasury Policy, a minimum of 30% of loans must be at fixed interest rates. Hedging of the interest rate risk is managed by entering into fixed-rate loans and interest rate swaps.",

        "page_content": "Capital structure and financing\n\n## 5.1 Financial risk factors and risk management (continued)\n\nWith the current hedging of interest rate risk, an increase of 1 percentage point in the average interest rate on Novozymes' net interest-bearing debt would have a negative effect on net profit of DKK 14 million (2021: negative effect of DKK 12 million). At December 31, 2022, 62% (2021: 62%) of the loan portfolio carried fixed interest rates.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises especially on cash and cash equivalents, derivatives, trade receivables and contract assets. The credit risk on trade receivables is countered by thorough, regular analysis based on customer type, country and specific conditions. The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents as well as derivatives is mitigated by the Treasury Policy, which limits exposure solely to counterparties that have an investment-grade credit rating. The credit risk is calculated on the basis of net market values and is governed by the Treasury Policy. Novozymes has entered into netting agreements (ISDA or similar) with all the banks used for trading in financial instruments, which means that Novozymes' credit risk is limited to net assets. At December 31, 2022, the Group considered its maximum credit risk to be DKK 5,036 million (2021: DKK 4,219 million),\n\nwhich is the total of the Group's financial assets. At December 31, 2022, the maximum credit risk related to one counterparty was DKK 386 million (2021: DKK 330 million).\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nIn connection with the Group's ongoing financing of operations, including refinancing, efforts are made to ensure adequate and flexible liquidity. This is guaranteed by using committed credit facilities and placing free funds in deposits, government bonds or ultra-liquid mortgage bonds in accordance with the Treasury Policy.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, Novozymes' financial resources amounted to DKK 18,543 million (2021: DKK 4,748 million), consisting of net cash, cash equivalents, and undrawn committed credit facilities of DKK 17,502 million, which expire in 2023-2027. The increase in undrawn committed credit facilities compared to 2021 is related to the facility obtained to refinance existing debt following completion of the proposed combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen.\n\nWith the exception of debt to credit institutions, the maturity dates are primarily within one year.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nNovozymes favors a conservative balance which is reflected by a target for net interest-bearing debt of around 1x EBITDA. At December 31, 2022, the ratio was 1.0 and thus the target is considered as met in 2022. The capital structure is mainly managed using two instruments: 1) Dividend payments where Novozymes aims for a payout ratio of around 50%. For 2022, the payout ratio is expected to be 45.0%*, which is in line with the communicated target. 2) Stock buybacks, where a program for DKK 500 million was executed in 2022.\n\n*Adjusted for non-recurring items with no cash flow impact related to 21 st .BIO and the Microbiome Labs earnout, the payout ratio is 50.9%.",

Derivatives are recognized at the transaction date.\n\nDerivatives used for fair value hedges are measured at fair value at the reporting date, and value adjustments are recognized as Financial income or Financial costs. Derivatives used for cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in subsidiaries are measured at fair value at the reporting date, and value adjustments are recognized in Other comprehensive income.\n\nIncome and costs relating to cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in subsidiaries are transferred from Other comprehensive income. On realization, foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are recognized as Financial income and Financial costs, and electricity price agreements covering production-related electricity are recognized as part of Cost of goods sold.",

The fair value of these assets is determined using valuation techniques that utilize market-based data such as exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, electricity prices and volatilities.\n\nOther financial assets, contingent considerations and share purchase liability are measured at fair value based on non-observable data (level 3 input).

Further, significant proportions of their remuneration packages are based on performance-related pay through short and long-term incentives. Most of the variable remuneration is weighted towards the long-term, in line with Novozymes' strategic focus and mirroring the long-term nature of Novozymes' investments in the business.\n\nThe short and long-term incentive programs are designed to incentivize performance against selected financial, environmental, social and operational key performance indicators and individual objectives, which are directly linked to Novozymes' strategy, and to incentivize longterm value creation and alignment with the longterm interests of shareholders, customers and other stakeholders. The annual cash bonus cannot exceed 9.5 months' fixed base salary, of which 65% is expected to be payable at target\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Board of Directors comprises a fixed fee and is not based on incentives.",

The purpose of these programs is to ensure an alignment of interests of the Management, employees and shareholders. Allocation of programs has been, and remains, dependent on profit, value creation and, in some cases, sustainability targets being achieved, and are made based on individual base salary.  The exercise price and the share price of a stock option are identical at the date of grant. In order to exercise the options, the employees must still be employed at the exercise date. This does not apply to persons who have retired, taken voluntary early retirement or been given notice.\n\nIn 2020, Novozymes introduced annual long-term incentive-based program grants with overlapping three-year performance periods, and so in 2022 a new incentive program for the Executive Leadership Team was established, covering the performance period 2022-2024. The program is a combination of stock options and stock, with half of the incentive program allocated in stock options and half in stock. The total number of stock options and stock achievable is divided into two categories: 'target stock options and target stock'\n\nand 'extra stock options and extra stock'. The target stock options, and target stock correspond to 65% of the maximum stock options and stock, and extra stock options and extra stock correspond to 35% of the maximum stock options and stock. The targets have 40% weight on organic sales growth, 20% weight on EBIT margin, 20% weight on ROIC, and 20% weight on nonfinancial targets. The nonfinancial targets are measured in relation to Climate, water & waste, workplace and diversity. Each of the nonfinancial targets carries a weight of 5%. The performance targets are as protocolled in the minutes of the board meeting approving the annual group financial statement for the year prior to the performance period.\n\n- \u00b7 If Novozymes reaches the targets for 20222024 for organic sales growth, EBIT margin and ROIC in line with business plans and long-term aspiration and on all four measures for the nonfinancial targets, then the target stock options and the target stock will be granted.\n- \u00b7 If Novozymes manages to outperform the targets, some or all of the extra stock options and extra stock may be granted.\n- \u00b7 If Novozymes does not meet the targets for 2022-2024 or if Novozymes is significantly below the targets on one or more of the four\n\nnonfinancial targets, then none or only part of the target stock options and the target stock will be granted.\n\nThe program contains a maximum-value clause, allowing the Board of Directors to choose to limit the total allocation of stock options and stock if the intrinsic value of the program exceeds twice the annual conditional grant.\n\nThe total target-level fair value of the program at the date of grant was approximately DKK 40 million. The value of the stock will be expensed over the three-year qualifying period (2022-2024) and will be released in 2025. The stock options have a vesting period of four years, followed by an exercise period of five years. The fair value of the stock options will be expensed over the four-year vesting period.\n\nA new program was also established in 2022 for vice presidents and directors covering the performance period 2022-2024 (206 vice presidents and directors). The total target level fair value at grant date was approximately DKK 50 million and based on the same requirements and targets as for the Executive Leadership Team. The program is a combination of stock options and stock, with half of the incentive program allocated in stock\n\nand half in stock options. The stock options have a four-year vesting period, while the stock will be released in 2025.\n\nThe program contains a maximum-value clause, allowing the Executive Leadership Team to choose to limit the total allocation of stock and stock options if the intrinsic value of the program exceeds twice the annual conditional grant.\n\nFor other employees, a new stock option-based incentive program was also established in 2022 covering the performance period 2022-2024. The employee program follows the same requirements and targets as the program for the Executive Leadership Team and the program for vice presidents and directors.\n\nThe Executive Leadership Team and other senior management, who are already included in an existing incentive program, are excluded from this new program. The awarded stock options have a vesting period of four years, followed by an exercise period of five years. The target level value of the program is approximately DKK 40 million.",

The targets for sales growth and economic profit was adjusted in 2021 to exclude 2020 performance due to the extraordinary impact from COVID-19, and the allocations related to these targets were reduced by one third. For more information, see the description in the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2021.\n\nThe accumulated economic profit generated in the two-year period (2021-2022) was DKK 4.6 billion, resulting in 100% of the economic profit pool (26.5% of the total program) being awarded. Average organic sales growth during the two-year period was 7.5%, resulting in 100% of the sales growth pool (26.5% of the total program). 80% of the sustainability targets were reached (20% of the total program). In total, 69% of the original maximum of the program is being awarded.\n\nFor the Executive Leadership Team, this means that a total of 45,085 shares will be released in January 2023. The number of stock options granted over the three-year period is 328,763 reflecting the realized target achievement. The program contains a maximum-value clause, allowing the Board of Directors to choose to limit the\n\ntotal allocation of stock and stock options if the intrinsic value exceeds twice the annual conditional grant at the end of the program. There will be no limitation on the total allocation, as the intrinsic value is DKK 16 million.\n\nThe program for vice presidents and directors follows the same requirements and targets as the program for the Executive Leadership Team. The final number of shares allocated under this program to be released in January 2023 is 60,768. The number of stock options granted over the three-year period is 442,539, reflecting the realized target achievement of 69%.\n\nAwards in the program for other employees covering the performance period 2020-2022 were also finalized in 2022. The number of stock options granted over the three-year period is 785,811, reflecting the realized target achievement of 69%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If allocations under the programs are made in countries where ownership of foreign stock is not permitted, the value of stock options is settled in cash instead, and a liability of DKK 21 million was recognized for this in 2022 (2021: DKK 44 million). The intrinsic value of exercisable cash-settled programs in 2022 was DKK 9 million (2021: DKK 61 million).\n\nThe fair value of employee services received is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Fair value at grant date is measured in accordance with the BlackScholes model, using the average exercise price, the option term and the following significant assumptions:\n\n| DKK million                                | Note   |   2022 | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Expected future dividends per share        | DKK    |   38.9 | 38.1   |\n| Volatility                                 | %      |   25.9 | 25.3   |\n| Annual risk-free interest rate             | %      |    0.3 | (0.5)  |\n| Weighted average share price at grant date | DKK    |  416   | 385    |\n\nFurthermore, the options are assumed to be exercised two years after expiry of the vesting period, on average, or at the option's expiry date if within one year. Volatility is estimated using\n\nthe historical volatility over the last three years. The risk-free interest rate is based on Danish government bonds with a maturity equivalent to the option's term to maturity.\n\n## Stock awards\n\nThe stock allocated under the programs is used for stock awards. In 2022, 107,510 stock awards with a fair value of DKK 45 million were granted (2021: DKK 41 million) which will be expensed over the three-year period (2022-2024).\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe Group has established stock-based incentive programs comprising equity-settled and cash-settled programs.\n\nThe fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of stock options and stock awards is measured with reference to the fair value of the stock options and stock awards granted. The fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\n\nThe fair value of stock-based payment at the grant date is recognized as an employee cost over the period in which the stock options vest. In measuring the fair value, account is taken of the number of employees expected\n\nThe total number of outstanding stock awards at December 31, 2022 was 314,029 (2021: 209,193).\n\nThe fair value of these at December 31, 2022 was DKK 111 million (2021: 112 million).\n\nto gain entitlement to the options as well as the number of options the employees are expected to gain. This estimate is adjusted at the end of each reporting period such that only the number of options to which employees are entitled or expected to be entitled is recognized.\n\nThe value of equity-settled programs is recognized in equity. The value of cash-settled programs, which are recognized as Other liabilities, is adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period, and the subsequent adjustment is recognized in the income statement under Financial income or Financial costs.",

The Group audit fee ratio may only exceed 1 with the approval of the Audit Committee.\n\nIn 2022, approval was given for advisory services and mandatory statements of DKK 9.6 million related to the proposed combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen.\n\nIn 2021 the group audit fee ratio was 0.4.\n\nImplementation of the EU audit reform has led to restrictions on the nonaudit services that the auditors elected at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting may perform, including a 70% cap. The fee for nonaudit services performed for Novozymes by PricewaterhouseCoopers Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab was DKK 4 million (2021: DKK 1 million) and does not exceed the 70% cap. The services comprise tax advisory services concerning transfer pricing, advisory services related to the proposed combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen and other general financial reporting and tax consultancy. The fee for the mandatory statements related to the proposed combination of Novozymes and Chr.

We actively invest to lower the carbon footprint of our operations and deliver low-carbon solutions to our customers. Our solutions play a key role in addressing many of the climate-related risks facing the world.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes is committed to the science-based targets and to reaching net-zero CO 2 emissions across our operations and value chain by 2050.\n\nTo deliver on our long-term ambition, we work with milestone targets. In 2022, we concluded our milestone target for 2022 to reduce emissions from our operations by 40% from a 2018 baseline, and we introduced two new milestone targets for 2025. By 2025, we aim to reduce absolute CO 2 emissions from operations by 65% from a 2018 baseline. In addition, we increase our level of ambition as to source 100% renewable electricity by 2025, five years earlier than previously communicated.\n\nIn 2021, in response to the latest climate science, we raised our ambition by committing to a 50% reduction of emissions from our\n\noperations and supply chain (scopes 1+2+3) by 2030, which is the weighted average of a 75% reduction of emissions from our operations (scopes 1+2) and a 35% reduction from our supply chain (scope 3), from a 2018 baseline. In 2022, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) re-validated our 2030 emissions reduction targets and our 2025 renewable electricity targets. In addition, Novozymes was among the first companies in the world to receive validation of our net-zero targets by SBTi.\n\nFurther information on our science-based target and net-zero roadmap is available in the Targets & Outlook section of this report.\n\nWe are committed to improve our climate data quality and transparency. We conduct peer-reviewed cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to document the environmental impact of our solutions. These studies are used to keep our stakeholders informed and to demonstrate to our customers ways to reduce their CO 2 emissions and leverage the positive impact on climate change that Novozymes' solutions can enable. Our published LCAs are available on our website.\n\nWe disclose our climate change impacts through CDP every year, and in 2022, Novozymes was recognized in CDP's Climate Change A List (leadership ranking) for our commitment to environmental transparency and climate action.\n\n## 2022 summary\n\nIn 2022, the CO 2 emissions from our operations (scopes 1 + 2) decreased by 26% to 161,000 tonnes from 218,000 tonnes in 2021. These reductions were mainly driven by our continued focus on energy efficiency and increased sourcing of renewable electricity.\n\n| CO2-equivalent emissions  1,000 tonnes   |   2022 |   2021 |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Natural gas                              |     40 |     38 |\n| Gas oil, light fuel oil and diesel oil   |      4 |      3 |\n| HCFCs                                    |      2 |      2 |\n| Scope 1                                  |     46 |     43 |\n| District heat                            |      1 |      1 |\n| Electricity                              |     50 |    112 |\n| Steam                                    |     64 |     62 |\n| Scope 2 (market-based)                   |    115 |    175 |\n| Scope 1 and 2, total                     |    161 |    218 |\n\n| Market-based vs. location-based scope 2 emissions 1,000 tonnes   |   2022 |   2021 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 2 CO2 emissions (market-based)                             |    115 |    175 |\n| Scope 2 CO2 emissions (location-based)                           |    332 |    316 |\n\n2021 is restated due to full implementation of IEA CO2 emission factors in U.S.and Scope 3 emissions are no longer included in this table.",

Electricity accounts for more than half of the total energy consumed, and 82% of the electricity came from renewable sources, compared to 68% in 2021. The major contributor of this improvement was Novozymes' production site in Hongda, China, which began to procure green electricity in 2022, converting approximately 400,000 GJ from conventional to renewable electricity.\n\nIn Kalundborg, Denmark, we announced a collaboration with Novo Nordisk and Kalundborg Forsyning (Utility) to invest in a new district cooling system that uses ocean water. It also has the ambition to use the excess heat collected to supply renewable heating to households in both Kalundborg and Holb\u00e6k municipalities. When a distribution solution is found, it could potentially contribute significantly to the green transition in Denmark.\n\n## Renewable electricity sources 2022 (2021)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a consequence of the war in Ukraine, the supply of natural gas has become subject to uncertainty. To mitigate this risk, production plants in Denmark that use natural gas as fuel have been equipped with flex burners, which makes it possible to change to fuel oil if gas supply is temporarily reduced or stopped.\n\nOver the next three years, we will seek to implement our strong portfolio of projects to further invest in renewable electricity, to find cleaner alternatives for natural gas and coal-based steam and to save and recover energy.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEnergy consumption includes quantities consumed both in the production process and in other areas.\n\nInternally generated energy is measured as fuel consumption converted to energy based on the lower of combustion value and weight by volume, except in the U.S., where legal requirements for reporting CO2 state that the higher of combustion value and weight by volumen is to be applied. Fuel consumption comprises all types of fuel used to produce electricity, heat and steam on site and is converted to energy using factors supplied by utility providers or local authorities. Fuel for transportation is not included.\n\nExternally generated energy is the input to Novozymes of externally generated electricity, heat and steam.\n\nEnergy produced from waste or wastewater is renewable and corresponds to the total energy (heat, electricity or steam) produced by an internal or external utility provider. An example is energy produced from biomass waste or biogas.\n\nReported quantities are based on meter readings, with the exception of steam, which may be subject to calculation.\n\nThe renewable energy percentage is calculated by dividing renewable energy consumed by total energy consumption. Renewable energy used at Novozymes sites comprises energy generated from natural processes and continuously replenished. Sources include solar, wind and hydropower-based electricity and energy from biogas and biomass.\n\nDistrict heat - renewable is primarily generated from biomass.",

The production, development and processing of our solutions depends on availability of water. We not only use water as a coolant, solvent and cleaning agent, but also as a component of our final products. Additionally, many of the raw materials required in our operations are agriculture-based and depend on water for production.\n\nMany of our biosolutions in textile, brewing, household care and grain & starch processing enable customers to reduce their water consumption compared with conventional methods, while improving efficiency, wastewater quality and reducing dependence on hazardous chemicals.\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur approach towards water stewardship is driven by science and our ambition to manage water in balance with local conditions at all our sites. To deliver on this ambition, we concluded our milestone target for 2022 to establish contextual water management programs for all sites*. We also introduced three new long-term commitments and two milestone targets for 2025. We aim to improve freshwater withdrawal by recycling 10% more water by 2025, 15% more water by 2030 and 20% more water by 2035\n\nfrom a 2021 baseline. In addition, in basins close to our production sites where Water, Sanitization and Hygiene (WASH) is a challenge, we aim to restore 10 billion liters of water by 2025 and 30 billion liters by 2030 from a 2021 baseline.\n\nFor our operations, we seek to reduce dependence on freshwater by implementing recycling and water efficiency projects, while ensuring compliance with local regulations. We drive projects that also address site-specific challenges including scarcity, quality and changing regulation. Our wastewater is biologically treated internally or externally before being discharged or recycled after secondary filtration.\n\nAt community level, we drive collective action with communities and organizations within our production basins. Our actions address shared water challenges such as flooding, ecosystem service, water quality and scarcity, through collective action on WASH, nature restoration and watershed restoration.\n\nWe disclose our water security impacts through CDP every year, and in 2022, Novozymes received an 'A-' leadership ranking recognizing our good water management practices.\n\n## 2022 summary\n\nIn 2022, our water withdrawal increased by 2% compared with 2021 and wastewater discharge also increased by 2% compared with 2021. This change was due to increased production and shows a lower rate than our organic sales growth of 9%.\n\n## Water withdrawal by primary source\n\n1,000 m\u00b3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough our major projects in operations, we achieved water savings of approximately 41,000 m3 for the year. These are related to a capex investment at our site in Blair, USA.\n\nWe met our 2022 milestone targets for developing our context-based water management plans for all our production sites, and their implementation will guide our actions in the coming years. We have identified site-specific risks, opportunities and actions aimed at improving the health of our operational basins.\n\nPrioritized focus areas cover both our operations and our communities and include collective action, recycling, nature restoration and WASH. In Taihu basin, China, we have transitioned into phase 2 of our collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and local experts.\n\n| Water by primary source  1,000 m3   |     | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----|--------|--------|\n| Drinking water                      |     | 5,788  | 5,906  |\n| Industrial water                    |     | 2,554  | 2,249  |\n| Steam                               |     | 378    | 383    |\n| Water withdrawal, total             | ESG | 8,720  | 8,538  |",

Our goal is to gradually convert the wetland from a landscape functional park to a thriving wetland with enhanced ecosystem services. Additionally, we are working with Green Partnership of Industrial Parks, TEDA and academics to develop water stewardship guidance for TEDA industrial park.\n\nIn India, via the Novozymes Water Opulence project, we have been collaborating with our local community since 2020 to drive action to ensure water availability and groundwater restoration, while making sure that challenges at the basin level are managed. Since then, we have reached more than 1,800 people spread across five villages.\n\nIn Kalundborg, Denmark, we announced a collaboration with Novo Nordisk and Kalundborg Forsyning (Utility) to invest in a new district cooling system that will use cold salt water from the ocean instead of freshwater from the local lake.\n\nThe new cooling system will connect the factories of Novo Nordisk and Novozymes in a closed loop, and it will eliminate the need to use freshwater from Lake Tiss\u00f8 for cooling purposes.\n\nGoing forward, we continue to develop projects and initiatives that would allow us to reduce our dependence on freshwater, especially in waterstressed sites. These include water recycling within our own operations and water efficiency projects.

In our operations, we take a holistic approach towards circularity, such as by improving packaging recyclability, as well as site-specific initiatives to reduce and recover waste. In addition, our biosolutions enable our customers to adopt practices that help minimize waste from their operations. For example, some of our grain and vegetable oil processing biosolutions enable our customers to optimize resource utilization by unlocking additional starch, protein and oils from feedstocks, hence reducing waste.\n\n## Our approach\n\nResponsible waste and packaging management at Novozymes is a key element of our efforts to reduce the environmental impact of our operations. We remain committed to have zero waste to landfill from our operations by 2030. This year we introduced a new commitment to have three key circular projects successfully implemented by 2030. To deliver on these long-term ambitions, we work with milestone targets.\n\nIn 2022, we concluded our milestone targets for 2022 of achieving circular management of our biomass waste, developing plans for 100% circular management of key packaging materials and\n\nprograms to reach zero waste. We also introduced a new milestone target to have two key circular projects in pilots with demonstrated benefit by 2025.\n\nGuided by our aim to achieve zero waste to landfill, we have a site-specific waste management approach. We actively work with local experts and service providers to explore localized opportunities to manage waste. This allows us to manage this complex issue in alignment with local regulations and external service providers. We are also committed to minimizing the impact of the waste generated by our packaging materials by making our key packaging materials recyclable and reusable.\n\n## 2022 summary\n\nIn 2022, we met our milestone targets of achieving circular management of our biomass waste, developing plans for 100% circular management of key packaging materials and programs to reach zero waste by 2030 at our sites.\n\nThe total recycling and composting rate was 99%, and only 1% was sent to landfill or incineration without energy recovery. The total waste increased from 481,000 tonnes in 2021 to 559,000 tonnes in 2022. The change was mainly due to higher water content in the biomass. To\n\nfacilitate transportation and application of biomass waste we adjust its water content in accordance with local requirement, ranging from 5% to 85%.\n\n## Total waste by disposal method 2022 (2021)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur waste is composed of biomass waste and non-biomass waste, and a small fraction of that is treated as hazardous waste.\n\n## Biomass\n\nMost of the waste generated during the production of our solutions constitutes biomass. It has essential nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, making it ideal for supporting agricultural activities.\n\nIn 2022, 100% of our biomass was managed in a circular manner compared to 99% in 2021. We closed the gap by finding new partners to benefit from this waste stream. Our biomass waste is utilized as raw material in fertilizer production for agriculture with or without prior biogas production.\n\nThe weight of the biomass upon exit from our facilities varies depending on the site and the biosolutions produced there. In 2022, the total dry matter content for biomass used in agriculture was 53,000 tonnes.\n\n|                     | Biomass wet (actual)   | Biomass wet (actual)   | Biomass dry matter (excl. water)   | Biomass dry matter (excl. water)   |\n|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Biomass             |                        |                        |                                    |                                    |\n| 1,000 tonnes        | 2022                   | 2021                   | 2022                               | 2021                               |\n| Used in agriculture | 538.8                  | 463.5                  | 53.1                               | 5 50.5                             |\n| Landfill            | -                      | 2.4                    | -                                  | 1.4                                |\n| Biomass, total      | 538.8                  | 465.9                  | 53.1                               | 51.9                               |",

In 2022, the recycling rate of non-biomass waste was 63% compared with 62% in 2021. The remaining 37% of the waste was sent to landfill or incineration.\n\nThe increase of nonhazardous waste from 2021 to 2022 was mainly driven by product scrapping, with the majority of it being recycled.\n\nIn 2022, all of our sites* finalized developing programs to reach zero waste. Their implementation will guide our actions towards our zero-waste target in the coming years. To reduce, recycle, reuse and recover the waste generated, we identified site specific risks, opportunities and actions. Initiatives from these plans have been prioritized\n\n- *  The targets do not include sites with activities not considered to have a significant environmental impact, e.g. sales offices, R&D labs, etc.\n\nand implementation has started. We have also undertaken various initiatives such as process improvements, resource optimization, process planning and waste sorting in order to optimize waste management.\n\nAcross various regions, our employees have led initiatives to improve waste management. For example, at our site in Bangalore, India, we have initiated the process of converting food waste collected in our canteens to compost, which is distributed to employees for gardening.\n\nOur site in Blair, U.S., was presented with the Nebraska Recycling Council's 2022 Waste Diversion Award. The site was recognized for its strides towards our zero waste to landfill target, with biomass waste being diverted to land application, filter pads diverted to compost,\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nBiomass is measured or calculated based on volume or weight produced. At each site, biomass is produced with different dry matter to water ratio. The quantity of biomass dry matter is calculated based on spot checks of the dry matter content present in the wet biomass.\n\nNon-biomass waste is the registered volume of waste broken down into hazardous and nonhazardous waste, and by disposal method. The amount recycled is the quantity recycled internally or sent to an external service provider for recycling.\n\nrecyclables diverted to single stream recycling program and the orange bag program that helps recover non-recyclable plastics.\n\n## Circular Packaging\n\nIn 2022, we completed the development of nine plans to make our key packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable. Actions from these plans have been prioritized and implementation has started. Overall, we have strong processes to evaluate and introduce new enzymes packaging based on recyclability and reusability criteria.\n\nMoving forward, we will actively work towards introducing packaging made with less virgin plastics and we will continue implementing our circular packaging plans and further integrate them into our packaging strategy.",

As a biology-based business, we interact with nature and biodiversity over various stages of our research, development, innovation, operations and product use. From the establishment of our company, we have been analyzing microoganisms and fungi at a molecular level to create biosolutions that can help solve some of the world's biggest challenges with a special focus on climate, food systems and health.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes' approach to biodiversity is guided by the principles of the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity (U.N. CBD), including the Nagoya Protocol on access and benefits sharing. When we collect biological samples in nature, it is important that we always follow the local laws of the countries where we operate as well as complying with globally recognized principles on the utilization of genetic resources. We have defined systems and processes, guided by an internal CBD and Nagoya Protocol committee to ensure compliance with local and global regulations, guidelines and protocols.\n\nWe work closely with our stakeholders to ensure that guidance and requirements from regulatory authorities on biotech innovation are duly followed. We are committed to using scientifically sound tools and developing solutions that are safe to humans, animals and the environment.\n\nWe are fully aware of the need to constantly challenge ourselves to see not only the possibilities of our solutions, but also the potential negative impact we have on biodiversity as a company and the need to act on it. We also closely follow the development in this area and regularly assess how to incorporate best practice in our operations, products and reporting among other things through constant dialogue with relevant business groups and U.N. organizations.\n\n## 2022 summary\n\nIn 2022, we continued to closely monitor and participate in ongoing discussions and dialogues on nature and biodiversity loss across the globe. As an active member of multilateral organizations, we followed developments related to methodologies for companies to monitor and establish targets to prevent nature loss. We continued to be a part of the technical dialogue on biodiversity through industry and business groups such as the International Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIn December 2022, we attended the U.N. CBD COP 15 in Montreal, Canada as an observer to be a part of negotiations on the conservation of biological diversity, sustainable use of its components and fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the use of biodiversity. We welcome the outcomes of COP 15 and the creation of post2020 global biodiversity framework. We initiated the process of identifying the impact of global developments across Novozymes' operations and the organization as a whole. We are actively seeking opportunities to align our ambition and actions with the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, its 2050 vision and mission and its associated 2030 targets.\n\nWe also acknowledge the need for science-based tools to evaluate our net impact on biodiversity, so we can understand, track and act on the urgent need for change together with other companies and as a global society.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Product stewardship is a priority for our business given that many of our biosolutions serve as ingredients in consumer products such as detergents or are used to manufacture consumer products such as food, textiles, paper, livestock, and more recently, dietary supplements and cosmetics.\n\n## Our approach\n\nProduct stewardship is an integral part of Novozymes' Quality Management System, and our approach is outlined in our Quality and Product Safety Policy. Procedures ensuring product stewardship for customers and end-users are enforced globally and audited by an independent external body. We collaborate with our customers, suppliers, and various trade associations to drive product safety and stewardship.\n\nNovozymes has internal targets on product stewardship that guide our progress. We evaluate performance particularly in the areas of product safety and hazardous substance management.\n\nWe constantly strive to reduce risks for humans, animals and the environment.\n\nFor example, we seek to improve our products to ensure enzymes release a minimum amount of dust and prevent allergies. We also educate our employees and customers in safe handling of our products using multiple communication channels, such as safety data sheets, videos, posters, brochures and safety catalogues.\n\nWherever feasible, we substitute hazardous substances in our operations with safer alternatives. Through a rigorous and comprehensive crossfunctional process, new and existing chemicals are screened annually for human health and environmental safety aspects, followed by risk and feasibility assessments to determine candidates for potential phase-out from our products.\n\nTo make it easier for our customers to ensure compliance of their products, we have a structured approach to related topics such as product information and labeling, traceability, industrial biotechnology, REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals), FIAP (Food Improvement Agents Package) and animal testing. Novozymes is a leading REACH registrant and remains firmly committed to maintaining high-quality dossiers that document product safety and provide transparency.\n\n## 2022 summary\n\nFor the second year in a row, Novozymes was a recipient of the Safer Choice Partner of the Year award by the US Environmental Protection Agency. It recognizes companies whose products and ingredients meet or exceed specific safety criteria and thereby promote human health and environmental sustainability.\n\n## Product safety\n\nIn 2022, we improved our Safety Catalogue, an internal guidance tool on how our biosolutions can be safely used. For our microbial biosolutions, we launched our first safe-handling manual for customers with usage recommendations according to standards set by regulatory authorities and accepted industrial practice. It has now become easier and more intuitive for our employees and customers to find information on how to handle these products safely.\n\nWe launched our new cloud-based Regulatory Information Management System, which provides a common backbone for product stewardship activities across Regulatory Affairs by harmonizing our processes and enabling more digital collaboration internally and with customers and other external partners.\n\nHazardous substance management To address societal concerns and consumer demand for 'preservative free' products, in 2022, we successfully phased out preservatives from some of our enzymes products by completing their removal and/or substitution of with other formulation ingredients.\n\nIn 2022, many of our products in the textile and leather industries received OEKO-TEX\u00ae certification, which requires proving the absence of unwanted chemicals such as carcinogen, volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, organotin, flame retardants etc. This certification is key for our textile and leather customers to bring certified greener products to the market.\n\nGoing forward, we will focus on developing further safety guidance for our microbial products and collaborating with customers to further phase out prioritized substances of concern, such as titanium dioxide.",

Our People and Organization (P&O) function, together with leaders across Novozymes, are responsible for ensuring equal rights for all employees. We are committed to ensuring equal opportunities and avoiding discrimination based on age, sex, gender identity, race, national origin, ethnicity, disability, education, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs in our global organization.\n\nNovozymes is committed to providing a work environment where all individuals can work together free of any kind of harassment and discrimination. Novozymes recognizes and respects the right to form and join unions and associations and to bargain collectively. Our P&O function works together with the regional leadership to facilitate the fulfillment of these fundamental rights, particularly in countries with limited labor legislation.\n\nWe conduct regionally focused human rights impact assessments to identify and assess human rights risks and impacts in our business and supplier base. As human rights risks vary from region to region, this approach enables us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of human rights risks, our positioning, and the associated gaps within the respective regions.\n\nNovozymes respects human rights as defined by the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and has implemented them in our operational policies and procedures. We respect the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and, since 2001, we have been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact. Novozymes is also a signatory to the Women's Empowerment Principles. We publish an annual statement under the U.K. Modern Slavery Act.\n\n## 2022 summary\n\nLabor practices\n\nThe rate of employee turnover decreased to 11.4% from 11.8% in 2021. The rate of employee turnover is consistent with general developments in the labor market.\n\nIn 2022, we recorded a 2.6% rate of absence, compared to 2.2% in 2021. In both years, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic along with new legislations which require people to stay at home if they have been in contact with someone\n\nwho has tested positive for COVID-19 continues to impact the absence rate. The rate of absence has been broken down in the table below into grouped job categories.\n\n| Employee statistics                                                               |        | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Rate of employee turnover - retirement                                            | %      | 1.0    | 0.9    |\n| Rate of employee turnover - dismissal                                             | %      | 2.1    | 3.4    |\n| Rate of employee turnover - voluntary                                             | %      | 8.3    | 7.5    |\n| Rate of employee turnover, total                                                  | %      | 11.4   | 11.8   |\n| Rate of absence                                                                   |        |        |        |\n| Senior management, management, professional and  administrative                   | %      | 1.7    | 1.2    |\n| Skilled workers, laboratory technicians, other technicians and  process operators | %      | 4.1    | 3.6    |\n| All employees                                                                     | ESG  % | 2.6    | 2.2    |\n| Other employee statistics                                                         |        |        |        |\n| Average age                                                                       | years  | 41.9   | 42.0   |\n| Average seniority                                                                 | years  | 9.2    | 9.7    |\n| Number of expatriates                                                             | No.    | 18     | 23     |",

In 2021, we launched company-wide global training for all employees on non-discrimination and anti-harassment. In 2022, we made the training mandatory for all new employees, as part of their onboarding.\n\nEvery year we conduct regionally focused Human Rights Impact Assessments. In the past five years, we have completed assessments for India (2018), Europe (2019), The Americas (2020), China (2021) and the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa Region (2022).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAcross these regional assessments, we have identified no systematic human rights violations within our global operations. Isolated incidents regarding business integrity and harassment had appropriate mitigation measures. Going forward, we will continue to monitor human rights and take appropriate measures to close gaps and mitigate identified risks.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAbsence is defined as time lost due to an employee's illness, including leave, and occupational injuries and diseases. The rate of absence is calculated as the number of registered days of absence as a percentage of the total number of normal working days in one year, less vacation and public holidays.\n\nThe rate of employee turnover is calculated as employee turnover divided by the average number of permanent employees. Employee turnover is measured as the number of permanent employees leaving the Group during\n\nthe preceding year excluding employees at divested entities transferred to the acquiring company.\n\nAverage age and seniority are calculated as the sum of employees total age/seniority in whole years at the reporting date, divided by the number of employees.\n\nExpatriation refers to Novozymes employees temporary reassigned within Novozymes from the country of original employment for periods of more than six months.",

        "page_content": "## 8.2 Inclusion & diversity\n\nAcross Novozymes, employees bring together diverse and complementary skills, a spirit of collaboration and shared values to form a vibrant culture. Nurturing an inclusive and diverse organization where employees thrive is the foundation from which we can continue to bring the power of biotech to the world.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe are committed to nurture a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. By 2030, we aim to achieve gender balance across all professionals and in senior management. This means that, we will strive for a minimum of 45% women and 45% men across all professionals and in senior management. To deliver on our long-term ambition, we work with milestone targets. In 2022, we concluded our nonfinancial milestone target of Nurture Diversity Index and launched a new milestone target for 2025. We aim to achieve a minimum 35% women in senior management and of 45% women across all professionals by 2025.\n\nWe recognize that focusing on diversity of representation alone is not enough. For diverse teams to succeed, people need to feel that they are valued, respected, and have a sense of shared purpose, and thus we focus on inclusion.\n\nWe take a regional approach to develop and define programs based on local demographics, to address diversity dimensions beyond gender.\n\nAt Novozymes, we have a policy for diversity and equal opportunities, which applies to the entire workforce. Our People and Organization (P&O) function, together with regional leaders across Novozymes are responsible for ensuring equal opportunities and for promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I). Novozymes' Global Flexibility Policy acknowledges that our employees may have different needs at different phases of their lives, and to accommodate those needs, it is our intention as a company to offer as much flexibility for our employees as possible without compromising efficiency, company culture and wellbeing.\n\n## 2022 summary\n\nIn 2022, our senior management consisted of 214 employees of which 33% were women, a slight decrease compared to 34% in 2021.\n\nNevertheless, the gender diversity balance across all professionals improved to 43% women and 57% men compared to 41% women and 59% men in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, we achieved 86 on our Nurture Diversity Index, thus successfully meeting our target of 86.\n\nWe have engaged in various forums to learn about and promote DE&I such as the World Economic Forum in Davos and the Female Force 2025 Initiative by Egon Zehnder and Bain & Company to name a few.\n\nAcross our global organization, hiring managers and people leaders have access to material on how to strengthen diversity in recruitment (focusing on bias) along with addressing screening, interviewing and evaluating candidates.\n\nWe have different projects and initiatives to promote a diverse workforce at Novozymes. For example, in India, the Zym(H)ers club (Employee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResource Group) has continued nurturing women empowerment through inspiring 'Choose to Challenge' sessions by women leaders and sensitization on financial well-being. As a step towards inclusion in health care benefits, Novozymes India widened the scope by including LGBT partners under its existing medical coverage. Various infrastructural changes across India sites such as lactation rooms and pad care dispensers have been introduced to aid women's hygiene.\n\nAcross several of Novozymes' regions (North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East & Africa) we have conducted 'Unconscious Bias' training through which we aim to educate employees and help eliminate biases across the organization.\n\n| Gender diversity         |    | 2022   | 2022   | 2021   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------|----|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                          |    | Women  | Men    | Women  | Men    |\n| In senior management     | %  | 33     | 67     | 34     | 66     |\n| In management            | %  | 40     | 60     | 39     | 61     |\n| At professional levels   | %  | 45     | 55     | 44     | 56     |\n| Across all professionals | %  | 43     | 57     | 41     | 59     |",

Following the new Danish legislation, we are seeking to incorporate further leave policies supporting LGBTQ+ families. During the Copenhagen Pride Week, we raised the pride flag to show our support for the cause and our commitment to human rights, equity, diversity, and inclusion. In addition, we invited external speakers to give talks to our employees about different topics within diversity and inclusion to allow employees to broaden their understanding.\n\nIn North America, we launched one new Zymer Resource Group - voluntary employee-led group. In total, the four active resource groups in the region are building community, safe space and DE&I awareness throughout the organization. Likewise, in Latin America, the DE&I purpose has been communicated to all employees in the region. In 2022, we conducted training programs with managers on leadership challenges and rewards for managing an inclusive workplace.\n\nMoving forward, we will continue our regional specific approach and focus on being an inclusive and diverse organization.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nGender diversity in senior management measures the percentage of women and men in director positions or higher (i.e. director, vice president or executive vice president).\n\nGender diversity in management measures the percentage of women and men in middle management and specialist manager positions.\n\nGender diversity at professional levels measures the percentage of women and men in positions typically requiring an academic background or team lead positions.\n\nGender diversity across all professional levels, measures the percentage of women and men across professional, manager and senior leadership levels.\n\nAll of the above classicifications are based on internal job categories.\n\nNurture Diversity Index measures the ratio of women and international employees at both senior leadership and management level.

We want them to have a positive work-life synergy and bring out their best at work and beyond. This is crucial to our success as a business and for sustaining our reputation as a great place to work.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe are committed to a workplace where employees stay safe, thrive and grow. To deliver this long-term ambition, we work with milestone targets. In 2022, we concluded our nonfinancial milestone targets for 2022 on lost-time injury frequency, Zymer Spirit Index and Enable Learning, and we launched two new milestone targets for 2025. By 2025, we aim to achieve a three-year rolling average of occupational injuries with absence \u2264 1.5. In addition, by 2025, we aim to match the benchmark in our Thrive index score.\n\nTo support our culture, our People and Health & Safety Policies set the guidelines, and our employee survey serves as an important tool to track the organization disposition and support better team conversations focusing on how we work together at Novozymes.\n\nOur Health & Safety management system aims to ensure that robust safety processes, equipment, standards, tools and training are fully integrated into the way we work. Our global incident handling system CAPTURE enables us to anchor improvements, corrective actions, incidents, and inspections to work smarter, and implement targeted, theme-based safety initiatives. Injury prevention is a focal point for Novozymes, and our preventive programs for enzyme and biological safety benefit both employees and customers.\n\nOur global and regional well-being groups address local health and well-being challenges. Learning and development is a key managerial responsibility, with support from the People & Organization function.\n\n## 2022 summary\n\nIn 2022, we achieved a score of 83 on our Zymer Spirit Index (82 in 2021), showing that our employees are engaged and committed to our purpose and strategy. During the year, we focused on implementing our strategy and ensuring a clear direction for the future. We also conducted initiatives to nurture our culture, e.g. a global campaign in which employees engaged with our purpose. Employees across some of our regions were challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic and were\n\naffected by the war in Ukraine. Through regional crisis response teams, our leadership, and supporting functions at Novozymes, we helped employees manage these changes through clear communications and actions.\n\n## Safety\n\nIn 2022, we conducted several initiatives to support safety awareness, such as our global mandatory safety e-learning for all employees and multiple site and regional safety dialogues. We will continue to drive a safety culture, to ensure that a part of the daily routines in our organization and to\n\nproactively prevent injuries. Our three-year rolling average frequency of occupational injuries per million working hours was 1.5 (1.2 in 2021). Moving forward, we will continue to drive a safety culture, to ensure that safety behaviors are part of our organization and to proactively prevent injuries.\n\n## Well-being\n\nIn 2022, we launched a research-based e-learning team program that has had a considerable effect on important elements of mental well-being, such as limiting negative thoughts and reducing stress while fostering self-confidence.\n\n| Consequences of occupational injuries No.        | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Return to original job                           | 17     | 16     |\n| Return to a different job in the same department | -      | -      |\n| Out of work or early retirement                  | -      | 1      |\n| Case pending                                     | 3      | -      |\n| Occupational injuries with absence, total        | 20     | 17     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Occupational injuries                        |               |   2022 |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------|--------|--------|\n| Days of absence due to occupational injuries | No.           |  564   |  657   |\n| Frequency of occupational injuries           | working hours |    1.7 |    1.5 |",

It applies to all employees across the world and lays ground rules for conducting business with honesty and fairness in compliance with laws and recognized standards for responsible and ethical business practices.\n\nIt contains principles, which among other things underline Novozymes' zero tolerance position towards bribery and define clear rules for gifts and hospitality.\n\nAll employees have access to relevant guidance on business integrity and are encouraged to raise any concerns through the relevant grievance channels. In addition, Novozymes provides annual compliance training in business integrity and competition law, which is mandatory for employees in scope. It focuses on anti-corruption and it is based on questions raised during the year, including real-life case studies to ensure relevance and applicability. We also provide targeted training on an ad-hoc basis, depending on needs or risks detected or foreseen.\n\nWe have a Corporate Business Integrity Committee responsible for the oversight of business integrity matters across Novozymes. Members include executive and senior management representatives from both business and compliance functions. They meet on a regular basis to make strategic decisions, prioritizations and to follow up on the state of business integrity compliance and relevant initiatives.\n\nThe committee also engages with external advisors, when relevant for a thorough and qualified decision-making process.\n\nNovozymes works proactively to prevent, detect and respond to fraud, corruption and other business integrity violations. Novozymes has a global corporate whistleblower hotline which allows employees and external partners to report any concerns on illegal or unethical misconduct or other business integrity violations. The whistleblower hotline is supplemented by various internal reporting channels and screening activities. All allegations of fraud, corruption and other business integrity cases are thoroughly investigated. Substantiated violations lead to proportionate disciplinary sanctions for the parties involved and an internal review on compliance gaps or potential improvements of policies and procedures.\n\nNovozymes' responsibility for ensuring ethical business practices also extends to our business partners. Our third-party due diligence processes seek to ensure that our commercial partners conduct business with integrity and share our values regarding legal compliance.\n\n## 2022 summary\n\nThis year, our business integrity training was completed by 97% of our employees in scope, compared to 99% in 2021. The training provided a general reminder of the principles we abide by to mitigate the risk of bribery and corruption, with a particular focus on gifts and hospitality. In addition, our competition law compliance training in 2022 served as a general reminder of do's and don'ts and had a focus on competition law aspects associated with external communication.\n\nAs in previous years, Novozymes had no reported violations of competition law in 2022.\n\nAdvanced data analytics remains the main channel for revealing potential fraud. During 2022, investigations based on whistleblows and tipoffs decreased by nine cases compared to 2021. None of the substantiated cases had material business nor financial impact for the company. The increased threat from cybercrime did not led to an increase in the number of cybercrime cases in 2022.",

We provide them with information on our products, services and corporate policies, commitments, targets, and initiatives in a transparent manner.\n\nWe believe that getting feedback from our customers is crucial for determining our performance. It assists us in gauging customer expectations and driving improvements to our products and service offerings. We also gather feedback over the course of the year and rapidly respond to concerns and suggestions from customers as they arise.\n\n## 2022 summary\n\nThe Customer Satisfaction Survey resulted in a Net Promotor Score (NPS) of 69 in 2022, which was unchanged from 2021.

We believe we have a responsibility for the well-being of our communities we operate in and to invest strategically in programs that create value to society. We inspire each other to make change happen to deliver on our promise of better lives in a growing world, both inside and outside the workplace.\n\n## Our approach\n\nAs part of our strategy, we have ambitious targets to nurture a working environment that empowers employees to give back to the society and the nature that surrounds us. We encourage this by pledging 1% of our work time to community outreach activities that support community needs, help educate the next generation and enable our employees to live more sustainably.\n\nNovozymes' global community outreach initiative 'Inspire' is driven by passionate employees, who are encouraged to contribute to better lives via initiatives which they are enthusiastic about. All regions have 'Inspire' groups coordinating the local agenda in alignment with the regional leadership teams.\n\nFurther philanthropic contributions are done indirectly through our dividend payments to the Novo Nordisk Foundation - through Novo Holdings A/S -  which in 2022 held 26% of the shares in\n\nNovozymes (see The Novozymes Stock). The Novo Nordisk Foundation's objective is to support scientific, social and humanitarian purposes, and the Foundation contributes to communities in large scale through donations and impact investments.\n\n## 2022 summary\n\nEngaging with our local communities In response to the war in Ukraine, we are no longer accepting orders for our products by our Russian and Belarusian customers, and we have discontinued all sales and shipments of our products to Russia and Belarus. In addition, Novozymes supported refugees via multiple initiatives such as sponsoring four trucks for Red Cross' transportation of relief goods to the Romanian-Ukrainian borders and sponsoring two music teachers for one year to give classes to refugees.\n\nEmployees donated and helped to pack essential supplies for families impacted by the war in Ukraine, the floods in Australia and for other citizens in need in China and the United States.\n\nAround the world, employees engaged with local communities in many ways, including by collecting trash, planting trees and assisting with nucleic acid testing for Covid-19 diagnosis. For example, in India, we donated 40 refurbished and 30 new laptops to a shelter home and to the Government Polytechnic College for Women.\n\nHelping to educate the next generation In Brazil, employees have been actively supporting the NGO 'Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Acolhedor' on different social projects by helping children make fun experiments, giving lectures to teenagers on their career and job and acting as career mentors.\n\nIn Thailand, employees accumulated steps in a virtual donation run to help contribute to raising scholarships for students who are at risk of leaving school and missing out on an education.\n\nIn South Africa, employees volunteered time in a gardening activity to help uplift women and vulnerable children from underserved communities by teaching them about sustainability, food security, basic farming skills, in addition to donating the farming tools that were used in the activity.\n\nEmpowering employees to live more sustainably In India, we established infrastructure for bikes at our campuses to encourage more employees to ride a bike to work. Employees in China has also been encouraged to bike to work. At our Danish sites, employees challenged their habits to reduce their personal CO2 footprint by selecting reusable cups or bottles during the workday and biking to work instead of taking the car.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Agricultural raw materials are a major component of our production processes and having a responsible and secure supply of them is crucial to Novozymes' production.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes' sourcing department drives our supplier management and responsible sourcing program, anchored within Novozymes Operations, Supply and Quality function. Our approach to responsible sourcing is defined by our Responsible Purchasing Standards (RPS) and managed through our Supplier Performance Management (SPM) process and the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX) platform. Through the SPM process, Novozymes screens suppliers and classifies their risk based on spend, country and category. In case a supplier does not meet our assessment criteria, either an action plan is established, or an alternate supplier is identified. Novozymes uses the SEDEX to engage with suppliers and manage sustainability risks in our supply chain.\n\nNovozymes requires all contracted suppliers to comply with our RPS, as well as, when requested,\n\nto complete questionnaires and to accept visits and audits relevant for confirmation of compliance. Our requirements cover various ESG criteria including respect for human and labor rights, business ethics, employee health and safety and environmental stewardship. In addition, all our suppliers of directly sourced agricultural raw materials are required to adhere to our no-deforestation requirements and to have zero tolerance for land grabbing.\n\nResponsible sourcing is a key driver of Novozymes' journey towards becoming net-zero by 2050. In 2022, we advanced our ambition to source 100% renewable electricity by 2025, five years earlier than previously communicated. We have also committed to reducing our supply chain (scope 3) emissions by 35% by 2030 from a 2018 baseline. These targets are validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Furthermore, we recognize that the climate maturity of suppliers is critical to Novozymes' efforts to reduce emissions, and therefore we engage with suppliers on their own decarbonization efforts.\n\nFurther information on our science-based targets and net-zero roadmap is available in the Targets & Outlook section of this report.\n\n## 2022 summary\n\nIn 2022, Novozymes continued to expand the use of the SEDEX platform to enhance the transparency of our supply chain. We continued to onboard both high-risk and high-spend suppliers, identified by the results of the hotspot analysis conducted during the previous years.\n\nDuring 2022, to advance towards sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2025, we sourced 100% of electricity for our Hongda site in China from renewable sources. We are continuing to focus on progressing the existing renewable opportunities and identifying further long-term solutions. These initiatives require years of preparation.\n\nIn 2022, 82% of our overall electricity consumption came from renewable sources, and we are well on track to meet our target for 2025. During 2022, we identified key levers and reduction strategies that will drive decarbonization in our supply chain.\n\nAs a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), 100% of the palm-derived products we sourced in 2022 had RSPO's mass balance (MB) or Segregated (SG) certification.\n\nIn 2022, Novozymes commenced the process of receiving the RSPO supply chain (MB) certification in Denmark.\n\nThis year, we conducted global sustainability training for global category managers which focused on modern slavery and human rights. Furthermore, we also completed a Human Rights Impact assessment in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East & Africa region that covered our supplier base, as described in Note 8.1 Labor Practices & Human Rights.\n\nIn 2022, we undertook various responsible sourcing efforts that included increasing green certification requirements for our travel vendors, hotels, and conference venues. In Bangalore, India, we installed two 4-wheeler and three 2-wheeler electric vehicle charging stations to promote cleaner and energy efficient transport. In addition, at our sites in Denmark, we are sourcing organic produce, making efforts to reduce meat consumption and donating obsolete lab equipment to schools, universities and hospitals.\n\nMoving forward, we will implement our updated responsible sourcing strategy and further integrate our corporate nonfinancial commitments in our sourcing and supplier engagement processes.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information, environmental, social and governance data of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Environmental, Social and Governance Data. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and, where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This responsibility includes:\n\n- \u00b7 The preparing of the annual report in XHTML format;\n- \u00b7 The selection and application of appropriate iXBRL tags, including extensions to the ESEF taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for all financial information required to be tagged using judgment where necessary;\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring consistency between iXBRL tagged data and the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in human-readable format; and\n- \u00b7 For such internal control as Management determines necessary to enable the preparation of an annual report that is compliant with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation based on the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a report that includes our opinion. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\nTesting whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format;\n\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of the company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the Consolidated Financial Statements including notes;\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy; and\n- \u00b7 Reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of Novozymes A/S for the financial year January 1 to December 31, 2022 with the file name NOVOZYMES-202212-31-en.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nHellerup, January 26, 2023\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab CVR No 3377 1231\n\n## Lars Baungaard\n\nState Authorized Public Accountant mne23331\n\n## Michael Groth Hansen\n\nState Authorized Public Accountant mne33228",

For a description of the Group's accounting policies, please refer to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe accounting policies are unchanged from 2021, with the exception that subsequent measurement of investments in subsidiaries has been changed from previously following the equity method to now following the cost method. Management has reassessed the policy, and found cost price to be more appropriate as management evaluates the subsidiaries based on their ability to generate dividends.\n\nThe main effects of the policy change on the balance sheet at January 1, 2021 are that Equity has increased from DKK 9,891 million to DKK 10,063 million and Investments in subsidiaries has increased from DKK 7,157 million to DKK 7,574 million. The impact on the income statement for 2021 is an increase in income from subsidiaries from DKK 885 million to DKK 1,228 million.\n\nNo separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for Novozymes A/S; please refer to the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Recognition and measurement in general\n\nIncome is recognized in the income statement as earned.\n\nAll costs incurred in generating the year's revenue are also recognized in the income statement, including depreciation, amortization and impairment losses.\n\nValue adjustments of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortized cost are also recognized in the income statement.\n\nAssets are recognized in the balance sheet when it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the company and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. Liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet when they are considered probable and can be measured reliably. On initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at cost. Assets and liabilities are subsequently measured as described below for each item.\n\nThe recognition and measurement principles\n\ntake due account of predictable losses and risks occurring prior to the presentation of financial statements that confirm or refute the conditions prevailing at the reporting date.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nThe accounting policies for intangible fixed assets follow those of the Group with the exception of goodwill, which is amortized over a period of 10 years using the straight-line method.\n\nAn amount equal to the total capitalized development costs after tax is recognized under Equity in Reserve for development costs.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are recognized initially at cost and subsequently measured using the cost method. Dividends on investments in subsidiaries are recognized in the income statement of the Parent Company in the financial year in which the dividend is declared. If the carrying amount of an investment in a subsidiary exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets in the subsidiary's financial statements, or the dividend exceeds the total comprehensive income of the subsidiary in the period in which the dividend is declared, the carrying amount of the subsidiary is tested for impairment.\n\nShare-based payments granted to employees of the Company's subsidiaries are recognized as contributions to the investment in the respective subsidiaries.\n\nInvestments in associates are recognized initially at cost and subsequently measured using the equity method. If the equity of associates is negative and Novozymes A/S has a legal or constructive obligation to cover the their negative equity, a provision is recognized.\n\nShare purchase liabilities are obligations to invest in subsidiaries and are disclosed as a contractual obligation. The derivative embedded in the share purchase obligation is measured at fair value through the income statement.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe dividend proposed for the financial year is shown as a separate item under Equity.\n\n## Treasury stock\n\nTreasury stock is used to reduce the common stock and to hedge employees' exercise of granted stock awards and stock options.",

These risks and uncertainties may, among other things, include unexpected developments in i) the ability to develop and market new products; ii) the demand for Novozymes' products, market-driven price decreases, industry consolidation, and launches of competing products or disruptive technologies in Novozymes' core business areas; iii) the ability to protect and enforce the company's intellectual property rights; iv) significant litigation or breaches of contract; v) the materialization of the company's growth platforms; vi) political conditions, such as acceptance of enzymes produced by genetically modified organisms; vii) global economy and capital market conditions, including, but not limited to, currency exchange rates (USD/DKK and EUR/ DKK in particular, but not exclusively), interest rates and inflation; viii) significant price decreases for input and materials that compete with Novozymes' biological solutions. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of future developments or new information.",
