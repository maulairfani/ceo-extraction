Back then, our leadership team and I laid out a comprehensive strategy to strengthen and grow the firm: First, we would invest in our core businesses. Second, we would pursue four growth initiatives: asset management, wealth management, transaction banking and consumer banking. And third, we would run the firm more efficiently. In addition, for the first time, we set public, firmwide financial targets to help investors hold us accountable.\n\nIn February 2023, we took another step on our journey when we held our second Investor Day, and as I said then, it has certainly been an interesting three years. Back in January 2020, nobody would have imagined that just a few weeks later a pandemic would break out and there would be such disruption in the global economy. Even today, we're operating in an uncertain environment. The war in Ukraine has roiled energy markets, and an increase in inflation has triggered monetary tightening.\n\nBut through it all, we've stayed focused on shareholders, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished. Since our first Investor Day, our total shareholder return is 60 percent, outperforming our peer average meaningfully. 1 Our book value per share is up by nearly 40 percent, roughly twice that of our closest competitor. 1 Our earnings per share is up by over 40 percent. We've returned nearly $18 billion in capital to common shareholders. And our average returns over the past three years are in line with",

The same business mix that did so well in 2021 faced headwinds, such as low capital markets issuance activity and falling equity and fixed income asset prices. At the same time, we continued to make strategic investments in our acquisitions and technology that, though important to the firm's longterm strength, weighed on our financial performance in the short run.\n\nDespite those difficulties, we delivered for shareholders in 2022. Net revenues were $47.4 billion, net earnings were $11.3 billion and diluted earnings per common share were $30.06. ROE was 10.2 percent and ROTE 2 was 11.0 percent. We also grew our book value per share by 6.7 percent and continued to make significant progress on our strategic evolution. As a result, in a macro environment where equity issuance hit a nearly two-decade low, we performed better than we would have three years ago.\n\nIn the pages that follow, we lay out in detail the state of our franchise as well as the progress we've made in our businesses, and as you'll see, our strategy is a reflection of our purpose: We aspire to\n\n## Financial Performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNet revenues\n\n10.2 %\n\n$ 11.3 B\n\nNet earnings\n\n11.0 %\n\nROTE 2\n\n'Being exceptional is not a given, but we always learn and adapt.'\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nbe the world's most exceptional financial institution, united by our core values of partnership, client service, integrity and excellence.

I'm also fortunate to work with a leadership team that is laser-focused on executing our strategy: our president and chief operating officer, John Waldron; our chief financial officer, Denis Coleman; and our entire Management Committee.\n\nThe path ahead is never certain, and there will be plenty of challenges along the way, but we head into 2023 energized, excited and determined to deliver for shareholders.\n\n## One Goldman Sachs\n\nAt the heart of our strategy is a focus on clients. We believe that serving our clients exceptionally well will both strengthen our franchise and deliver returns for our shareholders. As a result, in 2019, we started a pilot program that we believed would help demonstrate that commitment: One Goldman Sachs .\n\nOne Goldman Sachs is now the organizational philosophy that underpins how we cover our clients in an increasingly complex world. It puts clients at the center of everything we do. It brings to bear our intellectual capital and expertise across all our businesses to serve our global client franchise in a more integrated and comprehensive manner.\n\n## Our Three Key Execution Priorities\n\n1\n\n2 and other fees in Asset & Wealth Management\n\n3\n\nMaximizing wallet share and growing financing activities in Global Banking & Markets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGrowing management\n\nToday, we have partners who are responsible for owning the entire firmwide relationship with One Goldman Sachs clients, and as part of that, they are responsible for building dedicated teams that bring together the relevant experts and thought leaders across the firm to serve the client. One Goldman Sachs is highly accretive to multiple parts of our business and, more importantly, it's highly accretive to our clients, who get the best of Goldman Sachs. One Goldman Sachs has expanded beyond a pilot program. We believe this ethos is applicable and extensible to a much broader set of clients.\n\n## Strategic Reorganization\n\nIn December 2022, building off our renewed commitment to client centricity, we reorganized the firm into three segments: 1) Global Banking & Markets; 2) Asset & Wealth Management; and 3) Platform Solutions, into which we have integrated two lines of businesses: Transaction banking and Consumer platforms, which consists of our consumer card partnerships and GreenSky. We saw this as the logical next step in our strategic journey to building a more durable firm that generates higher returns through the cycle.\n\nWe are now reporting our results under our new structure, and we have also announced three key execution priorities: 1) maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities in GBM; 2) growing management and other fees in AWM; and 3) scaling Platform Solutions to deliver profitability. We believe we're now well positioned to execute our strategy, capitalize on our strengths and achieve our execution priorities in all three of our segments.\n\nScaling Platform Solutions to deliver profitability",

We've been #1 in global completed M&A for 23 of the last 24 years, 3 and once again this year we were the advisor of choice. We were also #2 in equity and equity-related underwriting as well as in high-yield debt underwriting.\n\nAnd yet, over the past three years, we've seen significant growth. We've increased wallet share by 370 basis points. 4 We've increased our financing activities in FICC and Equities at a 16 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to more than $7 billion in net revenues for 2022. And we're now ranked in the top 3 with 77 of the top 100 institutional clients across FICC and Equities, up from a base of 51 at our first Investor Day. 5 We had a very good business and we've made it better.\n\nIn 2022, GBM generated revenues of $32.5 billion, a 12 percent decline from 2021, as significantly higher FICC net revenues were more than offset by a steep decline in Investment banking fees. Advisory net revenues, however, were $4.7 billion, the second highest in our history.\n\n## Asset & Wealth Management\n\nIn Asset & Wealth Management, we've taken several disparate businesses inside the firm and combined them into one powerful platform. Today, we are a top 5 global active asset manager 6 and a top 5 global alternatives manager 6 with a premier wealth management franchise. We now have more than $2.5 trillion in assets under supervision (AUS).\n\nWe had a record year in alternatives fundraising in 2022, with $72 billion raised across our franchise. Overall, we've raised nearly $180 billion since 2019, making real progress toward our revised target of $225 billion. Of that $72 billion in alternatives, $27 billion came through our wealth platform. And we now have loan penetration 7 with approximately 30 percent of our U.S. private wealth clients, leaving us plenty of room for growth. Our total client assets 8 in Wealth management stand at more than $1 trillion.\n\nIn 2022, our Asset & Wealth Management business generated net revenues of $13.4 billion, a 39 percent decline from 2021. A steep drop in the net revenues related to Equity and Debt investments offset an additional $1 billion of Management and other fees and a strong increase in Private banking and lending net revenues. Full-year Management and other fees were $8.8 billion, putting us well on track to hit our 2024 target of more than $10 billion.\n\n## Platform Solutions\n\nIn 2022, we decided to significantly narrow our ambitions for our consumer strategy.\n\nNow we have a smaller set of emerging businesses. We are working to drive them to profitability, and we're also considering strategic alternatives for our Consumer platforms.",

Compensation and benefits expenses fell by 15 percent, despite a 10 percent increase in headcount, and were largely offset by higher non-compensation expenses. The increase in non-compensation expenses was primarily related to acquisitions, transaction-based costs and continued investments in technology. In addition, client-related market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic. We remain highly focused on operating efficiency. We are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts as we look to appropriately calibrate the firm for the operating environment.\n\n## Balance Sheet\n\nOur balance sheet ended the year at $1.4 trillion, down by $114 billion versus the third quarter and relatively flat year over year as we focused on actively managing our resources. Deposits ended the year at $387 billion, up by approximately $23 billion year over year, reflecting growth in private bank and consumer deposits and transaction banking deposits. At the end of the fourth quarter, our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.0 percent, up by 80 basis points year over year. This represents a 120-basispoint buffer to our new capital requirement of 13.8 percent in the beginning of 2023. We returned $6.7 billion to common shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $3.5 billion and common stock dividends of $3.2 billion.\n\n## Focused on the Forward\n\nWe believe our strategy positions us well to meet our financial targets through the cycle. And, while in tougher environments we may not hit our return targets, our actions over the past several years have raised the floor of our returns, while retaining the upside in more conducive markets and lowering the overall volatility. Across all our businesses, we are focused on the forward.\n\nThe integration of our #1 Investment Banking franchise 9 with our leading FICC and Equities businesses positions Global Banking & Markets to continue delivering strong returns. Now we are focused on capturing share, particularly in favorable environments, while maintaining resource discipline. The size, breadth and diversity of our mix of activities have made revenues relatively stable over time. Our share gains and higher financing revenues over the past few years have further increased durability. This is a great business, and we are performing for clients at the highest level.\n\nIn Asset & Wealth Management, our franchise benefits from the Goldman Sachs ecosystem that gives clients access to a wide breadth of products and solutions as well as our unique market insight and expertise. We're focused on investment performance and client experience to drive a more durable revenue stream from fees and Private banking and lending. We are keeping ourselves accountable with our new medium-term targets on revenue growth, margin and ROE. This is the",

We believe these are attractive businesses that provide stable, more recurring revenue derived from net interest income and fees, and we offer innovative, tech-forward products for our end customers.\n\nFirmwide, we remain committed to delivering on our financial targets, and we are confident in our ability to do so, given the underlying strength of our franchise. In the past three years, our average ROE was 14.8 percent. This was in line with our targets and 320 basis points higher than the peer 10 average. And, if you exclude the impact of litigation in 2020, our average ROE would have been roughly 130 basis points higher.\n\nAs we look ahead, we are committed to making the firm more transparent and accountable to shareholders. This is just as important to us as our business level targets. We've made a conscious effort to be open and accessible, with enhanced disclosures, more frequent investor conferences and regular strategic updates. We've continued to lay out targets for our firm and our businesses, and we've provided robust disclosure of key performance indicators to measure our progress.\n\nWe returned $6.7 billion to common shareholders\n\nWe've also made important changes to better align employee incentives. All our Management Committee members receive 100 percent of their annual stock-based compensation in performance-based shares that are earned based on future results. This is intended specifically to enhance collaboration and align our entire leadership team with long-term shareholder value creation. Beyond that, many of our employees are shareholders as well. We are united in driving shareholder value.\n\n## Our People\n\nIn addition to serving our clients and delivering for shareholders, we're also focused on taking care of our people. We have a longstanding commitment to recruiting, developing and promoting the best talent available with the widest range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We have made headway with our diverse representation goals at the analyst, associate and vice president levels. We were proud that our 2022 partner class was the most diverse to date. That said, we still have much work to do to build and retain a pipeline of diverse leadership.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The 10,000 Women in-person business education program was launched in 2008, and in 2018, the curriculum was made available online through Coursera, further democratizing access. In 2014, in partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), 10,000 Women launched a first-of-its-kind global finance facility, the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility, to enable access to capital for more women entrepreneurs. As of March 2023, the facility had reached more than 164,000 women entrepreneurs, eclipsing the 100,000 target set when the initiative was launched, and contributing to an over $4.5 billion increase in the volume of loans on-lent by financial institutions to women-owned businesses. Overall, Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women has reached more than 200,000 women from over 150 countries.\n\nBuilding on what we learned from 10,000 Women , in 2009 we launched our signature entrepreneurship initiative, Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses . Today, the program has served more than 13,600 small businesses in all 50 states through our education program, and it has also partnered with select Community Development Financial Institutions to provide loans to small businesses. In 2020, we launched a new advocacy initiative, Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Business Voices , to help small business owners in the U.S. advocate for policy changes that matter to them. In July 2022, we brought together more than 2,500 entrepreneurs at our summit in Washington, D.C. - the largest gathering of its kind - to hear from top business leaders, devise new strategies for business growth and meet with more than 300 members of Congress to call for policy action, specifically to modernize and reauthorize the Small Business Administration for the first time in more than 20 years.\n\nIn 2021, we took what we had learned from both programs to launch our latest initiative, One Million Black Women . In the first two years, we've already seen progress and firmwide engagement. We've committed more than $1 billion of investment capital and more than $20 million in grant capital to 116 organizations, companies and projects, which puts us on track to directly impact the lives of more than 184,000 Black women and girls. Some examples include a growth equity investment in CareAcademy, a Black woman-led upskilling company; our Alternative Investment Management Black Equity Opportunities fund; and our people serving as executive coaches to Black women school principals through our partnership with New Leaders. From our experience, and with the guidance of our Advisory Council, we've learned that what we need most - more than good ideas - are partners. Only by combining our efforts can we hope to transform the economy we leave behind for the next generation.\n\n## Sustainable Finance\n\nAnother area where we've long been focused is sustainability. We have been a leading voice in the financial services industry addressing climate change and other critical environmental challenges going back to 2005, when we established our Environmental Policy Framework. In 2019, we set a target of $750 billion in financing, advisory and investing activity over the next 10 years across the themes of climate transition and inclusive growth. We have achieved approximately 55 percent of our target in three years. By connecting our experience as a financial institution with the insights gained through our work with clients and partners and our ongoing engagement with the public sector, we are enabling capital to move toward solutions that will help clients not only adapt but also take ownership to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. At the same time, we cannot address market gaps at scale on our own, so we continue to identify strategic partners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our own.",

We are dedicated to complying fully with the letter and spirit of the laws, rules and ethical principles that govern us. Our continued success depends upon unswerving adherence to this standard.\n\n## Our goal is to provide superior returns to our shareholders.\n\nProfitability is critical to achieving superior returns, building our capital, and attracting and keeping our best people. Significant employee stock ownership aligns the interests of our employees and our shareholders.\n\n## We take great pride in the professional quality of our work.\n\nWe have an uncompromising determination to achieve excellence in everything we undertake.\n\nThough we may be involved in a wide variety and heavy volume of activity, we would, if it came to a choice, rather be best than biggest.\n\n## We stress creativity and imagination in everything we do.\n\nWhile recognizing that the old way may still be the best way, we constantly strive to find a better solution to a client's problems. We pride ourselves on having pioneered many of the practices and techniques that have become standard in the industry.\n\n## We make an unusual effort to identify and recruit the very best person for every job.\n\nAlthough our activities are measured in billions of dollars, we select our people one by one. In a service business, we know that without the best people, we cannot be the best firm.\n\n## We offer our people the opportunity to move ahead more rapidly than is possible at most other places.\n\nAdvancement depends on merit and we have yet to find the limits to the responsibility our best people are able to assume. For us to be successful, our people must reflect the diversity of the communities and cultures in which we operate. That means we must attract, retain and motivate people from many backgrounds and perspectives. Being diverse is not optional; it is what we must be.\n\n## We stress teamwork in everything we do.\n\nWhile individual creativity is always encouraged, we have found that team effort often produces the best results. We have no room for those who put their personal interests ahead of the interests of the firm and its clients.\n\n## The dedication of our people to the firm and the intense effort they give their jobs are greater than one finds in most other organizations.\n\nWe think that this is an important part of our success.\n\n## We consider our size an asset that we try hard to preserve.\n\nWe want to be big enough to undertake the largest project that any of our clients could contemplate, yet small enough to maintain the loyalty, the intimacy and the esprit de corps that we all treasure and that contribute greatly to our success.\n\n## We constantly strive to anticipate the rapidly changing needs of our clients and to develop new services to meet those needs.\n\nWe know that the world of finance will not stand still and that complacency can lead to extinction.\n\n## We regularly receive confidential information as part of our normal client relationships.\n\nTo breach a confidence or to use confidential information improperly or carelessly would be unthinkable.\n\n## Our business is highly competitive, and we aggressively seek to expand our client relationships.\n\nHowever, we must always be fair competitors and must never denigrate other firms.\n\n## Integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business.\n\nWe expect our people to maintain high ethical standards in everything they do, both in their work for the firm and in their personal lives.\n\n15",

You should read the cautionary notes on forward-looking statements in our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2022.\n\n- 1 Data as of December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2019. Total shareholder return is sourced from Bloomberg. All other data is sourced from company filings. Peers include MS, JPM, BAC, C.\n- 2 ROTE is calculated by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly tangible common shareholders' equity. Tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated as total shareholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Management believes that ROTE is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally and that tangible common shareholders' equity is meaningful because it is a measure that the firm and investors use to assess capital adequacy. ROTE and tangible common shareholders' equity are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The table below presents a reconciliation of average common shareholders' equity to average tangible common shareholders' equity.\n\n)\n\n|                                      | Average for the Year Ended December   | Average for the Year Ended December   | Average for the Year Ended December   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| $ in millions                        | 2022                                  | 2021                                  | 2020                                  |\n| Total shareholders' equity           | $ 115,990                             | $ 101,705                             | $    91,779                           |\n| Preferred Stock                      | (10,703 )                             | (9,876 )                              | (11,203 )                             |\n| Common shareholders' equity          | 105,287                               | 91,829                                | 80,576                                |\n| Goodwill                             | (5,726 )                              | (4,327 )                              | (4,238                                |\n| Identifiable intangible assets       | (1,583 )                              | (536 )                                | (617 )                                |\n| Tangible common shareholders' equity | $    97,978                           | $    86,966                           | $    75,721                           |\n\n- 3 Source: Dealogic\n- 4 Revenue wallet share 2022 vs. 2019.

At times, we take the other side of transactions ourselves if a buyer or seller is not readily available, and at other times we connect our clients to other parties who want to transact. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our client relationships. Market makers provide liquidity and play a critical role in price discovery, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the capital markets. In connection with our market-making activities, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory).\n\nWe execute a high volume of transactions for our clients in large, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. Treasury securities, stocks and certain agency mortgage passthrough securities). We also execute transactions for our clients in less liquid markets (such as mid-cap corporate bonds, emerging market currencies and certain non-agency mortgage-backed securities) for spreads and fees that are generally somewhat larger than those charged in more liquid markets. Additionally, we structure and execute transactions involving customized or tailor-made products that address our clients' risk exposures, investment objectives or other complex needs, as well as derivative transactions related to client advisory and underwriting activities.\n\n2\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThrough our global sales force, we maintain relationships with our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment research, trading ideas, market information and analysis.

'Cash' refers to trading the underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or barrel of oil). 'Derivative' refers to instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors (such as an option, which is the right or obligation to buy or sell a certain bond, stock or other asset on a specified date in the future at a certain price, or an interest rate swap, which is the agreement to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating rate or vice versa).\n\nGlobal Banking & Markets generates revenues from the following:\n\nInvestment banking fees.

We invest heavily in developing and supporting our people throughout their careers, and we strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, high standards of business ethics, diversity, teamwork and cooperation among our employees worldwide.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion The strength of our culture, our ability to execute our strategy, and our relationships with clients all depend on a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment that encourages a wide range of perspectives. We believe that diversity at all levels of our organization, from entry-level analysts to senior management, as well as the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) is essential to our sustainability. As of December 2022, approximately 57% of our Board was diverse by race, gender or sexual orientation. Our management team works closely with our Global Inclusion and Diversity Committee to continue to increase diversity of our global workforce at all levels. In addition, we have Inclusion and Diversity Committees across regions, which promote an environment that values different perspectives, challenges conventional thinking and maximizes the potential of all our people.\n\nWe believe that increased diversity, including diversity of experience, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and veteran status, in addition to being a social imperative, is vital to our commercial success through the creativity that it fosters. For this reason, we have established a comprehensive action plan with aspirational diversity hiring and representation goals which are set forth below and are focused on cultivating an inclusive environment for all our colleagues.\n\nDiverse leadership is crucial to our long-term success and to driving innovation, and we have implemented and expanded outreach and career advancement programs for rising diverse executive talent. For example, we are focused on providing diverse vice presidents the necessary coaching, sponsorship and advocacy to support their career trajectories and strengthen their leadership platforms, including through programs, such as our Vice President Sponsorship Initiative focused on high-performing women, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian and LGBTQ+ vice presidents across the globe. Many other career development initiatives are aimed at fostering diverse talent at the analyst and associate level, including the Black Analyst and Associate Initiative, the Hispanic/Latinx Analyst Initiative and the Women's Career Strategies Initiative.

We offer our employees the opportunity to participate in ongoing educational offerings and periodic seminars facilitated by our Learning & Engagement team. To accelerate their integration into the firm and our culture, new hires have the opportunity to receive training before they start working and orientation programs with an emphasis on culture and networking, and nearly all employees participate in at least one training event each year. For our more senior employees, we provide guidance and training on how to manage people and projects effectively, exhibit strong leadership and exemplify our culture. We are also focused on developing a high performing, diverse leadership pipeline and career planning for our next generation of leaders. We maintain a variety of programs aimed at employees' professional growth and leadership development, including initiatives, such as our Vice President and Managing Director Leadership Acceleration Initiatives and Partner Development Initiative.\n\nEnhancing our people's experience of internal mobility is a key focus, as we believe that this will inspire employees, help retain top talent and create diverse experiences to build future leaders.\n\nAnother important part of instilling our culture is our employee performance review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees whom they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team approach and includes an evaluation of an employee's performance with respect to risk management, protecting our reputation, adherence to our code of conduct, compliance, and diversity and inclusion principles. Our approach to evaluating employee performance centers on providing robust, timely and actionable feedback that facilitates professional development. We have directed our managers, as leaders at the firm, to take an active coaching role with their teams. We have also implemented 'The Three Conversations at GS' through which managers establish goals with their team members at the start of the year, check in mid-year on progress and then close out the year with a conversation on performance against goals. We believe that our people value opportunities to contribute\n\nto their communities and that these opportunities enhance their job satisfaction. We also believe that being able to volunteer together with colleagues and support community organizations through completing local service projects strengthens our people's bond with us. Community TeamWorks, our signature volunteering initiative, enables our people to participate in high-impact, team-based volunteer opportunities, including projects coordinated with hundreds of nonprofit partner organizations worldwide. During 2022, our people volunteered approximately 86,000 hours of service globally through Community TeamWorks, with approximately 17,000 employees partnering with approximately 500 nonprofit organizations on approximately 1,200 community projects.\n\nWellness We recognize that for our people to be successful in the workplace they need support in their personal, as well as their professional, lives. We have created a strong support framework for wellness, which is intended to enable employees to better balance their roles at work and their responsibilities at home. We provide a number of policies for our employees that support taking time away from the office when needed, including 20 weeks of parental leave, family care leave and bereavement leave. In 2022, we also enhanced our vacation policies for our employees, allowing managing directors to take time off, when needed, without a fixed vacation day entitlement and adding a minimum of two additional vacation days for all other employees, as well as setting a minimum annual expected vacation usage of 15 days. For longer-tenured employees, we offer an unpaid sabbatical leave. We also continue to advance our resilience programs, offering our people a range of counseling, coaching, medical advisory and personal wellness services. We increased the availability of these resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, and continued to evolve and strengthen virtual offerings to enhance access to support, with the aim of maintaining the physical and mental wellbeing of our people, and enhancing their effectiveness and productivity.\n\nIn addition, to support the financial wellness of our employees, we offer a variety of resources that help them manage their personal financial health and decision-making, including financial education information sessions, live and on-demand webinars, articles and interactive digital tools.\n\n## Global Reach and Strategic Locations\n\nAs a firm with a global client base, we take a strategic approach to attracting, developing and managing a global workforce. Our clients are located worldwide and we are an active participant in financial markets around the world. As of December 2022, we had headcount of 48,500, offices in over 35 countries and 52% of our headcount was based in the Americas, 19% in EMEA and 29% in Asia. Our employees come from over 180 countries and speak more than 150 languages as of December 2022.\n\nIn addition to maintaining offices in major financial centers\n\naround the world, we have established key strategic locations, including in Bengaluru, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Singapore, Warsaw and Hyderabad. We continue to evaluate the expanded use of strategic locations, including cities in which we do not currently have a presence.

Our two priorities in this area are helping clients across industries decarbonize their businesses to support their transition to a low-carbon economy (Climate Transition) and to advance solutions that expand access, increase affordability, and drive outcomes to support sustainable economic growth (Inclusive Growth). Our strategy is to advance these two priorities through our work with our clients, and with strategic partners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our own, as well as through our supply chain.\n\nWe have established a Sustainable Finance Group, which serves as the centralized group that drives climate strategy and sustainability efforts across our firm, including commercial efforts alongside our businesses, to advance Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. We have also created the role of Global Head of Sustainability and Inclusive Growth, which, like our One Goldman Sachs initiative, is intended to facilitate the application of our full capabilities across both Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. Our sustainable finance-related efforts continue to evolve. For example, we recently launched the Sustainable Banking Group, a group focused on supporting our corporate clients in reducing their direct and indirect carbon emissions.\n\nOur activities relating to sustainability present both financial and nonfinancial risks, and we have processes for managing these risks, similar to the other risks we face. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities committees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability risks affecting us, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change-related risks. We have also implemented an Environmental Policy Framework to guide our overall approach to sustainability issues. We apply this Framework when evaluating transactions for environmental and social risks and impacts. Our employees also receive training with respect to environmental and social risks, including for sectors and industries that we believe have higher potential for these risks. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Other Risk Management - Climate Risk Management' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our climate risk management.\n\n8\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nAs a leading financial institution, we acknowledge the importance of Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth for our business. In February 2021, we issued our inaugural sustainability bond of $800 million, and in June 2022 we issued our second benchmark sustainability bond of $700 million. These issuances align with our sustainable finance framework for future issuances and fund a range of onbalance sheet sustainable finance activity. We believe we can advance sustainability by partnering with our clients across our businesses, including by developing new sustainabilitylinked financing solutions, offering strategic advice, or coinvesting alongside our clients in clean energy companies. We have announced a target to deploy $750 billion in sustainable financing, investing and advisory activity by the beginning of 2030. As of December 2022, we achieved approximately 55% of that goal, with the majority dedicated to Climate Transition.\n\nWith respect to Climate Transition, we have announced our commitment to align our financing activities with a net-zeroby-2050 pathway. In that context, we have set an initial set of targets for 2030 focused on three sectors - power, oil and gas, and auto manufacturing - where we see an opportunity to proactively engage our clients and investors, deploy capital required for transition, and invest in new commercial solutions to drive decarbonization in the real economy. Carbon neutrality is also a priority for the operation of our firm and our supply chain. In 2015, we achieved carbon neutrality in our operations and business travel, ahead of our 2020 goal announced in 2009. We have expanded our operational carbon commitment to include our supply chain, targeting net-zero carbon emissions by 2030.\n\nIn addition to Climate Transition, our approach to sustainability also centers on Inclusive Growth where we seek to drive solutions that expand access, increase affordability, and drive outcomes to advance sustainable economic growth. We have sponsored initiatives, such as One Million Black Women, Launch With GS, the Urban Investment Group, 10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses . An overarching theme of our sustainability strategy is promoting diversity and inclusion as an imperative for us, as well as for our clients and their boards. These efforts are further strengthened by strategic partnerships that we have established in areas where we have identified gaps or believe we are able to drive even greater impact through collaboration. We believe our ability to achieve our sustainability objectives is critically dependent on the strengths and talents of our people, and we recognize that our people are able to maximize their impact by collaborating in a diverse and inclusive work environment.

Our competitors provide investment banking, market-making and asset management services, private banking and lending, commercial lending, point-of-sale financing, credit cards, transaction banking, deposit-taking and other banking products and services, and make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. Our competitors include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, merchant banks, consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internet-based companies. Some of our competitors operate globally and others regionally, and we compete based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, client experience, products and services, innovation, reputation and price.\n\nWe have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments.\n\nConsolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To capitalize on some of our most significant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S.\n\nWe also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them.\n\nA number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking, market-making, consumer, wealth management and asset management businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for nonelectronic trading. It appears that this trend toward lowcommission trading will continue. Price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our market-making businesses. The increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies that typically have lower fees than other strategies we offer has affected the competitive and pricing dynamics for our asset management products and services. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution. We and other banks also compete for deposits on the basis of the rates we offer. Increases in short-term interest rates have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing.\n\nWe also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer, including cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that we cannot or may choose not to provide. Our competitors may also develop technology platforms that provide a better client experience.\n\nThe provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial regulations could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based banking organizations and give non-U.S.-based banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n9",

The impact of regulatory developments on our competitive position has depended and will continue to depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, the extent of international convergence, and the development of market practice and structures under the evolving regulatory regimes, as described further in 'Regulation' below.\n\nWe also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively has depended and will continue to depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB and other regulators inside and outside the U.S., including the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. We also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight.

GSBE is directly supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and additionally by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank in the context of the E.U. Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). GSBE's London branch is regulated by the FCA. GSBE engages in certain activities primarily in the E.U., including underwriting and market making in debt and equity securities and derivatives, investment, asset and wealth management services, deposittaking, lending (including securities lending), and financial advisory services. GSBE is also a primary dealer for government bonds issued by E.U. sovereigns. As a foreign bank subsidiary of GS Bank USA, GSBE is subject to limits on the nature and scope of its activities under the FRB's Regulation K, including limits on its underwriting and market making in equity securities based on GSBE's and/or GS Bank USA's capital.\n\nGSPIC is an investment firm regulated by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR) and the French Financial Markets Authority.

Banking Supervision and Regulation\n\n## The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter\n\nfor prudential bank regulation. However, the Basel Committee's standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules to implement its standards. The implications of Basel Committee standards and related regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally, and the market practices and structures that develop.\n\nCapital and Liquidity Requirements. We and GS Bank USA are subject to regulatory risk-based capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). The Capital Framework is largely based on the Basel Committee's framework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management of banks (Basel III) and also implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' tailoring framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to 'Category I' standards because we have been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). Accordingly, we and GS Bank USA are 'Advanced approach' banking organizations. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies.\n\nGSBE is subject to capital and liquidity requirements prescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation, as amended (CRR), and the E.U. Capital Requirements Directive, as amended (CRD), which are largely based on Basel III. The most recent amendments to the CRR and CRD (respectively, CRR II and CRD V) include changes to the liquidity, market risk, counterparty credit risk, large exposures and leverage ratio frameworks. These changes have been applicable in the E.U. since June 2021. From June 2022, the CRR requires large institutions with securities traded on a regulated market of a member state to make qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to environmental, social and governance risks on an annual basis. Under an E.U. proposal, these requirements would apply to our E.U.-regulated entities beginning in January 2025.\n\nGSI and GSIB are subject to the U.K. capital and liquidity frameworks, which are also largely based on Basel III and are predominantly aligned with the E.U. capital and liquidity frameworks. The most recent amendments to the U.K. frameworks include changes to the liquidity, counterparty credit risk, large exposures and leverage ratio frameworks.

As Advanced approach banking organizations, we and GS Bank USA calculate riskbased capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Both the Advanced Capital Rules and the Standardized Capital Rules include minimum risk-based capital requirements and additional capital conservation buffer requirements that must be satisfied solely with Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Failure to satisfy a buffer requirement in full would result in constraints on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints would depend on the amount of the shortfall and the organization's 'eligible retained income,' defined as the greater of (i) net income for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income; and (ii) the average of net income over the preceding four quarters. For Group Inc., the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), a stress capital buffer (SCB) (under the Standardized Capital Rules), and both a countercyclical buffer and the G-SIB surcharge (under both Capital Rules). For GS Bank USA, the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer.\n\nThe SCB is based on the results of the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests and our planned common stock dividends and is likely to change over time based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. See 'Stress Tests and Capital Planning' below. The countercyclical capital buffer is designed to counteract systemic vulnerabilities and currently applies only to banking organizations subject to Category I, II or III standards, including us and GS Bank USA. Several other national supervisors also require countercyclical capital buffers. The G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer applicable to us may change in the future, including due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes. As a result, the minimum capital ratios to which we are subject are likely to change over time.\n\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have a rule that implements the Basel Committee's standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures in connection with derivative contracts (SA-CCR). Under the rule, 'Advanced approach' banking organizations are required to use SA-CCR for calculating their standardized risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and, with some adjustments, for purposes of determining their supplementary leverage ratios (SLRs) discussed below.\n\n12\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe capital requirements applicable to GSBE, GSI and GSIB include both minimum requirements and buffers. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Management and Regulatory Capital' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10 -K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 -K for information about our capital ratios and those of GS Bank\n\nUSA, GSBE, GSI and GSIB.\n\nThe Basel Committee standards include guidelines for calculating incremental capital ratio requirements for banking institutions that are systemically significant from a domestic but not global perspective (D-SIBs). Depending on how these guidelines are implemented by national regulators, they may apply, among others, to certain subsidiaries of GSIBs. These guidelines are in addition to the framework for G-SIBs, but are more principles-based. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not designated any D-SIBs. The CRD and CRR provide that institutions that are systemically important at the E.U. or member state level, known as other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs), may be subject to additional capital ratio requirements, according to their degree of systemic importance (O-SII buffers). BaFin has identified GSBE as an O-SII in Germany and set an O-SII buffer.\n\nIn the U.K., the PRA has identified Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited (GSG UK), the parent company of GSI and GSIB, as an O-SII but has not applied an O-SII buffer.\n\nThe Basel Committee has finalized revisions to the framework for calculating capital requirements for market risk as part of its Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB). These revisions are expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations and large broker-dealers subject to bank capital requirements. The revised framework, among other things, revises the standardized and internal model-based approaches used to calculate market risk requirements and clarifies the scope of positions subject to market risk capital requirements. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators will have implemented the revised framework by January 1, 2023. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing the revised framework. Under the CRR, E.U. financial institutions, including GSBE, commenced reporting their market risk calculations under the revised framework in the third quarter of 2021. In November 2022, the PRA issued a consultation paper to implement this framework.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (Basel III Revisions). These standards set a floor on internally modeled capital requirements at a percentage of the capital requirements under the standardized approach. They also revise the Basel Committee's standardized and internal model-based approaches for credit risk, provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital and revise the frameworks for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators will have implemented these standards and that the new floor will be phased in through January 1, 2028. The U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities have not yet proposed rules implementing the Basel III Revisions for purposes of their risk-based capital ratios. The European Commission proposed rules to implement the Basel III Revisions in October 2021 and in November 2022, the Council of the E.U. adopted its general approach on implementing the Basel III revisions. The proposed E.U. rules contemplate amendments to the CRR and the CRD, referred to as CRR III and CRD VI, generally taking effect in January 2025. In November 2022, the PRA issued a consultation on the implementation of the Basel III Revisions, with a proposed January 2025 effective date. Under the PRA consultation, our U.K. subsidiaries are not expected to be subject to a floor on internally modeled capital requirements.\n\nThe Basel Committee has published an updated securitization framework and a revised G-SIB assessment methodology, but the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing them. The updated securitization framework has been implemented in the E.U. and U.K.\n\nIn December 2022, the Basel Committee published a final standard on the prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures. The Basel Committee contemplates that national regulators will have incorporated the standard into local capital requirements by January 1, 2025. U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and E.U. and U.K. authorities have not yet proposed rules implementing the standards.\n\nLeverage Ratios. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs established by the FRB. As a G-SIB, the SLR requirements applicable to us include both a minimum requirement and a buffer requirement, which operates in the same manner as the risk-based buffer requirements described above. In April 2018, the FRB and the OCC issued a proposed rule which would (i) replace the current 2% SLR buffer for G-SIBs, including us, with a buffer equal to 50% of their G-SIB surcharge and (ii) revise the 6% SLR requirement for Category I banks, such as GS Bank USA, to be 'well capitalized' with a requirement equal to 3% plus 50% of their parent's G-SIB surcharge. This proposal, together with the adopted rule requiring use of SA-CCR for purposes of calculating the SLR, would implement certain of the revisions to the leverage ratio framework published by the Basel Committee in December 2017.\n\nGSBE and certain of our U.K. entities are also subject to requirements relating to leverage ratios, which are generally\n\nbased on the Basel Committee leverage ratio standards. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Management and Regulatory Capital' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about our and GS Bank USA's Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs, and GSI's leverage ratio.\n\nLiquidity Ratios. The Basel Committee's framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).\n\nThe LCR rule issued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and applicable to both us and GS Bank USA is generally consistent with the Basel Committee's framework and is designed to ensure that a banking organization maintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. We and GS Bank USA are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. See 'Available Information' below and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management - Liquidity Regulatory Framework' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information about our average daily LCR.\n\nGSBE is subject to the LCR rule approved by the European Parliament and Council, and GSI and GSIB are subject to the rules approved by the U.K. regulatory authorities' LCR rules. These rules are generally consistent with the Basel Committee's framework.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to promote medium- and long-term stable funding of the assets and off-balance sheet activities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. The Basel Committee's NSFR framework requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%.\n\nWe are subject to the U.S. NSFR rule and we will be required\n\nto publicly disclose our quarterly average daily NSFR semiannually. We will begin doing so in August 2023. The CRR implements the NSFR for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSBE. The NSFR requirement implemented in the U.K. is applicable to both GSI and GSIB.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n13",

Although the liquidity requirement under these rules has some similarities to the LCR, it is a separate requirement. GSBE also has its own liquidity planning process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). GSI and GSIB have their own liquidity planning processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of the PRA's ILAAP.\n\nSee 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Overview and Structure of Risk Management' and 'Liquidity Risk Management - Liquidity Regulatory Framework' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information about the LCR and NSFR, as well as our risk management practices and liquidity.\n\nStress Tests and Capital Planning. The FRB's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) is designed to ensure that large BHCs, including us, have sufficient capital to permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. As required by the FRB, we perform an annual capital stress test and incorporate the results into an annual capital plan, which we submit to the FRB for review. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Management and Regulatory Capital - Capital Planning and Stress Testing Process' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10K for further information about our annual capital plan. As described in 'Available Information' below, summary results of the annual stress test are published on our website.\n\nAs part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions across a range of macroeconomic and company-specific assumptions, based on our and the FRB's own stress tests.\n\n14\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe FRB's rule applicable to BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including us, replaced the static 2.5% component of the capital conservation buffer required under the Standardized Capital Rules with the SCB. The SCB reflects stressed losses estimated under the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the CCAR stress tests, as calculated by the FRB, and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends. The SCB, which is subject to a 2.5% floor, is generally effective on October 1 of each year and remains in effect until October 1 of the following year, unless it is reset in connection with the resubmission of a capital plan. See 'Available Information' below and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Management and Regulatory Capital' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10 -K for information about our SCB requirement.\n\nThe SCB rule requires a BHC to receive the FRB's approval for any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit its capital plan, which may occur if the BHC determines there has been or will be a 'material change' in its risk profile, financial condition or corporate structure since the plan was last submitted, or if the FRB directs the BHC to revise and resubmit its capital plan.\n\nU.S. depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more that are subsidiaries of U.S. G-SIBs, such as GS Bank USA, are required to submit annual company-run stress test results to the FRB. GSBE also has its own capital and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In addition, GSI and GSIB have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the PRA's ICAAP guidelines.\n\nLimitations on the Payment of Dividends. U.S. federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by U.S. depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current year's net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity's undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus), unless the entity receives regulatory and stockholder approval. As a result of dividend payments from GS Bank USA to Group Inc. in connection with the acquisition of GSBE in July 2021, GS Bank USA cannot currently declare any dividends without regulatory approval.",

Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act requires BHCs to act as a source of strength to their U.S. bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the FRB at times when BHCs might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a BHC to a U.S. subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if a BHC commits to a U.S. federal banking agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRB's invoking its source-of-strength authority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the BHC.\n\nTransactions Between Affiliates. Transactions between GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries, including GSBE, and Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to restrictions under the Federal Reserve Act and regulations issued by the FRB. These laws and regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions (such as loans and other credit extensions, including credit exposure arising from resale agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions, from GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates and purchases of assets by GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries from Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may take place and generally require those transactions, to the extent permitted, to be on market terms or better to GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries. These laws and regulations generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. Similarly, German regulatory requirements provide that certain transactions between GSBE and GS Bank USA or its other affiliates, including Group Inc., must be on market terms and are subject to special internal approval requirements. PRA rules provide similar requirements for transactions between GSI and GSIB and their respective affiliates.\n\nResolution and Recovery Plans. We are required by the FRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). If these regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to remediate identified shortcomings in its resolution plan or that its resolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, they may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or may jointly order the institution to divest assets or operations, in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure. The FRB and FDIC require U.S. G-SIBs to submit resolution plans every two years (alternating between submissions of full plans and targeted plans that include only select information). We submitted our 2021 resolution plan, which was a targeted submission, in June 2021, and the FRB and FDIC did not identify any deficiencies or shortcomings. Our next required submission is a full submission by July 1, 2023. See 'Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory -The application of Group Inc.'s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.'s security holders' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K and 'Available Information' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about our resolution plan.\n\nWe are also required by the FRB to submit, on a periodic basis, a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that we could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress. Certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to similar recovery plan requirements.\n\nGS Bank USA is required to provide a resolution plan to the FDIC that must, among other things, demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities. GS Bank USA's most recent resolution plan was submitted in June 2018. In June 2021, the FDIC provided guidance on insured depository institution (IDI) resolution plans and divided IDIs with $100 billion or more in assets, including GS Bank USA, into two groups for purposes of the timing of resolution plan submissions. GS Bank USA is in the second group with a later submission date.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n15",

        "page_content": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules imposing restrictions on qualified financial contracts (QFCs) entered into by G-SIBs. The rules are intended to facilitate the orderly resolution of a failed G-SIB by limiting the ability of the G-SIB to enter into a QFC unless (i) the counterparty waives certain default rights in such contract arising upon the entry of the G -SIB or one of its affiliates into resolution, (ii) the contract does not contain enumerated prohibitions on the transfer of such contract and/or any related credit enhancement, and (iii) the counterparty agrees that the contract will be subject to the special resolution regimes set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act orderly liquidation authority (OLA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950 (FDIA), described below. GS Bank USA has achieved compliance by adhering to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA Universal Protocol) and International Swaps and Derivatives Association 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (U.S. ISDA Protocol) described below.\n\nCertain of our other subsidiaries also adhere to these protocols. The ISDA Universal Protocol imposes a stay on certain cross-default and early termination rights within standard ISDA derivative contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction, including a resolution under OLA or the FDIA in the U.S. The U.S. ISDA Protocol, which was based on the ISDA Universal Protocol, was created to allow market participants to comply with the final QFC rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies.\n\nThe E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), as amended by the BRRD II, establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of financial institutions in the E.U., such as GSBE. The BRRD provides national supervisory authorities with tools and powers to pre-emptively address potential financial crises in order to promote financial stability and minimize taxpayers' exposure to losses. The BRRD requires E.U. member states to grant certain resolution powers to national and, where relevant, E.U. resolution authorities, including the power to impose a temporary stay and to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in the E.U. must provide that contracts governed by non-E.U. law recognize those temporary stay and bail-in powers unless doing so would be impracticable. GSBE is under the direct authority of the Single Resolution Board for resolution planning. Regulatory authorities in the E.U. may require financial institutions in the E.U., including subsidiaries of non-E.U. groups, to submit recovery plans and to assist the relevant resolution authority in constructing resolution plans for the E.U. entities. GSBE's primary regulator with respect to recovery planning is the ECB, and it is also regulated by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank.\n\n16\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe U.K. Special Resolution Regime confers substantially the same powers on the Bank of England, as the U.K. resolution authority, and substantially the same requirements on U.K. financial institutions. Further, certain U.K. financial institutions, including GSI and GSIB, are required to meet the Bank of England's expectations contained in the U.K. Resolution Assessment Framework, including with respect to loss absorbency, contractual stays, operational continuity and funding in resolution. They are also required by the PRA to submit solvent wind-down plans on how they could be wound down in a stressed environment. The PRA is also the regulatory authority in the U.K. that supervises recovery planning, and GSI and GSIB are each required to submit recovery plans to the PRA.\n\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). The FRB's rule addresses U.S. implementation of the Financial Stability Board's (FSB's) TLAC principles and term sheet on minimum TLAC requirements for G-SIBs. The rule, among other things, establishes minimum TLAC requirements, establishes minimum requirements for 'eligible long-term debt' (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a maturity of at least one year from issuance and satisfies certain additional criteria) and caps the amount of parent company liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt.\n\nThe rule also prohibits a BHC that has been designated as a U.S. G-SIB from (i) guaranteeing subsidiaries' liabilities that are subject to early termination provisions if the BHC enters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding, subject to an exception for guarantees permitted by rules of the U.S. federal banking agencies imposing restrictions on QFCs; (ii) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries; (iii) issuing short-term debt to third parties; or (iv) entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with external counterparties.\n\nAdditionally, the rule caps, at 5% of the value of the parent company's eligible TLAC, the amount of unsecured noncontingent third-party liabilities that are not eligible longterm debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible long-term debt. The CRR, the BRRD and U.K. financial services regime are\n\ndesigned to, among other things, implement the FSB's minimum TLAC requirement for G-SIBs. For example, the CRR requires E.U. subsidiaries of a non-E.U. G-SIB that exceed the threshold of 5% of the G-SIB's RWAs, operating income or leverage exposure, such as GSBE, to meet internal TLAC requirements. Under the U.K. financial services regime, GSG UK exceeds the applicable thresholds and therefore, it is subject to internal TLAC requirements.",

        "page_content": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe CRD requires a non-E.U. group with more than \u20ac40 billion of assets in the E.U., such as us, to establish an E.U. intermediate holding company (E.U. IHC) by December 30, 2023 if it has, as in our case, two or more of certain types of E.U. financial institution subsidiaries, including brokerdealers and banks. A non-E.U. group may have two E.U. IHCs if a request for a second is approved. GSBE and GSPIC will be subject to the single E.U. IHC requirement unless an exemption is granted. The CRR requires E.U. IHCs to satisfy capital and liquidity requirements, a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), and certain other prudential requirements at a consolidated level. The U.K. has not implemented a similar requirement to establish an IHC; however, the PRA has introduced a requirement that certain U.K. financial holding companies or a designated U.K. group entity be responsible for the U.K. group's regulatory compliance. We have designated GSI for that responsibility.\n\nThe BRRD II and the U.K. resolution regime subject institutions to an MREL, which is generally consistent with the FSB's TLAC standard. GSI is required to maintain a minimum level of internal MREL and provide the Bank of England the right to exercise bail-in triggers over certain intercompany regulatory capital and senior debt instruments issued by GSI. These triggers enable the Bank of England to write down such instruments or convert such instruments to equity. The triggers can be exercised by the Bank of England if it determines that GSI has reached the point of nonviability and the FRB and the FDIC have not objected to the bail-in or if Group Inc. enters bankruptcy or similar proceedings. The Single Resolution Board's internal MREL requirements applicable to GSBE are required to be phased in through January 2024.\n\nInsolvency of a BHC or IDI. The Dodd-Frank Act created a resolution regime, OLA, for BHCs and their affiliates that are systemically important. Under OLA, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed non-bank subsidiaries if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things, that the institution is in default or in danger of default, that the institution's failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system and that resolution under OLA would avoid or mitigate those effects. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, then the\n\npowers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution, would be determined under OLA, and not under the bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under OLA are generally based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the FDIA, described below.\n\nSubstantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors' claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a 'bridge' entity. In addition, OLA limits the ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual crossdefaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership. The FDIC has issued a notice that it would likely resolve a failed FHC by transferring its assets to a 'bridge' holding company under its 'single point of entry' or 'SPOE' strategy pursuant to OLA.\n\nUnder the FDIA, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an IDI such as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has broad powers, including the power:\n\n- \u00b7 To transfer any of the IDI's assets and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly formed 'bridge' bank, without the approval of the depository institution's creditors;\n- \u00b7 To enforce the IDI's contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or\n- \u00b7 To repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the IDI is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the repudiation or disaffirmance of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the IDI.\n\nIn addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an IDI would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims, including deposits at non-U.S. branches and claims of debtholders of the IDI, in the 'liquidation or other resolution' of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the debtholders (other than depositors at U.S. branches) would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors at U.S. branches of GS Bank USA .\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n17",

The FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on IDIs. GS Bank USA's assessment (subject to adjustment by the FDIC) is currently based on its average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period, its supervisory ratings and specified forward-looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate. The deposits of GSBE are covered by the German statutory deposit protection program to the extent provided by law. In addition, GSBE has elected to participate in the German voluntary deposit protection program which provides insurance for certain eligible deposits not covered by the German statutory deposit program. Eligible deposits at GSIB and the London branch of GS Bank USA are covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to the applicable limits.\n\nIn October 2022, the FDIC adopted a rule applicable to all FDIC-insured banks that increased initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action. The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take 'prompt corrective action' in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks, such as GS Bank USA: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.\n\nAn institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, as described in 'Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC' above.\n\n18\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to BHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the BHC's depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances, relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary's capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the BHC, the guarantee would take priority over the BHC's general unsecured creditors, as described in 'Source of Strength' above.\n\nVolcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities. As a BHC, we are subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which we may engage.\n\nVolcker Rule. The Volcker Rule prohibits 'proprietary trading,' but permits activities such as underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record-keeping requirements.\n\nIn addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, 'covered funds' (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including us. It also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored and advised funds, similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates. Covered funds include our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to limit our investment in each such fund to 3% or less of the fund's net asset value, and to limit our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of our Tier 1 capital.\n\nThe FRB has granted our request for additional time until July 2023 to conform our investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy 'illiquid funds' (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 2013. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information about our investments in such funds.",

FHCs generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs. The broader range of permissible activities for FHCs includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non-FHCs (merchant banking activities). In addition, certain FHCs, including us, are permitted to engage in certain commodities activities in the U.S. that may otherwise be impermissible for BHCs, so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of their consolidated assets.\n\nThe FRB, however, has the authority to limit an FHC's ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible, and will likely do so if the FHC does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the FRB. For example, if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements, as well as additional limitations or conditions. If the deficiencies persist, the FHC may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities.\n\nIf any IDI subsidiary of an FHC fails to maintain at least a 'satisfactory' rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the FHC would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions.\n\nIn addition, we are required to obtain prior FRB approval before certain acquisitions and before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the U.S.\n\nU.S. G-SIBs, like us, are also required to comply with a rule regarding single counterparty credit limits, which imposes more stringent requirements for credit exposures among major financial institutions.\n\nThe New York State banking law imposes lending limits (which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions) and other requirements that could impact the manner and scope of GS Bank USA's activities. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued\n\nguidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk management frameworks and that outlines high-level principles for safe-and-sound leveraged lending, including underwriting standards, valuation and stress testing. This guidance has, among other things, limited the percentage amount of debt that can be included in certain transactions.\n\nAs a German credit institution, GSBE will become subject to Volcker Rule-type prohibitions under German banking law and regulations on December 31, 2023 because its financial assets exceeded certain thresholds. Prohibited activities include (i) proprietary trading, (ii) high-frequency trading at a German trading venue, and (iii) lending and guarantee businesses with German hedge funds, German funds of hedge funds or any non-German substantially leveraged alternative investment funds, unless an exclusion or an exemption applies. See 'Volcker Rule' above for further information.\n\nU.K. banks that have over \u00a325 billion of core retail deposits are required to separate their retail banking services from their investment and international banking activities, commonly known as 'ring-fencing.'

The SEC proposed establishing a broker-dealer best execution standard, which would require broker-dealers to use reasonable diligence to ascertain the best market for a customer order so that the resultant price to the customer is as favorable as possible under prevailing market conditions. The best execution standard applies to all securities and supplements, but does not replace, the existing FINRA and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) best execution rules. The SEC also proposed, among other things, to require that individual investor orders routed through broker-dealers be exposed to order-by-order competition in qualified auctions; to update the minimum pricing increments, with variable price increments based on the trading characteristics of stocks; and to revise and expand reporting and disclosure requirements relating to execution quality.\n\nIn January 2023, the SEC proposed a rule that would prohibit participants involved in the creation of asset-backed securities, including any underwriter, placement agent, initial purchaser or sponsor of an asset-backed security (or any affiliate or subsidiary), from engaging in any transaction that would involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the securitization participant and an investor in an asset-backed security, including reducing its exposure to the asset-backed securities, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nThe SEC, FINRA and regulators in various non-U.S. jurisdictions have imposed both conduct-based and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts and may impose additional regulations.\n\nGS&Co. and other U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to rules adopted by U.S. federal agencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that require any person who organizes or initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain a portion (generally, at least five percent) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a third party. For certain securitization transactions, retention by third-party purchasers may satisfy this requirement.\n\nIn\n\nEurope, we provide broker-dealer services, including\n\nthrough GSBE, GSPIC and GSI, that are subject to oversight by European and national regulators. These services are regulated in accordance with E.U., U.K. and other national laws and regulations. These laws require, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy and liquidity standards, customer protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules. Certain of our European subsidiaries are also regulated by the securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members.\n\n20\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nIn the E.U. and the U.K., the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) established trading venue categories for the purposes of discharging the obligation to trade OTC derivatives on a trading platform, enhanced preand post-trade transparency covering a wide range of financial instruments, placed volume caps on non-transparent liquidity trading for equities trading venues, limited the use of broker-dealer equities crossing networks and created a regime for systematic internalizers, which are investment firms that execute client equity transactions outside a trading venue. Additional control requirements apply to algorithmic trading, high frequency trading and direct electronic access. Commodities trading firms are required to calculate their positions and adhere to specific position limits. MiFID II also requires enhanced transaction reporting, the publication of best execution data by investment firms and trading venues, transparency on costs and charges of service to investors, restrictions on the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research, rules limiting the payment and receipt of soft commissions and other forms of inducements, and mandatory unbundling for broker-dealers between execution and other major services. Certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, including GSBE and GSI, are subject to risk retention requirements in connection with securitization activities.\n\nGSJCL, our regulated Japanese broker-dealer, is subject to capital requirements imposed by Japan's Financial Services Agency.

        "page_content": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nSwaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation The commodity futures, commodity options and swaps industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the regulation of security-based swaps. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern commodity futures, commodity options and swaps activities.\n\nThe terms 'swaps' and 'security-based swaps' include a wide variety of derivative instruments in addition to those conventionally referred to as swaps (including certain forward contracts and options), and relate to a wide variety of underlying assets or obligations, including currencies, commodities, interest or other monetary rates, yields, indices, securities, credit events, loans and other financial obligations.\n\nCFTC rules require registration of swap dealers, mandatory clearing and execution of interest rate and credit default swaps and real-time public reporting and adherence to business conduct standards for all in-scope swaps. A number of these requirements, particularly those regarding recordkeeping and reporting, also apply to transactions that do not involve a registered swap dealer. GS&Co. and other subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, GSBE, GSI and J. Aron, are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. The CFTC has rules establishing capital requirements for swap dealers that are not subject to the capital rules of a prudential regulator, such as the FRB. The CFTC also has financial reporting requirements for covered swap entities and capital rules for CFTC-registered futures commission merchants that provide explicit capital requirements for proprietary positions in swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared by a clearing organization. Certain of our registered swap dealers, including J. Aron, are subject to the CFTC's capital requirements.\n\nOur affiliates registered as swap dealers are subject to the margin rules issued by the CFTC (in the case of our non-bank swap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA and GSBE). Inter-affiliate transactions under the CFTC and FRB margin rules are generally exempt from initial margin requirements.\n\nSEC rules govern the registration and regulation of securitybased swap dealers. Security-based swaps are defined as swaps on single securities, single loans or narrow-based baskets or indices of securities. The SEC has adopted a number of rules for security-based swap dealers, including (i) capital, margin and segregation requirements; (ii) recordkeeping, financial reporting and notification requirements; (iii) business conduct standards; (iv) regulatory and public trade reporting; and (v) the application of risk mitigation techniques to uncleared portfolios of security-based swaps. Certain of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co., GS Bank USA and GSBE, are registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers and subject to the SEC's regulations regarding security-based swaps. The SEC has proposed additional regulations regarding security-based swaps that would, among other things, require public reporting of large positions in security-based swaps.\n\nGS Bank USA is also subject to the FRB's swaps margin rules. These rules require the exchange of initial and variation margin in connection with transactions in swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared through a registered or exempt clearinghouse. GS Bank USA is required to post and collect margin in connection with transactions with swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants and major security-based swap participants, or financial end users.\n\nThe CFTC and the SEC have adopted rules relating to crossborder regulation of swaps and securities-based swaps, and business conduct and registration requirements. The CFTC and the SEC have entered into agreements with certain nonU.S. regulators regarding the cross-border regulation of derivatives and the mutual recognition of cross-border execution facilities and clearinghouses, and have approved substituted compliance with certain non-U.S. regulations related to certain business conduct requirements and margin rules. The U.S. prudential regulators have not yet made a determination with respect to substituted compliance for transactions subject to non-U.S. margin rules.\n\nSimilar types of regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in the E.U. and Japan. Under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), for example, the E.U. and the U.K. have established regulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared derivatives activities. In addition, under the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation, transactions in certain types of derivatives are required to be executed on regulated platforms or exchanges.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n21",

        "page_content": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe FSB has released standards for implementation by local regulators that are designed to encourage sound compensation practices at banks and other financial companies. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have also provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization's supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also notes that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB and SEC, to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets. The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized. In October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule requiring securities exchanges to adopt rules mandating, in the case of a restatement, the recovery or 'clawback' of excess incentive-based compensation paid to current or former executive officers and requiring listed issuers to disclose any recovery analysis where recovery is triggered by a restatement.\n\nThe NYDFS' guidance emphasizes that any incentive compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators at banking institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, must be subject to effective risk management, oversight and control. In the E.U., certain provisions in the CRR and CRD are\n\ndesigned to meet the FSB's compensation standards. These provisions limit the ratio of variable to fixed compensation of all employees at GSBE and of certain employees at our other operating subsidiaries in the E.U., including those employees identified as having a material impact on the risk profile of regulated entities. CRR II and CRD V amended certain aspects of these rules, including, by increasing minimum variable compensation deferral periods. Substantially similar requirements apply in the U.K. in relation to GSI and GSIB. The E.U. and the U.K. have each also introduced investment\n\nfirm regimes, including rules regulating compensation for certain persons providing services to certain investment funds.\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and\n\nRegulations The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, as amended (BSA), including by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and authorizes or mandates the promulgation of various regulations applicable to financial institutions, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through these and other provisions, the BSA seeks, among other things, to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which amends the BSA, is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to antimoney laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for testing technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA violations; and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury has issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy, as required under the AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing.\n\nWe are subject to other laws and regulations worldwide relating to anti-money laundering and financial transparency, including the E.U. Anti-Money Laundering Directives. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and other laws and regulations worldwide regarding corrupt and illegal payments, or providing anything of value, for the benefit of government officials and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad. These laws and regulations include requirements relating to the identification of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, monitoring direct and indirect payments to politically exposed persons, providing information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and sharing information with other financial institutions.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n23",

Among other things, the CCPA imposes compliance obligations with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In addition, several other states and non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted, or are proposing, privacy and data protection laws similar to the GDPR and the CCPA. Furthermore, the GDPR has heightened our privacy compliance obligations, impacted certain of our businesses' collection, processing and retention of personal data and imposed strict standards for reporting data breaches. The GDPR also provides for significant penalties for non-compliance. The PIPL limits the legal bases for processing personal information, contains heightened notice and consent requirements for the handling of certain types of personal information and imposes special crossborder data transfer rules under certain circumstances.\n\nOur businesses are also subject to laws and regulations governing cybersecurity and related risks, and which require regulatory disclosures of certain security incidents.

Many of our businesses, by their nature, do not produce predictable earnings, and all of our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally, both directly and through their impact on client activity levels and creditworthiness. These conditions can change suddenly and negatively.\n\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth, regulatory and market conditions that result in transparent, liquid and efficient capital markets, low inflation, business, consumer and investor confidence, stable geopolitical conditions and strong business earnings.\n\nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: low levels of or declines in economic growth, business activity or investor, business or consumer confidence; concerns over a potential recession; changes in consumer spending or borrowing patterns; pandemics; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest rates, exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates; high levels of inflation or stagflation; concerns about sovereign defaults; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy, government shutdowns, debt ceilings or funding; the extent of and uncertainty about potential increases in tax rates and other regulatory changes; limitations on international trade and travel; laws and regulations that limit trading in, or the issuance of, securities of issuers outside their domestic markets; outbreaks of domestic or international tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cybersecurity threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication, energy transmission or transportation networks or other geopolitical instability or uncertainty; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets; extreme weather events or other natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. The financial services industry and the securities and other\n\nfinancial markets have been materially and adversely affected in the past by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes, by a serious lack of liquidity and by high levels of borrower defaults. In addition, concerns about actual or potential increases in interest rates, inflation and other borrowing costs, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, European sovereign debt risk and its impact on the European banking system, and limitations on international trade, have, at times, negatively impacted the levels of client activity.

        "page_content": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nGeneral uncertainty about economic, political and market activities, and the scope, timing and impact of regulatory reform, as well as weak consumer, investor and CEO confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty, has in the past negatively impacted client activity, which can adversely affect many of our businesses. Periods of low volatility and periods of high volatility combined with a lack of liquidity, have at times had an unfavorable impact on our\n\nmarket-making businesses. Changes, or proposed changes, to U.S. international trade and investment policies, particularly with important trading partners, have in recent years negatively impacted financial markets. Continued or escalating tensions may result in further actions taken by the U.S. or other countries that could disrupt international trade and investment and adversely affect financial markets. Those actions could include, among others, the implementation of sanctions, tariffs or foreign exchange measures, the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury securities or other restrictions on cross-border trade, investment, or transfer of information or technology. Any such developments could adversely affect our or our clients' businesses.\n\nFinancial institution returns may be negatively impacted by increased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceived government support of such institutions in the event of future financial crises relative to financial institutions in countries in which governmental support is maintained. In addition, liquidity in the financial markets has in the past been, and could in the future be, negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures adjust to evolving regulatory frameworks.\n\nIn January 2023, the outstanding debt of the U.S. reached its statutory limit and the U.S. Treasury Department commenced taking extraordinary measures to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its obligations. If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling, the U.S. could default on its obligations, including Treasury securities that play an integral role in financial markets. A default by the U.S. could result in unprecedented market volatility and illiquidity, heightened operational risks relating to the clearance and settlement of transactions, margin and other disputes with clients and counterparties, an adverse impact to investors including money market funds that invest in U.S. Treasuries, downgrades in the U.S. credit rating, further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs and a recession in the U.S. or other economies. Even if the U.S. does not default, continued uncertainty relating to the debt ceiling could result in downgrades of the U.S. credit rating, which could adversely affect market conditions, lead to margin disputes, further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs and necessitate significant operational changes among market participants, including us. A downgrade of the federal government's credit rating could also materially and adversely affect the market for repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and lending, and other financings typically collateralized by U.S. Treasury or agency obligations. Further, the fair value, liquidity and credit ratings of securities issued by, or other obligations of, agencies of the U.S. government or related to the U.S. government or its agencies, as well as municipal bonds could be similarly adversely affected.\n\n30\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by declining asset values, particularly where we have net 'long' positions, receive fees based on the value of assets managed, or\n\nreceive or post collateral. Many of our businesses have net 'long' positions in debt securities, loans, derivatives, mortgages, equities (including private equity and real estate) and most other asset classes. These include positions we take when we act as a principal to facilitate our clients' activities, including our exchange-based market-making activities, or commit large amounts of capital to maintain positions in interest rate and credit products, as well as through our currencies, commodities, equities and mortgage-related activities. In addition, we invest in similar asset classes. Substantially all of our investing and marketmaking positions and a portion of our loans are marked-tomarket on a daily or other periodic basis and declines in asset values directly and promptly impact our earnings, unless we have effectively 'hedged' our exposures to those declines.\n\nIn certain circumstances (particularly in the case of credit products, including leveraged loans, and private equities or other securities that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets), it may not be possible or economic to hedge our exposures and to the extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the assets. Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated, and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate, the trading markets for certain assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. We may incur losses from time to time as trading markets deteriorate or cease to function, including with respect to loan commitments we have made or securities offerings we have underwritten. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets has in the past negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, our capital, liquidity or leverage ratios, our funding costs and our ability to deploy capital.\n\nIn our exchange-based market-making activities, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing securities in a declining market. In markets where asset values are declining and in volatile markets, this results in losses and an increased need for liquidity. We receive asset-based management fees based on the value\n\nof our clients' portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values would ordinarily reduce the value of our clients' portfolios or fund assets, which in turn would typically reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets.",

        "page_content": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nWe post collateral to support our obligations and receive collateral that supports the obligations of our clients and counterparties. When the value of the assets posted as collateral or the credit ratings of the party posting collateral decline, the party posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral or, if possible, reduce its trading position. An example of such a situation is a 'margin call' in connection with a brokerage account. Therefore, declines in the value of asset classes used as collateral mean that either the cost of funding positions is increased or the size of positions is decreased. If we are the party providing collateral, this can increase our costs and reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving collateral, this can also reduce our profitability by reducing the level of business done with our clients and counterparties.\n\nIn addition, volatile or less liquid markets increase the difficulty of valuing assets, which can lead to costly and timeconsuming disputes over asset values and the level of required collateral, as well as increased credit risk to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate collateral. In cases where we foreclose on collateral, sudden declines in the value or liquidity of the collateral have in the past resulted in and may in the future, despite credit monitoring, overcollateralization, the ability to call for additional collateral or the ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation, result in significant losses to us, especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that the foreclosure was not permitted under the legal documents, was conducted in an improper manner, including in violation of law, or caused a client or counterparty to go out of business.\n\n## Our market-making activities have been and may in the future be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility.\n\nCertain of our market-making activities depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities to our clients, and decreases in volatility have reduced and may in the future reduce these opportunities and the level of client activity associated with them and adversely affect the results of these activities. Increased volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads, also increases risk as measured by Value-at-Risk (VaR) and may expose us to increased risks in connection with our market-making activities or may cause us to reduce our inventory in order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting the size of our market-making positions can adversely affect our profitability. In periods when volatility is increasing, but asset values are declining significantly, it may not be possible to sell assets at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts. In those circumstances, we have been and may in the future be forced to either take on additional risk or to realize losses in order to decrease our VaR. In addition, increases in volatility increase the level of our RWAs, which increases our capital requirements.\n\nOur investment banking, client intermediation, asset management and wealth management businesses have been adversely affected and may in the future be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and CEOs due to declines in economic activity and other unfavorable\n\neconomic, geopolitical or market conditions. Our investment banking business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by market conditions. Poor economic conditions and other uncertain geopolitical conditions may adversely affect and have in the past adversely affected investor and CEO confidence, resulting in significant industry-wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and of advisory transactions, which would likely have an adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins. In particular, because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues is derived from our participation in large transactions, a decline in the number of large transactions has in the past and would in the future adversely affect our investment banking business. Similarly, in recent years, cross-border initial public offerings and other securities offerings have accounted for a significant proportion of new issuance activity. Legislative, regulatory or other changes that limit trading in, or the issuance of, securities outside the issuers' domestic markets, that result in or could result in the delisting or removal of securities from exchanges or indices, have in the past adversely affected and would in the future adversely affect our underwriting and client intermediation businesses. Furthermore, changes, or proposed changes, to international trade and investment policies of the U.S. and other countries could negatively affect market activity levels and our revenues.\n\nIn certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general declines in market or economic activity may adversely affect our client intermediation businesses by decreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing volatility, but at other times market uncertainty and even declining economic activity may result in higher trading volumes or higher spreads or both.\n\nMarket uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions, as well as declines in asset values, may cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues, principally in our asset management and wealth management businesses. Even if clients do not withdraw their funds, they may invest them in products that generate less fee income.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n31",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nOur asset management and wealth management businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the poor investment performance of our investment products or a client preference for products other than those which we\n\noffer or for products that generate lower fees. Poor investment returns in our asset management and wealth management businesses, due to either general market conditions or underperformance (relative to our competitors or to benchmarks) by funds or accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or sell, affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients. This could affect the management and incentive fees that we earn on AUS or the commissions and net spreads that we earn for selling other investment products, such as structured notes or derivatives. To the extent that our clients choose to invest in products that we do not currently offer, we will suffer outflows and a loss of management fees. Further, if, due to changes in investor sentiment or the relative performance of certain asset classes or otherwise, clients continue to invest in products that generate lower fees (e.g., passively managed or fixed income products), our average effective management fee would continue to decline and our asset management and wealth management businesses could be adversely affected.\n\n## Inflation has had, and could continue to have, a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nInflationary pressures have affected economies, financial markets and market participants worldwide. Inflationary pressures have increased certain of our operating expenses, and have adversely affected consumer sentiment and CEO confidence. Central bank responses to inflationary pressures have also resulted in higher market interest rates, which, in turn, have contributed to lower activity levels across financial markets, in particular for debt underwriting transactions and mortgage originations, and resulted in lower values for certain financial assets which have adversely affected our equity and debt investments. Higher interest rates increase our borrowing costs and have required us to increase interest paid on our deposits. If inflationary pressures persist, our expenses may increase further; we may be unable to achieve our efficiency ratio target; activity levels for certain of our businesses, in particular debt underwriting and mortgages, may remain at low levels or decline further; our interest expense could increase faster than our interest income, reducing our net interest income and net interest margin; certain of our investments could continue to incur losses or generally low levels of returns; AUS could decline, reducing management and other fees; economies worldwide could experience recessions; and we could continue to operate in a generally unfavorable economic and market environment.\n\n32\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nLiquidity Our liquidity, profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt\n\ncapital markets or to sell assets. Liquidity is essential to our businesses. It is of critical importance to us, as most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity. Our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to raise or retain deposits, an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally, an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments, lack of timely settlement of transactions, unusual deposit outflows, or other unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, such as in March 2020, when corporate clients drew on revolving credit facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market or economic disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us, or even by the perception among market participants that we, or other market participants, are experiencing greater liquidity risk.\n\nWe employ structured products to benefit our clients and hedge our own risks. The financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are often complex, and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress. Our investing and financing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our positions.\n\nFurther, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is not generally a liquid market for such assets, as well as in circumstances where other market participants are seeking to sell similar otherwise generally liquid assets at the same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis or in response to changes to rules or regulations. For example, in 2021, an investment management firm with large positions with several financial institutions defaulted, resulting in rapidly declining prices in the securities underlying those positions. In addition, clearinghouses, exchanges and other financial institutions with which we interact may exercise setoff rights or the right to require additional collateral, including in difficult market conditions, which could further impair our liquidity. Numerous regulations have been adopted that impose more\n\nstringent liquidity requirements on large financial institutions, including us. These regulations require us to hold large amounts of highly liquid assets and reduce our flexibility to source and deploy funding. In addition, our need to manage our operations in light of certain regulatory requirements when applicable thresholds are met has in the past limited and may in the future limit our ability to raise deposits in GSIB or other funding, which could adversely affect our liquidity or ability to respond efficiently to liquidity stress.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit\n\nand higher costs of obtaining credit. Widening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long-term debt and commercial paper, by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking entities. We seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability, particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending and market making.\n\nOur clients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other types of strategic transactions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions. A lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of our clients' merger and acquisition transactions, particularly large transactions, and adversely affect our advisory and underwriting businesses.\n\nOur credit businesses have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A lack of liquidity reduces price transparency, increases price volatility and decreases transaction volumes and size, all of which can increase transaction risk or decrease the profitability of these businesses.\n\n## Reductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and\n\ncost of funding. Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with us or require us to post additional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements.\n\nAs of December 2022, our counterparties could have called for additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements in an aggregate amount of $343 million in the event of a one-notch downgrade of our credit ratings and $1.12 billion in the event of a two-notch downgrade of our credit ratings. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency's relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies. For further information about our credit ratings, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management - Credit Ratings' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\n\nOur cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay). Increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous, market-driven, and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements. Our credit spreads are also influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to our long-term debt. The market for credit default swaps has proven to be extremely volatile and at times has lacked a high degree of transparency or liquidity.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n33",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nGroup Inc. is a holding company and its liquidity depends on payments and loans from its subsidiaries, many of which are subject to legal, regulatory and other restrictions on providing funds or assets to\n\nGroup Inc. Group Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund share repurchases and dividend payments and to fund payments on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our brokerdealer and bank subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc.\n\nIn addition, our broker-dealer and bank entities and their subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses. Additional restrictions on related-party transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of Group Inc., including under the FRB's source of strength requirement, and even require Group Inc. to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Restrictions or regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend payments. In addition, Group Inc.'s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.\n\nThere has been a trend towards increased regulation and supervision of our subsidiaries by the governments and regulators in the countries in which those subsidiaries are located or do business. Concerns about protecting clients and creditors of financial institutions that are controlled by persons or entities located outside of the country in which such entities are located or do business have caused or may cause a number of governments and regulators to take additional steps to 'ring fence' or require internal total lossabsorbing capacity (which may also be subject to 'bail-in' powers, as described below) at those entities in order to protect clients and creditors of those entities in the event of financial difficulties involving those entities. The result has been and may continue to be additional limitations on our ability to efficiently move capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities, or to Group Inc., including in times of stress, thereby increasing the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis.\n\n34\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nFurthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of certain of its subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and GS Bank USA, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as negotiated with counterparties. These guarantees may require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations.\n\nThe requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries to develop and submit recovery and resolution plans to regulators, and the incorporation of feedback received from regulators, may require us to increase capital or liquidity levels or issue additional long-term debt at Group Inc. or particular subsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or duplicative operational or other costs at multiple entities, and may reduce our ability to provide Group Inc. guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries or raise debt at Group Inc. Resolution planning may also impair our ability to structure our intercompany and external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient. Furthermore, arrangements to facilitate our resolution planning may cause us to be subject to additional taxes.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nCredit Our businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality\n\nof or defaults by third parties. We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us.\n\nWe are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold, including a deterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure their obligations to us under derivative contracts and loan agreements, could result in losses and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes.\n\nA significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results. While in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights. Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral typically increase significantly in times of market stress, increased volatility and illiquidity.\n\nAs part of our clearing and prime brokerage activities, we finance our clients' positions, and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients. Although we have limits and regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.\n\n## Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting,\n\ninvesting and financing activities. Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities. The number and size of these transactions has affected and may in the future affect our results of operations in a given period. Moreover, because of concentrated risk, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors. Disruptions in the credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or economically. In addition, we extend large commitments as part of our credit origination activities. Disruptions in the credit markets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated, and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate, the trading markets for loans we originate. These disruptions may make it difficult for us to sell or value such assets, which may result in losses for us from time to time.\n\nRules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and similar rules adopted in other jurisdictions, require issuers of certain assetbacked securities and any person who organizes and initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain economic exposure to the asset, which has affected the cost of and structures used in connection with these securitization activities. Our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, including during periods of market stress, could negatively affect our results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, including due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of borrowers, as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty, borrower, issuer (including sovereign issuers) or geographic area or group of related countries, such as the E.U., and a failure or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities, industries, countries and regions may not function as we have anticipated. Regulatory reform, including the Dodd-Frank Act, has led to increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearinghouses, central agents or exchanges, which has significantly increased our concentration of risk with respect to these entities. While our activities expose us to many different industries, counterparties and countries, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties engaged in financial services activities, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, clearinghouses, exchanges and investment funds. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to these counterparties.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n35",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Derivative transactions and delayed documentation or settlements may expose us to credit risk, unexpected\n\nrisks and potential losses. We are party to a large number of derivative transactions, including credit derivatives. Many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and nonstandardized, which can make exiting, transferring or settling positions difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation and may not be able to obtain the underlying security, loan or other obligation. This could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk, as well as increased costs to us.\n\nDerivative transactions also involve the risk that documentation has not been properly executed, that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty, or that obligations under such agreements may not be able to be 'netted' against other obligations with such counterparty. In addition, counterparties may claim that such transactions were not appropriate or authorized.\n\nAs a signatory to the ISDA Universal Protocol or U.S. ISDA Protocol (ISDA Protocols) and being subject to the FRB's and FDIC's rules on QFCs and similar rules in other jurisdictions, we may not be able to exercise remedies against counterparties and, as this regime has not yet been tested, we may suffer risks or losses that we would not have expected to suffer if we could immediately close out transactions upon a termination event. The ISDA Protocols and these rules and regulations extend to repurchase agreements and other instruments that are not derivative contracts.\n\nDerivative contracts and other transactions, including secondary bank loan purchases and sales, entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement, we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce our rights.\n\nIn addition, as new complex derivative products are created,\n\ncovering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise, which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring central clearing of credit derivatives and other OTC derivatives, or a market shift toward standardized derivatives, could reduce the risk associated with these transactions, but under certain circumstances could also limit our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and to hedge our own risks, and could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, these provisions have increased our credit exposure to central clearing platforms. 36 Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nOperational A failure in our operational systems or human error, malfeasance or other misconduct, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our\n\nreputation and cause losses. Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards.\n\nMany rules and regulations worldwide govern our obligations to execute transactions and report such transactions and other information to regulators, exchanges and investors. Compliance with these legal and reporting requirements can be challenging, and we have been and may in the future be subject to regulatory fines and penalties for failing to follow these rules or to report timely, accurate and complete information in accordance with these rules. As reporting requirements expand, compliance with these rules and regulations has become more challenging.\n\nAs our client base, including through our consumer businesses, and our geographical reach expand and the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of transactions, especially electronic transactions (as well as the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and exchanges) increase, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure has become more challenging, and the risk of systems or human error in connection with such transactions has increased, as have the potential consequences of such errors due to the speed and volume of transactions involved and the potential difficulty associated with discovering errors quickly enough to limit the resulting consequences. These risks are exacerbated in times of increased volatility. As with other similarly situated institutions, we utilize credit underwriting models in connection with our businesses, including our consumer-oriented activities. Allegations or publicity, whether or not accurate, that our underwriting decisions do not treat consumers or clients fairly, or comply with the applicable law or regulation, can result in negative publicity, reputational damage and governmental and regulatory scrutiny, investigations and enforcement actions.",

We must continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets, and invest heavily in systemic controls and training to pursue our objective of ensuring that such transactions do not violate applicable rules and regulations or, due to errors in processing such transactions, adversely affect markets, our clients and counterparties or us. Enhancements and updates to systems, as well as the requisite training, including in connection with the integration of new businesses, entail significant costs and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones.\n\nThe use of computing devices and phones is critical to the work done by our employees and the operation of our systems and businesses and those of our clients and our thirdparty service providers and vendors. Their importance has continued to increase, in particular in light of work-fromhome arrangements. Computers and computer networks are subject to various risks, including, among others, cyber attacks, inherent technological defects, system failures and human error. For example, fundamental security flaws in computer chips found in many types of these computing devices and phones have been reported in the past and may occur in the future. The use of personal devices by our employees or by our vendors for work-related activities also presents risks related to potential violations of record retention and other requirements. Cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Service disruptions have resulted, and may result in the future, in delays in accessing, or the loss of, data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients' access to our platforms. There have been a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud computing providers. Addressing these and similar issues could be costly and affect the performance of these businesses and systems. Operational risks may be incurred in applying fixes and there may still be residual security risks.\n\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology-based risk and control systems, our businesses ultimately rely on people as our greatest resource, and, from time to time, they have in the past and may in the future make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures that are not always caught immediately by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures, which are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations. These have in the past and may in the future include calculation errors, mistakes in addressing emails, errors in software or model development or implementation, or simple errors in judgment, as well as intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures. Human errors, malfeasance and other misconduct, including the intentional misuse of client information in connection with insider trading or for other purposes, even if promptly discovered and remediated, has in the past resulted and may in the future result in reputational damage and losses and liabilities for us.\n\nThe majority of the employees in our primary locations, including the New York metropolitan area, London, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Salt Lake City and Dallas, work in close proximity to one another. Our headquarters is located in the New York metropolitan area, and we have our largest employee concentration occupying two principal office buildings near the Hudson River waterfront. They are subject to potential catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, terrorist attacks, extreme weather, or other hostile events that could negatively affect our business. Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity, business disruptions impacting our offices and employees could lead to our employees' inability to occupy the offices, communicate with or travel to other office locations or work remotely. As a result, our ability to service and interact with clients may be adversely impacted, due to our failure or inability to successfully implement business contingency plans.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n37",

We face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions, and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay with respect to our clients' systems.\n\nThere has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearinghouses and an increasing number of derivative transactions are cleared on exchanges, which has increased our exposure to operational failure or significant operational delay, termination or capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and costeffective alternatives in the event of any such failure, delay, termination or constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among market participants or financial intermediaries, increases the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis.\n\nThe interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearinghouses, and the increased centrality of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business. Interconnectivity of financial institutions with other companies through, among other things, application programming interfaces or APIs presents similar risks. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses or result in financial loss or liability to our clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\n\nDespite our resiliency plans and facilities, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, satellite, undersea cable or other communications, internet, transportation or other facilities used by us, our employees or third parties with which we conduct business, including cloud service providers. These disruptions may occur as a result of events that affect only our buildings or systems or those of such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those buildings or systems are located, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, war, civil unrest, terrorism, economic or political developments, pandemics and weather events.\n\n38\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nIn addition, although we seek to diversify our third-party vendors to increase our resiliency, we are exposed to risks if our vendors operate in the same area and are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other information technology event at a common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide products or services to us. We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors' use of common service\n\nproviders. Additionally, although the prevalence and scope of applications of distributed ledger technology, cryptocurrency and similar technologies is growing, the technology is nascent and may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or have other inherent weaknesses. We are exposed to risks, and may become exposed to additional risks, related to distributed ledger technology, including through our facilitation of clients' activities involving financial products that use distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain, cryptocurrencies or other digital assets, our investments in companies that seek to develop platforms based on distributed ledger technology, the use of distributed ledger technology by third-party vendors, clients, counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries, and the receipt of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets as collateral. The market volatility that financial products using distributed ledger technology have recently experienced may increase these risks.\n\n## A failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar threats could impair our ability to conduct our businesses, result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-of-service attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of cyber attacks as we expand our mobile- and other internetbased products and services, as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies, and as we provide more of these services to a greater number of individual consumers. The migration of our communication from devices we provide to employee-owned devices presents additional risks of cyber attacks, as do work-from-home arrangements . In addition, due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors (and their respective service providers), central agents, exchanges, clearinghouses and other financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event. These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the third party subject to the cyber attack or other information security event or could result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.\n\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, including because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources, including third parties who are affiliated with or sponsored by foreign governments or are involved with organized crime or terrorist organizations. Third parties may also attempt to place individuals in our offices or induce employees, clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data or that of our clients, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent.\n\nAlthough we take protective measures proactively and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks on our vendors and other events that could have a security impact. Risks relating to cyber attacks on our vendors have been increasing given the greater frequency and severity in recent years of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, protective measures that we employ to compartmentalize our data may reduce our visibility into, and adversely affect our ability to respond to, cyber threats and issues with our systems.\n\nIf one or more of these types of events occur, it potentially could jeopardize our, our clients', our counterparties' or third parties' confidential and other information processed, stored in, or transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or those of our clients, counterparties or third parties, which could impact their ability to transact with us or otherwise result in legal or regulatory action, significant losses or reputational damage. In addition, such an event could persist for an extended period of time before being properly detected or escalated, and, following detection or escalation, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation. Moreover, potential new regulations may require us to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident before it has been resolved or fully investigated.\n\nWe have expended, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources on an ongoing basis to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, but these measures may be ineffective and we may be subject to legal or regulatory action, as well as financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\n\nOur clients' confidential information may also be at risk from the compromise of clients' personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company. Losses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our reputation and may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks, as can work-fromhome arrangements. Certain aspects of the security of such technologies are unpredictable or beyond our control, and the failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential and other information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures, despite their sophistication, may be defeated, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies vastly increase the speed and computing power available.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n39",

An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a client, vendor, service provider, counterparty or other third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.\n\n## We may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\n\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. Our risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from market-making, investing or lending positions, and underwriting activities, with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Thus, in the course of our activities, we have incurred and may in the future incur losses. Market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk.\n\nThe models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely previously correlated indicators may move in different directions. These types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so in the future. These changes in correlation have been and may in the future be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets.\n\n40\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nIn addition, the use of models in connection with risk management and numerous other critical activities presents risks that the models may be ineffective, either because of poor design, ineffective testing, or improper or flawed inputs, as well as unpermitted access to the models resulting in\n\nunapproved or malicious changes to the model or its inputs. To the extent that we have positions through our marketmaking or origination activities or we make investments directly through our investing activities, including private equity, that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with those positions. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation, we invest our own capital in private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds that we manage and limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of our investments in these funds, whether for legal, reputational or other reasons, may make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures relating to these investments.\n\nPrudent risk management, as well as regulatory restrictions, may cause us to limit our exposure to counterparties, geographic areas or markets, which may limit our business opportunities and increase the cost of our funding or hedging activities.\n\nAs we have expanded and intend to continue to expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings of credit and investment products to consumers, we are presented with different risks and must expand and adapt our risk monitoring and mitigation activities to account for these business activities. A failure to adequately assess and control such risk exposures could result in losses to us.\n\nFor further information about our risk management policies and procedures, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.",

The implementation of higher capital requirements, more stringent requirements relating to liquidity, long-term debt and total loss-absorbing capacity and the prohibition on proprietary trading and the sponsorship of, or investment in, covered funds by the Volcker Rule may continue to adversely affect our profitability and competitive position, particularly if these requirements do not apply equally to our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across jurisdictions. We may also become subject to higher and more stringent capital and other regulatory requirements as a result of the implementation of Basel Committee standards, including the credit and operational risk capital standards published in December 2017 and the market risk capital standard published in January 2019.\n\nAs described in 'Business - Regulation - Banking Supervision and Regulation' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10K, the SCB has replaced the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized Capital Rules and resulted in higher Standardized capital ratio requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could limit our ability to, among other things, repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. In addition, if, as in 2020, we are required to resubmit our capital plan, we generally may not make capital distributions, such as share repurchases or dividends, without the prior approval of the FRB. Dividends and repurchases are also subject to oversight by the FRB, which can result in limitations. Limitations on our ability to make capital distributions could, among other things, prevent us from returning capital to our shareholders and impact our return on equity. Additionally, as a G -SIB, we are subject to the G -SIB surcharge. Our G -SIB surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year. Expansion of our businesses, growth in our balance sheet and increased reliance on short-term wholesale funding have resulted in increases and in the future may result in further increases in our G -SIB surcharge and a corresponding increase in our capital requirements.\n\n42\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations, such as the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase.\n\nFurther, the CRD requires certain non-E.U. groups with more than \u20ac40 billion of assets in the E.U., such as us, to establish an E.U. IHC by December 30, 2023. A non-E.U. group may have two E.U. IHCs if a request for a second is approved. If we are unable to obtain approval to have two E.U. IHCs, we would be required to limit our European subsidiary activities to those that are permissible for GSBE.\n\nIn addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data on-shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks and misappropriation, corruption or loss of information or technology.\n\nWe have entered into consumer-oriented deposit-taking, lending and credit card businesses, and we may expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings. Entering into these businesses subjects us to numerous additional regulations in the jurisdictions in which these businesses operate. Not only are these regulations extensive, but they involve types of regulations and supervision, as well as regulatory compliance risks, that have not historically applied to us. The level of regulatory scrutiny and the scope of regulations affecting financial interactions with consumers is often much greater than that associated with doing business with institutions and high-net-worth individuals. Complying with these regulations is time-consuming, costly and presents new and increased risks.",

Any failure to comply with different or expanded CRA requirements as a result of this change in assessment methods could negatively impact GS Bank USA's CRA ratings, cause reputational harm and result in limits on our ability to make future acquisitions or engage in certain new activities.\n\nIncreasingly, regulators and courts have sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where they have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing, even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the activities engaged in by its client. Regulators and courts have also increasingly found liability as a 'control person' for activities of entities in which financial institutions or funds controlled by financial institutions have an investment, but which they do not actively manage. In addition, regulators and courts continue to seek to establish 'fiduciary' obligations to counterparties to which no such duty had been assumed to exist. To the extent that such efforts are successful, the cost of, and liabilities associated with, engaging in brokerage, clearing, market-making, prime brokerage, investing and other similar activities could increase significantly. To the extent that we have fiduciary obligations in connection with acting as a financial adviser or investment adviser or in other roles for individual, institutional, sovereign or investment fund clients, any breach, or even an alleged breach, of such obligations could have materially negative legal, regulatory and reputational consequences.\n\nFor information about the extensive regulation to which our businesses are subject, see 'Business - Regulation' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\n\n## A failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect\n\nour businesses. Due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of that client or another client, as well as situations where one or more of our businesses have access to material non-public information that may not be shared with our other businesses and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity with which we also have an advisory or other relationship.\n\nIn addition, our status as a BHC subjects us to heightened regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the FRB with respect to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries and entities that are or could be viewed as affiliates of ours and, under the Volcker Rule, transactions between us and covered funds.\n\nWe have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest, including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation, which is one of our most important assets, could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions with us may be adversely affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Additionally, our One Goldman Sachs initiative aims to increase collaboration among our businesses, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing. The realignment of our businesses, reflected in our new segments beginning with the fourth quarter of 2022, presents similar risks.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n43",

        "page_content": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## We may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative\n\npublicity. Governmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies and law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to compensation, our business practices, our past actions and other matters remains at high levels. Political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions has in the past resulted and may in the future result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage, as well as adverse statements or charges by regulators or other government officials. Press coverage and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing (including, in some cases, press coverage and public statements that do not directly involve us) often result in some type of investigation by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in lawsuits.\n\nResponding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to support legislation targeted at the financial services industry. Governmental authorities may also be more likely to pursue criminal or other actions, including seeking admissions of wrongdoing or guilty pleas, in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation to the extent a company is viewed as having previously engaged in criminal, regulatory or other misconduct. Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our reputation and on the morale and performance of our employees, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. Further, we are subject to regulatory settlements, orders and feedback that require significant remediation activities, which require us to commit significant resources, including hiring, as well as testing the operation and effectiveness of new controls, policies and procedures.\n\nThe financial services industry generally and our businesses in particular have been subject to negative publicity. Our reputation and businesses may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our businesses and personnel, whether or not accurate or true, that may be posted on social media or other internet forums or published by news organizations. Postings on these types of forums may also adversely impact risk positions of our clients and other parties that owe us money, securities or other assets and increase the chance that they will not perform their obligations to us or reduce the revenues we receive from their use of our services. The speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels, in particular social media, may magnify risks relating to negative publicity.\n\n44\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nSubstantial civil or criminal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm\n\nour business prospects. We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about certain of our legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations. We have seen legal claims by consumers and clients increase in a market downturn and employment-related claims increase following periods in which we have reduced our headcount. Additionally, governmental entities have been plaintiffs and are parties in certain of our legal proceedings, and we may face future civil or criminal actions or claims by the same or other governmental entities, as well as follow-on civil litigation that is often commenced after regulatory settlements.\n\nSignificant settlements by several large financial institutions, including, in some cases, us, with governmental entities have been publicly announced. The trend of large settlements with governmental entities may adversely affect the outcomes for other financial institutions, including, in some cases, us, in similar actions, especially where governmental officials have announced that the large settlements will be used as the basis or a template for other settlements. The uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses, which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and subsequent actual settlements or penalties.\n\nClaims of collusion or anti-competitive conduct have become more common. Financial institutions (including us) have been subject to civil cases and investigatory demands relating to alleged bid-rigging, group boycotts or other anti-competitive practices. Antitrust laws generally provide for joint and several liability and treble damages. These claims have resulted in significant settlements and fines in the past and may do so in the future. We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, including\n\nthe FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to, government officials and others. Violation of these or similar laws and regulations have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in significant monetary penalties. Such violations could also result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation.",

See for example, '1MDB-Related Matters' in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Any such resolution of a criminal matter involving us or our employees could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation, could adversely affect our reputation, could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our activities generally or in certain circumstances and could have other negative effects. Further, as a result of this type of settlement, we are no longer a 'well-known seasoned issuer,' which places limitations on the manner in which we can market our securities.\n\n## In conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, legal, regulatory and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries.\n\nIn conducting our businesses and supporting our global operations, we are subject to risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, communications and other content restrictions, and other restrictive governmental actions. For example, sanctions have been imposed by the U.S. and the E.U. on certain individuals and companies in Russia and Venezuela. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries and many of the transactions in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. We have been in some cases subject to divergent and conflicting laws and regulations across markets, and we are increasingly subject to the risk that the jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented or may implement laws and regulations that directly conflict with those of another jurisdiction. Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in compliance with the application of local laws in a particular market or our failure to develop effective working relationships with local regulators could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market, but also on our reputation generally. Further, in some jurisdictions a failure, or alleged failure, to comply with laws and regulations has subjected and may in the future subject us and our personnel not only to civil actions, but also criminal actions and other sanctions. We are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.\n\nWhile business and other practices throughout the world differ, our principal entities are subject in their operations worldwide to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments, hiring practices and money laundering, as well as laws relating to doing business with certain individuals, groups and countries, such as the FCPA, the BSA and the U.K. Bribery Act. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring, the geographical diversity of our operations, employees, clients and consumers, as well as the vendors and other third parties that we deal with, greatly increases the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules or regulations and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation. See for example, '1MDB-Related Matters' in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nIn addition, there have been a number of highly publicized cases around the world, involving actual or alleged fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry, and we have had and may in the future have employee misconduct. This misconduct has included and may also in the future include intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, rules or procedures or misappropriation of funds and the theft of proprietary information, including proprietary software. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity have not been and may not be effective in all cases, as reflected by the settlements relating to 1MDB.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n45",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe application of regulatory strategies and requirements in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions could create greater risk of loss for Group\n\nInc.'s security holders. As described in 'Business - Regulation - Banking Supervision and Regulation - Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC,' if the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, the rights of Group Inc.'s creditors would be determined under OLA, and substantial differences exist in the rights of creditors between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on our debtholders.\n\nThe FDIC has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under OLA to resolve a large financial institution in a manner that would, among other things, impose losses on shareholders, debtholders and other creditors of the top-tier BHC (in our case, Group Inc.), while the BHC's subsidiaries may continue to operate. It is possible that the application of the single point of entry strategy under OLA, in which Group Inc. would be the only entity to enter resolution proceedings (and its material broker-dealer, bank and other operating entities would not enter resolution proceedings), would result in greater losses to Group Inc.'s security holders (including holders of our fixed rate, floating rate and indexed debt securities), than the losses that would result from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy, such as a multiple point of entry resolution strategy for Group Inc. and certain of its material subsidiaries.\n\nAssuming Group Inc. entered resolution proceedings and that support from Group Inc. or other available resources to its subsidiaries was sufficient to enable the subsidiaries to remain solvent, losses at the subsidiary level would be transferred to Group Inc. and ultimately borne by Group Inc.'s security holders, third-party creditors of Group Inc.'s subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, and Group Inc.'s security holders (including our shareholders, debtholders and other unsecured creditors) could face significant and possibly complete losses. In that case, Group Inc.'s security holders would face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc.'s subsidiaries would incur no losses because the subsidiaries would continue to operate and would not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, holders of Group Inc.'s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc.'s other debt securities could face losses ahead of its other similarly situated creditors in a resolution under OLA if the FDIC exercised its right, described above, to disregard the priority of creditor claims.\n\n46\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nOLA also provides the FDIC with authority to cause creditors and shareholders of the financial company in receivership to bear losses before taxpayers are exposed to such losses, and amounts owed to the U.S. government would generally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims\n\nof private creditors, including senior creditors. In addition, under OLA, claims of creditors (including debtholders) could be satisfied through the issuance of equity or other securities in a bridge entity to which Group Inc.'s assets are transferred. If such a securities-for-claims exchange were implemented, there can be no assurance that the value of the securities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or any part of the creditor claims for which the securities were exchanged. While the FDIC has issued regulations to implement OLA, not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible.\n\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and the E.U., have implemented resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Such 'bail-in' powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured debtholders. For example, the Bank of England requires a certain amount of intercompany funding that we provide to our material U.K. subsidiaries to contain a contractual trigger to expressly permit the Bank of England to exercise such 'bail-in' powers in certain circumstances. If the intercompany funding we provide to our subsidiaries is 'bailed in,' Group Inc.'s claims on its subsidiaries would be subordinated to the claims of the subsidiaries' third-party creditors or written down. U.S. regulators are considering and non-U.S. authorities have adopted requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of total loss-absorbing capacity that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the top-tier BHC and, ultimately, to security holders of the top-tier BHC in the event of failure.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## The application of Group Inc.'s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.'s\n\nsecurity holders. In our resolution plan, Group Inc. would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The strategy described in our resolution plan is a variant of the single point of entry strategy: Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Group Inc., would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries, including through the forgiveness of intercompany indebtedness, the extension of the maturities of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loans. If this strategy were successful, creditors of some or all of Group Inc.'s major subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, while Group Inc.'s security holders could face significant and possibly complete losses.\n\nTo facilitate the execution of our resolution plan, we formed Funding IHC. In exchange for an unsecured subordinated funding note and equity interest, Group Inc. transferred certain intercompany receivables and substantially all of its GCLA to Funding IHC, and agreed to transfer additional GCLA above prescribed thresholds.\n\nWe also put in place a Capital and Liquidity Support Agreement (CLSA) among Group Inc., Funding IHC and our major subsidiaries. Under the CLSA, Funding IHC has provided Group Inc. with a committed line of credit that allows Group Inc. to draw sufficient funds to meet its cash needs during the ordinary course of business. In addition, if our financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent, (i) the committed line of credit will automatically terminate and the unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven, (ii) all intercompany receivables owed by the major subsidiaries to Group Inc. will be transferred to Funding IHC or their maturities will be extended to five years, (iii) Group Inc. will be obligated to transfer substantially all of its remaining intercompany receivables and GCLA (other than an amount to fund anticipated bankruptcy expenses) to Funding IHC, and (iv) Funding IHC will be obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to the major subsidiaries. Group Inc.'s and Funding IHC's obligations under the CLSA are secured pursuant to a related security agreement. Such actions would materially and adversely affect Group Inc.'s liquidity. As a result, during a period of severe stress, Group Inc. might commence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier time than it otherwise would if the CLSA and related security agreement had not been implemented.\n\nIf Group Inc.'s proposed resolution strategy were successful, Group Inc.'s security holders could face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc.'s major subsidiaries would incur no losses because those subsidiaries would continue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. As part of the strategy, Group Inc. could also seek to elevate the priority of its guarantee obligations relating to its major subsidiaries' derivative contracts or transfer them to another entity so that cross-default and early termination rights would be stayed under the ISDA Protocols, as applicable, which would result in holders of Group Inc.'s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc.'s other debt securities incurring losses ahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee obligations. It is also possible that holders of Group Inc.'s eligible long-term debt and other debt securities could incur losses ahead of other similarly situated creditors of Group Inc.'s major subsidiaries.\n\nIf Group Inc.'s proposed resolution strategy were not successful, Group Inc.'s financial condition would be adversely impacted and Group Inc.'s security holders, including debtholders, may as a consequence be in a worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented. In all cases, any payments to debtholders are dependent on our ability to make such payments and are therefore subject to our credit risk.\n\nAs a result of our recovery and resolution planning processes, including incorporating feedback from our regulators, we may incur increased operational, funding or other costs and face limitations on our ability to structure our internal organization or engage in internal or external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient.\n\nOur commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs.\n\nAs part of our commodities business, we purchase and sell certain physical commodities, arrange for their storage and transport, and engage in market making of commodities. The commodities involved in these activities may include crude oil, refined oil products, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, electric power, agricultural products, metals (base and precious), minerals (including unenriched uranium), emission credits, coal, freight and related products and indices.

Our client base is not the same as that of our major competitors. Our businesses may have a higher or lower percentage of clients in certain industries or markets than some or all of our competitors. Therefore, unfavorable industry developments or market conditions affecting certain industries or markets have resulted in the past and may result in the future in our businesses underperforming relative to similar businesses of a competitor if our businesses have a higher concentration of clients in such industries or markets. For example, our market-making businesses have a higher percentage of clients with actively managed assets than some of our competitors and such clients have in the past been and may in the future be disproportionately affected by low volatility.\n\nCorrespondingly, favorable or simply less adverse developments or market conditions involving industries or markets in a business where we have a lower concentration of clients in such industry or market have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in our underperforming relative to a similar business of a competitor that has a higher concentration of clients in such industry or market. For example, we have a smaller corporate client base in our market-making businesses than some of our peers and therefore those competitors may benefit more from increased activity by corporate clients. Similarly, we have not historically engaged in retail equities intermediation to the same extent as other financial institutions, which has in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our market share in equities execution.\n\n## The financial services industry is highly competitive.\n\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation, creditworthiness and price. There has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. This has hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions.

These or other similar rules, many of which do not apply to all our U.S. or non-U.S. competitors, could impact our ability to compete effectively.\n\nPricing and other competitive pressures in our businesses have continued to increase, particularly in situations where some of our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing prices. For example, in connection with investment banking and other assignments, in response to competitive pressure we have experienced, we have extended and priced credit at levels that in some cases have not fully compensated us for the risks we undertook.\n\nThe financial services industry is highly interrelated in that a significant volume of transactions occur among a limited number of members of that industry. Many transactions are syndicated to other financial institutions, and financial institutions are often counterparties in transactions. This has led to claims by other market participants and regulators that such institutions have colluded in order to manipulate markets or market prices, including allegations that antitrust laws have been violated.

Securities, futures and options transactions are increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue. Some of these alternative trading systems compete with us, particularly our exchangebased market-making activities, and we may experience continued competitive pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the increased use by our clients of low-cost electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads. As our clients increasingly use our systems to trade directly in the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure.\n\nWe have invested significant resources into the development of electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so, but there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate return, particularly given the\n\ngenerally lower commissions arising from electronic trades. In addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new technologies, including distributed ledgers, such as digital assets and blockchain, have required us to invest resources to adapt our existing products and services, and we expect to continue to make such investments, which could be material. The adoption and evolution of such new technologies may also increase our compliance and regulatory costs. Further, technologies, such as those based on distributed ledgers, that do not require intermediation could also significantly disrupt payments processing and other financial services. Regulatory limitations on our involvement in products and platforms involving digital assets and distributed ledger technologies may not apply equally or in some cases at all to certain of our competitors. We may not be as timely or successful in developing or integrating, or even able to develop or integrate, new products and technologies, such as those built on distributed ledgers, into our existing products and services, adapting to changes in consumer preferences or achieving market acceptance of our products and services, any of which could affect our ability to attract or retain clients, cause us to lose market share or result in service disruptions and in turn reduce our revenues or otherwise adversely affect us.\n\n## Our businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.\n\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled people; therefore, our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses, to manage our businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new talented and diverse employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Factors that affect our ability to attract and retain such employees include the level and composition of our compensation and benefits, and our reputation as a successful business with a culture of fairly hiring, training and promoting qualified employees. As a significant portion of the compensation that we pay to our employees is in the form of year-end discretionary compensation, a significant portion of which is in the form of deferred equity-related awards, declines in our profitability, or in the outlook for our future profitability, as well as regulatory limitations on compensation levels and terms, can negatively impact our ability to hire and retain highly qualified employees.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n49",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nCompetition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry, including the technology industry, for qualified employees has often been intense. We have experienced increased competition in hiring and retaining employees to address the demands of our expanding consumer-oriented businesses and our technology initiatives. This is also the case in emerging and growth markets, where we are often competing for qualified employees with entities that have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region.\n\nLaws or regulations in jurisdictions in which our operations are located that affect taxes on our employees' income or the amount or composition of compensation, or that require us to disclose our or our competitors' compensation practices, may also adversely affect our ability to hire and retain qualified employees in those jurisdictions.\n\nAs described further in 'Business - Regulation -Compensation Practices' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K, our compensation practices are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB. As a large global financial and banking institution, we are subject to limitations on compensation practices (which may or may not affect the companies with which we compete for talent) by the FRB, the PRA, the FCA, the FDIC and other regulators worldwide. These limitations have shaped our compensation practices, which has, in some cases, adversely affected our ability to attract and retain talented employees, in particular in relation to companies not subject to these limitations, and future legislation or regulation may have similar adverse effects.\n\nOur operating expenses and efficiency ratio depend, in part, on our overall headcount and the proportion of our employees located in strategic locations. Our future human capital resource requirements and the benefits provided by strategic locations are uncertain, and we may not realize the benefits we anticipate.\n\n50\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n## Market Developments and General Business\n\nextreme weather events or other natural disasters. The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, such as COVID-19, or other widespread health emergencies (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks, extreme weather events, solar events or other natural disasters, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. These events could have such effects through economic or financial market disruptions or challenging economic or market conditions more generally, the deterioration of our creditworthiness or that of our counterparties, changes in consumer sentiment and consumer borrowing, spending and savings patterns, liquidity stress, or operational difficulties (such as travel limitations and limitations on occupancy in our offices) that impair our ability to manage our businesses.\n\nEnvironment Our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorist attacks,\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on, among other things, future developments, including any resurgence of COVID-19 cases, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments over the long term and against new variants, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\nClimate change could disrupt our businesses and adversely affect client activity levels and the creditworthiness of our clients and counterparties, and our efforts to address concerns relating to climate change could result in damage to our reputation.\n\nClimate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our primary locations, which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients, adversely affect the value of our investments, including our real estate investments, and reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance. Climate change and the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy may also have a negative impact on the operations or financial condition of our clients and counterparties, which may decrease revenues from those clients and counterparties and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients and counterparties. In addition, climate change may impact the broader economy.",

These changes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation. For example, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our or our clients' involvement in, or decision not to participate in, certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. If we are unable to achieve our objectives relating to climate change or our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective, insufficient or otherwise inappropriate, our business, reputation and efforts to recruit and retain employees may suffer.\n\nNew regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as the perspectives of government officials, regulators, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change, may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we engage in certain activities or offer certain products. Federal and state, and non-U.S. banking regulators and supervisory authorities, shareholders and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as playing an important role in helping to address risks related to climate change, both directly and with respect to their clients, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased requirements and expectations regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending, investment and advisory activities. The FRB has announced that we are among the six U.S. financial institutions participating in a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise in 2023, and we also are subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements relating to climate change, such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory, compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements. The risks associated with, and the perspective of regulators, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding, climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly, which can make it difficult to assess the ultimate impact on us of climate change-related risks and uncertainties, and we expect that climate change-related risks will increase over time.\n\nOur business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions and other\n\ndevelopments. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively affected the global economy. Governments around the world have responded to Russia's invasion by imposing economic sanctions and export controls on certain industry sectors, including price caps on Russian oil, and parties in Russia. Compliance with economic sanctions and restrictions imposed by governments has increased our costs and otherwise adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. Russia has responded with its own restrictions against investors and countries outside Russia and has proposed additional measures aimed at non-Russia owned businesses. Businesses in the U.S. and globally have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials due in part to the negative effects of the war on the global economy. The escalation or continuation of the war between Russia and Ukraine or other hostilities could result in, among other things, further increased risk of cyber attacks, an increased frequency and volume of failures to settle securities transactions, supply chain disruptions, higher inflation, lower consumer demand and increased volatility in commodity, currency and other financial markets.\n\nThe extent and duration of the war, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, and the consequences for our business could be significant.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nCertain of our businesses, our funding instruments and financial products may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of Interbank Offered\n\nRates (IBORs), in particular USD LIBOR. On January 1, 2022, the publication of all EUR, CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR (non-USD LIBOR) settings along with certain USD LIBOR settings ceased. The publication of the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings as representative rates will cease after June 2023. The FCA proposed that certain of those USD LIBOR settings continue to be published on a synthetic basis through September 2024. The FCA has allowed the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain GBP LIBOR settings in legacy GBP LIBOR-based derivative contracts through March 2024.\n\nThe International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (IBOR Protocol) has provided derivatives market participants with amended fallbacks for legacy and new derivative contracts to mitigate legal or economic uncertainty. Both counterparties have to adhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in bilateral amendments for the terms to be effective for derivative contracts. ISDA has confirmed that the FCA's formal announcement to cease both non-USD and USD LIBOR settings fixed the spread adjustment for all LIBOR rates and as a result fallbacks applied automatically for non-USD LIBOR settings following December 31, 2021 and will apply automatically for USD LIBOR settings following June 30, 2023. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (LIBOR Act), that was enacted in March 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for contracts governed by U.S. law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of a poll or LIBOR-based rate. In December 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule that implements the LIBOR Act, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. The final rule identifies different SOFR-based replacement rates for derivative contracts, for cash instruments such as floating-rate notes and preferred stock, for consumer contracts, for certain government-sponsored enterprise contracts and for certain student loan securitizations that lack a fallback to an alternative rate when USD LIBOR ceases to be published on June 30, 2023. As the transition from LIBOR is ongoing, there continues to be uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the transition on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. Similar developments have occurred with respect to other IBORs.\n\n52\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe language in our contracts and financial instruments that define IBORs, in particular LIBOR, have developed over time and have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. Once a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments often give the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion over the successor rate or benchmark to be selected. Although the LIBOR Act includes safe harbors if the FRB-identified SOFRbased replacement rate is selected, these safe harbors are untested. As a result, and despite the enactment of the LIBOR Act, for the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings, the selection of a successor rate could result in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our IBORbased contracts and financial instruments. Discretionary actions taken in connection with the implementation of fallback provisions could also result in client disputes and litigation particularly for derivatives and other synthetic instruments.\n\nChanges in, the discontinuation of, or changes in market acceptance of any IBOR, particularly USD LIBOR, as a reference rate may adversely affect certain of our businesses, our funding instruments and financial products.\n\nCertain of our businesses and our funding instruments may be adversely affected by changes in other reference rates, currencies, indexes, baskets or ETFs to which products we offer or funding that we raise are linked.\n\nMany of the products that we own or that we offer, such as structured notes, warrants, swaps or security-based swaps, pay interest or determine the principal amount to be paid at maturity or in the event of default by reference to rates or by reference to an index, currency, basket, ETF or other financial metric (the underlier). In the event that the composition of the underlier is significantly changed, by reference to rules governing such underlier or otherwise, the underlier ceases to exist (for example, in the event that a country withdraws from the Euro or links its currency to or delinks its currency from another currency or benchmark, an index or ETF sponsor materially alters the composition of an index or ETF, or stocks in a basket are delisted or become impermissible to be included in the index or ETF), the underlier ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark or there are legal or regulatory constraints on linking a financial instrument to the underlier, we may experience adverse effects.",

Continued or escalating tensions may also lead to the U.S., China or other countries taking other actions, which could include the implementation of sanctions, tariffs or foreign exchange measures, the largescale sale of U.S. Treasury securities or restrictions on crossborder trade, investment or transfer of information or technology. Any such developments could adversely affect our or our clients' businesses, as well as our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, possibly materially.\n\nA conflict, or concerns about a potential conflict, involving China and Taiwan, the U.S. or other countries could negatively impact financial markets and our or our clients' businesses.

Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, possibly materially.\n\nWe face enhanced risks as new business initiatives and acquisitions lead us to engage in new activities, operate in new locations, transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us to new\n\nasset classes and new markets. A number of our recent and planned business initiatives and expansions of existing businesses, including through acquisitions and partnership arrangements, could continue to bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base, expose us to new asset classes and new markets, and present us with integration challenges. For example, we continue to transact business and invest in new regions, including a wide range of emerging and growth markets, and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging and growth market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative growth rates in their economies. The possible effects of any of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally.\n\nFurthermore, in a number of our businesses, including where we make markets, invest and lend, we own interests in, or otherwise become affiliated with the ownership and operation of, public services, such as airports, toll roads and shipping ports, as well as physical commodities and commodities infrastructure components, both within and outside the U.S.\n\nWe have increased our consumer-oriented deposit-taking and lending activities. For example, we now issue credit cards to consumers and through our acquisition of GreenSky, Inc. (GreenSky), we expanded our offering of point-of-sale financing. To the extent we engage in those and other consumer-oriented activities, we have faced, and would continue to face, additional compliance, legal and regulatory risk, increased reputational risk and increased operational risk due to, among other things, higher transaction volumes and significantly increased retention and transmission of consumer and client information. Acquisitions and new products can also expose us to new or different types of risks. For example, providing point-of-sale financing through GreenSky also subjects us to risks relating to retaining and attracting merchants and servicing loans for other banks, as well as potential liability for remediation costs if merchants fail to fulfill their obligations to consumers. We are also subject to additional legal requirements, including with respect to suitability and consumer protection (for example, Regulation Best Interest, fair lending laws and regulations and privacy laws and regulations).

We may face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining and integrating the relevant businesses and systems, including the need to combine or separate accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients, counterparties, regulators and others in connection with acquisitions. Integration of acquired businesses is timeconsuming and could disrupt our ongoing businesses, produce unforeseen regulatory or operating difficulties, cause us to incur incremental expenses or require incremental financial, management and other resources.

Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was $30.06 for 2022, compared with $59.45 for 2021. Return on average common shareholders' equity (ROE) was 10.2% for 2022, compared with 23.0% for 2021. Book value per common share was $303.55 as of December 2022, 6.7% higher compared with December 2021.\n\nNet revenues were $47.37 billion for 2022, 20% lower than a strong 2021, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Asset & Wealth Management and lower net revenues in Global Banking & Markets, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in Platform Solutions. Net revenues in Asset & Wealth Management primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Debt investments. Net revenues in Global Banking & Markets primarily reflected significantly lower Investment banking fees compared with a strong prior year, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC). Net revenues in Platform Solutions were significantly higher, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Consumer platforms.\n\nProvision for credit losses was $2.72 billion for 2022, compared with $357 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and net charge-offs. Provisions for 2021 reflected growth in the credit card and wholesale portfolios, largely offset by reserve reductions as the broader economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOperating expenses were $31.16 billion for 2022, 2% lower than 2021, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). This decrease was partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses, reflecting the inclusion of NN Investment Partners (NNIP) and GreenSky, Inc. (GreenSky) and increases in transaction based expenses and technology expenses. Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) was 65.8% for 2022, compared with 53.8% for 2021. During 2022, we returned a total of $6.70 billion to\n\nshareholders, including common stock repurchases of $3.50 billion and common stock dividends of $3.20 billion. As of December 2022, our CET1 capital ratio was 15.1% under the Standardized Capital Rules and 14.4% under the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nBusiness Environment In 2022, the global economy was impacted by persistent broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war, and inflationary and labor market pressures. Governments around the world responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine by imposing economic sanctions, and global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. These factors contributed to increased market volatility during the year, as well as a decrease in global equity and bond prices and wider corporate credit spreads compared with the end of 2021.\n\nThe economic outlook remains uncertain, reflecting concerns about the continuation or escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine and other geopolitical risks, inflation, and supply chain complications. See 'Results of Operations - Segment Assets and Operating Results - Segment Operating Results' for further information about the operating environment for each of our business segments.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair Value Hierarchy. Trading assets and liabilities, certain investments and loans, and certain other financial assets and liabilities, are included in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market), with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy.\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We measure certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). In determining fair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolio's net risk exposure to that input. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.\n\nThe fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer\n\nrestrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. Instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. Level 3 financial assets represented 1.8% as of December 2022 and 1.6% as of December 2021 of our total assets. See Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level 3 financial assets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related fair value measurements. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include:\n\n- \u00b7 Determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/ or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument;\n- \u00b7 Determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and\n- \u00b7 Determining appropriate valuation adjustments, including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality.\n\nRegardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence.\n\n## Controls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments. Market makers and investment professionals in our revenue-\n\nproducing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in independent risk oversight and control functions. This independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n59",

All financial instruments at fair value classified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent risk oversight and control functions include:\n\n- \u00b7 Trade Comparison. Analysis of trade data (both internal and external, where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations.\n- \u00b7 External Price Comparison. Valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, S&P Global Services, Bloomberg, ICE Data Services, Pricing Direct, TRACE). Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotations or thirdparty pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations.\n- \u00b7 Calibration to Market Comparables. Market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components.\n- \u00b7 Relative Value Analyses. Market-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another.\n- \u00b7 Collateral Analyses. Margin calls on derivatives are analyzed to determine implied values, which are used to corroborate our valuations.\n- \u00b7 Execution of Trades. Where appropriate, market-making desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market-clearing levels.\n- \u00b7 Backtesting. Valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for\n\nfurther information about fair value measurements. Review of Net Revenues. Independent risk oversight and\n\ncontrol functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. Through this process, we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified.\n\n60\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nReview of Valuation Models. Our independent model risk management group (Model Risk), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. New or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to implementation. Models are reviewed annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. See 'Risk Management - Model Risk Management' for further information about the review and\n\nvalidation of our valuation models.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses We estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. To determine the allowance for credit losses, we classify our loans accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which we have developed and documented our methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an assetspecific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loans and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. We apply judgment in weighting individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including our internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and GDP), the borrower's capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factors for installment and credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators.",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision\n\nand concentration risk. Our estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within our independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within our independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While we use the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\n\nWe also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such commitments are cancellable by us.\n\nTo estimate the potential impact of an adverse macroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit losses, we, among other things, compared the expected credit losses under the weighted average forecast used in the calculation of allowance for credit losses as of December 2022 (which was weighted towards the baseline and adverse economic scenarios) to the expected credit losses under a 100% weighted adverse economic scenario. The adverse economic scenario of the forecast model reflects a global recession in 2023 and a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy by central banks, resulting in an economic contraction and rising unemployment rates. A 100% weighting to the adverse economic scenario would have resulted in an approximate $1.0 billion increase in our allowance for credit losses as of December 2022. This hypothetical increase does not take into consideration any potential adjustments to qualitative reserves. The forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain and do not take into account any other offsetting or correlated effects. The actual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic environment may differ significantly from this estimate. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses.\n\nUse of Estimates U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes.\n\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and allocated equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders' equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders' equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. The estimated fair value of our Consumer platforms reporting unit, which represents approximately 7.5% of our goodwill, was not substantially in excess of its carrying value. This reporting unit has been adversely impacted by the recent operating environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic concerns. We will continue to closely monitor it to determine whether an impairment is required in the future. As of December 2022, the goodwill related to the Consumer platforms reporting unit was $482 million. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill. If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, the performance of one or more of our reporting units or our common stock price, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future. Identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment when\n\nevents or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's or asset group's carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test identifiable intangible assets for impairment, if required. An impairment is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about identifiable intangible assets. Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 61",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nWe also estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a caseby-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.\n\nIn accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. As of December 2022, our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $1.22 billion. We use estimates to recognize current and deferred income taxes in the U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. The income tax laws in these jurisdictions are complex and can be subject to different interpretations between taxpayers and taxing authorities. Disputes may arise over these interpretations and can be settled by audit, administrative appeals or judicial proceedings. Our interpretations are reevaluated quarterly based on guidance currently available, tax examination experience and the opinions of legal counsel, among other factors. We recognize deferred taxes based on the amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future based on enacted income tax laws. As of December 2022, we had $8.93 billion of deferred tax assets with a related valuation allowance of $1.57 billion. Our estimate for deferred taxes includes estimates for future taxable earnings, including the level and character of those earnings, and various tax planning strategies.

Operating Environment. During 2022, the operating environment was characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which contributed to a decrease in global equity and bond prices and wider corporate credit spreads compared with the end of 2021. These factors contributed to solid market-making activity levels and a decline in industry-wide investment banking activity, particularly for underwriting. In the U.S., the rate of unemployment remained low and consumer spending increased slightly compared with 2021.\n\nIf concerns about the economic outlook grow, including those about the continuation or escalation of geopolitical concerns, inflation and supply chain complications, and the persistence of COVID-19-related effects, it may lead to a continued decline in asset prices, or a decline in marketmaking activity levels, or a continued decline in investment banking activity levels, and net revenues and provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. See 'Segment Assets and Operating Results - Segment Operating Results' for information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations.\n\n## 2022 versus 2021\n\nNet revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $47.37 billion for 2022, 20% lower than a strong 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower other principal transactions revenues and investment banking revenues, partially offset by significantly higher market making revenues.\n\nNon-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $7.36 billion for 2022, 48% lower than a strong 2021, due to significantly lower revenues in both equity and debt underwriting, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide volumes, and lower revenues in advisory, reflecting a decline in industrywide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions from elevated activity levels in the prior year.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n63",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nInvestment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $9.01 billion for 2022, 10% higher than 2021, due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the inclusion of NNIP and a reduction in fee\n\nwaivers on money market funds. Commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $4.03 billion for 2022, 12% higher than 2021, primarily due to higher commissions and fees in Equities, reflecting generally higher volumes.\n\nMarket making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $18.63 billion for 2022, 21% higher than 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher revenues in interest rate products, currencies and commodities, partially offset by lower revenues in equity products.\n\nOther principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $654 million for 2022, compared with $11.62 billion for 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities, significant mark-to-market net losses from investments in public equities and net mark-downs in debt investments compared with net mark-ups in 2021.\n\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $7.68 billion for 2022, 19% higher than 2021, reflecting an increase in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements, other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks, each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates, and loans, reflecting the impact of higher average balances and higher average interest rates. The increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, collateralized financings, and borrowings, each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates, and deposits, reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates and higher average balances. See 'Statistical Disclosures -Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity' for further information about our sources of net interest income.\n\n## 2021 versus 2020\n\nNet revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $59.34 billion for 2021, 33% higher than 2020, reflecting significantly higher other principal transactions revenues, investment banking revenues and net interest income, and higher investment management revenues. Non-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in\n\nthe consolidated statements of earnings were $14.14 billion for 2021, 55% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher revenues in advisory, reflecting a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, in equity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wide initial public offerings activity, and in debt underwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged finance activity.\n\n64\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nInvestment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $8.17 billion for 2021, 17% higher than 2020, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by higher fee waivers on money market funds. In addition, incentive fees were\n\nsignificantly higher, primarily driven by harvesting. Commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.59 billion for 2021, essentially unchanged compared with 2020.\n\nMarket making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $15.36 billion for 2021, essentially unchanged compared with 2020, as significantly lower revenues in interest rate products and credit products were largely offset by significantly higher revenues in equity products (primarily in derivatives) and commodities, and improved results in mortgages.\n\nOther principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $11.62 billion for 2021, compared with $4.76 billion for 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities and in debt instruments, partially offset by net losses from investments in public equities compared with significant net gains in 2020.\n\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $6.47 billion for 2021, 36% higher than 2020, reflecting a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in interest income. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, deposits and long-term borrowings, each reflecting the impact of lower interest rates. The decrease in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements and trading assets, both reflecting the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average balances for loans.

Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $2.72 billion for 2022, compared with $357 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and net charge-offs. Provisions for 2021 reflected portfolio growth in the credit card and wholesale portfolios, largely offset by reserve reductions as the broader economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2021 versus 2020. Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $357 million for 2021, compared with $3.10 billion for 2020. Provisions for 2021 reflected portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards, including approximately $185 million of provisions related to the commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio), largely offset by reserve reductions on wholesale and consumer loans reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment. This followed challenging conditions in the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to significant provisions in 2020.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOur operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, net of provision for credit losses, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment.\n\nThe table below presents our operating expenses by line item and headcount.\n\nYear Ended December\n\n| $ in millions                  | 2022 2021 2020   | 2022 2021 2020   | 2022 2021 2020   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Compensation and benefits      | $15,148          | $17,719          | $13,309          |\n| Transaction based              | 5,312            | 4,710            | 4,141            |\n| Market development             | 812              | 553              | 401              |\n| Communications and technology  | 1,808            | 1,573            | 1,347            |\n| Depreciation and amortization  | 2,455            | 2,015            | 1,902            |\n| Occupancy                      | 1,026            | 981              | 960              |\n| Professional fees              | 1,887            | 1,648            | 1,306            |\n| Other expenses                 | 2,716            | 2,739            | 5,617            |\n| Total operating expenses p g p | $31,164          | $31,938          | $28,983          |\n| Headcount at period-end        | 48,500           | 43,900           | 40,500           |\n\n2022 versus 2021. Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $31.16 billion for 2022, 2% lower than 2021. Our efficiency ratio was 65.8% for 2022, compared with our medium-term target efficiency ratio of approximately 60%. Our efficiency ratio was 53.8% for\n\n2021. The decrease in operating expenses compared with 2021 was primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). This decrease was partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses, reflecting the inclusion of NNIP and GreenSky and increases in transaction based expenses and technology expenses. While certain expenses (e.g., compensation and benefits, occupancy and market development) were impacted by inflationary pressures, the overall impact of higher inflation was not material to our operating expenses for 2022.\n\nNet provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were $576 million for 2022 compared with $534 million for 2021.\n\nHeadcount increased 10% during 2022, primarily reflecting investments in growth initiatives and the acquisitions of NNIP and GreenSky.\n\n2021 versus 2020. Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $31.94 billion for 2021, 10% higher than 2020. Our efficiency ratio was 53.8% for 2021, compared with 65.0% for 2020. In 2020, net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings increased our efficiency ratio by 7.6 percentage points.\n\nThe increase in operating expenses compared with 2020 primarily reflected significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance). In addition, technology expenses and professional fees were significantly higher and transaction based expenses were higher. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and lower expenses related to consolidated investments (including impairments).\n\nNet provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were $534 million for 2021 compared with $3.42 billion for 2020. Charitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives were\n\napproximately $250 million for 2021. Headcount increased 8% during 2021, reflecting investments\n\nin growth initiatives and an increase in technology professionals.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n65",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nProvision for Taxes The effective income tax rate for 2022 was 16.5%, down from the full year income tax rate of 20.0% for 2021, primarily due to an increase in the impact of permanent tax benefits, partially offset by changes in the geographic mix of\n\nearnings in 2022 compared with 2021. The U.K. Finance Act 2021 increased the corporate income tax rate by six percent and the Finance Act 2022 decreased the U.K. bank surcharge tax rate by five percent effective from April 1, 2023. As a result, beginning April 1, 2023, the U.K. tax rate for our U.K. regulated broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries and branches, including Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB), will increase by one percent and the U.K. tax rate for all other U.K. subsidiaries and branches will increase by six percent. During 2022, following Royal Assent of Finance Act 2022, certain U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured and a net reduction in deferred tax assets of approximately $50 million was recognized.\n\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes income tax incentives to encourage investments in clean energy and a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT). The CAMT applies to corporations with average annual profits over $1 billion and is calculated on their financial statement income, with certain adjustments, for years beginning after December 31, 2022. The legislation had no impact on our 2022 annual effective tax rate and based on our current understanding of the CAMT, is not expected to have a material impact on our 2023 annual effective tax rate.\n\n## Segment Assets and Operating Results\n\nSegment Assets.

The allocation of assets includes allocation of GCLA (which consists of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash), which is generally included within cash and cash equivalents, collateralized agreements and trading assets on our balance sheet. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating these assets. See 'Risk Management Liquidity Risk Management' for further information about our GCLA.\n\n66\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nSegment Operating Results.\n\nThe table below presents our\n\nsegment operating results.\n\n|                                                       |                  | Year Ended December   |                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| $ in millions                                         | 2022             | 2021                  | 2020           |\n| Global Banking & Markets                              |                  |                       |                |\n| Net revenues                                          | $ 32,487 $36,734 | $ 30,469              |                |\n| Provision for credit losses                           | 468              | (171)                 | 1,216          |\n| Operating expenses                                    | 17,851           | 19,542                | 18,884         |\n| Pre-tax earnings                                      | $ 14,168         | $17,363               | $ 10,369       |\n| Net earnings to common                                | $ 11,458         | $13,535 $             | 7,428          |\n| Average common equity Return on average common equity | $ 69,951 16.4%   | $60,064 22.5%         | $ 54,749 13.6% |\n| Asset & Wealth Management                             | $ 13,376         | $21,965               | $ 13,757       |\n| Net revenues                                          |                  |                       |                |\n| Provision for credit losses                           | 519              | (169)                 | 1,395          |\n| Operating expenses                                    | 11,550           | 11,406                | 9,469          |\n| Pre-tax earnings                                      | $ 1,307          | $10,728 $             | 2,893          |\n| Net earnings to common Average common equity          | $ 979 $ 31,762   | $ 8,459 $ $29,988     | 2,083 $ 24,963 |\n| Return on average common equity                       | 3.1%             | 28.2%                 | 8.3%           |\n| Platform Solutions                                    |                  |                       |                |\n| Net revenues                                          | $ 1,502 $        | 640 $                 | 334            |\n| Provision for credit losses                           | 1,728            | 697                   | 487            |\n| Operating expenses                                    | 1,763            |                       |                |\n| Pre-tax earnings/(loss)                               | $ (1,989)        | 990 $(1,047) $        | 630 (783)      |\n| Net earnings/(loss) to common                         | $ (1,673) $      | (843) $               | (596)          |\n| Average common equity                                 | $ 3,574          | $ 1,777 $             | 864            |\n| Return on average common equity                       | (46.8)%          | (47.4)%               | (69.0)%        |\n| Total                                                 |                  |                       |                |\n| Net revenues                                          | $ 47,365         | $59,339               | $ 44,560       |\n| Provision for credit losses                           | 2,715            | 357                   | 3,098          |\n| Operating expenses                                    | 31,164           | 31,938                | 28,983         |\n| Pre-tax earnings                                      | $ 13,486         | $27,044               | $ 12,479       |\n| Net earnings to common                                | $ 10,764         | $21,151 $             | 8,915          |\n| Average common equity                                 | $105,287         | $91,829               | $ 80,576       |\n| Return on average common equity                       | 10.2%            | 23.0%                 | 11.1%          |\n\nNet revenues in our segments include allocations of interest income and expense to specific positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, such positions.

Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment's pre-tax earnings. Compensation and benefits expenses within our segments\n\nreflect, among other factors, our overall performance, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of our business may be significantly affected by the performance of our other business segments. A description of segment operating results follows.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nMarket-Making Activities As a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. In this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In addition, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). Our inventory is recorded in trading assets (long positions) or trading liabilities (short positions) in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nOur results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). Due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations.\n\nThe amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties.\n\nIn general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widening of credit spreads on our inventory positions. Other. We lend to corporate clients, including through\n\nrelationship lending and acquisition financing. The hedges related to this lending and financing activity are also reported as part of Other.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n- In the table above:\n- \u00b7 Volumes are per Dealogic. \u00b7 Announced and completed mergers and acquisitions volumes are based on full credit to each of the advisors in a transaction. Equity and equity-related and debt offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or a change in the value of a transaction.\n- \u00b7 Equity and equity-related offerings includes Rule 144A and public common stock offerings, convertible offerings and rights offerings.\n- \u00b7 Debt offerings includes non-convertible preferred stock, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and taxable municipal debt. It also includes publicly registered and Rule 144A issues and excludes leveraged loans.\n\nOperating Environment. During 2022, Global Banking & Markets operated in an environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which negatively affected industry-wide investment banking activity levels, particularly for underwriting, but contributed to solid market-making activity levels.\n\nIn investment banking, compared with 2021, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes were low amid volatile equity markets and a decline in prices, and industry-wide debt underwriting volumes declined across leveraged finance and investment grade issuances amid rising interest rates. Additionally, industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions declined from elevated levels in the prior year.\n\nFor volatility, the average daily VIX was 30% higher compared with 2021. In equities, the S&P 500 Index decreased by 19% and the MSCI World Index decreased by 20%, compared with the end of 2021. Additionally, global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate\n\nfurther, and activity levels or volatility decline, or credit spreads related to hedges on our relationship lending portfolio tighten, net revenues in Global Banking & Markets would likely be negatively impacted. In addition, if economic conditions deteriorate further or if the creditworthiness of borrowers deteriorates, provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted.\n\n70\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n2022 versus 2021. Net revenues in Global Banking & Markets were $32.49 billion for 2022, 12% lower than a\n\nstrong 2021. Investment banking fees were $7.36 billion, 48% lower than a strong 2021, due to significantly lower net revenues in both Equity and Debt underwriting, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide volumes, and lower net revenues in Advisory, reflecting a decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions from elevated activity levels in the prior year.\n\nAs of December 2022, our Investment banking fees backlog decreased significantly compared with the end of 2021, primarily due to significantly lower estimated net revenues from both potential advisory transactions and potential debt underwriting transactions (primarily from leveraged finance transactions).\n\nOur backlog represents an estimate of our net revenues from future transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time. In addition, our backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur.\n\nNet revenues in FICC were $14.68 billion, 38% higher than 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in FICC intermediation, driven by significantly higher net revenues in interest rate products, currencies and commodities, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in mortgages and lower net revenues in credit products. In addition, net revenues in FICC financing were significantly higher, primarily driven by secured lending.\n\nThe increase in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected significantly higher client activity as we supported clients amid an evolving macroeconomic environment. The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared with 2021 results: \u00b7 Net revenues in interest rate products, currencies and\n\n- commodities primarily reflected higher client activity. \u00b7 Net revenues in mortgages and credit products primarily\n- reflected the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nNet revenues in Equities were $10.99 billion, 6% lower than 2021, due to lower net revenues in Equities intermediation, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in cash products and lower net revenues in derivatives. Net revenues in Equities financing were higher, primarily reflecting increased\n\nclient activity. Net revenues in Other were $(537) million for 2022, compared with $265 million for 2021, reflecting significantly lower net gains from investments in equities and net markdowns on acquisition financing activities.\n\nProvision for credit losses was $468 million for 2022, compared with a net benefit of $171 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected the impact of broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, while the net benefit for 2021 reflected reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by growth in the portfolio.\n\nOperating expenses were $17.85 billion for 2022, 9% lower than 2021, reflecting lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). Pre-tax earnings were $14.17 billion for 2022, 18% lower than 2021.\n\n2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Global Banking & Markets were $36.73 billion for 2021, 21% higher than 2020.\n\nInvestment banking fees were $14.14 billion, 55% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher net revenues in Advisory, reflecting a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, in Equity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wide initial public offerings activity, and in Debt underwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged finance activity.\n\nAs of December 2021, our Investment banking fees backlog increased significantly compared with December 2020, due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions and potential debt underwriting transactions (particularly from leveraged finance transactions), and higher estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions. Net revenues in FICC were $10.61 billion, 7% lower than\n\n2020, due to lower net revenues in FICC intermediation, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in interest rate products and credit products and slightly lower net revenues in currencies, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in mortgages and higher net revenues in commodities. Net revenues in FICC financing were significantly higher, reflecting significantly higher net revenues from secured lending, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues from resale agreements.\n\nThe decrease in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected strong but significantly lower client activity compared with very strong activity levels in the prior year due to high volatility amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory compared with challenging conditions in the prior year. The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared\n\nwith 2020 results:\n\n- \u00b7 Net revenues in interest rate products primarily reflected lower client activity.\n- \u00b7 Net revenues in credit products and currencies reflected lower client activity, partially offset by the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory.\n- \u00b7 Net revenues in mortgages reflected the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory.\n- \u00b7 Net revenues in commodities primarily reflected higher client activity.\n\nNet revenues in Equities were $11.72 billion, 19% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher net revenues in Equities financing, primarily reflecting increased activity (including higher average client balances), and higher net revenues in Equities intermediation, primarily reflecting higher net revenues in derivatives.\n\nNet revenues in Other were $265 million for 2021, compared with $32 million for 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from investments in equities.\n\nProvision for credit losses was a net benefit of $171 million for 2021, compared with net provisions of $1.22 billion for 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the year reflecting continued improvement in the broad economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by portfolio growth.\n\nOperating expenses were $19.54 billion for 2021, 3% higher than 2020, primarily due to significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance) and higher transaction based expenses, largely offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. Pre-tax earnings were $17.36 billion, 67% higher than 2020. ROE was 22.5% for 2021, compared with 13.6% for 2020 (which included the impact of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings that reduced ROE by 5.4 percentage points).\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n71",

During 2022, Asset & Wealth Management operated in an environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which contributed to a decrease in asset prices compared to the end of 2021, negatively affecting assets under supervision and investments. Additionally, global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate\n\nfurther, it may lead to a continued decline in asset prices, or investors transitioning to asset classes that typically generate lower fees or withdrawing their assets or deposits, and net revenues in Asset & Wealth Management would likely continue to be negatively impacted. 2022 versus 2021. Net revenues in Asset & Wealth\n\nManagement were $13.38 billion for 2022, 39% lower than 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Debt investments.\n\n74\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nBroad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns during the year led to a decline in global equity prices and wider credit spreads. As a result, net revenues in Equity investments reflected significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities and significant mark-to-market net losses from investments in public equities. The decrease in Debt investments net revenues reflected net mark-downs compared with net mark-ups in the prior year and lower net interest income. Incentive fees were significantly lower, primarily driven by harvesting in the prior year. Management and other fees were higher, reflecting the inclusion of NNIP and a reduction in fee waivers on money market funds. Private banking and lending net revenues were significantly higher, primarily reflecting higher deposit spreads, as well as higher loan and deposit balances.\n\nProvision for credit losses was $519 million for 2022, compared with a net benefit of $169 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, while the net benefit for 2021 reflected reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOperating expenses were $11.55 billion for 2022, essentially unchanged compared with 2021, reflecting the inclusion of operating expenses related to NNIP, largely offset by lower compensation and benefits expenses. Pre-tax earnings were $1.31 billion for 2022, compared with $10.73 billion for 2021.\n\n2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Asset & Wealth Management were $21.97 billion for 2021, 60% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Equity investments and Debt investments, and higher Management and other fees.\n\nThe increase in Equity investments net revenues reflected significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities, driven by company-specific events and improved corporate performance compared with 2020, partially offset by net losses from investments in public equities compared with significant net gains in the prior year. The increase in Debt investments net revenues reflected net mark-ups compared with net mark-downs in the prior year, and significantly higher net interest income. The increase in management and other fees reflected the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by higher fee waivers on money market funds. Private banking and lending net revenues were higher, primarily reflecting higher deposit balances. Incentive fees were significantly higher, primarily driven by harvesting. Provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $169 million\n\nfor 2021, compared with net provisions of $1.40 billion for 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the year reflecting continued improvement in the broad economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These incentive fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees were $3.33 billion as of December 2022, $3.39 billion as of December 2021 and $1.79 billion as of December 2020. Such amounts are based on the completion of the funds' financial statements, which is generally one quarter in arrears. These fees will be recognized, assuming no decline in fair value, if and when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of the assets. Our target is to achieve annual firmwide management and\n\nother fees of more than $10 billion (including more than $2 billion from alternatives) in 2024.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n75",

During 2022, Platform Solutions operated in an environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic concerns. In the U.S., the rate of unemployment remained low and consumer spending increased slightly compared with 2021. Additionally, global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate\n\nfurther, it may lead to a decrease in consumer spending or a deterioration in consumer credit, and net revenues and provision for credit losses in Platform Solutions would likely be negatively impacted.\n\n2022 versus 2021. Net revenues in Platform Solutions were $1.50 billion for 2022, 135% higher than 2021, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in both Consumer platforms\n\nand Transaction banking and other. The increase in Consumer platforms net revenues primarily reflected significantly higher credit card balances. The increase in Transaction banking and other net revenues\n\nreflected higher deposit balances. Provision for credit losses was $1.73 billion for 2022, compared with $697 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio and net charge offs, while 2021 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, which was partially offset by reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOperating expenses were $1.76 billion for 2022, 78% higher than 2021, reflecting higher spend on growth initiatives in Consumer platforms, primarily from the inclusion of operating expenses related to GreenSky. Pre-tax loss was $1.99 billion for 2022, compared with $1.05 billion for 2021.\n\n2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Platform Solutions were $640 million for 2021, 92% higher than 2020, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Consumer platforms and higher net revenues in Transaction banking and other.\n\nNet revenues in Consumer platforms reflected higher credit card balances. Net revenues in Transaction banking and other reflected higher deposit balances.\n\nProvision for credit losses was $697 million for 2021, 43% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting growth in the credit card portfolio, including approximately $185 million of the provisions related to the commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio, partially offset by reserve reductions in the year reflecting continued improvement in the broad economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOperating expenses were $990 million for 2021, 57% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting higher spend on growth initiatives in Consumer platforms. Pre-tax loss was $1.05 billion for 2021, compared with $783 million for 2020.

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Balance Sheet and Funding Sources\n\nBalance Sheet Management One of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors, including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. See 'Capital Management and Regulatory Capital Capital Management' for information about our capital management process.\n\nAlthough our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day basis, our total assets at quarter-end are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods.\n\nIn order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses.\n\nBalance Sheet Planning. We prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. The objectives of this planning process are:\n\n- \u00b7 To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements;\n- \u00b7 To allow Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from our revenue-producing units in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and capital levels, and key metrics; and\n- \u00b7 To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities.\n\nTreasury and our independent risk oversight and control\n\nfunctions, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage.\n\n80\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nOur consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee. See 'Risk Management - Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for an overview of our risk\n\nmanagement structure. Balance Sheet Limits. The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee have the responsibility to review and approve balance sheet limits. These limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions on a routine basis. Requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits is monitored by our revenueproducing units and Treasury, as well as our independent risk oversight and control functions.\n\nMonitoring of Key Metrics. We monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. We attribute assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations.\n\nScenario Analyses. We conduct various scenario analyses, including as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Stress Tests (DFAST), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. See 'Capital Management and Regulatory Capital - Capital Management' for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover short- and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and capital. Additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nBalance Sheet Analysis and Metrics As of December 2022, total assets in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.44 trillion, a decrease of $22.19 billion from December 2021, reflecting decreases in trading assets of $74.67 billion (primarily due to decreases in equity securities, corporate debt instruments, reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities), customer and other receivables of $25.23 billion (primarily reflecting client activity), cash and cash equivalents of $19.21 billion (primarily reflecting our activity), partially offset by increases in investments of $41.91 billion (primarily due to an increase in U.S. government obligations accounted for as held-to-maturity), collateralized agreements of $29.68 billion (primarily reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities), and loans of $20.72 billion (reflecting increases in other collateralized and consumer loans).\n\nAs of December 2022, total liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.32 trillion, a decrease of $29.45 billion from December 2021, reflecting decreases in collateralized financings of $75.91 billion (primarily reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities), partially offset by increases in deposits of $22.44 billion (primarily due to increases in transaction banking and private bank and consumer deposits, partially offset by other deposits), customer and other payables of $10.11 billion (primarily reflecting client activity), and trading liabilities of $9.90 billion (primarily due to an increase in equity securities, partially offset by a decrease in government obligations, both reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities).\n\nOur total repurchase agreements, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $110.35 billion as of December 2022 and $165.88 billion as of December 2021, which were 15% lower as of December 2022 and 3% higher as of December 2021 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective quarters, and 27% lower as of December 2022 and 14% higher as of December 2021 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective years. As of December 2022, the decrease in our repurchase agreements relative to the average daily amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter and year resulted from lower levels of our and our clients' activities at the end of the period. The level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between\n\nand within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as certain government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities.\n\nThe table below presents information about our balance\n\nsheet and leverage ratios.\n\n|                                | As of December   |             |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|-------------|\n| $ in millions                  | 2022             | 2021        |\n| Total assets                   | $ 1,441,799      | $ 1,463,988 |\n| Unsecured long-term borrowings | $ 247,138 $      | 254,092     |\n| Total shareholders' equity     | $ 117,189 $      | 109,926     |\n| Leverage ratio                 | 12.3x            | 13.3x       |\n\nDebt-to-equity ratio\n\n2.1x\n\n2.3x\n\nIn the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 The leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders' equity and measures the proportion of equity and debt we use to finance assets.

We also use our own inventory and investments to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding and pre-funding residual risk through our GCLA.\n\nWe seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. Our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts.\n\nAssets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage- and other asset-backed loans and securities, non-investment-grade corporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities.\n\nWe also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. We had no outstanding borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank as of December 2022 and $100 million as of December 2021. Additionally, we have access to funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. However, we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing.",

A significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally longterm debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. We use unsecured short-term borrowings, including U.S. and non-U.S. hybrid financial instruments and commercial paper, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. In accordance with regulatory requirements, Group Inc. does not issue debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings.\n\nUnsecured Long-Term Borrowings. Unsecured long-term borrowings, including structured notes, are raised through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and Rule 144A medium-term note programs, offshore medium-term note offerings and other debt offerings. We issue in different tenors, currencies and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base.\n\nThe table below presents our quarterly unsecured long-term borrowings maturity profile.\n\n| $ in millions           | First Quarter Second Quarter    | Third Quarter Fourth Quarter      | Total     |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|\n| As of December 2022     |                                 |                                   |           |\n| 2024                    |                                 | $18,136 $11,053 $ 9,964 $11,858 $ | 51,011    |\n| 2025                    | $12,131 $10,681 $ 6,443 $ 7,887 |                                   | 37,142    |\n| 2026                    | $ 5,862 $ 3,835 $ 3,278 $ 9,227 |                                   | 22,202    |\n| 2027                    |                                 | $ 8,580 $ 3,435 $ 6,568 $11,777   | 30,360    |\n| 2028 - thereafter Total |                                 |                                   | 106,423   |\n|                         |                                 |                                   | $ 247,138 |\n\nThe weighted average maturity of our unsecured long-term borrowings as of December 2022 was approximately six years. To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing over the course of any monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual time horizon. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations to manage our exposure to interest rates. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings. We issued approximately $28 billion of benchmark debt during 2022, and we intend to issue significantly less benchmark debt in 2023 compared to our benchmark debt issuance in 2022, though actual issuances may differ due to business needs and market opportunities. Shareholders' Equity. Shareholders' equity is a stable and\n\nperpetual source of funding. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our shareholders' equity.\n\nCapital Management and Regulatory Capital Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and\n\n## stressed conditions.\n\nCapital Management We determine the appropriate amount and composition of our capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets.\n\nWe manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on the balance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the firmwide and business levels.\n\nWe principally manage the level and composition of our capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock.\n\nWe may issue, redeem or repurchase our preferred stock and subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to such redemptions or repurchases, we must receive approval from the FRB. See Notes 14 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock and subordinated debt.\n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing Process. As part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues.\n\nOur capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n83",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOur stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required by the FRB, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in 'Business - Available Information' in Part I, Item 1 of this\n\nForm 10-K. As required by the FRB's CCAR rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB's review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress.\n\nThe FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions. The FRB determines the stress capital buffer (SCB) applicable to us based on its own annual stress test. The SCB under the Standardized approach is calculated as (i) the difference between our starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs).\n\nBased on our 2022 CCAR submission, the FRB reduced our SCB from 6.4% to 6.3% for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. As a result, beginning on October 1, 2022, our Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement was 13.3%. Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, our G-SIB surcharge increased from 2.5% to 3.0%, resulting in a Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement of 13.8%. See 'Share Repurchase Program' for further information about common stock repurchases and dividends and 'Consolidated Regulatory Capital' for further information about the G-SIB surcharge. We published a summary of our annual DFAST results in June 2022. See 'Business - Available Information' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. GS Bank USA is required to conduct stress tests on an annual\n\nbasis and publish a summary of certain results. GS Bank USA published a summary of its annual DFAST results in June 2022. See 'Business - Available Information' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\n\n84\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nGSI, GSIB and GSBE also have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the\n\nguidelines of their respective regulators. Contingency Capital Plan. As part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders.\n\nCapital Attribution. We assess the capital usage of each of our businesses based on our attributed equity framework. This framework considers many factors, including our internal assessment of risks as well as the regulatory capital requirements related to our business activities. These regulatory capital requirements take into consideration our most binding capital constraints. Our most binding capital constraint is our CET1 capital ratio requirement under the Standardized Capital Rules. This requirement includes the SCB which is determined by the FRB based on its own annual stress test.\n\nShare Repurchase Program. We use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) approved an increase in our common stock dividend from $2.00 to $2.50 per share. During 2022, we returned a total of $6.70 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $3.50 billion and common stock dividends of $3.20 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we returned a total of $2.38 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.50 billion and common stock dividends of $880 million. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will continue prioritizing deployment of capital for our clients where returns are attractive and return any excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter of 2023 through February 23, 2023, our common stock repurchases were approximately $2.25 billion.",

In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a one percent non-deductible excise tax (buyback tax) on the fair market value of certain corporate share repurchases after December 31, 2022. The fair market value of share repurchases subject to the tax is reduced by the fair market value of any stock issued during the calendar year, including stock issued to employees. Based on our current understanding, we do not expect the buyback tax to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in 2023.\n\nResolution Capital Models. In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established a Resolution Capital Adequacy and Positioning framework, which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI, GSIB, GSBE, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International) have access to sufficient lossabsorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.\n\nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\n\n## Rating Agency Guidelines The credit rating\n\nagencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. GS&Co. and GSI have been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS Bank USA, GSIB and GSBE have also been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long- and short-term bank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of Group Inc.\n\nThe level and composition of our capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. See 'Risk Management Liquidity Risk Management - Credit Ratings' for further information about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS Bank\n\nUSA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&Co. and GSI.\n\nConsolidated Regulatory Capital We are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). Under the Capital Framework, we are an 'Advanced approaches' banking organization and have been designated as a G-SIB.\n\nThe capital requirements calculated under the Capital Framework include the capital conservation buffer requirements, which are comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), the SCB (under the Standardized Capital Rules), a countercyclical capital buffer (under both Capital Rules) and the G-SIB surcharge (under both Capital Rules). Our G-SIB surcharge was 2.5% for 2022 and is 3.0% for 2023 and 2024. The G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer in the future may differ due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes, and our SCB is likely to change from year to year based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. Our target is to maintain capital ratios equal to the regulatory requirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100 basis points.\n\nSee Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios, and the Capital Framework.\n\n## Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)\n\nWe are also subject to the FRB's TLAC and related requirements. Failure to comply with the TLAC and related requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the FRB and could limit our ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n85",

GS&Co., our primary U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiary, is also a registered futures commission merchant and a registered swap dealer with the CFTC, and a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC, and therefore is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., the CFTC, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the National Futures Association. Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC and Rules 1.17 and Part 23 Subpart E of the CFTC specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants' assets be kept in relatively liquid form.

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOther Matters Replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), including LIBOR. On January 1, 2022, the publication of all EUR, CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR (non-USD LIBOR) settings along with certain USD LIBOR settings ceased. The publication of the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings as representative rates will cease after June 2023. The FCA has allowed the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain GBP LIBOR settings in legacy GBP LIBOR-based derivative contracts through March 2024. The FCA has proposed to allow the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain USD LIBOR settings in legacy USD LIBOR-based derivative contracts through September 2024. The U.S. federal banking agencies' guidance strongly encourages banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR.\n\nThe International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (IBOR Protocol) has provided derivatives market participants with amended fallbacks for legacy and new derivative contracts to mitigate legal or economic uncertainty. Both counterparties have to adhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in bilateral amendments for the terms to be effective for derivative contracts. ISDA has confirmed that the FCA's formal announcement to cease both non-USD and USD LIBOR settings fixed the spread adjustment for all LIBOR rates and as a result fallbacks applied automatically for non-USD LIBOR settings following December 31, 2021 and will apply automatically for USD LIBOR settings following June 30, 2023. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, that was enacted in March 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for contracts governed by U.S. law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of a poll or LIBOR-based rate. In December 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule that implements the LIBOR Act, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. The final rule identifies different SOFR-based replacement rates for derivative contracts, for cash instruments such as floating-rate notes and preferred stock, for consumer contracts, for certain government-sponsored enterprise contracts and for certain student loan securitizations that lack a fallback to an alternative rate when USD LIBOR ceases to be published on June 30, 2023. We facilitated an orderly transition from non-USD LIBORs\n\nto alternative risk-free reference rates and synthetic rates for us and our clients, and continue to make progress on our transition program as it relates to USD LIBOR.\n\n88\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nOur risk exposure to USD LIBOR is primarily in connection with our derivative contracts and, to a lesser extent, our unsecured debt, preferred stock and loan portfolio. As of December 2022, the notional amount of our USD LIBORbased derivative contracts was approximately $6 trillion, of which approximately $5 trillion will mature after June 2023 based on their contractual terms. Substantially all of such derivative contracts are with counterparties under bilateral agreements subject to the IBOR Protocol, or with central clearing counterparties or exchanges which have incorporated fallbacks consistent with the IBOR Protocol in their rulebooks and have announced that they plan to convert USD LIBOR contracts to alternative risk-free reference rates. Our unsecured benchmark debt and preferred stock with USD LIBOR exposure was approximately $29.0 billion as of December 2022, of which $26.4 billion will contractually mature after June 2023 or is perpetual and has no stated maturity date. Under the FRB's final rule and the LIBOR Act, we will replace our USD LIBOR-based unsecured benchmark debt and preferred stock with term SOFR plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread. This transition will take place following USD LIBOR cessation on June 30, 2023. In addition, our USD LIBOR-based loans were approximately $33.1 billion as of December 2022, of which approximately $30.5 billion will mature after June 2023 based on their contractual terms. A vast majority of such loans contain fallback provisions in the related loan agreements and we are actively engaging with our clients and syndicate partners to remediate the remaining loans agreements.\n\nWe have also issued debt and deposits linked to SOFR and Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and executed SOFR- and SONIA-based derivative contracts to make markets and facilitate client activities. When appropriate, we continue to execute transactions in the market to reduce our USD LIBOR exposures arising from hedges to our fixed-rate debt issuances and replace them with alternative risk-free reference rate exposures.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nRisk Management Risks are inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks. For further information about our risk management processes, see 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management,' and for information about our areas of risk, see 'Liquidity Risk Management,' 'Market Risk Management,' 'Credit Risk Management,' 'Operational Risk Management,' 'Model Risk Management' and 'Other Risk Management,' as well as 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Overview and Structure of Risk Management\n\n## Overview\n\nWe believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people.\n\nGovernance. Risk management governance starts with the Board, which both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee, oversees our risk management policies and practices implemented through the enterprise risk management framework. The Board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. The risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to achieve our objectives included in our strategic business plan, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board reviews our strategic business plan and is ultimately responsible for overseeing and providing direction about our strategy and risk appetite.\n\n90\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk, model risk and climate risk, from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from Compliance, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from the chief legal officer, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair and vice-chairs of our Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The chief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the Risk Committee of the Board. As part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement.\n\nThe implementation of our risk governance structure and core risk management processes is overseen by Enterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, and is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management framework provides the Board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite.\n\nOur revenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, Engineering, Human Capital Management, Operations, and Corporate and Workplace Solutions, are considered our first line of defense. They are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-generating activities, as well as for assessing and managing those risks within our risk appetite.\n\nOur independent risk oversight and control functions are considered our second line of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in risk committees. Independent risk oversight and control functions include Compliance, Conflicts Resolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk and Tax.\n\nInternal Audit is considered our third line of defense, and our director of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively to our chief executive officer. Internal Audit includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. Internal Audit is responsible for independently assessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those within the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nThe three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line and empowers\n\nindependent review from the third line. Processes. We maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk management framework, including (i) risk identification and control assessment, (ii) risk appetite, limit and threshold setting, (iii) risk metrics, reporting and monitoring, and (iv) risk decision-making.\n\n- \u00b7 Risk Identification and Control Assessment. We believe the identification of our risks and related control assessment is a critical step in providing our Board and senior management transparency and insight into the range and materiality of our risks. We have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures that require all employees to report and escalate risk events. Our approach for risk identification and control assessment is comprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile and business environment, leverages subject matter expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks. This approach also encompasses our control assessment, led by our second line of defense, to review and challenge the control environment to ensure it supports our strategic business plan.\n\nTo effectively assess our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures.\n\nAn important part of our risk management process is firmwide stress testing. It allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process. See 'Capital Management and Regulatory Capital - Capital Management' for further information.\n\n- \u00b7 Risk Appetite, Limit and Threshold Setting. We apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectly through its Risk Committee, approves limits and thresholds included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee, through delegated authority from the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee, is responsible for approving our risk limits and thresholds policy, subject to the overall limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, and monitoring these limits.\n\nThe Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of riskrelated matters. Additionally, through delegated authority from the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee, Market Risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance.\n\n- \u00b7 Risk Metrics, Reporting and Monitoring. Effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. As such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems provide us with complete, accurate and timely information. Our risk metrics, reporting and monitoring processes are designed to take into account information about both existing and emerging risks, thereby enabling our risk committees and senior management to perform their responsibilities with the appropriate level of insight into risk exposures. Furthermore, our limit and threshold breach processes provide means for timely escalation. We evaluate changes in our risk profile and our businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring risk factors at a firmwide level.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n91",

Our governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decisionmaking on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. We make extensive use of risk committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing\n\ndiscussions to manage and mitigate risks. We maintain strong and proactive communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decisionmaking among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management. While our first line of defense is responsible for management of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to our second line of defense in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. We regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all functions.\n\nPeople. Even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. The experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guides us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels.\n\nWe reinforce a culture of effective risk management, consistent with our risk appetite, in our training and development programs, as well as in the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. Our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. As part of our performance review process, we assess reputational excellence, including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. Our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards.\n\n92\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nStructure Ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee. We also have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our first and second lines of defense. We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional sub-committees, councils or working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact on our reputation of the transactions and activities that they oversee.\n\nMembership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. Accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members.\n\nThe chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nLiquidity Risk Management Principles We manage liquidity risk according to three principles: (i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii) maintain a viable\n\nContingency Funding Plan. GCLA. GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is to prefund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe that the securities held in our GCLA would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets.\n\nOur GCLA reflects the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company's survival;\n- \u00b7 Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment;\n- \u00b7 During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and\n- \u00b7 As a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger funding balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs.\n\nWe maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc.'s major brokerdealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to the GCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity.\n\nAsset-Liability Management. Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.\n\nOur approach to asset-liability management includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. See 'Balance Sheet and Funding Sources Funding Sources' for further information;\n- \u00b7 Actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and ability to fund assets on a secured basis. We assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. This enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. See 'Balance Sheet and Funding Sources - Balance Sheet Management' for further information about our balance sheet management process and '- Funding Sources - Secured Funding' for further information about asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and\n- \u00b7 Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. This reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n95",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOur goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, our independent risk oversight and control functions analyze, and the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders' equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquidity crisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis.\n\n## Subsidiary Funding Policies\n\nThe majority of our unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc., which provides the necessary funds to Funding IHC and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings.\n\nOur intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary's funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturity of such financing.\n\n96\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nGroup Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December 2022, Group Inc. had $39.33 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal U.S. registered broker-dealer; $47.74 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker-dealer; $2.62 billion invested in GSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $52.55 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York Statechartered bank; and $4.25 billion invested in GSIB, a regulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provides financing, directly or indirectly, in the form of: $108.14 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $52.93 billion) and $30.16 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities as of December 2022. In addition, as of December 2022, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries.\n\nContingency Funding Plan. We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution.\n\nThe contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering effective coordination, control and distribution of information, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress.",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nStress Tests In order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we model liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time horizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies our liquidity risks over a 30-day stress scenario. We also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity risk model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about firmwide stress tests.\n\nModeled Liquidity Outflow. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Severely challenged market environments, which include low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, and adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and\n- \u00b7 A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation and/or a ratings downgrade.\n\nThe following are key modeling elements of our Modeled Liquidity Outflow:\n\n- \u00b7 Liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario;\n- \u00b7 A two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings;\n- \u00b7 Changing conditions in funding markets, which limit our access to unsecured and secured funding; \u00b7 No support from additional government funding facilities.\n- Although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and\n- \u00b7 A combination of contractual outflows and contingent outflows arising from both our on- and off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual outflows include, among other things, upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, term deposits and secured funding. Contingent outflows include, among other things, the withdrawal of customer credit balances in our prime brokerage business, increase in variation margin requirements due to adverse changes in the value of our exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives, draws on unfunded commitments and withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. See notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about contractual outflows, including Note 11 for collateralized financings, Note 13 for deposits, Note 14 for unsecured long-term borrowings and Note 15 for operating lease payments, and 'Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements' for further information about our various types of off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\nIntraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday Liquidity Model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained.\n\nLong-Term Stress Testing. We utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. We are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.\n\nResolution Liquidity Models. In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. The liquidity needs are measured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. We have also established our Resolution Liquidity Execution Need framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy. In addition, we have established a triggers and alerts\n\nframework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n97",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nLimits We use liquidity risk limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. Limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about the\n\nlimit approval process. Limits are monitored by Treasury and Liquidity Risk.

Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a requirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding IHC is required to provide the necessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Liquidity held directly in each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In addition, the Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA directly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to support such requirements.\n\nOther Unencumbered Assets. In addition to our GCLA, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our GCLA. The fair value of our unencumbered assets averaged $273.49 billion for the three months ended December 2022, $271.65 billion for the three months ended December 2021, $275.69 billion for the year ended December 2022 and $249.32 billion for the year ended December 2021. We do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our GCLA.\n\n## Liquidity Regulatory Framework\n\nAs a BHC, we are subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR rule requires organizations to maintain an adequate ratio of eligible highquality liquid assets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows under an acute, short-term liquidity stress scenario.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nAs a BHC, we are subject to a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies, which requires large U.S. banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a one-year time horizon. The rule also requires disclosure of our quarterly average daily NSFR on a semiannual basis and a description of the banking organization's stable funding sources. We will begin doing so in August 2023. Our NSFR as of December 2022 exceeded the minimum requirement.\n\nThe following provides information about our subsidiary liquidity regulatory requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 GS Bank USA. GS Bank USA is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. As of December 2022, GS Bank USA's LCR exceeded the minimum requirement. The NSFR requirement described above also applies to GS Bank USA. As of December 2022, GS Bank USA's NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement.\n- \u00b7 GSI and GSIB. GSI and GSIB are subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.K. regulatory authorities. GSI's and GSIB's average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended December 2022 exceeded the minimum requirement. GSI and GSIB are subject to the applicable NSFR requirement in the U.K. As of December 2022, both GSI's and GSIB's NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement.\n- \u00b7 GSBE. GSBE is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the European Parliament and Council. GSBE's average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended December 2022 exceeded the minimum requirement. GSBE is subject to the applicable NSFR requirement in the E.U. As of December 2022, GSBE's NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement.\n- \u00b7 Other Subsidiaries. We monitor local regulatory liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance. For many of our subsidiaries, these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the Basel Committee's framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments. The implementation of these rules and any amendments\n\nadopted by the regulatory authorities could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future.\n\nCredit Ratings We rely on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as OTC derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term transactions.

See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for\n\nfurther information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings. 100 Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nCash Flows As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in\n\nour businesses. Year Ended December 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $19.21 billion to $241.83 billion at the end of 2022, primarily due to net cash used for investing activities, partially offset by net cash provided by financing activities. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected purchases of investments (primarily U.S. government obligations accounted for as held-to-maturity) and an increase in net lending activities (reflecting increases in other collateralized and consumer loans). The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected cash inflows from net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings and deposits (reflecting increases in transaction banking and private bank and consumer deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other deposits). The net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected cash inflows from trading assets and liabilities, customer and other receivables and payables, net (reflecting both a decrease in customer and other receivables and an increase in customer and other payables), net earnings and loans held for sale, net, partially offset by cash outflows from collateralized transactions (reflecting both a decrease in collateralized financings and an increase in collateralized agreements). The decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates was due to the U.S. dollar strengthening during the year. Such amount was $11.56 billion for 2022 ($3.42 billion for the three months ended March 2022, $10.34 billion for the six months ended June 2022 and $18.17 billion for the nine months ended September 2022).\n\nYear Ended December 2021 . Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $105.19 billion to $261.04 billion at the end of 2021, primarily due to net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in net deposits (reflecting increases across channels) and net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected purchases of investments and an increase in net lending activities, partially offset by sales and paydowns of investments. For an analysis of cash flows for the year ended December\n\n2020, see Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nMarket Risk Management\n\nOverview Market risk is the risk of an adverse impact to our earnings due to changes in market conditions. Our assets and liabilities that give rise to market risk primarily include positions held for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities, and these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. Categories of market risk include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads;\n- \u00b7 Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices;\n- \u00b7 Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and\n- \u00b7 Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals.\n\nMarket Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses.\n\nManagers in revenue-producing units, Treasury and Market Risk discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in revenueproducing units and Treasury are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have in-depth knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures.\n\nMarket Risk Management Process Our process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management,' as well\n\n- as the following: \u00b7 Monitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures;\n- \u00b7 Diversifying exposures;\n- \u00b7 Controlling position sizes; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives.\n\nOur market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR), Earningsat-Risk (EaR) and other stress measures, capture risk measures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position, report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner.\n\n## Risk Measures\n\nWe produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits. These measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels.\n\nWe use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short- and long-term time horizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, EaR and other stress tests.\n\nOur risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions.\n\nValue-at-Risk. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilities included in VaR, see 'Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures.' We typically employ a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. We use a single VaR model, which captures risks, including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n101",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nWe are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk\n\n- management process. Inherent limitations to VaR include: \u00b7 VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time\n- horizons where moves may be extreme; \u00b7 VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of\n- different risk positions; and \u00b7 Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves.\n\nTo comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our VaR calculation, we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position. These market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions, as well as variations in market conditions. We sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our positions included in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa.\n\nGiven its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions.\n\nOur VaR measure does not include:\n\n- \u00b7 Positions that are not accounted for at fair value, such as held-to-maturity securities and loans, deposits and unsecured borrowings that are accounted for at amortized cost;\n- \u00b7 Available-for-sale securities for which the related unrealized fair value gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss); \u00b7 Positions that are best measured and monitored using\n- sensitivity measures; and \u00b7 The impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit\n- spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. We perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e.,\n\ncomparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries.\n\n102\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nEarnings-at-Risk. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, we started managing our interest rate risk using the EaR metric. EaR measures the estimated impact of changes in interest rates to our net revenues and preferred stock dividends over a defined time horizon. EaR complements the VaR metric, which measures the impact of interest rate changes that have an immediate impact on the fair values of our assets and liabilities (i.e., mark-to-market changes). Our exposure to interest rate risk occurs due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Differences in maturity or repricing dates of assets, liabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet instruments.\n- \u00b7 Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet instruments with the same maturity or repricing dates.\n- \u00b7 Certain interest rate sensitive fees.\n\nTreasury manages the aggregated interest rate risk from all businesses through our investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives. We measure EaR over a one-year time horizon following a 100-basis point instantaneous parallel shock in both short- and long-term interest rates. This sensitivity is calculated relative to a baseline market scenario, which takes into consideration, among other things, the market's expectation of forward rates, as well as our expectation of future business activity. This scenario includes contractual elements of assets, liabilities, preferred stock, and certain off-balance sheet instruments, such as rates of interest, principal repayment schedules, maturity and reset dates, and any interest rate ceilings or floors, as well as assumptions with respect to our balance sheet size and composition, deposit repricing and prepayment behavior. We manage EaR with a goal to reduce potential volatility resulting from changes in interest rates so it remains within our EaR risk appetite. Our EaR scenario is regularly evaluated and updated, if necessary, to reflect changes in our business plans, market conditions and other macroeconomic factors. While management uses the best information available to estimate EaR, actual results may differ materially as a result of, among other things, changes in the economic environment or assumptions used in the process. Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units,\n\nand Treasury, have primary responsibility for assessing and monitoring EaR through firmwide oversight, including oversight of EaR stress testing and assumptions, and the establishment of our EaR risk appetite.",

Stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. In addition to EaR, we use other stress tests to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about firmwide stress tests.\n\nSensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures.\n\nScenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. When conducting scenario analysis, we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.\n\nUnlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).\n\nLimits\n\nWe use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size\n\nof our market exposures. These limits are set based on VaR, EaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about the limit approval process. Limits are monitored by Treasury and Risk. Risk is\n\nresponsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations). Such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit, if warranted.\n\nMetrics We analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business and region. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four\n\nmarket risk categories are not perfectly correlated.\n\nThe table below presents our average daily VaR.\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n114\n\n$\n\n86\n\n|                                         | Year Ended December   |      |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|------|\n| $ in millions                           | 2022                  | 2021 |\n| Categories                              | 97                    | 60   |\n| Interest rates                          | $ $                   |      |\n| Equity prices                           | 33                    | 43   |\n| Currency rates                          | 32                    | 13   |\n| Commodity prices Diversification effect | 47                    | 25   |\n|                                         | (95)                  | (55) |\n\nOur average daily VaR increased to $114 million in 2022 from $86 million in 2021, due to higher levels of volatility, partially offset by reduced exposures.

The total increase was primarily driven by increases in the interest rates and currency rates categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect and a decrease in the commodity prices category. During 2022, the firmwide VaR risk limit was exceeded on\n\nsix occasions (all of which occurred during March 2022) primarily due to higher levels of volatility generally resulting from broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. These limit breaches were resolved by temporary increases in the firmwide VaR risk limit and subsequent risk reductions. During this period, the firmwide VaR risk limit was also permanently increased due to higher levels of volatility. During 2021, the firmwide VaR risk limit was not exceeded and there were no permanent or temporary changes to the firmwide VaR risk limit.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n103",

The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives (including hedges) was a loss of $1 million as of both December 2022 and December 2021.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nCredit Risk Management\n\nOverview Credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives counterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold. Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and customer and other receivables.\n\nCredit Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit Risk.\n\n## Credit Risk Management Process\n\nOur process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management,' as well as the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our credit exposures and credit concentrations;\n- \u00b7 Establishing or approving underwriting standards;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations;\n- \u00b7 Measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default;\n- \u00b7 Using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and \u00b7 Maximizing recovery through active workout and\n- restructuring of claims.\n\n106\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nWe also perform credit analyses, which incorporate initial and ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit evaluation or more frequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances. We determine an internal credit rating for the counterparty by considering the results of the credit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty's industry and the economic environment. The internal credit rating does not take into consideration collateral received or other credit support arrangements. Senior personnel, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings.\n\nOur risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, collateral value, FICO credit scores and other risk factors.\n\nOur credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries. These systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region.\n\n## Risk Measures\n\nWe measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position.",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nStress Tests We conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements, including shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about firmwide stress tests.\n\nTo supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary.\n\nLimits We use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about the limit approval\n\nprocess.\n\nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.\n\n## Risk Mitigants\n\nTo reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive.\n\nFor loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\n\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty's financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty's obligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n107",

To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks.\n\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\n\n|                                               | As of December   | As of December   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                                 | 2022             | 2021             |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents q                   | $224,889         | $236,168         |\n| Industry                                      |                  |                  |\n| Financial Institutions                        | 6%               | 5%               |\n| Sovereign Total                               | 94%              | 95%              |\n|                                               | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Region                                        |                  |                  |\n| Americas EMEA                                 | 77%              | 55%              |\n| Asia                                          | 19%              | 36%              |\n|                                               | 4%               | 9%               |\n| Total                                         | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Credit Quality (Credit Rating Equivalent) AAA | 89%              | 64%              |\n| AA                                            | 5%               | 24%              |\n| A                                             | 6%               | 11%              |\n| BBB                                           | -                | 1%               |\n| Total                                         | 100%             | 100%             |\n\nThe table above excludes cash segregated for regulatory and other purposes of $16.94 billion as of December 2022 and $24.87 billion as of December 2021. OTC Derivatives. Our credit exposure on OTC derivatives\n\narises primarily from our market-making activities. As a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. We manage our credit exposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above.\n\n108\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nWe generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default.\n\nThe table below presents our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives and the concentration by industry and region.\n\n|                                                               | As of December   |                  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                                                 | 2022             | 2021             |\n| OTC derivative assets Collateral (not netted under U.S. GAAP) | $53,399          | $58,637          |\n| Net credit exposure p                                         | (15,823) $37,576 | (17,245) $41,392 |\n| Industry                                                      |                  |                  |\n| Consumer & Retail                                             | 3%               |                  |\n| Diversified Industrials                                       | 8%               | 2% 10%           |\n| Financial Institutions                                        | 20%              | 15%              |\n| Funds                                                         | 19%              | 13%              |\n| Healthcare                                                    | 1%               | 1%               |\n| Municipalities & Nonprofit                                    | 2%               |                  |\n| Natural Resources & Utilities                                 | 34%              | 5% 33%           |\n| Sovereign                                                     | 7%               | 8%               |\n| Technology, Media & Telecommunications                        | 4%               | 8%               |\n| Other (including Special Purpose Vehicles)                    | 2%               | 5%               |\n| Total                                                         | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Region                                                        |                  |                  |\n| Americas                                                      | 49%              | 53%              |\n| EMEA                                                          | 43%              | 37%              |\n| Asia                                                          | 8%               | 10%              |\n| Total                                                         | 100%             | 100%             |\n\nOur credit exposure (before any potential recoveries) to OTC derivative counterparties that defaulted during 2022 remained low, representing less than 2% of our total credit exposure from OTC derivatives.\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 OTC derivative assets, included in the consolidated balance sheets, are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net receivable for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting) and are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). \u00b7 Collateral represents cash collateral and the fair value of\n- securities collateral, primarily U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency obligations, received under credit support agreements, that we consider when determining credit risk, but such collateral is not eligible for netting under U.S. GAAP.",

We manage our lending activities using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above. Other lending positions, including secondary trading positions, are risk-managed as a component of market risk. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we changed the classification of our lending portfolio to better reflect the nature of the underlying collateral. Loans and lending commitments types in the table below include the addition of securities-based and other collateralized, as well as the removal of wealth management. This also resulted in reclassifications of certain loans and lending commitments in corporate and other to other collateralized. Prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation.\n\nThe table below presents our loans and lending commitments.\n\n| $ in millions             | Loans       | Lending Commitments   | Total        |\n|---------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|--------------|\n| As of December 2022       |             |                       |              |\n| Corporate                 | $ 40,135 $  | 139,718               | $ 179,853    |\n| Commercial real estate    | 28,879      | 4,271                 | 33,150       |\n| Residential real estate   | 23,035      | 3,192                 | 26,227       |\n| Securities-based          | 16,671      | 508                   | 17,179       |\n| Other collateralized      | 51,702      | 14,407                | 66,109       |\n| Consumer:                 |             |                       |              |\n| Installment               | 6,326       | 1,882                 | 8,208        |\n| Credit cards              | 15,820      | 62,216                | 78,036       |\n| Other                     | 2,261       | 944                   | 3,205        |\n| Total                     | $ 184,829 $ | 227,138               | $ 411,967    |\n| Allowance for loan losses | $ (5,543) $ | (774) $               | (6,317)      |\n| As of December 2021       |             |                       |              |\n| Corporate                 | $ 37,643 $  | 146,694 $ 184,337     |              |\n| Commercial real estate    | 29,000      | 6,736                 | 35,736       |\n| Residential real estate   | 24,674      | 4,031 454             | 28,705       |\n| Securities-based          | 16,652      |                       | 17,106       |\n| Other collateralized      | 38,263      | 17,253                | 55,516       |\n| Consumer:                 | 3,672       | 9                     | 3,681        |\n| Installment Credit cards  | 8,212       |                       |              |\n|                           | 4,019       | 35,932 443            | 44,144 4,462 |\n| Other Total               |             |                       |              |\n|                           | $ 162,135 $ | 211,552 $ 373,687     |              |\n| Allowance for loan losses | $ (3,573) $ | (776) $               | (4,349)      |\n\nIn the table above, lending commitments excluded $4.85 billion as of December 2022 and $4.14 billion as of December 2021 relating to issued letters of credit which are classified as guarantees in our consolidated financial statements.

Corporate loans and lending commitments include term loans, revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities and bridge loans, and are principally used for operating and general corporate purposes, or in connection with acquisitions. Corporate loans are secured (typically by a senior lien on the assets of the borrower) or unsecured, depending on the loan purpose, the risk profile of the\n\nborrower and other factors.

Such loans are included in trading assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCredit Hedges.\n\nTo mitigate the credit risk associated with\n\nour lending activities, we obtain credit protection on certain loans and lending commitments through credit default swaps, both single-name and index-based contracts, and through the issuance of credit-linked notes.\n\nSecurities Financing Transactions. We enter into securities financing transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain activities. We bear credit risk related to resale agreements and securities borrowed only to the extent that cash advanced or the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty exceeds the value of the collateral received. We also have credit exposure on repurchase agreements and securities loaned to the extent that the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty for these transactions exceeds the amount of cash or collateral received. Securities collateral for these transactions primarily includes U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency obligations.\n\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from securities financing transactions and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\n\n|                                               | As of December   | As of December   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                                 | 2022             | 2021             |\n| Securities Financing Transactions g           | $34,762          | $34,505          |\n| Industry                                      |                  |                  |\n| Financial Institutions                        | 43%              | 34%              |\n| Funds                                         | 23%              | 23%              |\n| Municipalities & Nonprofit                    | 5%               | 5%               |\n| Sovereign                                     | 28%              | 35%              |\n| Other (including Special Purpose Vehicles)    | 1%               | 3%               |\n| Total                                         | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Region                                        |                  | 36%              |\n| Americas                                      | 47%              |                  |\n| EMEA                                          | 34%              | 44%              |\n| Asia                                          | 19%              | 20%              |\n| Total                                         | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Credit Quality (Credit Rating Equivalent) AAA | 20%              | 19%              |\n| AA                                            | 31%              | 28%              |\n| A                                             | 31%              | 33%              |\n| BBB                                           | 8%               | 9%               |\n| BB or lower                                   |                  |                  |\n| Total                                         | 10% 100%         | 11% 100%         |\n\nThe table above reflects both netting agreements and collateral that we consider when determining credit risk.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n113",

We are exposed to credit risk from our receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties. Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily consist of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded, but not yet settled. These receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. Receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and generally have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short-term nature of these receivables.\n\nThe table below presents our other credit exposures and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\n\n|                                               | As of December   | As of December   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                                 | 2022             | 2021             |\n| Other Credit Exposures p                      | $48,916          | $61,187          |\n| Industry                                      |                  |                  |\n| Financial Institutions                        | 80%              | 86%              |\n| Funds                                         | 12%              | 9%               |\n| Other (including Special Purpose Vehicles)    | 8%               | 5%               |\n| Total                                         | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Region                                        |                  |                  |\n| Americas                                      | 41%              | 50%              |\n| EMEA Asia                                     | 49%              | 43%              |\n|                                               | 10%              | 7%               |\n| Total                                         | 100%             | 100%             |\n| Credit Quality (Credit Rating Equivalent) AAA |                  |                  |\n|                                               | 7%               | 4%               |\n| AA                                            | 32%              | 47%              |\n| A BBB                                         | 33% 10%          | 29% 6%           |\n|                                               | 16%              | 13%              |\n| BB or lower Unrated                           | 2%               | 1%               |\n| Total                                         | 100%             | 100%             |\n\nThe table above reflects collateral that we consider when determining credit risk.\n\n## Selected Exposures\n\nWe have credit and market exposures, as described below,\n\nthat have had heightened focus given recent events and broad market concerns.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to negatively affect the global economy and has resulted in significant disruptions in financial markets and increased macroeconomic uncertainty. Governments around the world have responded to Russia's invasion by imposing economic sanctions and export controls on specific industry sectors, companies and individuals in Russia. Retaliatory restrictions against investors, non-Russian owned businesses and other sovereign states have been implemented by Russia. Businesses in the U.S. and globally continue to experience shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy and raw materials due, in part, to the negative effects of the war on the global economy. The escalation or continuation of the war between Russia and Ukraine presents heightened risks relating to cyber attacks, limited ability to settle securities transactions, third-party and agent bank dependencies, supply chain disruptions, and inflation, as well as the potential for increased volatility in commodity, currency and other financial markets. Complying with economic sanctions and restrictions imposed by governments has resulted in increased operational risk. The extent and duration of the war, sanctions and resulting market disruptions, as well as the potential adverse consequences for our business, liquidity and results of operations, are difficult to predict.\n\nOur senior management, risk committees and the Board receive regular briefings from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including our chief risk officer, on Russian and Ukrainian exposures, as well as other relevant risk metrics. We have significantly reduced our exposure to Russia and Ukraine and have curtailed our operations in Russia to those necessary to meet our legal and regulatory obligations. The overall direct financial impact to our net revenues for 2022 from Russian and Ukrainian counterparties, borrowers, issuers and related instruments was not material. We have established a firmwide working group to identify and assess the operational risk associated with complying with economic sanctions and restrictions as a result of this invasion. In addition, to mitigate the risk of increased cyber attacks, we liaise with government agencies in order to update our monitoring processes with the latest information.\n\nOur\n\ntotal\n\ncredit\n\nexposure\n\nto\n\nRussian\n\nor\n\nUkrainian\n\ncounterparties or borrowers and our total market exposure relating to Russian or Ukrainian issuers was not material as of December 2022. In addition, economic and/or political uncertainties in\n\nArgentina, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lebanon, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Venezuela have led to concerns about their financial stability. Our credit exposure to counterparties or borrowers and our market exposure to issuers relating to each of these countries was not material as of December 2022.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nWe have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. We determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer's assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level. See 'Stress Tests' for information about stress tests that are designed to estimate the direct and indirect impact of events involving the above countries.\n\n## Operational Risk Management\n\n## Overview\n\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters.\n\nPotential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include:\n\n- \u00b7 Execution, delivery and process management;\n- \u00b7 Business disruption and system failures;\n- \u00b7 Employment practices and workplace safety;\n- \u00b7 Clients, products and business practices;\n- \u00b7 Damage to physical assets;\n- \u00b7 Internal fraud; and\n- \u00b7 External fraud.\n\nOperational Risk, which is independent of our revenueproducing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a formalized framework for assessing, monitoring and managing operational risk with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite.\n\nOperational Risk Management Process Our process for managing operational risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management,' including a comprehensive data collection process, as well as firmwide policies and procedures, for\n\noperational risk events. We combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a top-down perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. From a bottom-up perspective, our first and second lines of defense are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a day-to-day basis, including escalating operational risks and risk events to senior management.\n\nWe maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. The Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring operational resilience of our business.\n\nOur operational risk management framework is designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the Capital Framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance.\n\nWe have established policies that require all employees and consultants to report and escalate operational risk events. When operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/ or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events.\n\nWe use operational risk management applications to capture, analyze, aggregate and report operational risk event data and key metrics. One of our key risk identification and control assessment tools is an operational risk and control selfassessment process, which is performed by our managers. This process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n115",

Operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business\n\nenvironment factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluations of the complexity of our business activities;\n- \u00b7 The degree of automation in our processes;\n- \u00b7 New activity information;\n- \u00b7 The legal and regulatory environment; and\n- \u00b7 Changes in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties.\n\nThe results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. These analyses are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about firmwide stress tests.\n\n## Types of Operational Risks\n\nIncreased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such as information and cybersecurity risk, third-party risk and business resilience risk. We manage those risks as follows:\n\nInformation and Cybersecurity Risk. Information and cybersecurity risk is the risk of compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data and systems, leading to an adverse impact to us, our reputation, our clients and/or the broader financial system. We seek to minimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorized access, disruption or use of information and/or information systems. We deploy and operate preventive and detective controls and processes to mitigate emerging and evolving information security and cybersecurity threats, including monitoring our network for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized attempts to access our data and systems. There is increased information risk through diversification of our data across external service providers, including use of a variety of cloudprovided or -hosted services and applications. See 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about information and cybersecurity risk.\n\n116\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThird-Party Risk. Third-party risk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties performing services or activities on our behalf. These risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, operational or any other risks inherent in engaging a third party. We identify, manage and report key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across multiple risk domains, including information security and cybersecurity, resilience and additional supply chain dependencies. The Third-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and reassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. See 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about third-party risk.\n\nBusiness Resilience Risk. Business resilience risk is the risk of disruption to our critical processes. We monitor threats and assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies, such as critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or personnel. Our resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for BCP and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. The business continuity program is comprehensive, consistent on a firmwide basis, and up-todate, incorporating new information, including updated resilience capabilities as and when they become available. Our resilience assurance program encompasses testing of response and recovery strategies on a regular basis with the objective of minimizing and preventing significant operational disruptions. See 'Business - Business Continuity and Information Security' in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about business continuity.\n\n## Model Risk Management\n\n## Overview\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. We rely on quantitative models across our business activities primarily to value certain financial assets and liabilities, to monitor and manage our risk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital. Model Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing\n\nunits, model developers, model owners and model users, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our model risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the Risk Committee of the Board.",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOur model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. The Firmwide Model Risk Control Committee oversees our\n\n## model risk management framework.\n\nModel Review and Validation Process Model Risk consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. This review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards.\n\nWe regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. All models are reviewed on an annual basis, and new models or significant changes to existing models and their assumptions are approved prior to implementation.\n\nThe model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify:\n\n- \u00b7 The model's conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use;\n- \u00b7 The testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended;\n- \u00b7 The suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model;\n- \u00b7 The model's accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks;\n- \u00b7 The model's consistency with models for similar products; and\n- \u00b7 The model's sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions. See 'Critical Accounting Policies - Fair Value - Review of\n\nValuation Models,' 'Liquidity Risk Management,' 'Market Risk Management,' 'Credit Risk Management' and 'Operational Risk Management' for further information about our use of models within these areas.\n\nOther Risk Management\n\n## In addition to the areas of risks discussed above, we also\n\nmanage other risks, including capital, climate, compliance and conflicts. These areas of risks are discussed below.\n\nCapital Risk Management Capital risk is the risk that our capital is insufficient to support our business activities under normal and stressed market conditions or we face capital reductions or RWA increases, including from new or revised rules or changes in interpretations of existing rules, and are therefore unable to meet our internal capital targets or external regulatory capital requirements. Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. Accordingly, we have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to maintain an appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. Our capital management framework is designed to provide us with the information needed to identify and comprehensively manage risk, and develop and apply projected stress scenarios that capture idiosyncratic vulnerabilities with a goal of holding sufficient capital to remain adequately capitalized even after experiencing a severe stress event. See 'Capital Management and Regulatory Capital' for further information about our capital management process.\n\nWe have established a comprehensive governance structure to manage and oversee our day-to-day capital management activities and to ensure compliance with capital rules and related policies. Our capital management activities are overseen by the Board and its committees. The Board is responsible for approving our annual capital plan and the Risk Committee of the Board approves our capital management policy, which details the risk committees and members of senior management who are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of our capital adequacy and evaluation of current and future regulatory capital requirements, the review of the results of our capital planning and stress tests processes, and the results of our capital models. In addition, our risk committees and senior management are responsible for the review of our contingency capital plan, key capital adequacy metrics, including regulatory capital ratios, and capital plan metrics, such as the payout ratio, as well as monitoring capital targets and potential breaches of capital requirements.\n\nOur process for managing capital risk also includes independent review by Risk that, among other things, assesses regulatory capital policies and related interpretations, escalates certain interpretations to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, and performs calculation testing to corroborate alignment with applicable capital rules. Climate Risk Management\n\n## We categorize climate risk into physical risk and transition\n\nrisk. Physical risk is the risk that asset values may decline or operations may be disrupted as a result of changes in the climate, while transition risk is the risk that asset values may decline because of changes in climate policies or changes in the underlying economy due to decarbonization.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\nAs a global financial institution, climate-related risks manifest in different ways across our businesses and we have continued to make significant enhancements to our climate risk management framework, including steps to further integrate climate into our broader risk management processes. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities Committees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk, including our approaches towards scenario analysis and integration into existing risk management processes. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability issues affecting us, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change-related risks. Senior management within Risk is responsible for the development of our climate risk program.\n\nWe have begun incorporating climate risk into our credit evaluation and underwriting processes for select industries. Climate risk factors are now evaluated as part of transaction due diligence for select loan commitments.\n\nSee 'Business - Sustainability' in Part I, Item 1 and 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for information about our sustainability initiatives, including in relation to climate transition.\n\n## Compliance Risk Management\n\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to our reputation arising from our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and our internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk is inherent in all activities through which we conduct our businesses. Our Compliance Risk Management Program, administered by Compliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and reputational risk; monitors for compliance with new or amended laws, rules and regulations; designs and implements controls, policies, procedures and training; conducts independent testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for compliance risks and breaches; and leads our responses to regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. We monitor and review business practices to assess whether they meet or exceed minimum regulatory and legal standards in all markets and jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\n\n118\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nConflicts Management Conflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. The term 'conflict of interest' does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. The responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees.\n\nWe have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. Our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution and, in conjunction with Conflicts Resolution, Legal and Compliance, and internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. Resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment.\n\nAs a general matter, Conflicts Resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments in Global Banking & Markets and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. In addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the Firmwide Capital, Commitments and Suitability Committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. These groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. The head of Conflicts Resolution reports to our chief legal officer, who reports to our chief executive officer.\n\nWe regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\nFor further information about our risk management processes, see 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' and 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.",

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nValuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments As described in Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2022, the Company carries financial instruments at fair value, which includes $26.0 billion of financial assets and $22.8 billion of financial liabilities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as one or more inputs to the financial instrument's valuation technique are significant and unobservable. Significant unobservable inputs used by management to value certain of these Level 3 financial instruments included (i) industry multiples and public comparables, (ii) credit spreads or (iii)\n\ncorrelation.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of these certain Level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in valuing the financial instruments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of financial instruments, including controls over the methods and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments. These procedures also included, among others, for a sample of financial instruments, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) developing an independent estimate of fair value or (ii) testing management's process to determine the fair value of these financial instruments. Developing the independent estimate involved (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, (ii) evaluating and utilizing management's significant unobservable inputs or developing independent significant unobservable inputs, and (iii) comparing management's estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Testing management's process included evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs, evaluating the appropriateness of the techniques used, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management to determine the fair value of these instruments.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n121",

As of December 31, 2022, $2.6 billion of the allowance for loan losses and $150.4 billion of the loans accounted for at amortized cost related to the wholesale loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. In addition, it includes qualitative components to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. The wholesale models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower's capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans include forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the determinations of internal credit ratings and the forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management's determinations, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\n122\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Founded in 1869, the firm is headquartered in New York and maintains offices in all major financial centers around the world.\n\nCommencing with the fourth quarter of 2022, consistent with the firm's previously announced organizational changes, the firm began managing and reporting its activities in the following three business segments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. Prior periods are presented on a comparable basis.\n\n## Global Banking & Markets\n\nThe firm provides a broad range of services to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments. Services include strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and spin-offs, and equity and debt underwriting of public offerings and private placements. The firm facilitates client transactions and makes markets in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. In addition, the firm makes markets in and clears institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide and provides prime brokerage and other equities financing activities, including securities lending, margin lending and swaps.

All other significant accounting policies are either described below or included in the following footnotes:\n\n| Fair Value Measurements                                                 | Note 4          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Fair Value Hierarchy                                                    | Note 5          |\n| Trading Assets and Liabilities                                          | Note 6          |\n| Derivatives and Hedging Activities                                      | Note 7          |\n| Investments                                                             | Note 8          |\n| Loans                                                                   | Note 9          |\n| Fair Value Option                                                       | Note 10         |\n| Collateralized Agreements and Financings                                | Note 11         |\n| Other Assets                                                            | Note 12         |\n| Deposits                                                                | Note 13         |\n| Unsecured Borrowings                                                    | Note 14         |\n| Other Liabilities                                                       | Note 15         |\n| Securitization Activities                                               | Note 16         |\n| Variable Interest Entities                                              | Note 17         |\n| Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees                               | Note 18         |\n| Shareholders' Equity                                                    | Note 19         |\n| Regulation and Capital Adequacy                                         | Note 20         |\n| Earnings Per Common Share                                               | Note 21         |\n| Transactions with Affiliated Funds Interest Income and Interest Expense | Note 22 Note 23 |\n| Income Taxes                                                            | Note 24         |\n| Business Segments                                                       | Note 25         |\n| Credit Concentrations                                                   | Note 26         |\n| Legal Proceedings                                                       | Note 27         |\n| Employee Benefit Plans                                                  | Note 28         |\n| Employee Incentive Plans                                                | Note 29         |\n| Parent Company                                                          | Note 30         |\n\n128\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nConsolidation The firm consolidates entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest. The firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a\n\nvariable interest entity (VIE).\n\nVoting Interest Entities. Voting interest entities are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently and (ii) the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the firm has a controlling majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity is consolidated.\n\nVariable Interest Entities. A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. The firm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE when the firm has a variable interest or interests that provide it with (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for further information about VIEs.\n\nEquity-Method Investments. When the firm does not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but can exert significant influence over the entity's operating and financial policies, the investment is generally accounted for at fair value by electing the fair value option available under U.S. GAAP. Significant influence generally exists when the firm owns 20% to 50% of the entity's common stock or insubstance common stock.\n\nIn certain cases, the firm applies the equity method of\n\naccounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to the firm's principal business activities, when the firm has a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or operations of the investee or when cost-benefit considerations are less significant. See Note 8 for further information about equity-method investments.",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed investment funds with third-party investors. These funds are typically organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies for which the firm acts as general partner or manager. Generally, the firm does not hold a majority of the economic interests in these funds. These funds are usually voting interest entities and generally are not consolidated because third-party investors typically have rights to terminate the funds or to remove the firm as general partner or manager. Investments in these funds are generally measured at net asset value (NAV) and are included in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and 22 for further information about investments in funds.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, the most important of which relate to fair value measurements, the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information, but actual results could be materially different.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and liabilities and certain investments are carried at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to account for certain of its loans and other financial assets and liabilities at fair value by electing the fair value option. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. Fair value gains or losses are generally included in market making or other principal transactions. See Note 4 for further information about fair value measurements.\n\nRevenue from Contracts with Clients. The firm recognizes revenue earned from contracts with clients for services, such as investment banking, investment management, and execution and clearing (contracts with clients), when the performance obligations related to the\n\nunderlying transaction are completed. Revenues from contracts with clients represent approximately 50% of total non-interest revenues for 2022 (including approximately 85% of investment banking revenues, approximately 95% of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees), approximately 45% of total non-interest revenues for 2021 (including approximately 90% of both investment banking revenues and investment management revenues, and all commissions and fees), and approximately 45% of total non-interest revenues for 2020 (including approximately 90% of investment banking revenues, approximately 95% of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees). See Note 25 for information about net revenues by business segment.\n\n## Investment Banking\n\nAdvisory. Fees from financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues when the services related to the underlying transaction are completed under the terms of the assignment. Non-refundable deposits and milestone payments in connection with financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction or when the assignment is otherwise concluded.\n\nExpenses associated with financial advisory assignments are recognized when incurred and are included in transaction based expenses. Client reimbursements for such expenses are included in investment banking revenues.\n\nUnderwriting. Fees from underwriting assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction based on the terms of the assignment.\n\nExpenses associated with underwriting assignments are generally deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the assignment is otherwise concluded. Such expenses are included in transaction based expenses for completed assignments.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n129",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nInvestment Management The firm earns management fees and incentive fees for investment management services, which are included in investment management revenues. The firm makes payments to brokers and advisors related to the placement of the firm's investment funds (distribution fees), which are included in\n\ntransaction based expenses. Management Fees. Management fees for mutual funds are calculated as a percentage of daily net asset value and are received monthly. Management fees for hedge funds and separately managed accounts are calculated as a percentage of month-end net asset value and are generally received quarterly. Management fees for private equity funds are calculated as a percentage of monthly invested capital or committed capital and are received quarterly, semi-annually or annually, depending on the fund. Management fees are recognized over time in the period the services are provided.\n\nDistribution fees paid by the firm are calculated based on either a percentage of the management fee, the investment fund's net asset value or the committed capital. Such fees are included in transaction based expenses.\n\nIncentive Fees. Incentive fees are calculated as a percentage of a fund's or separately managed account's return, or excess return above a specified benchmark or other performance target. Incentive fees are generally based on investment performance over a twelve-month period or over the life of a fund. Fees that are based on performance over a twelvemonth period are subject to adjustment prior to the end of the measurement period. For fees that are based on investment performance over the life of the fund, future investment underperformance may require fees previously distributed to the firm to be returned to the fund.\n\nIncentive fees earned from a fund or separately managed account are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account. Therefore, incentive fees recognized during the period may relate to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.\n\n130\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nCommissions and Fees The firm earns substantially all commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on stock, options and futures markets, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Commissions and fees are recognized on the day the trade is executed. The firm also provides third-party research services to clients in connection with certain softdollar arrangements. Third-party research costs incurred by the firm in connection with such arrangements are presented\n\nnet within commissions and fees.\n\nRemaining Performance Obligations Remaining performance obligations are services that the firm has committed to perform in the future in connection with its contracts with clients. The firm's remaining performance obligations are generally related to its financial advisory assignments and certain investment management activities. Revenues associated with remaining performance obligations relating to financial advisory assignments cannot be determined until the outcome of the transaction. For the firm's investment management activities, where fees are calculated based on the net asset value of the fund or separately managed account, future revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account.\n\nThe firm is able to determine the future revenues associated with management fees calculated based on committed capital. As of December 2022, substantially all future net revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations will be recognized through 2030. Annual revenues associated with such performance obligations average less than $300 million through 2030.\n\n## Transfers of Financial Assets\n\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the assets transferred. For transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales, any gains or losses are recognized in net revenues. Assets or liabilities that arise from the firm's continuing involvement with transferred financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. For transfers of financial assets that are not accounted for as sales, the assets are generally included in trading assets and the transfer is accounted for as a collateralized financing, with the related interest expense recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 11 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as collateralized financings and Note 16 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales.",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents The firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight deposits held in the ordinary course of business. Cash and cash equivalents included cash and due from banks of $7.87 billion as of December 2022 and $10.14 billion as of December 2021. Cash and cash equivalents also included interest-bearing deposits with banks of $233.96 billion as of\n\nDecember 2022 and $250.90 billion as of December 2021.\n\nThe firm segregates cash for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. Cash and cash equivalents segregated for regulatory and other purposes were $16.94 billion as of December 2022 and $24.87 billion as of December 2021. In addition, the firm segregates securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. See Note 11 for further information about segregated securities.\n\n## Customer and Other Receivables\n\nCustomer and other receivables included receivables from customers and counterparties of $67.88 billion as of December 2022 and $103.82 billion as of December 2021, and receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $67.57 billion as of December 2022 and $56.85 billion as of December 2021. Such receivables primarily consist of collateral posted in connection with certain derivative transactions, customer margin loans and receivables resulting from unsettled transactions.\n\nSubstantially all of these receivables are accounted for at amortized cost net of any allowance for credit losses, which generally approximates fair value. As these receivables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm's fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these receivables been included in the firm's fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2022 and December 2021. See Note 10 for further information about customer and other receivables accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Interest on customer and other receivables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income.\n\nCustomer and other receivables includes receivables from contracts with clients and contract assets. Contract assets represent the firm's right to receive consideration for services provided in connection with its contracts with clients for which collection is conditional and not merely subject to the passage of time. The firm's receivables from contracts with clients were $3.01 billion as of both December 2022 and December 2021. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, contract assets were not material.\n\nCustomer and Other Payables Customer and other payables included payables to customers and counterparties of $238.12 billion as of December 2022 and $241.93 billion as of December 2021, and payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $23.93 billion as of December 2022 and $10.00 billion as of December 2021. Such payables primarily consist of customer credit balances related to the firm's prime brokerage activities. Customer and other payables are accounted for at cost plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these payables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm's fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these payables been included in the firm's fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2022 and December 2021. Interest on customer and other payables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest expense.\n\n## Offsetting Assets and Liabilities\n\nTo reduce credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, the firm may enter into master netting agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, netting agreements) with counterparties that permit it to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. A netting agreement is a contract with a counterparty that permits net settlement of multiple transactions with that counterparty, including upon the exercise of termination rights by a nondefaulting party. Upon exercise of such termination rights, all transactions governed by the netting agreement are terminated and a net settlement amount is calculated. In addition, the firm receives and posts cash and securities collateral with respect to its derivatives and securities financing transactions, subject to the terms of the related credit support agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, credit support agreements). An enforceable credit support agreement grants the non-defaulting party exercising termination rights the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In order to assess enforceability of the firm's right of setoff under netting and credit support agreements, the firm evaluates various factors, including applicable bankruptcy laws, local statutes and regulatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement. Derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e.,\n\nthe net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) in the consolidated balance sheets when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. Resale agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities borrowed and loaned transactions with the same settlement date are presented on a net-bycounterparty basis in the consolidated balance sheets when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n131",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nIn the consolidated balance sheets, derivatives are reported net of cash collateral received and posted under enforceable credit support agreements, when transacted under an enforceable netting agreement. In the consolidated balance sheets, resale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed and loaned, are not reported net of the related cash and securities received or posted as collateral. See Note 11 for further information about collateral received and pledged, including rights to deliver or repledge collateral. See Notes 7 and 11 for further information about offsetting assets and\n\nliabilities.\n\nForeign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the consolidated balance sheets and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the period. Foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on transactions in nonfunctional currencies are recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on translation of the financial statements of a non-U.S. operation, when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are included, net of hedges and taxes, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments\n\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on\n\nFinancial Reporting (ASC 848). In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.' This ASU, as amended in 2022, provides optional relief from applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. In addition, in January 2021 the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, 'Reference Rate Reform - Scope,' which clarified the scope of ASC 848 relating to contract modifications. The firm adopted these ASUs upon issuance and elected to apply the relief available to certain modified derivatives. The adoption of these ASUs did not have a material impact on the firm's consolidated financial statements.\n\n132\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (ASC 326) . In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, 'Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.' This ASU eliminates the recognition and measurement guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and requires enhanced disclosures about loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. This ASU also requires enhanced disclosure for loans that have been charged off. The ASU became effective in January 2023 under a prospective approach. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the firm's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Accounting for Obligations to Safeguard CryptoAssets an Entity Holds for Platform Users (SAB 121) .\n\nIn March 2022, the SEC staff issued SAB 121 (SAB 121) 'Accounting for obligations to safeguard crypto-assets an entity holds for platform users.' SAB 121 adds interpretive guidance requiring an entity to recognize a liability on its balance sheet to reflect the obligation to safeguard the crypto-assets held for its platform users, along with a corresponding asset. The firm adopted SAB 121 in June 2022 under a modified retrospective approach and adoption did not have a material impact on the firm's consolidated financial statements.\n\nFair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (ASC 820). In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, 'Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions.' This ASU clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be considered in measuring its fair value. In addition, the ASU requires specific disclosures related to equity securities that are subject to contractual sale restrictions. The ASU is effective in January 2024 under a prospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the firm's consolidated financial statements.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 4.\n\nFair Value Measurements The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks).\n\nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined by reference to prices for similar instruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less active markets, or internally developed models that primarily use market-based or independently sourced inputs, including, but not limited to, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread or difference between the interest rate at which a borrower could finance a given financial instrument relative to a benchmark interest rate).\n\nU.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial instrument's level in this hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement. In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, the firm considers, among other factors, a portfolio's net risk exposure to that input. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\n\n- Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets to which the firm had access at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2. Inputs to valuation techniques are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or more inputs to valuation techniques are\n\nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values for substantially all of the firm's financial\n\nassets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and the firm's credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence.\n\nThe table below presents financial assets and liabilities\n\ncarried at fair value.\n\n|                                                                               | As of December       |                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| $ in millions                                                                 | 2022                 | 2021                |\n| Total level 1 financial assets                                                | $ 194,698 $          | 255,774             |\n| Total level 2 financial assets                                                | 485,134              | 498,527             |\n| Total level 3 financial assets                                                | 26,048               | 24,083              |\n| Investments in funds at NAV                                                   | 2,941                | 3,469               |\n| Counterparty and cash collateral netting Total financial assets at fair value | (57,855) $ 650,966 $ | (66,041)            |\n| Total assets                                                                  | $ 1,441,799          | 715,812 $ 1,463,988 |\n| Total level 3 financial assets divided by:                                    |                      |                     |\n| Total assets                                                                  | 1.8%                 | 1.6%                |\n| Total financial assets at fair value Total level 1 financial liabilities      | 4.0% $ 119,578 $     | 3.4% 110,030        |\n| Total level 2 financial liabilities                                           | 353,060              | 403,627             |\n| Total level 3 financial liabilities                                           | 22,830               | 29,169              |\n| Counterparty and cash collateral netting                                      | (47,884)             | (51,269)            |\n| Total financial liabilities at fair value                                     | $ 447,584 $          | 491,557             |\n| Total liabilities                                                             | $ 1,324,610          | $ 1,354,062         |\n| Total level 3 financial liabilities divided by:                               |                      |                     |\n| Total liabilities                                                             | 1.7%                 | 2.2%                |\n| Total financial liabilities at fair value                                     | 5.1%                 | 5.9%                |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 Counterparty netting among positions classified in the same level is included in that level.\n- \u00b7 Counterparty and cash collateral netting represents the impact on derivatives of netting across levels.\n\nThe table below presents a summary of level 3 financial assets.\n\nAs of December\n\n| $ in millions            | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021   |\n|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Trading assets:          |             |             |\n| Trading cash instruments | 1,734 $     | 1,889       |\n| Derivatives              | 5,461       | 5,938       |\n| Investments              | 16,942      | 13,902      |\n| Loans                    | 1,837       | 2,354       |\n| Other assets             | 74          | -           |\n| Total                    | 26,048 $    | 24,083      |\n\nLevel 3 financial assets as of December 2022 increased\n\nused to determine the fair value of the firm's financial instruments are described below.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for\n\nTrading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans Level 1. Level 1 instruments include U.S. government obligations, most non-U.S. government obligations, certain agency obligations, certain corporate debt instruments, certain money market instruments and actively traded listed equities. These instruments are valued using quoted prices for identical unrestricted instruments in active markets. The firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and relative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both the average daily trading volume and the number of days with trading activity.\n\nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain non-U.S. government obligations, most agency obligations, most mortgage-backed loans and securities, most corporate debt instruments, most state and municipal obligations, most money market instruments, most other debt obligations, restricted or less liquid listed equities, certain private equities, commodities and certain lending commitments.\n\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be verified to quoted prices, recent trading activity for identical or similar instruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or executable) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources.\n\nValuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 instruments (i) if the instrument is subject to transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other premiums and liquidity discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence.\n\nLevel 3. Level 3 instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to the contrary, level 3 instruments are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence, including values realized on sales.\n\n134\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments vary by instrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques. The valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each\n\n## type of level 3 instrument are described below: Loans and Securities Backed by Commercial Real\n\nEstate Loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single property or a portfolio of properties, and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses and include:\n\n- \u00b7 Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and changes in market indices, such as the CMBX (an index that tracks the performance of commercial mortgage bonds);\n- \u00b7 Transaction prices in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral;\n- \u00b7 A measure of expected future cash flows in a default scenario (recovery rates) implied by the value of the underlying collateral, which is mainly driven by current performance of the underlying collateral and capitalization rates. Recovery rates are expressed as a percentage of notional or face value of the instrument and reflect the benefit of credit enhancements on certain instruments; and\n- \u00b7 Timing of expected future cash flows (duration) which, in certain cases, may incorporate the impact of any loan forbearances and other unobservable inputs (e.g., prepayment speeds).\n\n## Loans and Securities Backed by Residential Real Estate\n\nLoans and securities backed by residential real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by portfolios of residential real estate and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. Significant inputs include: \u00b7 Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related\n\n- assets;\n\n\u00b7\n\nTransaction prices in both the underlying collateral and\n\n- instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral; \u00b7 Cumulative loss expectations, driven by default rates,\n- home price projections, residential property liquidation timelines, related costs and subsequent recoveries; and \u00b7 Duration, driven by underlying loan prepayment speeds\n- and residential property liquidation timelines.",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nCorporate Debt Instruments Corporate debt instruments includes corporate loans, debt securities and convertible debentures. Significant inputs for corporate debt instruments are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt instruments for the same or similar issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are available. Significant inputs include:\n\n- \u00b7 Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and trends of market indices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks the performance of corporate credit);\n- \u00b7 Current performance and recovery assumptions and, where the firm uses credit default swaps to value the related instrument, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n- \u00b7 Duration; and\n- \u00b7 Market and transaction multiples for corporate debt instruments with convertibility or participation options.\n\n## Equity Securities\n\nEquity securities consists of private equities. Recent thirdparty completed or pending transactions (e.g., merger proposals, debt restructurings, tender offers) are considered the best evidence for any change in fair value. When these are not available, the following valuation methodologies are used, as appropriate:\n\n- \u00b7 Industry multiples (primarily EBITDA and revenue multiples) and public comparables;\n- \u00b7 Transactions in similar instruments;\n- \u00b7 Discounted cash flow techniques; and\n- \u00b7 Third-party appraisals.\n\nThe firm also considers changes in the outlook for the relevant industry and financial performance of the issuer as compared to projected performance. Significant inputs include:\n\n\u00b7\n\nMarket and transaction multiples;\n\n- \u00b7 Discount rates and capitalization rates; and\n- \u00b7 For equity securities with debt-like features, market yields\n- implied by transactions of similar or related assets, current performance and recovery assumptions, and duration.\n\n## Other Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and\n\nLoans The significant inputs to the valuation of other instruments, such as non-U.S. government and agency obligations, state and municipal obligations, and other loans and debt obligations are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt instruments for the same issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are available. Significant inputs include:\n\n- \u00b7 Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and trends of market indices;\n- \u00b7 Current performance and recovery assumptions and, where the firm uses credit default swaps to value the related instrument, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligation; and\n- \u00b7 Duration.\n\n## Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Derivatives\n\nThe firm's level 2 and level 3 derivatives are valued using derivative pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow models, correlation models and models that incorporate option pricing methodologies, such as Monte Carlo simulations). Price transparency of derivatives can generally be characterized by product type, as described below.\n\n- \u00b7 Interest Rate. In general, the key inputs used to value interest rate derivatives are transparent, even for most long-dated contracts. Interest rate swaps and options denominated in the currencies of leading industrialized nations are characterized by high trading volumes and tight bid/offer spreads. Interest rate derivatives that reference indices, such as an inflation index, or the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year swap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) are more complex, but the key inputs are generally observable.\n- \u00b7 Credit. Price transparency for credit default swaps, including both single names and baskets of credits, varies by market and underlying reference entity or obligation. Credit default swaps that reference indices, large corporates and major sovereigns generally exhibit the most price transparency. For credit default swaps with other underliers, price transparency varies based on credit rating, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligations, and the availability of the underlying reference obligations for delivery upon the default of the issuer. Credit default swaps that reference loans, asset-backed securities and emerging market debt instruments tend to have less price transparency than those that reference corporate bonds. In addition, more complex credit derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more underlying reference obligations, generally have less price transparency.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n135",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- \u00b7 Currency. Prices for currency derivatives based on the exchange rates of leading industrialized nations, including those with longer tenors, are generally transparent. The primary difference between the price transparency of developed and emerging market currency derivatives is that emerging markets tend to be only observable for contracts\n- with shorter tenors. \u00b7 Commodity. Commodity derivatives include transactions referenced to energy (e.g., oil, natural gas and electricity), metals (e.g., precious and base) and soft commodities (e.g., agricultural). Price transparency varies based on the underlying commodity, delivery location, tenor and product quality (e.g., diesel fuel compared to unleaded gasoline). In general, price transparency for commodity derivatives is greater for contracts with shorter tenors and contracts that are more closely aligned with major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n- \u00b7 Equity. Price transparency for equity derivatives varies by market and underlier. Options on indices and the common stock of corporates included in major equity indices exhibit the most price transparency. Equity derivatives generally have observable market prices, except for contracts with long tenors or reference prices that differ significantly from current market prices. More complex equity derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more individual stocks, generally have less price transparency.\n\nLiquidity is essential to the observability of all product types. If transaction volumes decline, previously transparent prices and other inputs may become unobservable. Conversely, even highly structured products may at times have trading volumes large enough to provide observability of prices and other inputs.\n\nLevel 1. Level 1 derivatives include short-term contracts for future delivery of securities when the underlying security is a level 1 instrument, and exchange-traded derivatives if they are actively traded and are valued at their quoted market price.\n\nLevel 2. Level 2 derivatives include OTC derivatives for which all significant valuation inputs are corroborated by market evidence and exchange-traded derivatives that are not actively traded and/or that are valued using models that calibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives. The selection of a particular model to value a derivative\n\ndepends on the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model selection does not involve significant management judgment because outputs of models can be calibrated to market-clearing levels.\n\n136\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nValuation models require a variety of inputs, such as contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, discount rates (including those derived from interest rates on collateral received and posted as specified in credit support agreements for collateralized derivatives), credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss severity rates and correlations of such inputs. Significant inputs to the valuations of level 2 derivatives can be verified to market transactions, broker or dealer quotations or other alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or executable) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources.\n\nLevel 3 . Level 3 derivatives are valued using models which utilize observable level 1 and/or level 2 inputs, as well as unobservable level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm's level 3 derivatives are described below.\n\n- \u00b7 For level 3 interest rate and currency derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include correlations of certain currencies and interest rates (e.g., the correlation between Euro inflation and Euro interest rates) and specific interest rate and currency volatilities.\n- \u00b7 For level 3 credit derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include illiquid credit spreads and upfront credit points, which are unique to specific reference obligations and reference entities, and recovery rates.\n- \u00b7 For level 3 commodity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include volatilities for options with strike prices that differ significantly from current market prices and prices or spreads for certain products for which the product quality or physical location of the commodity is not aligned with benchmark indices.\n- \u00b7 For level 3 equity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs generally include equity volatility inputs for options that are long-dated and/or have strike prices that differ significantly from current market prices. In addition, the valuation of certain structured trades requires the use of level 3 correlation inputs, such as the correlation of the price performance of two or more individual stocks or the correlation of the price performance for a basket of stocks to another asset class, such as commodities.",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level 3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to reflect observable market changes and any resulting gains and losses are classified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when corroborated by evidence, such as similar market transactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker or dealer quotations or other empirical market data. In circumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value by reference to market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. See Note 5 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of level 3 derivatives.\n\nValuation Adjustments. Valuation adjustments are integral to determining the fair value of derivative portfolios and are used to adjust the mid-market valuations produced by derivative pricing models to the exit price valuation. These adjustments incorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and funding valuation adjustments, which account for the credit and funding risk inherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios. The firm also makes funding valuation adjustments to collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the firm to deliver or repledge collateral received. Marketbased inputs are generally used when calibrating valuation adjustments to market-clearing levels.\n\nIn addition, for derivatives that include significant unobservable inputs, the firm makes model or exit price adjustments to account for the valuation uncertainty present in the transaction.\n\n## Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Other Financial Instruments at Fair Value\n\nIn addition to trading cash instruments, derivatives, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value under the fair value option. Such instruments include resale and repurchase agreements; certain securities borrowed and loaned transactions; certain customer and other receivables, including certain margin loans; certain time deposits, including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; substantially all other secured financings, including transfers of assets accounted for as financings; certain unsecured shortand long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments; and certain other assets and liabilities. These instruments are generally valued based on discounted cash flow techniques, which incorporate inputs with reasonable levels of price transparency, and are generally classified in level 2 because the inputs are observable. Valuation adjustments may be made for liquidity and for counterparty and the firm's credit quality. The significant inputs used to value the firm's other financial instruments are described below.\n\nResale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned. The significant inputs to the valuation of resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the amount and\n\ntiming of expected future cash flows and interest rates. Customer and Other Receivables. The significant inputs to the valuation of receivables are interest rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and funding spreads.\n\nDeposits. The significant inputs to the valuation of time deposits are interest rates and the amount and timing of future cash flows. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm's other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 13 for further information about deposits.\n\nOther Secured Financings. The significant inputs to the valuation of other secured financings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, funding spreads and the fair value of the collateral delivered by the firm (determined using the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market prices, market yields and recovery assumptions). See Note 11 for further information about other secured financings.\n\nUnsecured Short- and Long-Term Borrowings. The significant inputs to the valuation of unsecured short- and long-term borrowings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, the credit spreads of the firm and commodity prices for prepaid commodity transactions. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm's other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 14 for further information about borrowings.\n\nOther Assets and Liabilities. The significant inputs to the valuation of other assets and liabilities are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, market yields, volatility and correlation inputs. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm's other derivative instruments described above.

In other, the significant unobservable inputs for multiples as of December 2021 did not have a range (and there was no weighted average) as each pertained to a single position. Therefore, such\n- unobservable inputs are not included in the table above. \u00b7 Ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of trading cash\n\ninstrument.\n\n- \u00b7 Weighted averages are calculated by weighting each input by the relative fair value of the trading cash instruments.\n- \u00b7 The ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one trading cash instrument. For example, the highest recovery rate for corporate debt instruments is appropriate for valuing a specific corporate debt instrument, but may not be appropriate for valuing any other corporate debt instrument. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 trading cash instruments.\n- \u00b7 Increases in yield, duration or cumulative loss rate used in the valuation of level 3 trading cash instruments would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate or multiples would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2022 and December 2021. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 trading cash instrument, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.\n- \u00b7 Trading cash instruments are valued using discounted cash flows.\n\nLevel 3 Rollforward for Trading Cash Instruments The table below presents a summary of the changes in fair\n\nvalue for level 3 trading cash instruments.\n\n|                                                           | Year Ended December   |             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|\n| $ in millions                                             | 2022                  | 2021        |\n| Assets                                                    |                       |             |\n| Beginning balance                                         | $ 1,889 $             | 1,237       |\n| Net realized gains/(losses)                               | 167                   | 80          |\n| Net unrealized gains/(losses)                             | (1,889)               | 52          |\n| Purchases                                                 | 1,271                 | 1,241       |\n| Sales                                                     | (704)                 | (456)       |\n| Settlements                                               | (345)                 | (273)       |\n| Transfers into level 3                                    | 1,680                 | 272         |\n| Transfers out of level 3 Ending balance g                 | (335) $ 1,734 $       | (264) 1,889 |\n| Liabilities                                               | (104)                 | (80)        |\n| Beginning balance                                         | $ $                   |             |\n| Net realized gains/(losses) Net unrealized gains/(losses) | 18                    | 6 (5)       |\n| Purchases                                                 | 65                    |             |\n| Sales                                                     | 137 (106)             | 36 (64)     |\n| Settlements                                               | 5                     | 13          |\n| Transfers into level 3                                    | (89)                  | (16)        |\n| Transfers out of level 3                                  |                       |             |\n| Ending balance g                                          | 10 $ (64)             | 6           |\n\n$\n\n(104)\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in fair value are presented for all trading cash instruments that are classified in level 3 as of the end of the period.\n- \u00b7 Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates to trading cash instruments that were still held at period-end.\n- \u00b7 Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur. If a trading cash instrument was transferred to level 3 during a reporting period, its entire gain or loss for the period is classified in level 3.\n- \u00b7 For level 3 trading cash instrument assets, increases are shown as positive amounts, while decreases are shown as negative amounts.

The net realized and unrealized losses on level 3 trading cash instrument assets of $1.72 billion (reflecting $167 million of net realized gains and $1.89 billion of net unrealized losses) for 2022 included gains/ (losses) of $(1.77) billion reported in market making and $54\n\nmillion reported in interest income.\n\nThe net unrealized losses on level 3 trading cash instrument assets for 2022 primarily reflected losses on certain equity securities (included in other cash instruments), principally driven by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns.\n\nTransfers into level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2022 primarily reflected transfers of certain equity securities (included in other cash instruments) and corporate debt instruments from both level 1 and level 2 (in each case, principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments).\n\nTransfers out of level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2022 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments to level 2 (principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments).\n\nYear Ended December 2021. The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 trading cash instrument assets of $132 million (reflecting $80 million of net realized gains and $52 million of net unrealized gains) for 2021 included gains of $45 million reported in market making and $87 million reported in interest income.\n\nThe drivers of the net unrealized gains on level 3 trading cash instrument assets for 2021 were not material.\n\nTransfers into level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments from level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable yield and duration inputs becoming significant to the valuation of these instruments, and reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments). Transfers out of level 3 trading cash instrument assets during\n\n2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments, and loans and securities backed by real estate to level 2 (in each case, principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments, and certain unobservable yield and duration inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these instruments).",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- \u00b7 Averages represent the arithmetic average of the inputs and are not weighted by the relative fair value or notional amount of the respective financial instruments. An average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average. For example, the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads indicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower\n- end of the range. \u00b7 The ranges, averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative. For example, the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 derivatives.\n- \u00b7 Interest rates, currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models, credit derivatives are valued using option pricing, correlation and discounted cash flow models, and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, option pricing models and discounted cash flow models are typically used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques.\n- \u00b7 Correlation within currencies and equities includes crossproduct type correlation.\n- \u00b7 Natural gas spread represents the spread per million British thermal units of natural gas.\n- \u00b7 Oil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and refined products.\n- \u00b7 Electricity price represents the price per megawatt hour of electricity.\n\n## Range of Significant Unobservable Inputs for Derivatives The following provides information about the ranges of\n\nsignificant unobservable inputs used to value the firm's level 3 derivative instruments:\n\n\u00b7 Correlation.\n\nRanges for correlation cover a variety of\n\n- underliers both within one product type (e.g., equity index and equity single stock names) and across product types (e.g., correlation of an interest rate and a currency), as well as across regions. Generally, cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type.\n\n142\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n- \u00b7 Volatility. Ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers across a variety of markets, maturities and strike prices. For example, volatility of equity indices is generally lower\n- than volatility of single stocks. \u00b7 Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates. The ranges for credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers (index and single names), regions, sectors, maturities and credit qualities (high-yield and investment-grade). The broad range of this population gives rise to the width of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs.\n- \u00b7 Commodity prices and spreads. The ranges for commodity prices and spreads cover variability in products, maturities and delivery locations.\n\n## Sensitivity of Fair Value Measurement to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs for Derivatives\n\nThe following is a description of the directional sensitivity of the firm's level 3 fair value measurements to changes in significant unobservable inputs, in isolation, as of each period-end:\n\n- \u00b7 Correlation. In general, for contracts where the holder benefits from the convergence of the underlying asset or index prices (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates and equity prices), an increase in correlation results in a higher fair value measurement.\n- \u00b7 Volatility. In general, for purchased options, an increase in volatility results in a higher fair value measurement.\n- \u00b7 Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates. In general, the fair value of purchased credit protection increases as credit spreads or upfront credit points increase or recovery rates decrease. Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates are strongly related to distinctive risk factors of the underlying reference obligations, which include reference entity-specific factors, such as leverage, volatility and industry, market-based risk factors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity of the underlying reference obligation, and macroeconomic conditions.\n\n\u00b7 Commodity\n\nprices\n\nand\n\nspreads.\n\nIn\n\ngeneral,\n\nfor\n\n- contracts where the holder is receiving a commodity, an increase in the spread (price difference from a benchmark index due to differences in quality or delivery location) or price results in a higher fair value measurement. Due to the distinctive nature of each of the firm's level 3\n\nderivatives, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.",

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives of $2.66 billion (reflecting $839 million of net realized gains and $1.82 billion of net unrealized gains) for 2022 included gains of $2.65 billion reported in market making and gains of $3 million\n\nreported in other principal transactions. The net unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives for 2022 were attributable to gains on certain equity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in equity prices), gains on certain commodity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in commodity prices), gains on certain currency derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and an increase in interest rates), and gains on certain interest rate derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in interest rates), partially offset by losses on certain credit derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in interest rates).\n\nTransfers into level 3 derivatives during 2022 primarily reflected transfers of certain equity derivative liabilities from level 2 (principally due to decreased transparency of certain unobservable volatility inputs used to value these derivatives), partially offset by transfers of certain commodity derivative assets from level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable electricity price inputs becoming significant to the valuation of these derivatives).\n\nTransfers out of level 3 derivatives during 2022 primarily reflected transfers of certain interest rate derivative assets to level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable volatility inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these derivatives), certain credit derivative assets to level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable credit spread inputs no longer being significant to the net risk of certain portfolios), and certain commodity derivative assets to level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable natural gas spread and electricity price inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these derivatives), partially offset by transfers of certain equity derivative liabilities to level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable volatility inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these derivatives). Year Ended December 2021.

For example, the highest multiple for private equity securities is appropriate for valuing a specific private equity security but may not be appropriate for valuing any other private equity security. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 investments.\n- \u00b7 Increases in yield, discount rate, capitalization rate or duration used in the valuation of level 3 investments would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate or multiples would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2022 and December 2021. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 investment, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type. \u00b7 Corporate debt securities, securities backed by real estate\n- and other debt obligations are valued using discounted cash flows, and equity securities are valued using market comparables and discounted cash flows.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows may be used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the level 3\n- balance encompasses both of these techniques. \u00b7 The significant unobservable inputs for recovery rate (related to securities backed by real estate) and for duration (related to other debt obligations) as of December 2022 did not have a range (and there was no weighted average) as each pertained to a single position. Therefore, such unobservable inputs are not included in the table above.\n\nLevel 3 Rollforward for Investments The table below presents a summary of the changes in fair value for level 3 investments.\n\n|                               | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions                 |                       |                       |\n| Beginning balance             | 2022 $ 13,902         | 2021 $ 16,423         |\n| Net realized gains/(losses)   |                       |                       |\n| Net unrealized gains/(losses) | 563 (1,649)           | 449 1,263             |\n| Purchases                     | 2,362                 | 1,600                 |\n| Sales                         | (1,514)               | (2,135)               |\n| Settlements                   | (1,995)               | (3,265)               |\n| Transfers into level 3        | 6,345                 | 3,080                 |\n| Transfers out of level 3      | (1,072)               | (3,513)               |\n| Ending balance g              | $ 16,942              | $ 13,902              |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in fair value are presented for all investments that are classified in level 3 as of the end of the period.\n- \u00b7 Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates to investments that were still held at period-end.\n- \u00b7 Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur. If an investment was transferred to level 3 during a reporting period, its entire gain or loss for the period is classified in level 3.\n- \u00b7 For level 3 investments, increases are shown as positive amounts, while decreases are shown as negative amounts.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n145",

The net unrealized losses on level 3 investments for 2022\n\nprimarily reflected losses on certain equity securities and corporate debt securities (in each case, principally driven by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns) and securities backed by real estate (principally driven by an increase in interest rates).\n\n146\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nTransfers into level 3 investments during 2022 primarily reflected transfers of certain equity securities and corporate debt securities from level 2 (in each case, principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments), and transfers of certain corporate debt securities from level 2 (due to certain unobservable yield and duration inputs becoming significant to the valuation of these\n\ninstruments).\n\nTransfers out of level 3 investments during 2022 primarily reflected transfers of certain equity securities and corporate debt securities to level 2 (in each case, principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments and certain unobservable yield and duration inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these instruments).\n\nYear Ended December 2021. The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 investments of $1.71 billion (reflecting $449 million of net realized gains and $1.26 billion of net unrealized gains) for 2021 included gains of $1.53 billion reported in other principal transactions and $180 million reported in interest income.\n\nThe net unrealized gains on level 3 investments for 2021 primarily reflected gains on certain private equity securities and corporate debt securities (in each case, principally driven by corporate performance and company-specific events).\n\nTransfers into level 3 investments during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt securities from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments, and certain unobservable yield and duration inputs becoming significant to the valuation of these instruments) and transfers of certain private equity securities from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments).\n\nTransfers out of level 3 investments during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain private equity securities to level 2 (principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments) and transfers of certain corporate debt securities to level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable yield and duration inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these instruments, and increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions of these instruments).",

For example, the highest yield for real estate loans is appropriate for valuing a specific real estate loan but may not be appropriate for valuing any other real estate loan. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges\n- of, fair value measurements of level 3 loans. \u00b7 Increases in yield or duration used in the valuation of level 3 loans would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2022 and December 2021. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 loan, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.\n- \u00b7 Loans are valued using discounted cash flows.\n- \u00b7 The significant unobservable inputs for duration related to other loans as of December 2022 did not have a range (and there was no weighted average) as it related to a purchased portfolio of revolving loans with a single duration.\n\n## Level 3 Rollforward for Loans\n\nThe table below presents a summary of the changes in fair value for level 3 loans.\n\n|                               | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions                 | 2022                  | 2021                  |\n| Beginning balance             | 2,354 $ 82            | 2,678 99              |\n| Net realized gains/(losses)   |                       |                       |\n| Net unrealized gains/(losses) | (129)                 | (33)                  |\n| Purchases                     | 113                   | 272                   |\n| Sales                         | (82)                  | (54)                  |\n| Settlements                   | (403) 236             | (668) 369             |\n| Transfers into level 3        |                       |                       |\n| Transfers out of level 3      | (334)                 | (309)                 |\n| Ending balance g              | 1,837 $               | 2,354                 |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in fair value are presented for loans that are classified in level 3 as of the end of the period.\n- \u00b7 Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates to loans that were still held at period-end. \u00b7 Purchases includes originations and secondary purchases.\n- \u00b7 Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are\n- reported at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur.

Other Secured Financings. The ranges and weighted averages of significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 other secured financings are presented below. These ranges and weighted averages exclude unobservable inputs that are only relevant to a single instrument, and therefore are not meaningful.\n\nAs of December 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Yield: 4.5% to 9.4% (weighted average: 5.9%)\n- \u00b7 Duration: 0.6 to 5.1 years (weighted average: 2.2 years)\n\nAs of December 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 Yield: 1.3% to 6.4% (weighted average: 2.1%)\n- \u00b7 Duration: 0.6 to 7.1 years (weighted average: 3.7 years)\n\nGenerally, increases in yield or duration, in isolation, would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement as of periodend. Due to the distinctive nature of each of level 3 other secured financings, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform across such financings. See Note 11 for further information about other secured financings.\n\nDeposits, Unsecured Borrowings and Other Assets and Liabilities. Substantially all of the firm's deposits, unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, and other assets and liabilities that are classified in level 3 are hybrid financial instruments. As the significant unobservable inputs used to value hybrid financial instruments primarily relate to the embedded derivative component of these deposits, unsecured borrowings and other assets and liabilities, these unobservable inputs are incorporated in the firm's derivative disclosures. See Note 12 for further information about other assets, Note 13 for further information about deposits, Note 14 for further information about unsecured borrowings and Note 15 for further information about other liabilities.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n149",

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 other financial liabilities of $424 million (reflecting $401 million of net realized losses and $825 million of net unrealized gains) for 2021 included gains/ (losses) of $355 million reported in market making, $32 million reported in other principal transactions and $(20) million reported in interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings, and $57 million reported in debt valuation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n\nThe net unrealized gains on level 3 other financial liabilities for 2021 primarily reflected gains on certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long- and short-term borrowings (principally due to an increase in interest rates).\n\nTransfers into level 3 other financial liabilities during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long- and short-term borrowings from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency of certain volatility and correlation inputs used to value these instruments) and certain other secured financings from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency of certain yield and duration inputs used to\n\nvalue these instruments).

Gains/(losses) exclude related interest income and interest expense. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.\n- \u00b7 Gains/(losses) included in market making are primarily related to the firm's trading assets and liabilities, including both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.\n- \u00b7 Gains/(losses) are not representative of the manner in which the firm manages its business activities because many of the firm's market-making and client facilitation strategies utilize financial instruments across various product types. Accordingly, gains or losses in one product type frequently offset gains or losses in other product types. For example, most of the firm's longer-term derivatives across product types are sensitive to changes in interest rates and may be economically hedged with interest rate swaps. Similarly, a significant portion of the firm's trading cash instruments and derivatives across product types has exposure to foreign currencies and may be economically hedged with foreign currency contracts.\n\n## Note 7.\n\n## Derivatives and Hedging Activities\n\n## Derivative Activities\n\nDerivatives are instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors. Derivatives may be traded on an exchange (exchange-traded) or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as OTC derivatives. Certain of the firm's OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties (OTC-cleared), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties (bilateral OTC).\n\n152\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n|                |           | Year Ended December   |         |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------------------|---------|\n| $ in millions  | 2022      | 2021                  | 2020    |\n| Interest rates | $ (4,890) | $ (2,664) $           | 6,074   |\n| Credit         | 1,095     | 1,739                 | 3,269   |\n| Currencies     | 11,662    | 5,627                 | (3,312) |\n| Equities       | 7,734     | 8,459                 | 6,792   |\n| Commodities    | 3,033     | 2,196                 | 2,605   |\n\nMarket Making. As a market maker, the firm enters into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. In this role, the firm typically acts as principal and is required to commit capital to provide execution, and maintains market-making\n\npositions in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand. Risk Management. The firm also enters into derivatives to actively manage risk exposures that arise from its marketmaking and investing and financing activities. The firm's holdings and exposures are hedged, in many cases, on either a portfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed to an instrumentby-instrument basis. The offsetting impact of this economic hedging is reflected in the same business segment as the related revenues. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives designated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to manage interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits and certain U.S. government securities classified as available-forsale, foreign exchange risk of certain available-for-sale securities and the net investment in certain non-U.S. operations, and the price risk of certain commodities.\n\nThe firm enters into various types of derivatives, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Futures and Forwards. Contracts that commit counterparties to purchase or sell financial instruments, commodities or currencies in the future.\n- \u00b7 Swaps. Contracts that require counterparties to exchange cash flows, such as currency or interest payment streams. The amounts exchanged are based on the specific terms of the contract with reference to specified rates, financial instruments, commodities, currencies or indices.\n- \u00b7 Options. Contracts in which the option purchaser has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from or sell to the option writer financial instruments, commodities or currencies within a defined time period for a specified price.\n\nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). Derivative assets are included in trading assets and derivative liabilities are included in trading liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are included in market making (for derivatives included in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities within Global Banking & Markets), and other principal transactions (for derivatives included in Investment banking fees and Other within Global Banking & Markets, as well as derivatives in Asset & Wealth Management) in the consolidated statements of earnings. For both 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the firm's derivatives were included in Global Banking & Markets.",

Where the counterparty netting is across tenor categories, the netting is included in cross-tenor counterparty netting.\n\nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm's fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of derivatives, and Note 5 for information about derivatives within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Credit Derivatives\n\nThe firm enters into a broad array of credit derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage the credit risk associated with market-making and investing and financing activities. Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm's net risk position. Credit derivatives are generally individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity.\n\nThe firm enters into the following types of credit derivatives:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit Default Swaps. Single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages (reference obligations) in the event the issuer of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer. If a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer, calculated according to the terms of the contract. \u00b7 Credit Options. In a credit option, the option writer\n- assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.",

Credit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction's total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions (tranches), each having different levels of subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche.\n- \u00b7 Total Return Swaps. A total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation, and the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation.\n\nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit derivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchased credit derivatives with identical underliers. Substantially all of the firm's purchased credit derivative transactions are with financial institutions and are subject to stringent collateral thresholds. In addition, upon the occurrence of a specified trigger event, the firm may take possession of the reference obligations underlying a particular written credit derivative, and consequently may, upon liquidation of the reference obligations, recover amounts on the underlying reference obligations in the event of default.\n\nAs of December 2022, written credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $528.31 billion and purchased credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $579.14 billion, for total net notional purchased protection of $50.83 billion. As of December 2021, written credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $510.24 billion and purchased credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $569.34 billion, for total net notional purchased protection of $59.10 billion. The firm's written and purchased credit derivatives primarily consist of credit default swaps.\n\nThe table below presents information about credit derivatives.\n\n|

These derivatives are included in unsecured shortand long-term borrowings, as well as other secured financings, with the related borrowings.\n\n## Derivatives with Credit-Related Contingent Features Certain of the firm's derivatives have been transacted under\n\nbilateral agreements with counterparties who may require the firm to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in the firm's credit ratings. The firm assesses the impact of these bilateral agreements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would occur assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency's relative ratings of the firm at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies.\n\n156\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe table below presents information about net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements (excluding collateral posted), the fair value of collateral posted and additional collateral or termination payments that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch\n\ndowngrade in the firm's credit ratings.\n\nTwo-notch downgrade\n\n$\n\n1,115\n\n$\n\n1,536\n\n|                                                       | As of December   |        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------|\n| $ in millions $                                       | 2022             | 2021   |\n| Net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements | 33,059 $         | 34,315 |\n| Collateral posted $                                   | 27,657 $         | 29,214 |\n| Additional collateral or termination payments:        |                  |        |\n| One-notch downgrade $                                 | 343 $            | 345    |\n\n## Hedge Accounting\n\nThe firm applies hedge accounting for (i) interest rate swaps used to manage the interest rate exposure of certain fixedrate unsecured long- and short-term borrowings, certain fixed-rate certificates of deposit and certain U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale, (ii) foreign currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange risk of certain available-for-sale, (iii) foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt used to manage foreign exchange risk on the firm's net investment in certain non-U.S. operations and (iv) commodity futures contracts used to manage the price risk of certain commodities.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging instrument must be highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being hedged. Additionally, the firm must formally document the hedging relationship at inception and assess the hedging relationship at least on a quarterly basis to ensure the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective over the life of the hedging relationship.\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nThe firm designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate unsecured long- and short-term debt and fixed-rate certificates of deposit and, beginning in the second quarter of 2022, of certain U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale. These interest rate swaps hedge changes in fair value attributable to the designated benchmark interest rate (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or Overnight Index Swap Rate), effectively converting a substantial portion of these fixed-rate financial instruments into floating-rate financial instruments. The firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression\n\nanalysis when assessing the effectiveness of these hedging relationships in achieving offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument and the risk being hedged (i.e., interest rate risk). An interest rate swap is considered highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value attributable to changes in the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%.",

The firm uses NAV to measure the fair value of fund investments when (i) the fund investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and (ii) the NAV of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting, including measurement of the investments at fair value. Substantially all of the firm's investments in funds at NAV\n\nconsist of investments in firm-sponsored private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds where the firm co-invests with third-party investors.\n\nPrivate equity funds primarily invest in a broad range of industries worldwide, including leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments and distressed investments. Credit funds generally invest in loans and other fixed income instruments and are focused on providing private high-yield capital for leveraged and management buyout transactions, recapitalizations, financings, refinancings, acquisitions and restructurings for private equity firms, private family companies and corporate issuers. Real estate funds invest globally, primarily in real estate companies, loan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and property. Private equity, credit and real estate funds are closed-end funds in which the firm's investments are generally not eligible for redemption. Distributions will be received from these funds as the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing of which is uncertain.\n\nThe firm also invests in hedge funds, primarily multidisciplinary hedge funds that employ a fundamental bottomup investment approach across various asset classes and strategies. The firm's investments in hedge funds primarily include interests where the underlying assets are illiquid in nature, and proceeds from redemptions will not be received until the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing of which is uncertain.\n\nThe firm's investments in funds at NAV includes investments in 'covered funds' as defined in the Volcker Rule of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). To achieve conformance with the covered fund provisions of the Volcker Rule by July 2022, the firm restructured certain legacy 'illiquid funds' (as defined by the Volcker Rule) to be non-covered funds as liquidating trusts. However, based on recent interpretations of the covered fund provisions of the Volcker Rule, the firm was required to seek an additional extension from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) to bring these funds into conformance. The FRB granted the firm an additional extension to July 2023. If the firm does not conform such funds by July 2023, the firm will be required to sell such interests. If that occurs, the firm may receive a value for its interests that is less than the then carrying value as there could be a limited secondary market for these investments and the firm may be unable to sell them in orderly transactions. As of December 2022, the amount by which the firm's investment in such funds would need to be reduced in order to achieve conformance was approximately $200 million (net of the firm's pro rata share of cash in the funds).\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n159",

If the firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost, the difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance, if any) and the fair value of the securities is recognized as an impairment loss in earnings. The firm did not record any such impairment losses during either 2022 or 2021. Impaired available-for-sale debt securities that the firm has the intent and ability to hold are reviewed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded. The firm considers various factors in such determination, including market conditions, changes in issuer credit ratings and severity of the unrealized losses.

Had these securities been included in the firm's fair value hierarchy, U.S. government obligations would have been classified in level 1 and securities backed by real estate would have been primarily classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n- \u00b7 The weighted average yield for held-to-maturity securities is presented on a pre-tax basis and computed using the effective interest rate of each security at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. \u00b7 The gross unrealized gains were not material as of\n- December 2022 and were $175 million as of December 2021. The gross unrealized losses were $1.44 billion as of December 2022 and were not material as of December 2021. \u00b7 Held-to-maturity securities are reviewed to determine if an\n- allowance for credit losses should be recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings. The firm considers various factors in such determination, including market conditions, changes in issuer credit ratings, historical credit losses and sovereign guarantees. Provision for credit losses on such securities was not material during either 2022 or 2021.\n\n## Note 9.\n\nLoans Loans includes (i) loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost net of allowance for loan losses or at fair value under the fair value option and (ii) loans held for sale that are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the firm changed the classification of loans to better reflect the nature of the underlying collateral. This includes the addition of the securities-based and other collateralized loan types, as well as the removal of the wealth management loan type. This also resulted in reclassifications of certain loans in the corporate and other loan types to the other collateralized loan type. Prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation.\n\nIn the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 The increase in credit cards from December 2021 to December 2022 included approximately $2.0 billion relating to the firm's acquisition of the General Motors cobranded credit card portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost include net deferred fees and costs, and unamortized premiums and discounts, which are amortized over the life of the loan. These amounts were less than 1% of loans accounted for at amortized cost as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n\nThe following is a description of the loan types in the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 Corporate. Corporate loans includes term loans, revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities and bridge loans, and are principally used for operating and general corporate purposes, or in connection with acquisitions. Corporate loans are secured (typically by a senior lien on the assets of the borrower) or unsecured, depending on the loan purpose, the risk profile of the borrower and other factors.\n- \u00b7 Commercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate loans includes originated loans that are directly or indirectly secured by hotels, retail stores, multifamily housing complexes and commercial and industrial properties. Commercial real estate loans also includes loans extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly backed by commercial real estate. In addition, commercial real estate includes loans purchased by the firm.\n\n\u00b7 Residential Real Estate.\n\nResidential real estate loans\n\n- primarily includes loans extended to wealth management clients and to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by residential real estate. In addition, residential real estate includes loans purchased by the firm. \u00b7 Securities-Based. Securities-based loans includes loans\n- that are secured by stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds. These loans are primarily extended to the firm's wealth management clients and used for purposes other than purchasing, carrying or trading margin stocks. Securities-based loans require borrowers to post additional collateral based on changes in the underlying collateral's fair value. 162 Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n- \u00b7 Other Collateralized. Other collateralized loans includes loans that are backed by specific collateral (other than securities and real estate). Such loans are extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by corporate loans, consumer loans and other assets. Other collateralized loans also includes loans to investment funds (managed by third parties) that are collateralized by capital commitments of the funds' investors or assets held by the fund, as well as other secured loans extended to the firm's wealth management\n\nclients.\n\n- \u00b7 Installment. Installment loans are unsecured loans originated by the firm (including point-of-sale loans that the firm began to originate through the GreenSky platform in the third quarter of 2022).\n- \u00b7 Credit Cards. Credit card loans are loans made pursuant to revolving lines of credit issued to consumers by the firm.\n- \u00b7 Other. Other loans includes unsecured loans extended to wealth management clients and unsecured consumer and credit card loans purchased by the firm.\n\nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm's fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of loans, and Note 5 for information about loans within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Credit Quality\n\nRisk Assessment. The firm's risk assessment process includes evaluating the credit quality of its loans by the firm's independent risk oversight and control function. For corporate loans and a majority of securities-based, real estate, other collateralized and other loans, the firm performs credit analyses which incorporate initial and ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a borrower to meet its financial obligations. These credit evaluations are performed on an annual basis or more frequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances. The firm determines an internal credit rating for the borrower by considering the results of the credit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the borrower's industry and the economic environment. The internal credit rating does not take into consideration collateral received or other credit support arrangements. For consumer loans and for loans that are not assigned an internal credit rating, the firm reviews certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, collateral value and other risk factors.",

FICO credit scores are periodically refreshed by the firm to assess the updated creditworthiness of the borrower. See 'Vintage' below for information about installment and credit card loans by FICO credit scores.\n\nThe firm also assigns a regulatory risk rating to its loans based on the definitions provided by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. Total loans included 93% of loans as of December 2022 and 92% of loans as of December 2021 that were rated pass/non-criticized.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n163",

Loans accounted for at amortized cost (other than credit card loans) are placed on nonaccrual status when it is probable that the firm will not collect all principal and interest due under the contractual terms, regardless of the delinquency status or if a loan is past due for 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well collateralized and in the process of collection. At that time, all accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against interest income and interest subsequently collected is recognized on a cash basis to the extent the loan balance is deemed collectible. Otherwise, all cash received is used to reduce the outstanding loan balance. A loan is considered past due when a principal or interest payment has not been made according to its contractual terms. Credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status and accrue interest until the loan is paid in full or is charged off.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the firm may modify the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, typically in the form of a modification of loan covenants, but may also include forbearance of interest or principal, payment extensions or interest rate reductions. These modifications, to the extent significant, are considered TDRs. Loan modifications that extend payment terms for a period of less than 90 days are generally considered insignificant and therefore not reported as TDRs.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n165",

Loans and lending commitments accounted for at fair value or accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value are not subject to an allowance\n\nfor credit losses. To determine the allowance for credit losses, the firm classifies its loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which the firm has developed and documented its methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loan and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios described below. The firm applies judgment in weighing individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including the firm's internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk.",

The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within the firm's independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within the firm's independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses.

See Note 18 for further information about lending commitments.\n- \u00b7 The increase in installment lending commitments from December 2021 to December 2022 primarily relates to commitments extended in connection with point-of-sale financing through GreenSky. See Note 18 for further information about lending commitments.\n\nThe following is a description of the methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses:\n\nWholesale. The allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans and lending commitments that exhibit similar risk characteristics is measured using a modeled approach. These models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower's capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. For lending commitments, the methodology also considers the probability of drawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include the loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans and lending commitments include unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, such as nonaccrual loans or loans in a TDR, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective rate, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral. Wholesale loans are charged off against the allowance for\n\nloan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n167",

The allowance for credit losses for consumer loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is calculated using a modeled approach which classifies consumer loans into pools based on borrower-related and exposure-related characteristics that differentiate a pool's risk characteristics from other pools. The factors considered in determining a pool are generally consistent with the risk characteristics used for internal credit risk measurement and management and include key metrics, such as FICO credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for consumer loans include unemployment rates and delinquency rates. The expected life of revolving credit card loans is determined by modeling expected future draws and the timing and amount of repayments allocated to the funded balance. The firm also recognizes an allowance for credit losses on commitments to acquire loans and commitments extended in connection with point-of-sale financing. However, no allowance for credit losses is recognized on credit card lending commitments as they are cancellable by the firm.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses for consumer loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, such as loans in a TDR, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective rate.\n\nInstallment loans are charged off when they are 120 days past due. Credit card loans are charged off when they are 180 days past due.\n\n168\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses Rollforward The table below presents information about the allowance\n\nfor credit losses.\n\n| $ in millions                               | Wholesale                                   | Consumer    | Total      |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| Year Ended December 2022                    |                                             |             |            |\n| Allowance for loan losses                   |                                             |             |            |\n| Beginning balance                           | $ 2,135 $                                   | 1,438 $     | 3,573      |\n| Net (charge-offs)/recoveries                | (253)                                       | (473)       | (726)      |\n| Provision                                   | 699                                         | 2,016       | 2,715      |\n| Other                                       | (19) $                                      | -           | (19)       |\n| Ending balance g                            | 2,562 $                                     | 2,981 $     | 5,543      |\n| Allowance ratio                             | 1.7% 0.2%                                   | 13.5%       | 3.2%       |\n| Net charge-off ratio                        | Net charge-off ratio                        | 2.8%        | 0.5%       |\n| Allowance for losses on lending commitments | $                                           |             | 776        |\n| Beginning balance                           | 589 $ 124                                   | 187 $ (124) |            |\n| Provision                                   |                                             |             | -          |\n| Other Ending balance g                      | (2) $ 711 $                                 | - 63 $      | (2) 774    |\n| Year Ended December 2021                    |                                             |             |            |\n| Allowance for loan losses                   |                                             |             |            |\n| Beginning balance                           | $ 2,584 $                                   | 1,290 $     | 3,874      |\n| Net (charge-offs)/recoveries                | (130)                                       | (203)       | (333)      |\n| Provision                                   | (231)                                       | 351         | 120        |\n| Other                                       |                                             |             |            |\n| Ending balance g                            | (88) $ 2,135 $                              | - 1,438 $   | (88) 3,573 |\n| Allowance ratio                             | 1.6%                                        | 12.1%       | 2.5%       |\n| Net charge-off ratio                        | 0.1%                                        | 2.3%        | 0.3%       |\n| Allowance for losses on lending commitments | Allowance for losses on lending commitments |             |            |\n| Beginning balance                           | $ 557 $                                     | - $         | 557        |\n| Provision                                   | 50                                          | 187         | 237        |\n| Other                                       | (18)                                        | -           | (18)       |\n| Ending balance g                            | $ 589 $                                     | 187 $       | 776        |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 For the year ended December 2021, other primarily represented the reduction to the allowance related to loans and lending commitments transferred to held for sale.\n- \u00b7 The allowance ratio is calculated by dividing the allowance for loan losses by gross loans accounted for at amortized cost.\n- \u00b7 The net charge-off ratio is calculated by dividing net (charge-offs)/recoveries by average gross loans accounted for at amortized cost.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nForecast Model Inputs as of December 2022 When modeling expected credit losses, the firm employs a weighted, multi-scenario forecast, which includes baseline, adverse and favorable economic scenarios. As of December 2022, this multi-scenario forecast was weighted towards the\n\nbaseline and adverse economic scenarios. The table below presents the forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates used in the baseline economic\n\nscenario of the forecast model.\n\n|                                           | As of December 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| U.S. unemployment rate                    |                       |\n| Forecast for the quarter ended:           |                       |\n| June 2023                                 | 4.2%                  |\n| December 2023 June 2024                   | 4.6% 4.6%             |\n| Growth in U.S. GDP Forecast for the year: |                       |\n| 2023                                      | 0.4%                  |\n| 2024                                      | 1.3%                  |\n\n2025\n\n1.7%\n\nThe adverse economic scenario of the forecast model reflects a global recession in 2023 and a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy by central banks, resulting in an economic contraction and rising unemployment rates. In this scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate peaks at approximately 7.4% during the first quarter of 2024 and the maximum decline in the quarterly U.S. GDP relative to the fourth quarter of 2022 is approximately 2.7%, which occurs during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 U.S. unemployment rate represents the rate forecasted as of the respective quarter-end.\n- \u00b7 Growth in U.S. GDP represents the year-over-year growth rate forecasted for the respective years.\n- \u00b7 While the U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates are significant inputs to the forecast model, the model contemplates a variety of other inputs across a range of scenarios to provide a forecast of future economic conditions. Given the complex nature of the forecasting process, no single economic variable can be viewed in isolation and independently of other inputs.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses Commentary\n\n## Year Ended December 2022. The allowance for credit\n\nlosses increased by $1.97 billion during 2022, reflecting growth in the firm's consumer lending portfolios (principally in credit cards) and higher modeled expected losses due to broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. In addition, the allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans was impacted by asset-specific provisions and ratings downgrades primarily related to borrowers in the technology, media & telecommunications, real estate, and consumer & retail industries.\n\nNet (charge-offs)/recoveries for 2022 for wholesale loans were primarily related to corporate loans and net (chargeoffs)/recoveries for consumer loans were primarily related to\n\ncredit cards. Year Ended December 2021. The allowance for credit losses decreased by $82 million during 2021, reflecting reserve reduction driven by improved broader economic environment, partially offset by growth in the firm's lending portfolios, primarily in the consumer portfolio related to credit cards, including a provision for credit losses of approximately $185 million related to the acquisition of the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio.\n\nNet (charge-offs)/recoveries for 2021 for wholesale loans were primarily related to corporate loans and net (chargeoffs)/recoveries for consumer loans were primarily related to credit cards.\n\n## Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASC 326)\n\nThe firm adopted ASU No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" as of January 1, 2020. As a result of adopting this ASU, the firm's allowance for credit losses on financial assets and commitments that are accounted for at amortized cost reflects management's estimate of credit losses over the remaining life of such assets. The cumulative effect of adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020, was a decrease to retained earnings of $638 million (net of tax).\n\n## Estimated Fair Value\n\nThe table below presents the estimated fair value of loans that are not accounted for at fair value and in what level of the fair value hierarchy they would have been classified if they had been included in the firm's fair value hierarchy.\n\nCarrying\n\nEstimated Fair Value\n\n| $ in millions       | Value     | Level 3 Total               | Level 3 Total   | Level 3 Total   |\n|---------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| As of December 2022 |           | Level 2                     |                 |                 |\n| Amortized cost      | $ 167,037 | $ 85,921                    | $ 83,121        | $ 169,042       |\n| Held for sale       | 4,594 $   | 2,592 $                     | 2,014 $         | 4,606           |\n| As of December 2021 |           |                             |                 |                 |\n| Amortized cost      | $ 139,934 | $ 87,676 $ 54,127 $ 141,803 |                 |                 |\n| Held for sale       | 7,859 $   | 5,970 $                     | 1,917 $         | 7,887           |\n\nSee\n\nNote 4 for an overview of the firm's fair value\n\nmeasurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of loans, and Note 5 for information about loans within the fair value hierarchy.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n169",

The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis;\n- \u00b7 Mitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes (e.g., transfers of financial assets accounted for as financings are recorded at fair value, whereas the related secured financing would be recorded on an accrual basis absent electing the fair value option); and\n- \u00b7 Address simplification and cost-benefit considerations (e.g., accounting for hybrid financial instruments at fair value in their entirety versus bifurcation of embedded derivatives and hedge accounting for debt hosts).\n\nHybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain bifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not require settlement by physical delivery of nonfinancial assets (e.g., physical commodities). If the firm elects to bifurcate the embedded derivative from the associated debt, the derivative is accounted for at fair value and the host contract is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted for the effective portion of any fair value hedges. If the firm does not elect to bifurcate, the entire hybrid financial instrument is accounted for at fair value under the fair value option.\n\nOther financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option include:\n\n- \u00b7 Resale and repurchase agreements;\n- \u00b7 Certain securities borrowed and loaned transactions;\n- \u00b7 Certain customer and other receivables and certain other assets and liabilities;\n- \u00b7 Certain time deposits (deposits with no stated maturity are not eligible for a fair value option election), including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; \u00b7 Substantially all other secured financings, including\n- transfers of assets accounted for as financings; and \u00b7 Certain unsecured shortand long-term borrowings,\n- substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments. See Note 4 for an overview of the firm's fair value\n\nmeasurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of other financial assets and liabilities, and Note 5 for information about other financial assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n170\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n## Gains and Losses on Other Financial Assets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value Under the Fair\n\nValue Option The table below presents the gains and losses recognized in earnings as a result of the election to apply the fair value option to certain financial assets and liabilities.\n\n|                                                                | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions                                                  | 2022                  | 2021                  | 2020                  |\n| Unsecured short-term borrowings Unsecured long-term borrowings | 4,055 $               | (1,016) $             | 206                   |\n|                                                                | 6,506                 | (2,393)               | (2,804)               |\n| Other                                                          | 1,072                 | (135)                 | (563)                 |\n\nTotal\n\n$ 11,633\n\n$\n\n(3,544) $ (3,161)\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 Gains/(losses) were substantially all included in market making.\n- \u00b7 Gains/(losses) exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense, for all instruments other than hybrid financial instruments.

Accordingly, gains or losses on such other financial assets and liabilities can be partially offset by gains or losses on trading assets and liabilities. As a result, gains or losses on other financial assets and liabilities do not necessarily represent the overall impact on the firm's results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

The related amount was not material as of\n\nDecember 2021.\n\nThese debt instruments include both principal-protected and non-principal-protected long-term borrowings.\n\n## Debt Valuation Adjustment\n\nThe firm calculates the fair value of financial liabilities for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the firm's credit spreads.\n\nThe table below presents information about the net debt valuation adjustment (DVA) gains/(losses) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.\n\n|               | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   | Year Ended December   |\n|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $ in millions | 2022                  | 2021                  | 2020                  |\n| Pre-tax DVA   | $ 1,882               | $ 433 $               | (347)                 |\n| After-tax DVA | $ 1,403               | $ 322 $               | (261)                 |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 After-tax DVA is included in debt valuation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n- \u00b7 The gains/(losses) reclassified to market making in the consolidated statements of earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) upon extinguishment of such financial liabilities were not material for 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nLoans and Lending Commitments The table below presents the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate contractual principal amount for loans (included in trading assets and loans in the consolidated balance sheets) for which the fair value option\n\nwas elected.\n\nAggregate fair value\n\n$\n\n2,633\n\n$\n\n3,559\n\n|                                                                         | As of December                                                          |                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| $ in millions                                                           | 2022                                                                    | 2021                                                                    |\n| Performing loans                                                        |                                                                         |                                                                         |\n| Aggregate contractual principal in excess of fair value $ 2,645 $ 1,373 | Aggregate contractual principal in excess of fair value $ 2,645 $ 1,373 | Aggregate contractual principal in excess of fair value $ 2,645 $ 1,373 |\n| Loans on nonaccrual status and/or more than 90 days past due $          |                                                                         |                                                                         |\n| Aggregate contractual principal in excess of fair value                 | 3,331 $                                                                 | 8,600                                                                   |\n\nIn the table above, the aggregate contractual principal amount of loans on nonaccrual status and/or more than 90 days past due (which excludes loans carried at zero fair value and considered uncollectible) exceeds the related fair value primarily because the firm regularly purchases loans, such as distressed loans, at values significantly below the contractual principal amounts.\n\nThe fair value of unfunded lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was a liability of $22 million as of December 2022 and $20 million as of December 2021, and the related total contractual amount of these lending commitments was $307 million as of December 2022 and $611 million as of December 2021. See Note 18 for further information about lending commitments.\n\n## Impact of Credit Spreads on Loans and Lending Commitments\n\nThe estimated net gain/(loss) attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads on loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $(281) million for 2022, $277 million for 2021 and $(106) million for 2020. The firm generally calculates the fair value of loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the instrument-specific credit spreads. For floating-rate loans and lending commitments, substantially all changes in fair value are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads, whereas for fixed-rate loans and lending commitments, changes in fair value are also attributable to changes in interest rates.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n171",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 11.\n\nCollateralized Agreements and Financings Collateralized agreements are resale agreements and securities borrowed. Collateralized financings are repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings. The firm enters into these transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain\n\nfirm activities.\n\nCollateralized agreements and financings with the same settlement date are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements. Interest on collateralized agreements, which is included in interest income, and collateralized financings, which is included in interest expense, is recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.\n\n## Resale and Repurchase Agreements\n\nA resale agreement is a transaction in which the firm purchases financial instruments from a seller, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the same or substantially the same financial instruments to the seller at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date.\n\nA repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date.\n\nEven though repurchase and resale agreements (including 'repos- and reverses-to-maturity') involve the legal transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the financial instruments to be repurchased or resold before or at the maturity of the agreement. The financial instruments purchased or sold in resale and repurchase agreements typically include U.S. government and agency, and investment-grade sovereign obligations. The firm receives financial instruments purchased under\n\nresale agreements and makes delivery of financial instruments sold under repurchase agreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these financial instruments on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the financial instruments, as appropriate. For resale agreements, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the relevant assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n172\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions In a securities borrowed transaction, the firm borrows securities from a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the firm returns the securities, the counterparty returns the cash or securities. Interest is\n\ngenerally paid periodically over the life of the transaction.\n\nIn a securities loaned transaction, the firm lends securities to a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the counterparty returns the securities, the firm returns the cash or securities posted as collateral. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction.\n\nThe firm receives securities borrowed and makes delivery of securities loaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these securities on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the securities, as appropriate. For securities borrowed transactions, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the securities borrowed transaction.\n\nSecurities borrowed and loaned within FICC financing are recorded at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 5 for further information about securities borrowed and loaned accounted for at fair value.\n\nSubstantially all of the securities borrowed and loaned within Equities financing are recorded based on the amount of cash collateral advanced or received plus accrued interest. The firm also reviews such securities borrowed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded by taking into consideration the fair value of collateral received. As these agreements generally can be terminated on demand, they exhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the carrying value of such agreements approximates fair value. As these agreements are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm's fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these agreements been included in the firm's fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2022 and December 2021.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOther Secured Financings In addition to repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, the firm funds certain assets through the use of other secured financings and pledges financial instruments and other assets as collateral in these transactions. These\n\n- other secured financings include:\n- \u00b7 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs; \u00b7 Transfers of assets accounted for as financings rather than sales (e.g., pledged commodities, bank loans and mortgage whole loans); and\n- \u00b7 Other structured financing arrangements.\n\nOther secured financings included nonrecourse arrangements. Nonrecourse other secured financings were $7.94 billion as of December 2022 and $8.64 billion as of December 2021.\n\nThe firm has elected to apply the fair value option to substantially all other secured financings because the use of fair value eliminates non-economic volatility in earnings that would arise from using different measurement attributes. See Note 10 for further information about other secured financings that are accounted for at fair value.\n\nOther secured financings that are not recorded at fair value are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these financings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm's fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these financings been included in the firm's fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 3 as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n\n174\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe table below presents information about other secured\n\nfinancings.\n\n|                                                            | U.S.            | Non-U.S.           |             |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------|\n| $ in millions                                              | Dollar          | Dollar             | Total       |\n| As of December 2022                                        |                 |                    |             |\n| Other secured financings (short-term):                     |                 |                    |             |\n| At fair value $                                            | 3,478 $         | 2,963 $            | 6,441       |\n| At amortized cost                                          | 398             | -                  | 398         |\n| Other secured financings (long-term):                      |                 |                    |             |\n| At fair value                                              | 3,793           | 2,522              | 6,315       |\n| At amortized cost                                          | 395             | 397                | 792         |\n| Total other secured financings $ g                         | 8,064 $         | 5,882              | $ 13,946    |\n| Other secured financings collateralized by:                |                 |                    |             |\n| Financial instruments $ Other assets $                     | 3,817 $ 4,247 $ | 4,895 $ 987 $      | 8,712 5,234 |\n| As of December 2021 Other secured financings (short-term): |                 |                    |             |\n| $                                                          | 5,315 $         | 3,664 $            | 8,979       |\n| At fair value                                              |                 |                    |             |\n| At amortized cost Other secured financings (long-term):    | -               | 191                | 191         |\n| At fair value                                              | 4,170           | 3,925              | 8,095       |\n| At amortized cost                                          |                 |                    |             |\n| Total other secured financings $ g                         | 827 10,312 $    | 452 8,232 $ 18,544 | 1,279       |\n| Other secured financings collateralized by:                |                 |                    |             |\n| Financial instruments $                                    | 5,990 $         | 6,834 $ 12,824     |             |\n| Other assets $                                             | 4,322 $         | 1,398 $            | 5,720       |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 Short-term other secured financings includes financings maturing within one year of the financial statement date and financings that are redeemable within one year of the financial statement date at the option of the holder.\n- \u00b7 U.S. dollar-denominated short-term other secured financings at amortized cost had a weighted average interest rate of 5.56% as of December 2022.

Property, leasehold improvements and equipment included $7.17 billion as of December 2022 and $6.71 billion as of December 2021 that the firm uses in connection with its operations, and $89 million as of December 2022 and $194 million as of December 2021 of foreclosed real estate primarily related to distressed loans that were purchased by the firm. The remainder is held by investment entities, including VIEs, consolidated by the firm. Substantially all property and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease. Capitalized costs of software developed or obtained for internal use are amortized on a straight-line basis over three years.\n\nThe firm tests property, leasehold improvements and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's or asset group's carrying value may not be fully recoverable. To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.\n\nThe firm had impairments of $314 million during 2022, $143 million during 2021, and $171 million during 2020, primarily related to properties held by the firm's investment entities within Asset & Wealth Management.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, in connection with the\n\nchanges to the firm's business segments, the firm reassigned the goodwill to its new reporting units using a relative fair value approach in accordance with ASC 350.\n\nThe table below presents the carrying value of goodwill by\n\nreporting unit.\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n6,374\n\n$\n\n4,285\n\n|                                                  | As of December   |       |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| $ in millions                                    | 2022             | 2021  |\n| Global Banking & Markets:                        |                  |       |\n| Investment banking                               | 267 $            | 267   |\n| FICC                                             | 269              | 269   |\n| Equities                                         | 2,647            | 2,647 |\n| Asset & Wealth Management:                       |                  |       |\n| Asset management                                 | 1,385            | 349   |\n| Wealth management                                | 1,310            | 718   |\n| Platform Solutions:                              | 482              | 21    |\n| Consumer platforms Transaction banking and other |                  |       |\n|                                                  | 14               | 14    |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 Goodwill of $14 million previously in Investment Banking was reassigned to the Transaction banking and other reporting unit related to the transfer of the transaction banking business.

The amount of goodwill reassigned was based on the relative fair values of the transferred business and the remaining business within Wealth management.\n- \u00b7 All goodwill previously in Consumer banking was reassigned to Wealth management and Consumer platforms based on the relative fair values of the businesses transferred to each reporting unit.\n- \u00b7 Goodwill previously in FICC, Equities and Asset Management was not reassigned as no businesses were transferred out of these reporting units.\n- \u00b7 Substantially all of the increase in goodwill from December 2021 to December 2022 was driven by the acquisitions of GreenSky and NNIP.\n\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n177",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe quantitative goodwill test compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value (including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets). If the reporting unit's estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. An impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its\n\ncarrying value. During the fourth quarter of 2022, goodwill was tested for impairment using a quantitative test (both prior to and following the firm's changes to its business segments). For each test, the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value, and therefore, goodwill was not impaired.\n\nThe estimated fair value of each reporting unit was based on valuation techniques the firm believes market participants would use to value these reporting units. Estimated fair values are generally derived from utilizing a relative value technique, which applies observable price-to-earnings multiples or price-to-book multiples of comparable competitors to the reporting units' net earnings or net book value, or a discounted cash flow valuation approach, for reporting units with businesses in early stages of development. The carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders' equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders' equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements.\n\n## Identifiable Intangible Assets\n\nThe table below presents identifiable intangible assets by type.\n\nAs of December\n\n| $ in millions                                                  | 2022      | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|\n|                                                                |           | 2021    |\n| Customer lists and merchant relationships Gross carrying value | 3,225     | $ 1,460 |\n| Accumulated amortization                                       | $ (1,275) | (1,130) |\n| Net carrying value                                             | 1,950     | 330     |\n| Acquired leases and other Gross carrying value                 | 486       | 500     |\n| Accumulated amortization                                       | (427)     | (412)   |\n| Net carrying value                                             | 59        | 88      |\n| Total gross carrying value                                     | 3,711     | 1,960   |\n| Total accumulated amortization                                 | (1,702)   | (1,542) |\n| Total net carrying value y g                                   | $ 2,009   | 418     |\n\n178\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe firm acquired approximately $1.79 billion of identifiable intangible assets (with a weighted average amortization period of 13 years) during 2022, substantially all in connection with the acquisitions of GreenSky and NNIP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOperating Lease Right-of-Use Assets The firm enters into operating leases for real estate, office equipment and other assets, substantially all of which are used in connection with its operations. For leases longer than one year, the firm recognizes a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the liability to make payments. The lease term is generally determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease. For leases where the firm has the option to terminate or extend the lease, an assessment of the likelihood of exercising the option is incorporated into the determination of the lease term. Such assessment is initially performed at the inception of the lease and is updated if events occur that impact the original assessment.\n\nAn operating lease right-of-use asset is initially determined based on the operating lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, lease incentives and amounts paid at or prior to lease commencement. This amount is then amortized over the lease term.

The estimated fair value of such unsecured long-term borrowings was $173.70 billion as of December 2022 and $209.37 billion as of December 2021. As these borrowings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm's fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these borrowings been included in the firm's fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n\nSubordinated Borrowings Unsecured long-term borrowings includes subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt. Subordinated debt that matures within one year is included in unsecured short-term borrowings. Junior subordinated debt is junior in right of payment to other subordinated borrowings, which are junior to senior borrowings. Long-term subordinated debt had maturities ranging from 2025 to 2045 as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n\nThe table below presents information about subordinated borrowings.\n\n| $ in millions                  | Par Amount   | Carrying Value   | Rate   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|------------------|--------|\n| As of December 2022            |              |                  |        |\n| Subordinated debt              | $ 12,261     | $ 11,882         | 6.40%  |\n| Junior subordinated debt       | 968          | 1,054            | 4.86%  |\n| Total                          | $ 13,229     | $ 12,936         | 6.29%  |\n| As of December 2021            |              |                  |        |\n| Subordinated debt              | $ 12,437 $   | 15,571           | 1.74%  |\n| Junior subordinated debt Total | 968          | 1,321            | 1.31%  |\n|                                | $ 13,405 $   | 16,892           | 1.71%  |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 The par amount of subordinated debt issued by Group Inc. was $12.26 billion as of December 2022 and $12.44 billion as of December 2021, and the carrying value of subordinated debt issued by Group Inc. was $11.88 billion as of December 2022 and $15.57 billion as of December 2021.\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe rate is the weighted average interest rate for these\n\n- borrowings (excluding borrowings accounted for at fair value under the fair value option), including the effect of fair value hedges used to convert fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations.

Goldman Sachs Capital I issued $2.75 billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests (Trust Preferred securities) to third parties and $85 million of common beneficial interests to Group Inc. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, the outstanding par amount of junior subordinated debt held by Goldman Sachs Capital I was $968 million and the outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred securities and common beneficial interests issued by Goldman Sachs Capital I was $939 million and $29 million, respectively. Goldman Sachs Capital I is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but is not consolidated for accounting purposes.\n\nThe firm pays interest semi-annually on the junior subordinated debt at an annual rate of 6.345% and the debt matures on February 15, 2034. The coupon rate and the payment dates applicable to the beneficial interests are the same as the interest rate and payment dates for the junior subordinated debt. The firm has the right, from time to time, to defer payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt, and therefore cause payment on Goldman Sachs Capital I's preferred beneficial interests to be deferred, in each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual periods. During any such deferral period, the firm will not be permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of its common stock. Goldman Sachs Capital I is not permitted to pay any distributions on the common beneficial interests held by Group Inc. unless all dividends payable on the preferred beneficial interests have been paid in full.\n\n## Note 15.\n\n## Other Liabilities\n\nThe table below presents other liabilities by type.\n\nAs of December\n\n| $ in millions                            | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Compensation and benefits                | 7,225 $     | 10,838      |\n| Income tax-related liabilities           | 2,669       | 2,360       |\n| Operating lease liabilities              | 2,154       | 2,288       |\n| Noncontrolling interests                 | 649         | 840         |\n| Employee interests in consolidated funds | 25 8,733    | 29          |\n| Accrued expenses and other               |             | 8,146       |\n| Total                                    | 21,455 $    | 24,501      |",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe firm accounts for a securitization as a sale when it has relinquished control over the transferred financial assets. Prior to securitization, the firm generally accounts for assets pending transfer at fair value and therefore does not typically recognize significant gains or losses upon the transfer of assets. Net revenues from underwriting activities are recognized in connection with the sales of the underlying\n\nbeneficial interests to investors. The firm generally receives cash in exchange for the transferred assets but may also have continuing involvement with the transferred financial assets, including ownership of beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, primarily in the form of debt instruments. The firm may also purchase senior or subordinated securities issued by securitization vehicles (which are typically VIEs) in connection with secondary market-making activities.\n\nThe primary risks included in beneficial interests and other interests from the firm's continuing involvement with securitization vehicles are the performance of the underlying collateral, the position of the firm's investment in the capital structure of the securitization vehicle and the market yield for the security. Interests accounted for at fair value are primarily classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Interests not accounted for at fair value are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. See Note 4 for further information about fair value measurements.\n\nThe table below presents the amount of financial assets securitized and the cash flows received on retained interests in securitization entities in which the firm had continuing involvement as of the end of the period.\n\nYear Ended December\n\n|                                            | 2022 2021       | 2022 2021         | 2022 2021                |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| $ in millions                              |                 |                   | 2020                     |\n| Residential mortgages Commercial mortgages | $ 26,717 13,935 | 18,396            | $ 29,048 $ 20,167 14,904 |\n| Other financial assets                     | 3,617           | 4,377             | 1,775                    |\n| Total financial assets securitized         | $ 44,269        | $ 51,821 $ 36,846 |                          |\n| Retained interests cash flows              | $ 551           | $ 513 $           | 331                      |\n\nThe firm securitized assets of $792 million during 2022, $886 million during 2021 and $551 million during 2020, in a noncash exchange for loans and investments.\n\n184\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe table below presents information about nonconsolidated securitization entities to which the firm sold assets and had\n\ncontinuing involvement as of the end of the period.\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n115,351 $\n\n3,552 $\n\n266\n\n|                                                                        | Outstanding Principal   | Retained    | Purchased   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| $ in millions                                                          | Amount                  | Interests   | Interests   |\n| As of December 2022                                                    |                         |             |             |\n| U.S. government agency-issued CMOs                                     | $ 38,617 $              | 1,835 $     | -           |\n| Other residential mortgage-backed                                      | 27,075                  | 1,461       | 117         |\n| Other commercial mortgage-backed                                       | 59,688                  | 1,349       | 82          |\n| Corporate debt and other asset-backed                                  | 8,750                   | 398         | 46          |\n| Total                                                                  | $ 134,130 $             | 5,043 $     | 245         |\n| As of December 2021                                                    |                         |             | 3           |\n| U.S. government agency-issued CMOs $                                   | 33,984 $                | 955 $       |             |\n| Other residential mortgage-backed                                      | 23,262                  | 1,114 1,123 | 96 130      |\n| Other commercial mortgage-backed Corporate debt and other asset-backed | 50,350                  |             |             |\n|                                                                        | 7,755                   | 360         | 37          |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 CMOs represents collateralized mortgage obligations.\n- \u00b7 The outstanding principal amount is presented for the purpose of providing information about the size of the securitization entities and is not representative of the firm's risk of loss.\n- \u00b7 The firm's risk of loss from retained or purchased interests is limited to the carrying value of these interests.\n- \u00b7 Purchased interests represent senior and subordinated interests, purchased in connection with secondary marketmaking activities, in securitization entities in which the firm also holds retained interests.\n- \u00b7 Substantially all of the total outstanding principal amount and total retained interests relate to securitizations during 2018 and thereafter.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of retained interests was $5.03 billion as of December 2022 and $3.57 billion as of December 2021.\n\nIn addition to the interests in the table above, the firm had other continuing involvement in the form of derivative transactions and commitments with certain nonconsolidated VIEs.

In practice, simultaneous changes in assumptions might magnify or counteract the sensitivities disclosed above.\n- \u00b7 The constant prepayment rate is included only for positions for which it is a key assumption in the determination of fair value.\n- \u00b7 The discount rate for retained interests that relate to U.S. government agency-issued CMOs does not include any credit loss. Expected credit loss assumptions are reflected in the discount rate for the remainder of retained interests.\n\nThe firm has other retained interests not reflected in the table above with a fair value of $384 million and a weighted average life of 6.4 years as of December 2022, and a fair value of $360 million and a weighted average life of 3.6 years as of December 2021. Due to the nature and fair value of certain of these retained interests, the weighted average assumptions for constant prepayment and discount rates and the related sensitivity to adverse changes are not meaningful as of both December 2022 and December 2021. The firm's maximum exposure to adverse changes in the value of these interests is the carrying value of $398 million as of December 2022 and $360 million as of December 2021.\n\n## Note 17.\n\nVariable Interest Entities A variable interest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt or equity) or other interest (e.g., derivatives or loans and lending commitments) that will absorb portions of the VIE's expected losses and/or receive portions of the VIE's expected residual\n\nreturns. The firm's variable interests in VIEs include senior and subordinated debt; loans and lending commitments; limited and general partnership interests; preferred and common equity; derivatives that may include foreign currency, equity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and certain of the fees the firm receives from investment funds. Certain interest rate, foreign currency and credit derivatives the firm enters into with VIEs are not variable interests because they create, rather than absorb, risk.\n\nVIEs generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are either collateralized by or indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The debt and equity securities issued by a VIE may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. The firm's involvement with VIEs includes securitization of financial assets, as described in Note 16, and investments in and loans to other types of VIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the firm's consolidation policies, including the definition of a VIE.\n\n## VIE Consolidation Analysis\n\nThe enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis that principally considers:\n\n- \u00b7 Which variable interest holder has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance;\n- \u00b7 Which variable interest holder has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE;\n- \u00b7 The VIE's purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders;\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe VIE's capital structure;\n\n- \u00b7\n\nThe terms between the VIE and its variable interest holders\n\n- and other parties involved with the VIE; and \u00b7 Related-party relationships.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n185",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe firm reassesses its evaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when certain reconsideration events occur. The firm reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on current\n\nfacts and circumstances.\n\nVIE Activities The firm is principally involved with VIEs through the\n\nfollowing business activities: Mortgage-Backed VIEs. The firm sells residential and commercial mortgage loans and securities to mortgagebacked VIEs and may retain beneficial interests in the assets sold to these VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives with certain of these VIEs, primarily interest rate swaps, which are typically not variable interests. The firm generally enters into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk.\n\nReal Estate, Credit- and Power-Related and Other Investing VIEs. The firm purchases equity and debt securities issued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold real estate, performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets and equity securities. The firm generally does not sell assets to, or enter into derivatives with, these VIEs.\n\nCorporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs. The firm structures VIEs that issue notes to clients, purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by corporate debt and other assetbacked VIEs in connection with market-making activities, and makes loans to VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain of these VIEs synthetically create the exposure for the beneficial interests they issue by entering into credit derivatives with the firm, rather than purchasing the underlying assets. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives, such as total return swaps, with certain corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays the VIE a return due to the beneficial interest holders and receives the return on the collateral owned by the VIE. The collateral owned by these VIEs is primarily other assetbacked loans and securities. The firm may be removed as the total return swap counterparty and may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk related to these swaps. The firm may sell assets to the corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs it structures.\n\n186\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nPrincipal-Protected Note VIEs. The firm structures VIEs that issue principal-protected notes to clients. These VIEs own portfolios of assets, principally with exposure to hedge funds. Substantially all of the principal protection on the notes issued by these VIEs is provided by the asset portfolio rebalancing that is required under the terms of the notes. The firm enters into total return swaps with these VIEs under which the firm pays the VIE the return due to the principalprotected note holders and receives the return on the assets owned by the VIE. The firm may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk. The firm also obtains funding through these VIEs.\n\nInvestments in Funds. The firm makes equity investments in certain investment fund VIEs it manages and is entitled to receive fees from these VIEs. The firm has generally not sold assets to, or entered into derivatives with, these VIEs.\n\n## Nonconsolidated VIEs\n\nThe table below presents a summary of the nonconsolidated VIEs in which the firm holds variable interests.\n\n|                                                    | As of December   | As of December   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                                      | 2022             | 2021             |\n| Total nonconsolidated VIEs                         |                  |                  |\n| Assets in VIEs                                     | 181,697          | $ 176,809        |\n| Carrying value of variable interests - assets      | 12,325 $         | 9,582            |\n| Carrying value of variable interests - liabilities | 659 $            | 928              |\n| Maximum exposure to loss:                          |                  |                  |\n| Retained interests                                 | 5,043 $ 861      | 3,552            |\n| Purchased interests                                |                  | 1,071            |\n| Commitments and guarantees                         | 3,087            | 2,440            |\n| Derivatives                                        | 8,802            | 8,682            |\n| Debt and equity                                    | 6,026            | 4,639            |\n| Total                                              | 23,819 $         | 20,384           |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 The nature of the firm's variable interests is described in the rows under maximum exposure to loss.\n- \u00b7 The firm's exposure to the obligations of VIEs is generally limited to its interests in these entities.

As a result, the maximum exposure to loss exceeds liabilities recorded for commitments and guarantees, and derivatives.",

These commitments are presented net of amounts syndicated to third parties. The total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect actual future cash flows because the firm may syndicate portions of these commitments. In addition, commitments can expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the counterparty's request. The firm also provides credit to consumers by issuing credit card lines and through commitments to provide unsecured installment loans.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- In the table above: \u00b7 Held for investment lending commitments are accounted for at amortized cost. The carrying value of lending commitments was a liability of $1.01 billion (including allowance for credit losses of $774 million) as of December 2022 and $1.05 billion (including allowance for credit losses of $776 million) as of December 2021. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments was a liability of $5.95 billion as of December 2022 and $4.17 billion as of December 2021. Had these lending commitments been carried at fair value and included in the fair value hierarchy, $3.11 billion as of December 2022 and $1.91 billion as of December 2021 would have been classified in level 2, and $2.84 billion as of December 2022 and $2.26 billion as of December 2021 would have been classified in level 3.\n- \u00b7 Held for sale lending commitments are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. The carrying value of lending commitments held for sale was a liability of $88 million as of December 2022 and $91 million as of December 2021. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments approximates the carrying value. Had these lending commitments been included in the fair value hierarchy, they would have been primarily classified in level 3 as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n- \u00b7 Gains or losses related to lending commitments at fair value, if any, are generally recorded net of any fees in other principal transactions.\n\nCommercial Lending. The firm's commercial lending commitments were primarily extended to investment-grade corporate borrowers. Such commitments primarily included $127.60 billion as of December 2022 and $120.99 billion as of December 2021, related to relationship lending activities (principally used for operating and general corporate purposes), and $7.71 billion as of December 2022 and $21.07 billion as of December 2021, related to other investment banking activities (generally extended for contingent acquisition financing and are often intended to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other funding sources). The firm also extends lending commitments in connection with other types of corporate lending, commercial real estate financing and other collateralized lending. See Note 9 for further information about funded loans. To mitigate the credit risk associated with the firm's\n\ncommercial lending activities, the firm obtains credit protection on certain loans and lending commitments through credit default swaps, both single-name and indexbased contracts, and through the issuance of credit-linked notes.\n\nWarehouse Financing. The firm provides financing to clients who warehouse financial assets. These arrangements are collateralized by the warehoused assets, primarily consisting of residential real estate, consumer and corporate\n\nloans. Consumer. The firm's consumer lending commitments\n\n- includes: \u00b7 Credit card lines issued by the firm to consumers were $62.22 billion as of December 2022 and $33.97 billion as of December 2021. These credit card lines are cancellable by the firm. The increase in credit card lending commitments from December 2021 to December 2022 included approximately $15.0 billion relating to the firm's acquisition of the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio in February 2022. In addition, consumer lending commitments as of December 2021 included a commitment of approximately $2.0 billion to acquire the outstanding credit card loans related to the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Commitments to provide unsecured installment loans to consumers were $1.88 billion as of December 2022 and $9 million as of December 2021. The increase in these lending commitments from December 2021 to December 2022 primarily related to commitments extended in connection with point-of-sale financing.\n\n## Risk Participations\n\nThe firm also risk participates certain of its commercial lending commitments to other financial institutions. In the event of a risk participant's default, the firm will be responsible to fund the borrower.\n\n## Collateralized Agreement Commitments/ Collateralized Financing Commitments\n\nCollateralized agreement commitments includes forward starting resale and securities borrowing agreements, and collateralized financing commitments includes forward starting repurchase and secured lending agreements that settle at a future date, generally within three business days. Collateralized agreement commitments also includes transactions where the firm has entered into commitments to provide contingent financing to its clients and counterparties through resale agreements. The firm's funding of these commitments depends on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to the resale agreement and these commitments can expire unused.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n189",

See the tables in 'Commitments' above for a summary of the firm's commitments.\n\n190\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n- \u00b7 The carrying value for derivatives included derivative assets of $578 million as of December 2022 and $1.10 billion as of December 2021, and derivative liabilities of $8.06 billion as of December 2022 and $4.51 billion as of\n\nDecember 2021. Derivative Guarantees. The firm enters into various derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including written equity and commodity put options, written currency contracts and interest rate caps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives are risk managed together with derivatives that do not meet the definition of a guarantee, and therefore the amounts in the table above do not reflect the firm's overall risk related to derivative activities. Disclosures about derivatives are not required if they may be cash settled and the firm has no basis to conclude it is probable that the counterparties held the underlying instruments at the inception of the contract. The firm has concluded that these conditions have been met for certain large, internationally active commercial and investment bank counterparties, central clearing counterparties, hedge funds and certain other counterparties. Accordingly, the firm has not included such contracts in the table above. See Note 7 for information about credit derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee, which are not included in the table above.\n\nDerivatives are accounted for at fair value and therefore the carrying value is considered the best indication of payment/ performance risk for individual contracts. However, the carrying values in the table above exclude the effect of counterparty and cash collateral netting.\n\nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees . Securities lending and clearing guarantees include the indemnifications and guarantees that the firm provides in its capacity as an agency lender and in its capacity as a sponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation.\n\nAs an agency lender, the firm indemnifies most of its securities lending customers against losses incurred in the event that borrowers do not return securities and the collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the securities borrowed. The maximum payout of such indemnifications was $12.23 billion as of December 2022 and $11.05 billion as of December 2021. Collateral held by the lenders in connection with securities lending indemnifications was $12.62 billion as of December 2022 and $11.36 billion as of December 2021. Because the contractual nature of these arrangements requires the firm to obtain collateral with a market value that exceeds the value of the securities lent to the borrower, there is minimal performance risk associated with these indemnifications.",

        "page_content": "## THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nAs a sponsoring member of the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the performance of its sponsored member clients to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in connection with certain resale and repurchase agreements. To minimize potential losses on such guarantees, the firm obtains a security interest in the collateral that the sponsored client placed with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on such guarantees is minimal. As of December 2022, the maximum payout on this guarantee was $8.74 billion and the related collateral held was $8.70 billion. There were no amounts outstanding under the guarantee as of December 2021.\n\nOther Financial Guarantees . In the ordinary course of business, the firm provides other financial guarantees of the obligations of third parties (e.g., standby letters of credit and other guarantees to enable clients to complete transactions and fund-related guarantees). These guarantees represent obligations to make payments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a contractual arrangement with that beneficiary. Other financial guarantees also include a guarantee that the firm has provided to the Government of Malaysia that it will receive, by August 2025, at least $1.4 billion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In connection with this guarantee, the firm is also required to make a onetime interim payment of $250 million towards the $1.4 billion if the Government of Malaysia has not received at least $500 million in assets and proceeds by August 2022. The firm considers the reports that it receives on a semi-annual basis, expected in February and August, in evaluating the progress of Malaysia's recovery efforts. The firm and the Government of Malaysia disagree about and, following an extension of the contractual dispute resolution period, continue to discuss whether the Government of Malaysia did, in fact, recover at least $500 million as of August 2022 and whether any interim payment was due. If the parties are unable to resolve this dispute, it would be settled by arbitration. Any amounts paid by the firm would, in any event, be subject to reimbursement in the event the assets and proceeds received by the Government of Malaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed $1.4 billion. See Note 27 for further information about matters related to 1MDB.\n\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The firm has established trusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital I, Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III (the Trusts), and other entities, for the limited purpose of issuing securities to third parties, lending the proceeds to the firm and entering into contractual arrangements with the firm and third parties related to this purpose. The firm does not consolidate these entities. See Notes 14 and 19 for further information about the transactions involving the Trusts.\n\nThe firm effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of the securities issued by these entities. Timely payment by the firm of amounts due to these entities under the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements will be sufficient to cover payments due on the securities issued by these entities. No subsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the securities of the Trusts.\n\nManagement believes that it is unlikely that any circumstances will occur, such as nonperformance on the part of paying agents or other service providers, that would make it necessary for the firm to make payments related to these entities other than those required under the terms of the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements and in connection with certain expenses incurred by these entities.\n\nIndemnities and Guarantees of Service Providers. In the ordinary course of business, the firm indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified potential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the firm or its affiliates.\n\nThe firm may also be liable to some clients or other parties for losses arising from its custodial role or caused by acts or omissions of third-party service providers, including subcustodians and third-party brokers. In certain cases, the firm has the right to seek indemnification from these third-party service providers for certain relevant losses incurred by the firm. In addition, the firm is a member of payment, clearing and settlement networks, as well as securities exchanges around the world that may require the firm to meet the obligations of such networks and exchanges in the event of member defaults and other loss scenarios. In connection with the firm's prime brokerage and clearing\n\nbusinesses, the firm agrees to clear and settle transactions entered into by clients with other brokerage firms. The firm's obligations in respect of such transactions are secured by the assets in the client's account and proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of the client. In connection with joint venture investments, the firm may issue loan guarantees under which it may be liable in the event of fraud, misappropriation, environmental liabilities and other matters involving the borrower.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n191",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2022 and\n\nDecember 2021. Other Representations, Warranties and Indemnifications. The firm provides representations and warranties to counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial transactions and occasionally indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and warranties. The firm may also provide indemnifications protecting against changes in or adverse application of certain U.S. tax laws in connection with ordinary-course transactions, such as securities issuances, borrowings or derivatives.\n\nIn addition, the firm may provide indemnifications to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change in or an adverse application of certain non-U.S. tax laws.\n\nThese indemnifications generally are standard contractual terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in these indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify are not expected to occur. The firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n\nGuarantees of Subsidiaries. Group Inc. is the entity that fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by GS Finance Corp., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm. Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Group Inc. has provided guarantees to Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and GSBE related to agreements that each entity has entered into with certain of its counterparties. Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as negotiated with counterparties. Group Inc. is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under its subsidiary guarantees. However, because these obligations are also obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, Group Inc.'s liabilities as guarantor are not separately disclosed.\n\n192\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n## Note 19.\n\n## Shareholders' Equity\n\nCommon Equity As of both December 2022 and December 2021, the firm had 4.00 billion authorized shares of common stock and 200 million authorized shares of nonvoting common stock, each with a par value of $0.01 per share. During 2022, in connection with the acquisition of GreenSky, the firm issued approximately 5.5 million shares of common stock, including approximately 325,000 shares subject to future service.\n\nThe firm's share repurchase program is intended to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The share repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by the firm's current and projected capital position, and capital deployment opportunities, but which may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of the firm's common stock.\n\nThe table below presents information about common stock repurchases.\n\n|                                        | Year Ended December 2021 2020   | Year Ended December 2021 2020   | Year Ended December 2021 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| in millions, except per share amounts  | 2022                            |                                 |                                 |\n| Common share repurchases               | 10.1                            | 15.3                            | 8.2                             |\n| Average cost per share                 | $346.07                         | $ 339.81                        | $ 236.35                        |\n| Total cost of common share repurchases | $ 3,500                         | $ 5,200 $ 1,928                 |                                 |\n\nPursuant to the terms of certain share-based compensation plans, employees may remit shares to the firm or the firm may cancel share-based awards to satisfy statutory employee tax withholding requirements. Under these plans, 11,644 shares in 2022, 1,830 shares in 2021 and 3,476 shares in 2020 were remitted with a total value of $4 million in 2022, $0.5 million in 2021 and $0.9 million in 2020, and the firm cancelled 4.6 million share-based awards in 2022, and 3.4 million in both 2021 and 2020, with a total value of $1.59 billion in 2022, $984 million in 2021 and $829 million in 2020.\n\nThe table below presents common stock dividends declared.\n\nYear Ended December\n\n|   2022 2021 2020 | 2022 2021 2020   | 2022 2021 2020   |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                9 | $ 6.50 $ 5.00    |                  |\n\nOn January 13, 2023, the Board of Directors of Group Inc.\n\n(Board) declared a dividend of $2.50 per common share to be paid on March 30, 2023 to common shareholders of record on March 2, 2023.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 20.\n\nRegulation and Capital Adequacy The FRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a bank holding company under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under amendments to this Act. The firm is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with\n\nthe regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework).\n\nThe capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital and leverage ratios that compare measures of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets and off-balance sheet exposures. Failure to comply with these capital requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the firm's regulators and could limit the firm's ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. The firm's capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Furthermore, certain of the firm's subsidiaries are subject to separate regulations and capital requirements.\n\n## Capital Framework\n\nThe regulations under the Capital Framework are largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III) and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework, the firm is an 'Advanced approaches' banking organization and has been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).\n\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based capital and the capital conservation buffer requirements. The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.\n\nThe firm calculates its CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Each of the ratios calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules must meet its respective capital requirements. Under the Capital Framework, the firm is also subject to\n\nleverage requirements which consist of a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), as well as the SLR buffer.\n\nConsolidated Regulatory Capital Requirements Risk-Based Capital Ratios. The table below presents the\n\nrisk-based capital requirements.\n\nTotal capital ratio\n\n16.9%\n\n13.0%\n\n|                      | Standardized   | Advanced   |\n|----------------------|----------------|------------|\n| As of December 2022  |                |            |\n| CET1 capital ratio   | 13.3%          | 9.5%       |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio | 14.8%          | 11.0%      |\n| Total capital ratio  | 16.8%          | 13.0%      |\n| As of December 2021  |                |            |\n| CET1 capital ratio   | 13.4%          | 9.5%       |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio | 14.9%          | 11.0%      |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 As of both December 2022 and December 2021, under both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules, the CET1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 4.5%, the Tier 1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 6.0% and the Total capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 8.0%. These requirements also include the capital conservation buffer requirements, consisting of the G-SIB surcharge of 2.5% (Method 2) and the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to zero percent. In addition, the capital conservation buffer requirements include the stress capital buffer of 6.3% as of December 2022 and 6.4% as of December 2021 under the Standardized Capital Rules and a buffer of 2.5% under the Advanced Capital Rules.\n- \u00b7 The G-SIB surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year and is generally applicable for the following year. The G-SIB surcharge is calculated using two methodologies, the higher of which is reflected in the firm's risk-based capital requirements. The first calculation (Method 1) is based on the Basel Committee's methodology which, among other factors, relies upon measures of the size, activity and complexity of each G-SIB. The second calculation (Method 2) uses similar inputs but includes a measure of reliance on short-term wholesale funding.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n195",

As of December 2021, this deduction excluded investments that were subject to an extended conformance period. See Note 8 for further information about the Volcker Rule.\n- \u00b7 Other adjustments within CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital primarily include credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities, the overfunded portion of the firm's defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, debt valuation adjustments and other required credit risk-based deductions. Other adjustments within Advanced Tier 2 capital include eligible credit reserves.\n- \u00b7 Qualifying subordinated debt is subordinated debt issued by Group Inc. with an original maturity of five years or greater. The outstanding amount of subordinated debt qualifying for Tier 2 capital is reduced upon reaching a remaining maturity of five years. See Note 14 for further information about the firm's subordinated debt.\n- \u00b7 Junior subordinated debt is debt issued to a Trust and was fully phased out of regulatory capital on January 1, 2022. As of December 2021, 10% of this debt was included in Tier 2 capital and 90% was phased out of regulatory capital. Junior subordinated debt is reduced by the amount of Trust Preferred securities purchased by the firm.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor both risk management purposes and regulatory capital calculations, the firm uses a single VaR model which captures risks, including those related to interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. However, VaR used for risk management purposes differs from VaR used for regulatory capital requirements (regulatory VaR) due to differences in time horizons, confidence levels and the scope of positions on which VaR is calculated. For risk management purposes, a 95% one-day VaR is used, whereas for regulatory capital requirements, a 99% 10-day VaR is used to determine Market RWAs and a 99% one-day VaR is used to determine regulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the daily net revenues used to determine risk management VaR exceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to the VaR measure calculated as of the end of the prior business day) include intraday activity, whereas the Capital Framework requires that intraday activity be excluded from daily net revenues when calculating regulatory VaR exceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. As a result, there may be differences in the number of VaR exceptions and the amount of daily net revenues calculated for regulatory VaR compared to the amounts calculated for risk management VaR.\n\nThe firm's positional losses observed on a single day exceeded its 99% one-day regulatory VaR on one occasion during each of the years ended 2022 and 2021. There was no change in the firm's VaR multiplier used to calculate Market RWAs;\n\n- \u00b7 Stressed VaR is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, during a period of significant market stress;\n- \u00b7 Incremental risk is the potential loss in value of nonsecuritized positions due to the default or credit migration of issuers of financial instruments over a one-year time horizon;\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive risk is the potential loss in value, due to price risk and defaults, within the firm's credit correlation positions; and \u00b7 Specific risk is the risk of loss on a position that could\n- result from factors other than broad market movements, including event risk, default risk and idiosyncratic risk. The standardized measurement method is used to determine specific risk RWAs, by applying supervisory defined riskweighting factors after applicable netting is performed.\n\nOperational Risk Operational RWAs are only required to be included under the Advanced Capital Rules.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans (principally due to increased lending activity). Standardized Market RWAs as of December 2022 increased by $6.77 billion compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting an increase in regulatory VaR (principally due to higher levels of market volatility).\n\nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of December 2022 increased by $22.81 billion compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans, other credit RWAs and securities financing transactions (principally due to updates to the probability of default models in the fourth quarter of 2022). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in equity investments (principally due to reduced exposures as a result of sales and unrealized losses). Advanced Market RWAs as of December 2022 increased by $6.77 billion compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting an increase in regulatory VaR (principally due to higher levels of market volatility). Advanced Operational RWAs as of December 2022 increased by $1.95 billion compared with December 2021, primarily associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.",

GS Bank USA is the firm's primary U.S. bank subsidiary. GS Bank USA is a New York Statechartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and is subject to regulatory capital requirements that are calculated under the Capital Framework. GS Bank USA is an Advanced approaches banking organization under the Capital Framework. The deposits of GS Bank USA are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law.\n\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based capital and the capital conservation buffer requirements (consisting of a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer). The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as CET1 capital. In addition, the Capital Framework includes the leverage ratio requirement.\n\nGS Bank USA is required to calculate the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. The lower of each risk-based capital ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules is the ratio against which GS Bank USA's compliance with its risk-based capital requirements is assessed. In addition, under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action applicable to GS Bank USA, in order to meet the quantitative requirements for a 'wellcapitalized' depository institution, GS Bank USA must also meet the 'well-capitalized' requirements in the table below. GS Bank USA's capital levels and prompt corrective action classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Failure to comply with the capital requirements, including a breach of the buffers described below, would result in restrictions being imposed by the regulators.\n\nThe table below presents GS Bank USA's risk-based capital, leverage and 'well-capitalized' requirements.\n\n'Well-capitalized'\n\n| Risk-based capital requirements   | Requirements   | Requirements   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| CET1 capital ratio                | 7.0%           | 6.5%           |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio              | 8.5%           | 8.0%           |\n| Total capital ratio               | 10.5%          | 10.0%          |\n| Leverage requirements             |                |                |\n| Tier 1 leverage ratio             | 4.0%           | 5.0%           |\n| SLR                               | 3.0%           | 6.0%           |\n\n- In the table above: \u00b7 The CET1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 4.5%, the Tier 1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 6.0% and the Total capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 8.0%. These requirements also include the capital conservation buffer requirements consisting of a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to zero percent.\n- \u00b7 The 'well-capitalized' requirements are the binding requirements for leverage ratios.\n\nThe table below presents information about GS Bank USA's risk-based capital ratios.\n\n| $ in millions As of December 2022   | Standardized   | Advanced   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------|------------|\n| CET1 capital                        | 46,845 $       | 46,845     |\n| Tier 1 capital                      | 46,845 $       | 46,845     |\n| Tier 2 capital                      | 8,042 $        | 5,382      |\n| Total capital                       | 54,887 $       | 52,227     |\n| RWAs                                | 357,112 $      | 275,451    |\n| CET1 capital ratio                  | 13.1%          | 17.0%      |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio                | 13.1%          | 17.0%      |\n| Total capital ratio                 | 15.4%          | 19.0%      |\n| As of December 2021                 |                |            |\n| CET1 capital                        | 42,535 $       | 42,535     |\n| Tier 1 capital                      | 42,535 $       | 42,535     |\n| Tier 2 capital                      | 6,430 $        | 4,646      |\n| Total capital                       | 48,965 $       | 47,181     |\n| RWAs                                | 312,601 $      | 222,607    |\n| CET1 capital ratio                  | 13.6%          | 19.1%      |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio                | 13.6%          | 19.1%      |\n| Total capital ratio                 | 15.7%          | 21.2%      |\n\n## In the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 The lower of the Standardized or Advanced ratio is the ratio against which GS Bank USA's compliance with the capital requirements is assessed under the risk-based Capital Rules, and therefore, the Standardized ratios applied to GS Bank USA as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n- \u00b7 Beginning in January 2022, GS Bank USA started to phase in the estimated reduction to regulatory capital as a result of adopting the CECL model.

These limitations include provisions of applicable law and regulations and other regulatory restrictions that limit the ability of those subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends without prior regulatory approval. For example, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. As a result of dividends paid in connection with the acquisition of GSBE in July 2021, GS Bank USA cannot currently declare any additional dividends without prior regulatory approval.\n\nIn addition, subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax and legal guidelines, rating agency requirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk.\n\nGroup Inc.'s equity investment in subsidiaries was $134.59 billion as of December 2022 and $118.90 billion as of December 2021, of which Group Inc. was required to maintain $82.52 billion as of December 2022 and $77.22 billion as of December 2021, of minimum equity capital in its regulated subsidiaries in order to satisfy the regulatory requirements of such subsidiaries.\n\nGroup Inc.'s capital invested in certain non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries is exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all of which is managed through a combination of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt and derivatives.

Management fees waived were $123 million for 2022, $595 million for 2021 and $109 million for 2020.\n\nIn accordance with the Volcker Rule, the firm does not provide financial support to covered funds. However, in the ordinary course of business, the firm may choose to provide voluntary financial support to funds that are not subject to the Volcker Rule, although any such support is not expected to be material to the results of operations of the firm. Except for the fee waivers noted above, the firm did not provide any additional financial support to its affiliated funds during either 2022 or 2021.\n\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, the firm may also engage in other activities with its affiliated funds, including, among others, securities lending, trade execution, market-making, custody, and acquisition and bridge financing.

These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized and primarily relate to the ability to utilize losses in various tax jurisdictions.

As of December 2022, the firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $37 million in connection with foreign tax credit carryforwards and a related valuation allowance of $20 million. As of December 2022, the firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $41 million in connection with general business credit carryforwards and $9 million in connection with state and local tax credit carryforwards. If not utilized, the foreign tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2033, the general business credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2023 and the state and local tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2024.\n\nAs of both December 2022 and December 2021, the firm had no U.S. capital loss carryforwards and no related net deferred income tax assets.

The increases in both 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets from which the firm does not expect to realize any benefit.\n\nThe firm permanently reinvested eligible earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.

A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe accrued liability for interest expense related to income tax matters and income tax penalties was $205 million as of December 2022 and $131 million as of December 2021. The firm recognized interest expense and income tax penalties of $59 million for 2022, $13 million for 2021 and $41 million for 2020. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly during the twelve months subsequent to December 2022 due to potential audit settlements. However, at this time it is not possible to estimate any potential change.\n\nThe table below presents the changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in other liabilities.\n\n|                                                                | Year Ended or as of December   | Year Ended or as of December   | Year Ended or as of December   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| $ in millions                                                  | 2022                           | 2021                           | 2020                           |\n| Beginning balance                                              | $ 1,446                        |                                | $ 1,251 $ 1,445                |\n| Increases based on current year tax positions                  | 190                            | 297                            | 164                            |\n| Increases based on prior years' tax positions                  | 10                             | 95                             | 209                            |\n| Decreases based on prior years' tax positions                  | (32)                           | (111)                          | (205)                          |\n| Decreases related to settlements                               | (76)                           | (80)                           | (367)                          |\n| Exchange rate fluctuations                                     | (5)                            | (6)                            | 5                              |\n| Ending balance                                                 | $ 1,533                        |                                | $ 1,446 $ 1,251                |\n| Related deferred income tax asset Net unrecognized tax benefit | 315                            | 287                            | 200                            |\n|                                                                | $ 1,218                        |                                | $ 1,159 $ 1,051                |\n\nRegulatory Tax Examinations The firm is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities in jurisdictions where the firm has significant business operations, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The firm does not expect completion of these audits to have a material impact on the firm's financial condition, but it may be material to operating results for a particular period, depending, in part, on the operating results for that period.\n\nThe table below presents the earliest tax years that remain subject to examination by major jurisdiction.\n\n|                           |   As of December 2022 |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Jurisdiction U.S. Federal |                  2011 |\n| New York State and City   |                  2015 |\n| United Kingdom            |                  2017 |\n| Japan                     |                  2016 |\n\nHong Kong\n\n2016\n\nThe firm has been accepted into the Compliance Assurance Process program by the IRS for each of the tax years from 2013 through 2023. This program allows the firm to work with the IRS to identify and resolve potential U.S. federal tax issues before the filing of tax returns. All issues for the 2011 and 2012 tax years have been resolved and completion is pending final review by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). During 2022, the firm reached an agreement with IRS Appeals on the remaining issues for tax years 2012 through 2019. Subject to final review by JCT, this agreement will not have a material impact on the effective tax rate. During 2022, the fieldwork for the 2020 tax year was completed and the final resolution is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate. The 2021 tax year remains subject to post-filing review. New York State and City examinations of 2015 through 2018 commenced during 2021.\n\nAll years, including and subsequent to the years in the table above, remain open to examination by the taxing authorities. The firm believes that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits it has established is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments.\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n207",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 25.\n\nBusiness Segments The firm manages and reports its activities in three business segments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. See Note 1 for information about the firm's business segments, including the\n\nchanges made during 2022. Compensation and benefits expenses in the firm's segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the firm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of the firm's business may be significantly affected by the performance of the firm's other business segments.\n\nThe firm allocates assets (including allocations of global core liquid assets and cash, secured client financing and other assets), revenues and expenses among the three business segments. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. The allocation process is based on the manner in which management currently views the performance of the segments.\n\nThe allocation of common shareholders' equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements.\n\nNet earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment's pre-tax earnings.\n\nManagement believes that this allocation provides a reasonable representation of each segment's contribution to consolidated net earnings to common, return on average common equity and total assets. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate thirdparty rates.\n\n208\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nSegment Results The table below presents a summary of the firm's

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 26.\n\nCredit Concentrations The firm's concentrations of credit risk arise from its marketmaking, client facilitation, investing, underwriting, lending and collateralized transactions, and cash management activities, and may be impacted by changes in economic, industry or political factors. These activities expose the firm to many different industries and counterparties, and may also subject the firm to a concentration of credit risk to a particular central bank, counterparty, borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, or to a particular clearinghouse or exchange. The firm seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring exposures and obtaining collateral from counterparties as deemed appropriate.\n\nThe firm measures and monitors its credit exposure based on amounts owed to the firm after taking into account risk mitigants that the firm considers when determining credit risk. Such risk mitigants include netting and collateral arrangements and economic hedges, such as credit derivatives, futures and forward contracts. Netting and collateral agreements permit the firm to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and/or enable the firm to obtain collateral on an upfront or contingent basis.\n\nThe table below presents the credit concentrations included in trading cash instruments and investments.\n\n|                                            | As of December   | As of December   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| $ in millions                              | 2022             | 2021             |\n| U.S. government and agency obligations     | $ 205,935        | $ 141,191        |\n| Percentage of total assets                 | 14.3%            | 9.6%             |\n| Non-U.S. government and agency obligations | $ 40,334         | $ 51,426         |\n| Percentage of total assets                 | 2.8%             | 3.5%             |\n\nIn addition, the firm had $208.53 billion as of December 2022 and $222.20 billion as of December 2021 of cash deposits held at central banks (included in cash and cash equivalents), of which $165.77 billion as of December 2022 and $122.01 billion as of December 2021 was held at the Federal Reserve.\n\nAs of both December 2022 and December 2021, the firm did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded 2% of total assets.\n\nCollateral obtained by the firm related to derivative assets is\n\nprincipally cash and is held by the firm or a third-party custodian. Collateral obtained by the firm related to resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions is primarily U.S. government and agency obligations and non-U.S. government and agency obligations. See Note 11 for further information about collateralized agreements and financings.\n\n210\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe table below presents U.S. government and agency obligations and non-U.S. government and agency obligations that collateralize resale agreements and securities borrowed\n\ntransactions.\n\n|                                        | As of December   |        |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------|--------|\n| $ in millions                          | 2022             | 2021   |\n| U.S. government and agency obligations | 164,897 $        | 86,274 |\n\nNon-U.S. government and agency obligations\n\n$\n\n76,456\n\n$ 141,588\n\nIn the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-U.S. government and agency obligations primarily consists of securities issued by the governments of the U.K., Japan, Germany and France.\n- \u00b7 Given that the firm's primary credit exposure on such transactions is to the counterparty to the transaction, the firm would be exposed to the collateral issuer only in the event of counterparty default.\n\n## Note 27.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nThe firm is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings (including those described below) concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of the firm's businesses. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages.\n\nUnder ASC 450, an event is 'reasonably possible' if 'the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely' and an event is 'remote' if 'the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.' Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the firm is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the firm believes the risk of loss is more than slight.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWith respect to matters described below for which management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an amount of money damages, (ii) the firm is being, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers in a securities offering and is not being indemnified by a party that the firm believes will pay the full amount of any judgment, or (iii) the purchasers are demanding that the firm repurchase securities, management has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss based on (a) in the case of (i), the amount of money damages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the difference between the initial sales price of the securities that the firm sold in such offering and the estimated lowest subsequent price of such securities prior to the action being commenced and (c) in the case of (iii), the price that purchasers paid for the securities less the estimated value, if any, as of December 2022 of the relevant securities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking into account any other factors believed to be relevant to the particular matter or matters of that type. As of the date hereof, the firm has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for such matters and for any other matters described below where management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible aggregate loss to be approximately $2.3 billion in excess of the aggregate reserves for such matters.\n\nManagement is generally unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matters other than those included in the estimate above, including where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of money damages, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (ii) matters are in early stages, (iii) matters relate to regulatory investigations or reviews, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (vi) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (vii) there are novel legal issues presented. For example, the firm's potential liabilities with respect to the investigations and reviews described below in 'Regulatory Investigations and Reviews and Related Litigation' generally are not included in management's estimate of reasonably possible loss. However, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of such other matters will have a material adverse effect on the firm's financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the firm's operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.\n\n1MDB-Related Matters Between 2012 and 2013, subsidiaries of the firm acted as arrangers or purchasers of approximately $6.5 billion of debt\n\nsecurities of 1MDB. On November 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a criminal information and guilty plea by Tim Leissner, a former participating managing director of the firm, and an indictment against Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing director of the firm. On August 28, 2018, Leissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York of conspiring to launder money and to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act's (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions. Ng was charged with conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA's anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions. On April 8, 2022, Ng was found guilty on all counts following a trial.\n\nOn August 18, 2020, the firm announced that it entered into a settlement agreement with the Government of Malaysia to resolve the criminal and regulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving the firm, which includes a guarantee that the Government of Malaysia receives at least $1.4 billion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1MDB. See Note 18 for further information about this guarantee.\n\nOn October 22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached settlements of governmental and regulatory investigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ, the SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the FCA, the PRA, the Singapore Attorney General's Chambers, the Singapore Commercial Affairs Department, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. Group Inc. entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a charge against the firm, one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and will later be dismissed if the firm abides by the terms of the agreement. In addition, GS Malaysia pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was sentenced on June 9, 2021. In May 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor granted the firm a five-year exemption to maintain its status as a qualified professional asset manager (QPAM).\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\n211",

On February 19, 2019, a purported shareholder derivative action relating to 1MDB was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Group Inc. and the directors at the time and a former chairman and chief executive officer of the firm. The second amended complaint filed on November 13, 2020, alleges breaches of fiduciary duties, including in connection with alleged insider trading by certain current and former directors, unjust enrichment and violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act, including in connection with Group Inc.'s common stock repurchases and solicitation of proxies, and seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement and injunctive relief. On January 13, 2023, the court approved a settlement among the parties pursuant to which the firm agreed to a payment of $79.5 million to be made to the firm by its insurers, which the firm has agreed to use for compliance purposes after payment of any attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses awarded to plaintiffs.\n\nOn December 20, 2018, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Group Inc. and certain former officers of the firm alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act with respect to Group Inc.'s disclosures and public statements concerning 1MDB and seeking unspecified damages. The plaintiff filed the second amended complaint on October 28, 2019. On June 28, 2021, the court dismissed the claims against one of the individual defendants but denied the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to the firm and the remaining individual defendants. On November 12, 2021, the plaintiff moved for class certification. On January 13, 2023, the plaintiff moved for leave to file a third amended complaint.\n\n212\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nMortgage-Related Matters Beginning in April 2010, a number of purported securities law class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging the adequacy of Group Inc.'s public disclosure of, among other things, the firm's activities in the collateralized debt obligation market,\n\nand the firm's conflict of interest management. The consolidated amended complaint filed on July 25, 2011, which named as defendants Group Inc. and certain current and former officers and employees of Group Inc. and its affiliates, generally alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seeks monetary damages. The defendants have moved for summary judgment. On April 7, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's August 14, 2018 grant of class certification. On June 21, 2021, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the Second Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings, and on August 26, 2021, the Second Circuit vacated the district court's grant of class certification and remanded the case for further proceedings. On December 8, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On March 9, 2022, the Second Circuit granted defendants' petition seeking interlocutory review of the district court's grant of class certification.\n\nComplaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 25, 2019 and May 29, 2020 against Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and GS Mortgage Securities Corp. by U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee for two residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts that issued $1.7 billion of securities. The complaints generally allege that mortgage loans in the trusts failed to conform to applicable representations and warranties and seek specific performance or, alternatively, compensatory damages and other relief. On November 23, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint in the first action and denied defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint in the second action. On January 14, 2021, amended complaints were filed in both actions.",

The third amended complaint in the U.S. district court action, filed on August 3, 2020, generally alleges that the defendants violated federal antitrust law and state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to manipulate the foreign currency exchange markets and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified amounts of compensatory, punitive, treble and other damages. The claim in the English action is for breaches of English and E.U. competition rules from 2003 to 2013 and alleges manipulation of foreign exchange rates and bid/offer spreads, the exchange of commercially sensitive information among defendants and collusive trading. On December 13, 2022, the parties reached settlements in principle, subject to final documentation, to resolve these actions.\n\nGS&Co. is among the defendants named in a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on August 4, 2021. The amended complaint, filed on January 6, 2022, generally asserts claims under federal antitrust law and state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy among the defendants to manipulate auctions for foreign exchange transactions on an electronic trading platform, as well as claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified amounts of treble and other damages. On March 18, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\n\nBanco Espirito Santo S.A. and Oak Finance Beginning in February 2015, GSI commenced actions against Novo Banco S.A. (Novo Banco) in the English Commercial Court and the Bank of Portugal (BoP) in Portuguese Administrative Court in response to BoP's decisions in December 2014, September 2015 and December 2015 to reverse an earlier transfer to Novo Banco of an $835 million facility agreement (the Facility), structured by GSI, between Oak Finance Luxembourg S.A. (Oak Finance), a special purpose vehicle formed in connection with the Facility, and Banco Espirito Santo S.A. (BES) prior to the failure of BES. In July 2018, the English Supreme Court found that the English courts will not have jurisdiction over GSI's action unless and until the Portuguese Administrative Court finds against BoP in GSI's parallel action. In July 2018, the Liquidation Committee for BES issued a decision seeking to claw back from GSI $54 million paid to GSI and $50 million allegedly paid to Oak Finance in connection with the Facility, alleging that GSI acted in bad faith in extending the Facility, including because GSI allegedly knew that BES was at risk of imminent failure. In October 2018, GSI commenced an action in Lisbon Commercial Court challenging the Liquidation Committee's decision and has since also issued a claim against the Portuguese State seeking compensation for losses of approximately $222 million related to the failure of BES, together with a contingent claim for the $104 million sought by the Liquidation Committee.\n\n## Financial Advisory Services\n\nGroup Inc. and certain of its affiliates are from time to time parties to various civil litigation and arbitration proceedings and other disputes with clients and third parties relating to the firm's financial advisory activities.

Group Inc. was voluntarily dismissed from the putative class action on June 3, 2019. On November 2, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss, dismissing the state common law claims against GS&Co., but denying dismissal of the federal antitrust law claims.\n\nGS&Co. is also among the defendants named in a related putative class action filed on June 2, 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges the same conspiracy in the market for VRDOs as that alleged in the consolidated amended complaint filed on May 31, 2019, and asserts federal antitrust law, state law and state common law claims against the defendants. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified amounts of compensatory, treble and other damages. On August 6, 2021, plaintiffs in the May 31, 2019 action filed an amended complaint consolidating the June 2, 2021 action with the May 31, 2019 action. On September 14, 2021, defendants filed a joint partial motion to dismiss the August 6, 2021 amended consolidated complaint. On June 28, 2022, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss, dismissing the state breach of fiduciary duty claim against GS&Co., but declining to dismiss any portion of the federal antitrust law claims. On October 27, 2022, the plaintiffs moved for class certification.\n\n220\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nInterest Rate Swap Antitrust Litigation Group Inc., GS&Co., GSI, GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. are among the defendants named in a putative antitrust class action relating to the trading of interest rate swaps, filed in November 2015 and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The same Goldman Sachs entities are also among the defendants named in two antitrust actions relating to the trading of interest rate swaps, commenced in April 2016 and June 2018, respectively, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by three operators of swap execution facilities and certain of their affiliates. These actions have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings. The complaints generally assert claims under federal antitrust law and state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy among the defendants to preclude exchange trading of interest rate swaps. The complaints in the individual actions also assert claims under state antitrust law. The complaints seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as treble damages in an unspecified amount. Defendants moved to dismiss the class and the first individual action and the district court dismissed the state common law claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the first individual action and otherwise limited the state common law claim in the putative class action and the antitrust claims in both actions to the period from 2013 to 2016. On November 20, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss the second individual action, dismissing the state common law claims for unjust enrichment and tortious interference, but denying dismissal of the federal and state antitrust claims. On March 13, 2019, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion in the putative class action to amend their complaint to add allegations related to conduct from 2008 to 2012, but granted the motion to add limited allegations from 2013 to 2016, which the plaintiffs added in a fourth consolidated amended complaint filed on March 22, 2019. The plaintiffs in the putative class action moved for class certification on March 7, 2019.",

The amended complaint generally alleges that the defendants violated federal antitrust laws and the Commodity Exchange Act in connection with an alleged conspiracy to manipulate a benchmark for physical platinum and palladium prices and seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as treble damages in an unspecified amount. On March 29, 2020, the court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss and for reconsideration, resulting in the dismissal of all claims. On April 27, 2020, plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\nGS&Co., GSI, J. Aron & Company and Metro International Trade Services (Metro), a previously consolidated subsidiary of Group Inc. that was sold in the fourth quarter of 2014, are among the defendants in a number of putative class and individual actions filed beginning on August 1, 2013 and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints generally allege violations of federal antitrust laws and state laws in connection with the storage of aluminum and aluminum trading. The complaints seek declaratory, injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as unspecified monetary damages, including treble damages. In December 2016, the district court granted defendants' motions to dismiss and on August 27, 2019, the Second Circuit vacated the district court's dismissals and remanded the case to district court for further proceedings. On July 23, 2020, the district court denied the class plaintiffs' motion for class certification, and on December 16, 2020 the Second Circuit denied leave to appeal the denial. On February 17, 2021, the district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the claims of most of the individual plaintiffs. On April 14, 2021, the plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On May 31, 2022, the two remaining individual plaintiffs entered into a settlement with the defendants. The firm has paid the full amount of its contribution to the settlement.\n\nIn connection with the sale of Metro, the firm agreed to\n\nprovide indemnities to the buyer, including for any potential liabilities for legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of the conduct of Metro's business while the firm owned it.\n\nU.S. Treasury Securities Litigation GS&Co. is among the primary dealers named as defendants in several putative class actions relating to the market for U.S. Treasury securities, filed beginning in July 2015 and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. GS&Co. is also among the primary dealers named as defendants in a similar individual action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on August 25, 2017. The consolidated class action complaint, filed on December 29, 2017, generally alleges that the defendants violated antitrust laws in connection with an alleged conspiracy to manipulate the when-issued market and auctions for U.S. Treasury securities and that certain defendants, including GS&Co., colluded to preclude trading of U.S. Treasury securities on electronic trading platforms in order to impede competition in the bidding process. The individual action alleges a similar conspiracy regarding manipulation of the when-issued market and auctions, as well as related futures and options in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. The complaints seek declaratory and injunctive relief, treble damages in an unspecified amount and restitution. Defendants' motion to dismiss was granted on March 31, 2021.

The firm also provides certain benefits to former or inactive employees prior to retirement.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Postretirement Plans\n\nEmployees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries participate in various defined benefit pension plans. These plans generally provide benefits based on years of credited service and a percentage of eligible compensation. The firm maintains a defined benefit pension plan for certain U.K. employees. As of April 2008, the U.K. defined benefit plan was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants as of March 31, 2016. The non-U.S. plans do not have a material impact on the firm's consolidated results of operations.\n\nThe firm also maintains a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to November 1, 2003.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 29.\n\nEmployee Incentive Plans The cost of employee services received in exchange for a share-based award is generally measured based on the grantdate fair value of the award. Share-based awards that do not require future service (i.e., vested awards, including awards granted to retirement-eligible employees) are expensed immediately. Share-based awards that require future service are amortized over the relevant service period. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur.\n\nCash dividend equivalents paid on RSUs are generally charged to retained earnings. If RSUs that require future service are forfeited, the related dividend equivalents originally charged to retained earnings are reclassified to compensation expense in the period in which forfeiture occurs.\n\nThe firm generally issues new shares of common stock upon delivery of share-based awards. In limited cases, as outlined in the applicable award agreements, the firm may cash settle share-based compensation awards accounted for as equity instruments. For these awards, additional paid-in capital is adjusted to the extent of the difference between the value of the award at the time of cash settlement and the grant-date value of the award. The tax effect related to the settlement of share-based awards and payments of dividend equivalents is recorded in income tax benefit or expense.\n\n## Stock Incentive Plan\n\nThe firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2021) (2021 SIP), which provides for grants of RSUs, restricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other share-based awards, each of which may be subject to terms and conditions, including performance or market conditions. On April 29, 2021, shareholders approved the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is a successor to several predecessor stock incentive plans, the first of which was adopted on April 30, 1999, and each of which was approved by the firm's shareholders.\n\n224\n\nGoldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K\n\nAs of December 2022, 60.8 million shares were available to be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. If any shares of common stock underlying awards granted under the 2021 SIP or awards granted under predecessor stock incentive plans are not delivered because such awards are forfeited, terminated or canceled, or if shares of common stock underlying such awards are surrendered or withheld to satisfy any obligation of the grantee (including taxes), those shares will become available to be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. Shares available to be delivered under the 2021 SIP also are subject to adjustment for certain events or changes in corporate structure as provided under the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is scheduled to terminate on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders that occurs in 2025.\n\n## Restricted Stock Units\n\nThe firm grants RSUs (including RSUs subject to performance or market conditions) to employees, which are generally valued based on the closing price of the underlying shares on the date of grant, after taking into account a liquidity discount for any applicable post-vesting and delivery transfer restrictions. The value of equity awards also considers the impact of material non-public information, if any, that the firm expects to make available shortly following grant. RSUs generally vest and underlying shares of common stock deliver (net of required withholding tax) as outlined in the applicable award agreements. Award agreements generally provide that vesting is accelerated in certain circumstances, such as on retirement, death, disability and, in certain cases, conflicted employment. Delivery of the underlying shares of common stock is conditioned on the grantees satisfying certain vesting and other requirements outlined in the award agreements. RSUs not subject to performance or market conditions generally vest and deliver over a three-year period.\n\nRSUs that are subject to performance or market conditions generally deliver after the end of a three- to five-year period. For awards that are subject to performance or market conditions, generally the final award is adjusted from zero up to 150% of the original grant based on the extent to which those conditions are satisfied. Dividend equivalents that accrue on these awards are paid when the awards settle.",
