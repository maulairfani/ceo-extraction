While the year was characterised by many events and various global crises, Cargotec's orders received, sales and comparable operating profit were at a record level. The execution of the refocused strategy progressed with success.\n\nDuring the year, we experienced many significant events, both globally and in the business.\n\nMika Vehvil\u00e4inen CEO, Cargotec\n\nCargotec's year 2022 was successful. We achieved the highest orders received ever, with sales and comparable operating profit also at a record level. The service sales were also record-breaking, constituting 31/uni00A0percent of consolidated sales.\n\nDuring the year, we experienced many significant events, both globally and in our business. The component challenges and the Covid-19 pandemic continued from the previous year, and in February we witnessed the condemnable attack of Russia on Ukraine. At the end of the first quarter, the planned merger of Cargotec and Konecranes was cancelled, and inflation and energy availability were topics of discussion throughout the year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nUncertainty characterised the market environment in 2022. This was reflected in, for example, the development of the global GDP per capita affecting the demand for Cargotec's core businesses Hiab and Kalmar. According to the World Bank's economic outlook, the global economy grew by less than 3 percent in 2022, and the advanced economies group (a group of countries which includes several key Cargotec markets), the estimated growth was 2.5 percent.\n\nIn MacGregor's market environment, the level of merchant ship contracting declined in 2022 against a strong comparison period. Higher new vessel construction costs and extended lead times due to shipyard capacity restrictions weakened the ordering activity which, however, was still significantly higher compared to previous years. In the offshore sector, the number of the new unit contracts was still clearly below the historical average.\n\n## Execution of the re-focused strategy progressed well\n\nWe announced our re-focused strategy at the beginning of the year, right after the cancelled merger. The focus is now on sustainability and growth in our core businesses Hiab and Kalmar. We also announced\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continue our work to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nMika Vehvil\u00e4inen CEO, Cargotec\n\nplans to exit from Kalmar heavy cranes business, evaluate the strategic options for MacGregor, and review the operational model to support the re-focused group. We maintain our vision to become a leader in sustainable cargo flow.\n\nThe implementation of the strategy progressed rapidly during the year. We exited Kalmar's heavy crane business, transferring the heavy cranes-related immaterial rights to our subcontractor. With the arrangement, we were able to maintain the important service business, while still carrying the responsibility for the remaining customer order book. The majority of the heavy cranes order book is planned to be delivered in 2023. The changes in the operating model, aimed at increasing the independence of the business areas, have also been taken into use. Regarding the evaluation of strategic options for MacGregor, Cargotec's Board of Directors decided in November that, in the future, MacGregor would no longer be part of Cargotec's portfolio.\n\nIn connection with our Capital Markets Day in November, we published new performance targets for our core businesses. They illustrate our strategy to grow profitably by solving customers' sustainability challenges. The targets are above-market sales growth, a comparable operating profit of 12 percent in 2025 and 15 percent in 2030, doubling the eco portfolio sales compared to traditional products, and cutting the carbon dioxide emissions in Cargotec's value chain by 50 percent from the 2019 level by 2030. Presenting sustainability and financial targets side by side demonstrates how essential sustainability is in Cargotec's strategy.\n\n## Product development innovations supported our responsibility goals\n\nIn 2022, in line with Cargotec's strategy, we proceeded to develop our businesses towards an even more sustainable direction. The sales of our eco-solutions portfolio increased by 54 percent compared to the previous year, constituting a quarter of our total sales. Customer interest in eco-efficient equipment is constantly growing, which creates a definite and increasing business opportunity for Cargotec.\n\nDuring 2022, Kalmar started serial production of fully electric reachstackers, selling the first of these to customers in Norway and Sweden. Hiab launched a record number of products and solutions in 2022, around 40 in total. For example, Hiab now provides an electric version of all its truck mounted forklifts.\n\nWe did not reach our goal of lowering our carbon dioxide emissions from the level of the 2019 base year. Compared to the 2019 level, the increase in carbon dioxide emissions in the entire Cargotec value chain was 5 percent. The emission intensity decreased but not enough to compensate for the increase in emissions brought about by the increase in sales. We continue our work to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions. As an example, in 2022 Hiab introduced the world's first hooklift made mostly from fossil-free steel.\n\n## Our people are in a key role\n\nThe last three years have been challenging for all of us. Due to the corona pandemic, physical interaction became more difficult or stopped completely. At the same time working remotely increased while travelling ground to a halt.\n\nIn 2022, we paid special attention to the well-being and resilience of our personnel both globally and locally. As an example, we wanted to ensure that the needed information and tools to improve work well-being are available and that the team leaders and management consider the work-life balance of the personnel as one of the key enablers of good work performance and atmosphere. While there is still room for improvement, the progress in these areas has been good, having contributed to the high overall favourability score of our annual employee engagement survey Compass (75 percent).\n\n## New beginnings\n\nIn December, I informed Cargotec's Board of Directors of my intention to retire from Cargotec. In February 2023, the Board announced that it has appointed Casimir Lindholm as Cargotec's new President and CEO as of 1 April 2023. I want to express my congratulations and best wishes to Casimir in leading the financially and operationally strong Cargotec into its next development phase.\n\nIn 2023, it will be ten years since I started in my position. It has been a pleasure and a privilege to lead the transformation and development of Cargotec together with so many committed and talented colleagues, customers and partners.\n\nI thank our employees for their work efforts as well as our customers and shareholders for their trust in the year 2022.\n\nMika Vehvil\u00e4inen CEO, Cargotec",

Our order book is strong, and the orders received were at a record level. MacGregor's difficulties continued and resulted in a negative comparable operating profit. Due to the increase in sales, CO 2 emissions in our value chain increased compared to the base year 2019.\n\nThe orders received for 2022 increased by 10 percent from the comparison period and amounted to EUR 4,862 million. Our order book increased by 24 percent to EUR 3,541 million at the end of the year. Sales increased by 23 percent from the comparison period to EUR 4,089 million euros while cash flow increased to EUR 231 million. The increase in inventories caused by bottlenecks in the supply chain still burdened cash flow. Service sales increased by 17 percent and totalled EUR 1,264 million, representing 31 percent of consolidated sales.\n\nThe comparable operating profit increased by 43 percent and totalled EUR 332 million, representing ca. 8 percent of sales. The comparable operating profit increase was driven by higher sales in Kalmar and Hiab.\n\nCargotec's science-based target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by at least 50 percent by 2030 compared to a 2019 baseline. These emissions increased by five percent in 2022 due to sales growth. Emission intensity decreased but not sufficiently to compensate for the increase in emissions. During the year, we improved the calculation and collection methodology of our scope 3 climate data. As a consequence of the methodology improvements, Cargotec's scope 3 emissions for 2019-2021 were restated, which resulted in a change in the baseline of our science-based target. For more details, please see our GRI Index.\n\nDuring 2022, Cargotec revised its eco portfolio criteria to support its EU Taxonomy reporting. Eco portfolio sales totalled EUR 1,288 million, representing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Comparable operating pro/fit\n- Comparable operating pro/fit margin, %\n\n*Cargotec changed the definition of the alternative performance measure comparable operating profit starting from 1 January 2021.

For more details, please see page 34 .\n\nCargotec's safety performance is monitored primarily with the industrial injury frequency trend (IIFR, number of injuries per million hours worked). Cargotec's safety target for 2022 was to have an IIFR rate below 5 across the whole organisation. Cargotec achieved this target as the organisation's IIFR improved to 4.8 (2021: 6.0). The IIFR improved at assembly sites to 5.7 (7.3) and at non-assembly sites to 4.3 (5.3). Cargotec's safety figures cover the company's own employees and external contractors, excluding subcontractors due to missing information on working hours.\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting convening on 23 March 2023 that a dividend of EUR 1.34 for each class A shares and EUR 1.35 for each outstanding class B shares be paid. Cargotec aims for a growing dividend 30-50% of earnings per share.\n\n## ORDERS RECEIVED AND ORDER BOOK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INDUSTRIAL INJURY FREQUENCY RATE*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n181\n\n159\n\n106\n\n123\n\n99\n\n8.4\n\n6.9\n\n5.2\n\n6.0\n\n4.8\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2018 2019\n\n1.66\n\n1.39\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022*\n\n0.13\n\n3.82\n\n0.37\n\n1.08\n\n1.08\n\n1.35\n\n- * Board's proposal for dividend\n\nBasic earnings per share (EPS)\n\nDividend per B class share\n\n1.10\n\n1.2\n\nNumber of lost\n\ntime injuries\n\nCargotec IIFR*",

According to the strategy, MacGregor will not be part of Cargotec's portfolio in the future, and Cargotec has exited Kalmar's heavy cranes business.\n\nCargotec's Board of Directors appointed Mr. Jaakko Eskola as the new Company Chair . Jaakko Eskola succeeded Mr. Ilkka Herlin who chose to step down as the Chair of the Board, having served as Chair for 17 years since 2005. Ilkka Herlin continues as a member of the Board and as the Vice Chair.\n\nIn December, in accordance with the terms of his CEO service contract, Cargotec's CEO Mika Vehvil\u00e4inen informed Cargotec's Board of Directors of his intention to retire from Cargotec during 2023. The Board initiated a search for a successor and, in February 2023, announced that it has appointed Casimir Lindholm (M.Sc. (Econ.), MBA), b. 1971, as Cargotec's new President and CEO as of 1 April 2023.\n\nIn 2022, the number of orders for Kalmar hybrid straddle and shuttle carriers exceeded 500 worldwide . When the life cycle CO 2 emissions of these hybrid products are compared against conventional ones, the achieved CO 2 emission reduction is more than 400,000 tonnes. In addition, over 500 Kalmar Eco Reachstackers and more than 400 Kalmar medium electric forklifts were sold by the end of 2022.\n\nKalmar started the serial production of Kalmar Electric Reachstackers , and sold the first units to customers in Norway and Sweden. In addition, the world's first electric heavy forklift made by Kalmar was sold to a customer in Austria. Both products were launched at the end of 2021. Kalmar also announced that it will upgrade and expand its manufacturing plant in Kansas, US to respond\n\nto the logistics industry's growing demand for electric terminal tractors. The investment worth close to EUR 20 million makes the plant the largest terminal tractor manufacturing facility in North America.\n\nKalmar's long-standing collaboration with APM Terminals continued with repeat orders of 62 Kalmar Hybrid AutoStrads for APMT's Los Angeles facility, and 23 manually-driven, semiautomated hybrid shuttle carriers, complemented by services, maintenance and support, to its TM2 terminal in Tangiers, Morocco.\n\nKalmar signed a comprehensive five-year service agreement with a Swedish steel producer including the provision of equipment, parts and service personnel. Under the agreement, Kalmar will optimise uptime and productivity for the equipment involved in the customer's internal logistics operations.\n\nHiab received a significant order for MOFFETT truck mounted forklifts in the US worth over EUR 24 million. The order was made by an existing customer, one of the country's largest building materials and supply companies.\n\nHiab launched the comprehensive, intelligent HiPerform\u2122 service solution which optimises the performance of customers' Hiab equipment. The solution comprises Hiab HiConnect\u2122, Hiab Uptime\u2122 and Hiab ProCare\u2122, providing connectivity, real-time monitoring and diagnostics, as well as tailored service agreements.\n\nHiab launched a new HIAB railway loader crane range that is designed to comply with complex railway regulations and requirements. The HIAB RAIL series offers customers a range of equipment to maintain the railway infrastructure network.\n\nCargotec held a Capital Markets Day in Helsinki, Finland, in November. The event focused on Cargotec's refocused strategy, its core businesses Hiab and Kalmar as well as future shareholder potential. The hybrid event gathered a large audience of analysts and investors, participating both on location as well as online.\n\nHiab entered into an agreement to acquire the family-owned Swedish industrial group Olsbergs. Olsbergs is the technological leader in the design and manufacture of hydraulic valves and remote control systems. Its solutions are used to manoeuvre Hiab's truck mounted loader cranes and forestry cranes. The closing of the transaction took place on 1 January 2023.\n\nMacGregor received two significant orders for heavy lift cranes . These orders include the supply of 56 heavy lift cranes for fourteen 62,000 dwt multipurpose vessels.\n\nMacGregor received the 2022 SMART4SEA Technology Award for the development of its condition-based and predictive maintenance service OnWatch Scout.\n\nMacGregor received significant orders to supply comprehensive packages of RoRo equipment for eight multi-fuel and zero-carbonready Aurora-class pure car and truck carriers (PCTCs). The Aurora-class can transport up to 9,100 cars and will be the world's largest and most sustainable car carrier.\n\nREAD MORE ONLINE",

Every day, our solutions, services and products keep cargo and load handling running. As we innovate and develop world-class cargo handling practices, we also create and distribute knowledge. By continuously increasing the efficiency of our solutions and optimising maintenance, we help save energy and resources, which reduces the strain the logistic sector has on the environment. We also take action to provide safe,\n\ninclusive and fair working conditions for our employees and encourage our partners to do the same.\n\nOn the other hand, we need to use natural resources to run our business and we cause emissions throughout the value chain, particularly during the extraction and production of raw materials and the use phase of Cargotec's equipment and solutions. We strive to minimise these and any other negative impacts our business may have on people and the environment.\n\nSustainability is a key enabler of Cargotec's strategy and integrated into our decision making.

This enables us to seize profitable growth through sustainability.\n\nAt the same time, we take action to ensure that our environmental ambitions are founded on safe, inclusive, transparent and ethical business practices - for people and society at large.\n\nEnsuring that our own operations are sustainable is not good enough. We make sure that all aspects of sustainability are considered in all phases of our business, from design and sourcing to product use and end-of-life.\n\nCargotec's most relevant - material - sustainability topics are identified in a materiality analysis. In this process, we engage with internal and external stakeholders to understand their thoughts and concerns while thoroughly evaluating the impact of each topic. The next materiality analysis update will be done during 2023, in which we will consider the concept of double materiality.\n\nWe have identified seven material topics where our potential and actual impacts are most significant and where we will direct most of our resources to:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate change\n- \u00b7 Circularity\n- \u00b7 Human rights\n- \u00b7 Health & safety\n- \u00b7 Diversity, equity & inclusion\n- \u00b7 Sustainable /finance\n- \u00b7 Responsible sourcing & sales\n\nIn 2022, we strengthened our sustainability governance model and the management of our impacts in the value chain.

Cargotec's solutions and services also help drive the transformation of the logistic sector towards a low-carbon economy.\n\nThrough our global scale and presence in all areas of the logistics chain, we impact individuals and communities globally. Our solutions contribute to local and global infrastructure and trade by making logistics processes more efficient, sustainable and safe on roads, in ports, and on seas around the globe. We also contribute to the financial well-being of many sectors of society with tax payments, wages and dividends. We provide employment in 46 countries and, in 2022, the wages and benefits we paid to our employees totalled 762 million euros.\n\nCO 2 disclosure is a key element in our Business Partner Code of Conduct, and we actively encourage our suppliers to set ambitious emission reduction targets.\n\nBy conducting business in an ethical manner, sourcing responsibly and proactively aligning our business with the principles of sustainable finance, we can contribute to stable societies, fair trade and the green transition.\n\n## Responsible sourcing and sales\n\nCargotec works with over 2,500 direct suppliers. Through our purchasing power, we can influence our suppliers and support them in improving their performance related to, for example, human rights and the environment. Our positive impact is especially visible within climate action: CO 2 emission disclosure is a key element in our Business Partner Code of Conduct and we actively encourage our suppliers to set ambitious emission reduction targets.\n\nAt the same time, we recognise that the components and services we purchase may impact people and the environment.

For example, we screen all our customers to ensure that we do not engage in business with customers that are on trade sanction lists. On the other hand, our solutions have great potential to create positive environmental impacts as they help customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and make their operations safer.\n\n## Managing our supply chain\n\nOur responsible sourcing programme focuses on identifying and mitigating sustainability risks in the entire supply chain and is systematically managed throughout our business areas. The main policies and processes to support the programme and respect for human rights in our sphere of interest include our:\n\n- \u00b7 Business Partner Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7 Supplier approvals and contracting\n- \u00b7 Supplier engagement and audits\n- \u00b7 SpeakUp line (accessible to both internal and external stakeholders).\n\nOur Business Partner Code of Conduct (BPCoC) is fully aligned with our own Code of Conduct. While it is designed to cover all partners, it focuses on our supply chain. In the BPCoC, we have requirements for our partners related to, for example, health and safety, freedom of association as well as prohibition of child and forced labour.\n\nDuring our approval process, new suppliers must meet pre-requirements and pass an audit conducted by Cargotec before they can be approved as suppliers.\n\nThe pre-requirements include committing to our Business Partner Code of Conduct, a risk assessment conducted by Cargotec and a supplier self-assessment in a third-party platform. The audit focuses on the supplier's compliance with management of labour and human rights, anti-corruption and the environment. Approximately 20 percent of the questions in the audit checklist are related to sustainability topics. In 2022, we audited six new direct suppliers for Hiab, nine for Kalmar and six for MacGregor.\n\nIf any non-compliance of our BPCoC is found in our assessments or audits, we decide on corrective measures and timelines together with the partner. Our priority is always to collaborate with our partners to improve their sustainability performance. However, if the partner is unwilling to take the mutually agreed corrective action, Cargotec has the right to terminate the contract. In 2022, we supported several suppliers with driving decarbonisation in their operations and improving their own supplier management processes. To do this, we shared information, tools and Cargotec's best practices on relevant topics, such as managing hazardous substances, conflicts of interest and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Focused efforts to improve supplier sustainability\n\nDuring 2022, our Business Partner Code of Conduct was rolled out to all suppliers, and we continued to conduct sustainability audits of both existing strategic suppliers and potential new ones.\n\nDuring the year, we also began using a new tool for performing supplier self-assessments. Based on the\n\nresults, our suppliers are performing best in company management and the responsible sourcing of raw materials. Most improvement is needed within working conditions, human rights and supplier management. Cargotec will act on the findings with, for example, onsite audits of suppliers with missing information or below-average performance.\n\nOur 2023 target for responsible sourcing is to have 90% of strategic suppliers complete our sustainability self-assessment and reach an improved combined average score (54% in 2022).\n\n## Decarbonisation of the supply chain\n\nIn decarbonising our supply chain, we focus on innovation and collaboration. For more information, see page 32 .\n\n## Responsible minerals and hazardous substances\n\nIn January 2022, Cargotec became a member of the cross-industry platform Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). The goal of RMI is to support responsible mineral sourcing globally through developing business practices. While Cargotec does not directly source minerals from mines, smelters or refiners, we recognise that we are part of their downstream value chain. As such, we can play a role in addressing conflicts, human rights abuses and environmental issues related to the mining of minerals through strong multi-stakeholder partnerships. The RMI provides tools for increasing the transparency of the origin of conflict minerals and cobalt used in the value chain, including a due diligence tool and the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) to audit smelters and refiners.\n\nDuring the year, using our sustainability assessments, we identified those Cargotec suppliers that use critical minerals and asked them to provide information on the smelters and refiners they work with. Our goal is to only use smelters and refiners that conform with the RMI's RMAP audits.\n\nCargotec's responsible sourcing also covers the management of hazardous substances in our products. Our long-term goal is to minimise and eventually eliminate such substances from our products. We use an industry-led blockchain web database that helps us communicate our legal obligations to the authorities regarding REACH, SCIP and other regulations, but also supports us in communicating with our suppliers. During 2022, we continued our dialogue with suppliers on hazardous substances.\n\n## Responsible sales\n\nWe are currently identifying what responsible sales could mean for Cargotec in the longer run and where we should focus. This work will continue in 2023.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainable finance\n\nBy considering sustainability in financial decision making, Cargotec can have a big positive impact on the world around it. Aligning our eco portfolio solutions with sustainability-related regulation, for example, makes visible how these solutions contribute to international environmental goals, such as the EU's climate targets, and how we compare to our peers.\n\nTo support our ambition to pursue profitable growth through sustainability, we strengthened the management of sustainable finance in 2022. This work will continue in 2023.\n\nAdvancing sustainable finance at Cargotec has four focus areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainability as a dimension of equal importance in financial performance management . We aim to ensure that sustainability becomes an additional lens to cost and benefits in our financial performance management. In practice, this will help us to, for example, forecast and monitor our eco portfolio sales. Remuneration incentives are also part of this work. In 2022, Cargotec's Board of Directors set a remuneration incentive for the Cargotec Leadership Team that is based on eco portfolio order intake and progress towards Cargotec's climate targets.\n- \u00b7 Compliance with sustainability-related regulation. Our goal is to convert into financial figures the opportunities and challenges that sustainability-related regulation may bring to our business. For example, in 2022, we updated the eco portfolio criteria to cover two categories: climate solutions and circular solutions. This means that the sales of the eco portfolio consists of the revenue of climate solutions (equal to the KPI of the\n\ntaxonomy-aligned revenue) and circular solutions (equal to the KPI of the revenue that Cargotec considers to support the draft objective of transitioning to a circular economy). A summary of the criteria is available here. Read more about Cargotec's interpretation of the EU Taxonomy in the Board of Directors' report .\n\n- \u00b7 Support Cargotec's business areas in sustainabilityrelated financial matters. With increasing understanding of sustainability in Cargotec's finance function, we can better support our business areas in related matters. We can, for example, conduct scenario calculations for new eco portfolio solutions and how they could support the business areas in achieving their financial and climate targets. This will help us find a balance between profitable growth and sustainability.\n- \u00b7 Prepared for sustainability-linked loans . Sustainability and debt financing are becoming more and more integrated, which means that the cost of borrowing is increasingly impacted by the borrower's performance measured against sustainability targets. Cargotec signed its first such loan of EUR 50 million with a maturity of five years in 2020. The loan agreement includes sustainability targets where our performance will have an impact on our interest margin. In 2022, Cargotec entered into a EUR 330 million sustainabilitylinked revolving credit facility, where the key performance indicator (KPI) of the facility is directly linked to our climate-related performance target.\n\n## Ethics & compliance\n\nCargotec operates in a complex global environment, and our industry is exposed to ethics and compliance risks related to, for example, bidding for large projects and using sales intermediaries. With our strong governance practices and commitment to integrity,\n\nwe can make a positive impact in our value chain and industry by setting the example for all our stakeholders.\n\n## Aiming for highest ethical standards\n\nOur Code of Conduct sets the foundation for how business is done at Cargotec - always in line with the highest ethical standards. We regularly educate all of our employees on various areas of the Code of Conduct.\n\nViolations of Cargotec's Code of Conduct may put our people and business at risk. We encourage everyone to openly raise and discuss compliance concerns and to seek guidance when in doubt. Our channels for reporting a concern include:\n\n- \u00b7  Discussing directly with the line manager\n- \u00b7  Informing HR or Ethics and Compliance functions\n- \u00b7  Using our SpeakUp line, an externally hosted reporting tool which allows for anonymous reporting and can be accessed by both internal and external stakeholders.\n\nAll reported incidents are evaluated confidentially and investigated according to our response process. In substantiated cases, the need for disciplinary or remedial actions is discussed in Cargotec Leadership Team's Code of Conduct panel.\n\n## Continued focus on managing risks\n\nAccording to our analysis of Code of Conduct-related questions in our annual employee engagement survey, 83 percent of respondents considered Cargotec as an ethical company in 2022 (2021: 82%).\n\nDuring the year, Kalmar introduced ethics and compliance-related onsite visits. The visits feature risk and compliance discussions with relevant leadership\n\nteams, training sessions for high-risk employee groups, as well as meetings with key personnel and, when possible, key stakeholders, such as dealers, agents and customers. In 2022, Kalmar's Ethics and Compliance function conducted five site visits.\n\nIn 2022, we organised targeted ethics and compliance workshops and training sessions for management, sales, HR and project services teams. The sessions focused  on anti-corruption, third-party, conflict of interest and export controls. In addition, we introduced a new Code of Conduct e-learning focusing on three key areas: Conflicts of interest, Health and safety and Workplace environment. The online training was completed by 92 percent of Cargotec employees (2021: 84%). The completion rate covers employees who were employed by Cargotec at the launch of the training in September and remained employees by the year's end. Onsite training workshops were arranged for employees without an email address or access to our intranet.\n\nDuring the year, 93 reports (2021: 60 reports) of alleged misconduct were made through various channels. In 73 percent of closed investigations (2021: 73%), the allegations were substantiated at least partly, with some cases resulting in disciplinary actions, such as warnings and terminations of employment.\n\nDuring the year, we made a voluntary self-disclosure to the authorities regarding compliance with certain export regulations in the context of MacGregor's US Government business.\n\nFor more detailed information about our ethics and compliance-related performance, see the Board of Directors' report .",

The themes that most support this goal include digitalisation, electrification, green energy, automation and robotisation. Our research and product development expenditure in 2022 totalled EUR/uni00A0100 million.\n\nBy using cutting-edge cloud technologies and industry best practices, our Digital Solutions Hub (DiSH) accelerates the development of data-driven software and service solutions across Cargotec. DiSH, which was originally hosted on by Cargotec on group level, was moved into the Kalmar and Hiab business areas during 2022. This move helps Kalmar and Hiab to further scale up and monetise on Cargotec's digital assets.\n\nIn 2022, with the help of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, we used an Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform created by DiSH to collect, analyse and utilise data from equipment and systems. The data was then used in business applications to improve both customer and internal operations. For example, Kalmar ECOFlex, rolled out during 2022, collects data on how\n\nefficiently the customer is operating their equipment and combines it with an automated invoicing system. The goal is to incentivise equipment use in Eco mode which brings both emission and cost reductions.\n\nCargotec's Emerging Business Accelerator unit (EBA) drives future growth and business innovation together with Cargotec business areas by enabling business and service designers and product owners to work on new initiatives. For example, the rapid market roll-out of Kalmar Remote Services and MacGregor's simulator offerings in 2022 was made possible with the help of the EBA. At the core of the EBA method are modern, systematic ways to investigate, build and scale up both internal and external new products or services. The EBA also leads collaboration with startups and industryleading peer companies to drive an entrepreneurial and customer-centric culture within Cargotec.\n\nCargotec participates in programmes that drive innovation and new product development through consortiums that include customers, industry peers and universities. For example, Cargotec joined the WATERBORNE Technology Platform in 2022. The platform aims to establish a continuous dialogue between stakeholders and, for instance, contribute to expectations regarding clean and safe waterborne transport.\n\nIn addition, Kalmar and MacGregor are partners in the AEGIS programme which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through optimising, electrifying and automating operations in small and medium-sized marine terminals and to improve efficiency in the ship loading supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, our research and development focused on eco-efficient products and service solutions.",

A safety-first attitude is at our core, and we constantly look for ways to be better.\n\n## Human rights\n\nWe recognise that our business activities impact people in all parts of our value chain: Cargotec employees, operators of our equipment, supplier employees and local communities. As stated in Cargotec's Code of Conduct, we are committed to respecting the human rights of everyone in our operations and value chain.\n\n## Human rights impact assessment\n\ninitiated during 2022.\n\n## Committed to respecting human rights\n\nCargotec's human rights work is based on the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), which require companies to conduct due diligence to identify, assess, and remedy impacts on people.\n\nWe have concluded that our most significant human rights risks exist in our value chain, such as in the supply chain and business partner operations. In our Business Partner Code of Conduct, we have requirements for our partners related to, for example, health and safety, freedom of association as well as prohibition of child and forced labour.\n\n## Due diligence work kicked off\n\nIn 2022, we strengthened the management of human rights at Cargotec. We began the creation of a comprehensive human rights due diligence programme covering all Cargotec business areas and functions. As a first step, we initiated a human rights impact assessment to identify adverse impacts on people in our value chain. The assessment, which follows the UNGP framework, identifies impacts caused by us,\n\n## People, health & safety\n\n- \u00b7 Strong focus on health and safety at all sites, providing a safe working environment.\n- \u00b7 High supplier standards and requirements for labour rights.\n- \u00b7 Digitalisation and automatisation reduce the risk of human error and accidents at work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In conducting the assessment, we have considered various data points, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Reports from our SpeakUp channel\n- \u00b7 Audit reports\n- \u00b7 Internal third-party risk assessment\n- \u00b7 High-risk geographic regions\n- \u00b7 Health and safety incidents\n- \u00b7 Information from onsite supplier audits\n- \u00b7 Analysis of our operations and supply chain\n- \u00b7 Interviews with our employees and supplier employees.\n\nWe will finalise the human rights impact assessment and define Cargotec's salient human rights issues in 2023. Our future human rights due diligence work will focus on preventing, mitigating and remedying these salient issues.\n\nOur target for 2023 is to reach a completion rate of 100 percent for human rights training, as part of our Code of Conduct training.\n\nDuring the year, we also implemented a new tool for performing supplier self-assessments that can be used to identify high-risk countries in our supply chain. We have also been able to use the insights from this tool in our Group-wide human rights impact assessment. Read more on page 22 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health and safety\n\nWe acknowledge that the various locations at Cargotec\n\n- from an office environment to assembly facilities, service locations and various customer sites - pose different types of risks to our employees' health and safety. Keeping our employees safe has always been a top priority to us, and we continue to do our utmost to minimise and eliminate these risks. All our employees must be able to return home healthy and safe after every workday.\n\nWe also impact people's health and safety through our value chain. For example, the combustion of dieselpowered machinery, both our own equipment and those that our solutions enable, creates pollutants that can negatively impact people's health. At the same time, the people that operate our equipment may be at risk of getting into an accident. By continuously developing safer, quieter and cleaner high-quality equipment and solutions, we can reduce our negative impacts in the value chain.\n\n## Towards zero accidents\n\nIn ensuring a strong safety culture at Cargotec and focusing on behaviour-based safety, key themes include raising awareness of safety risks, involving employees in our safety activities, encouraging safe behaviour and further strengthening leadership commitment to safety. With regular training and campaigns, we strive to minimise work-related injuries and accidents, as well as incidents in locations where our solutions are used. We work continuously towards zero accidents in all our operations and always prioritise safety - even with time, cost or customer pressure. The occupational health and safety",

In 2022, 76% of our assembly sites were ISO 45001 certified.\n\nFor a more detailed description of our health and safety management processes in our own operations, see the Board of Directors' report .\n\nTo ensure the health and safety of people throughout our value chain, we also have related requirements for our suppliers and other business partners. These requirements, described in detail in our Business Partner Code of Conduct, include:\n\n- \u00b7 Providing appropriate health and safety information, training and instructions as well as protective equipment.\n- \u00b7 Having effective programs, such as emergency preparedness plans, in place.\n- \u00b7 Having clear procedures for identifying, managing, preventing, recording, reporting and adequately responding to occupational injuries and illnesses.\n- \u00b7 Providing appropriate resting areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stronger management of safety\n\nCargotec's safety performance improved in 2022. Our target was to reach a total Industrial Injury Frequency Rate (IIFR) of less than 5.0 across the organisation. We achieved this target, as the IIFR improved to 4.8 (2021: 6.0). At assembly sites, the IIFR improved to 5.7 (7.3), and at non-assembly sites, it improved to 4.3 (5.3). Hiab reduced its rate of lost time injuries by 29% in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, we strengthened the management of health and safety at Cargotec by, for example, forming a working group that comprises representatives from all business areas. The group enables collaboration in areas where the business areas can benefit from joint efforts and increases transparency on health and safety-related actions across Cargotec.\n\nDuring the year, we increased our safety resources at high-risk sites. At these sites, we will continue to focus on proactive measures, such as encouraging safety observations, as well as sharing best practices and investigation conclusions between sites. At sites with a more mature safety culture, we prioritise behaviourbased safety.\n\nFor 2023, our safety-related goal is to reach an IIFR of below 4.0. Key actions in pursuing this goal include introducing new software for reporting and managing safety-related risks and measures, as well as launching a global programme on behaviour-based safety and strengthened safety processes.\n\nDuring 2022, we also continued to support the wellbeing of our employees with both global and local\n\nactivities. These included sharing information and tools to improve wellbeing at work, enabling a sustainable work-life balance and highlighting prioritisation as one key aspect for leaders. For more information about wellbeing at Cargotec, see page 29 .\n\n## Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion drive creativity, innovation and growth, as they encourage individuals to fully reveal their knowledge, talents and skills. We impact the way our employees experience their workplace, both physically and psychologically. We have the responsibility to ensure that people feel safe coming to work as they are and express themselves freely.\n\n## Managing our commitment to equal opportunity\n\nWe strive to create an overall environment of inclusion and tolerance at Cargotec. To strengthen this commitment to further develop a diverse organisation, we have signed the Diversity Charter Finland. By signing the Charter, we pledge to provide equal opportunities, recognise individual know-how and needs, manage our employees and customers with fairness and communicate on our progress.\n\nCargotec is committed to ensuring  that all Cargotec people are treated with dignity and respect. We promote equal opportunity and non-discrimination regardless of gender, race, religion, nationality, age, physical ability or any other such characteristic. We have zero tolerance for harassment in all its forms - be it verbal, physical or sexual.\n\nOur internal service centre, Cargotec Business Services (CBS), hosts transparent and systematic\n\nprocesses for various supporting activities, including human resources. The data in CBS's systems helps us implement our principles on equal opportunity systematically and globally. This data, which we have been utilising for this purpose for years, will be a key enabler of our strategic efforts within diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) going forward.\n\nIn 2022, DE&I was identified as a key element of Cargotec's strategy implementation. During the year, we appointed a leader for the development, implementation and monitoring of the topic. We also kicked off a current state analysis to understand where we are and where we want to go. We will further work on our DE&I strategy and action roadmap in 2023.",

At Cargotec, we also adapted to a new strategy after a cancelled merger. Despite the turmoil, our people have managed to deliver record results. This success is enabled by our resilience which is built on our ability to adapt to changing circumstances. It stems from our investments in leadership, strong employee engagement, harmonised processes and organisational freedom in decision making. For example, one of our winning strategies for managing the pandemic has been to empower local management to take necessary actions based on guidance from their national governments and local health authorities.\n\nIn addition to delivering financial success, our employees signalled high satisfaction with their work environment in 2022. The overall favourability score of our annual employee engagement survey, Compass, which provides valuable information on the work-related feelings and thoughts of our employees, remained high at 75 percent (2021: 75 percent). We consider this a great achievement given the current global uncertainties. The top score of 82 percent was reached in the team climate and performance category (2021: 82), showcasing that teamwork remains our stronghold. At the same time, the results show that we must focus more attention on topics such as work-life balance, stress management and the future direction of the company. Managers follow up on these survey findings in team sessions for collecting feedback\n\nand setting up action plans, with special focus on improvement areas. The completion rate of the 2022 Compass survey was 75 percent (2021: 76).\n\nSimilarly, our employees signalled positive perceptions of Cargotec as a company in 2022. The Cargotec Integrity index, which measures employee perceptions related to sustainability, pride and hope as well as leadership, reached a favourability score of 77 percent (2021: 76 percent). Our target is to reach a score above 77 percent during 2023. Read more about the Integrity Index on page 17.\n\n## Our investments in leadership bear fruit\n\nOur leaders have an essential role in enabling our people to turn our strategy into reality and promoting wellbeing at work. They are in constant contact with teams, individual team members, and the rest of the organisation. It is thus vital that we invest in competent, inspiring, fair and consistent leadership.\n\nWe aim to become a company with world-class leadership skills. We have invested heavily in developing the leadership skills of our managers through our development programmes LEAD and GROW. The implementation of these programmes continued in 2022.\n\nWe regularly measure the climate our leaders create in their teams with a leadership survey. The results of our 2022 survey show that, according to team members, 62 percent of Cargotec leaders are creating a positive team climate. We were thus able to maintain our long-term target level of over 60 percent, which is considered world-class level. In addition, our\n\nLeadership index, calculated based on our annual employee engagement survey, was 76 in 2022 (2021: 76). This shows that our employees feel that their managers are available and present, which proves that our persistent leadership development work continues to bear fruit.\n\n## Fostering and awarding personal development\n\nOur long-running Performance and Development Plan (PDP) process supports us in performance management, setting future targets, personal development and promoting a feedback culture. The PDP process includes regular development performance appraisal meetings that, in addition to target setting and mutual feedback, foster continuous dialogue. Our target is to provide everyone a dedicated, personal development plan.\n\nIn 2022, our agile performance management process and related incentive programmes continued to reinforce our high-performance culture and payfor-performance philosophy. Performance-based compensation and incentives continued to be implemented in all parts of our operations, and they remain an integral part of our compensation philosophy. During 2022, approximately 7,000 of our employees were covered by our incentive programmes.\n\n## Flexibility as a driver of wellbeing\n\nWhile the Covid-19 pandemic changed the way we work, the global events of 2022 have proven that change is the only constant and that as people, we will continue to face high pressure outside work. It is crucial that we, as an employer, do our utmost to ensure employee wellbeing in this challenging environment.\n\nA key factor in our wellbeing efforts is flexibility which comes in many forms. For example, when not limited by the nature of their work, our teams decide for themselves what is the best way for them to combine remote work and face-to-face collaboration. Our employment policy includes remote work instructions that offer a range of options for organising work to increase employee motivation and productivity. In 2022, we interviewed employees on their views regarding our flexible work policy and found that the freedom that remote work options bring is a key contributor to employee wellbeing and motivation. We also believe it is a decisive factor for potential future employees.\n\nAt Cargotec, flexibility also means that we consider the different circumstances our employees face in their personal lives and provide support where we can. It is important to us that people's various needs are acknowledged and that they feel safe and free to be themselves when they work for Cargotec.\n\nFinally, flexibility and the ability to adapt to change is a key success factor for Cargotec. It gives us the resilience and agility we need to adjust to major developments in our operational environment. Our record results during the global turbulence of 2022 are a proof point of this resilience.",

While Cargotec's business requires natural resources and an environmental footprint is created in all steps of our value chain, we see these challenges as an opportunity to improve our own business and our entire industry.\n\nAs laid out in our sustainability policy, our environmental objectives aim to mitigate adverse impacts on the environment and to promote resource and energy efficiency throughout the value chain. Cargotec's biggest environmental impacts are related to climate change and circularity and take place within our supply chain and in the use phase of our products. To maximise our positive impacts and minimise the negative ones, this is where we focus on in our environmental work.\n\nOur progress in climate change and circularity is monitored on group level by a designated material topic lead. In our daily operations, ISO 14001 environmental\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmanagement systems provide guidance on managing our environmental impact. In 2022, 86 percent of our assembly sites were ISO 14001-certified.\n\n## Climate change\n\nAccording to the OECD's International Transport Forum, greenhouse gas emissions generated by international freight transport represent more than 7 percent of global emissions. As a key player in the cargo and load handling industry where much of the equipment is still powered by fossil fuels, Cargotec also contributes to these emissions. On the other hand, our equipment, services and software have the potential to drive the industry toward a circular, low-carbon economy. We see reducing the carbon footprint of our industry as a significant business opportunity for Cargotec.\n\nThe greenhouse gas emissions from the extraction and manufacturing of our raw materials and components, mostly steel, are significant. We continuously seek opportunities to drive positive change by decarbonising our supply chain and to turn challenges into innovations.\n\n## Climate & environment\n\n- \u00b7 1.5\u00b0C climate ambition transforms the industry to enable a low-carbon society.\n- \u00b7 Our eco-efficient offering presents our greatest opportunity to mitigate climate change.\n- \u00b7 With the 1.5\u00b0C target, committed to urgent actions to combat climate change in partnership with other actors in the value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Acknowledgement and evaluation of climate change risks to the business and appropriate mitigating actions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have ambitious targets for reducing these emissions and eventually reaching carbon neutrality.\n\nThe use phase of Cargotec products by customers is where the large majority of our greenhouse gas emissions are generated, mostly due to emissions from diesel-powered machinery. This is why we believe that developing and proactively offering energy efficient and electric equipment is where we can best improve our climate impact - and seize big business opportunities. Cargo handling solutions are essential in ports, on trucks and on vessels all over the world, so making changes in cargo handling can have a big impact on other sectors, such as the transport sector.\n\nCargotec impacts the climate but climate change also impacts Cargotec. We have tested the resilience of our climate strategy in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) for disclosing climate-related risks and opportunities. We have, for example, analysed how different climate scenarios may impact our operations and value chain and disclosed how we manage potential risks. For more information about this analysis, see cargotec.com.\n\n## Challenging ourselves with ambitious targets\n\nWe are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 1.5\u00b0C warming scenario, which is the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement. In 2022, we published our new strategic performance targets for our core businesses. For the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*In accordance with our science-based target, only indirect sourcing is included in the carbon footprint.

The targets are to reduce our emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and by 25 percent by 2025, which is in line with our science-based climate target, as well as to double the sales growth of our eco portfolio compared to traditional products. Embedding sustainability-related targets in our performance targets demonstrates that sustainability is truly integrated into our company strategy.\n\nOur science-based target, approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), is to reduce Cargotec's absolute greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent across all three emission scopes by 2030 compared to a 2019 baseline. As more than 95 percent of our emissions are generated indirectly in our supply chain and the product use phase (scope 3), setting an absolute reduction target in that area is vital to tackle the actual amount of emissions released into the atmosphere. In 2022, our total value chain emissions increased by five percent due to sales growth. Emission intensity decreased but not sufficiently to compensate for the increase in emissions. Read more about our science-based target here.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn our own operations (scopes 1 and 2), we aim to go beyond the ambition of our science-based target and be carbon neutral in our own operations by 2030. In 2022, we reached a 28 percent reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions compared to a 2019 baseline.\n\nAs we work toward our science-based target, our strategic climate target for 2024 is to reduce emissions in our value chain by 1 million tonnes of CO 2 compared to a 2019 baseline. In 2022, these emissions increased by 469,000 tonnes due to sales growth.\n\n## A robust climate action plan\n\nCargotec's strategic climate initiative, Mission Climate, guides us in achieving our science-based target and future-proofing our business through electrification, for example. Mission Climate has three priority areas: decarbonising the supply chain, decarbonising our own operations and boosting our sustainable offering. We focus our efforts on managing and mitigating emissions in the supply chain and the product use phase because, compared to our own operations, that is where our potential and actual climate impact is greatest. To enable this, we focus on climate data and systems, funding and partnerships, and sustainable product design through life cycle assessments.\n\nCargotec's climate disclosure was  top-ranked by CDP in 2022. With the A- rating, we reached CDP's Leadership level for the first time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Decarbonising the supply chain\n\nIn decarbonising our supply chain, we focus on innovation and collaboration. We look for sustainable alternatives to materials and solutions, ensure transparency of data and build on the innovative ideas of our partners.\n\nThe majority of greenhouse gas emissions from Cargotec's purchased goods and services are generated by the production of steel. Our goal is to secure early access to low-emission steel on the market and re-engineer Cargotec products so that they can utilise alternative materials. For example, Cargotec and the steel manufacturer SSAB have partnered to introduce fossil-free steel to the cargo and load handling industry in Cargotec's equipment. In 2022, Hiab introduced the world's first load handling equipment made with fossil-free steel. The steel for the MULTILIFT hooklift was produced by SSAB using fossil-free hydrogen instead of coal, which eliminates almost all CO 2 emissions in the manufacturing process. While fossil-free steel is key in significantly reducing our supply chain emissions, it will take a while before it is commercially and widely available. During this transition, we will explore other alternatives as well, such as the increased use of steel produced mainly from scrap material.\n\nWe engage with our suppliers to better understand their maturity level and climate strategies, and the climate impact of the components they supply to us. This also increases the transparency of where our supply chain emissions originate from, identifies opportunities to reduce them and sets climate requirements for our suppliers. In 2022, we continued\n\nto engage with the suppliers whose emissions are biggest. We also published a Supplier Decarbonisation Handbook to share best practices with our suppliers and provide guidance to them on climate-related target setting, emissions calculation and emission reduction approaches.\n\nDuring 2022, we also significantly improved the way we calculate and collect our scope 3 climate data related to purchased goods and services. We now have a system where we can automatically pull real-time data from local systems and complement that with data from our suppliers. This means that we have access to fact-based emission data and that we can forecast our emissions and make decisions based on this data on a continuous basis.\n\n## 2. Decarbonising our own operations\n\nAs we have full control over the greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations (scopes 1 and 2), our ambition level here is higher than for scope 3 emissions, and we aim for carbon neutrality by 2030. We will do this by focusing on the biggest emission sources in our operations: electricity use and fuel usage by our service fleet.\n\nAbout 30 percent of the emissions in our own operations come from electricity use. Our target is to increase the share of renewable electricity to 75 percent by 2026 and to 100 percent by 2030. At the end of 2022, this share was 57 percent, which enabled a significant reduction (-28%) in the greenhouse gas emissions of our own operations compared to a 2019 baseline. To mitigate emissions from fuel usage by our service fleet, we aim to increase the share",

Reaching carbon neutrality may also require compensation for those emissions that cannot be eliminated.\n\nIn 2022, Hiab's innovation centre in Hudiksvall, Sweden, achieved net-zero CO 2 e emissions and is the first carbon neutral Cargotec site. The site operates on 100% renewable electricity and bio-heating, and the equipment tested on the site is either electric or runs on fossil-free hydrotreated vegetable oil fuel (HVO100).\n\nDuring the year, both Kalmar and Hiab's operations at our Stargard site in Poland switched to 100 percent renewable electricity. The switch will enable annual emission savings of nearly 4,000 tonnes of CO 2 -equivalents, representing approximately 26 percent of Cargotec's scope 2 emissions. Kalmar's Stargard operations have also used renewable energy for heating for several years (wood pellets made from waste wood).\n\nDuring 2022, Cargotec also updated its European car policy to begin the transition to only using zero-emission benefit cars and service vans in Europe. Country-specific policies will consider the local infrastructure and availability of hybrid and electric vehicles.\n\n## 3. Boosting our sustainable offering\n\nCargotec's low-carbon and intelligent technologies, products and services help solve our customers' sustainability challenges. Our eco portfolio ( page 34 ) plays a key role in this work. In 2022, we updated the\n\neco portfolio criteria so that the portfolio's climate solutions are aligned with the EU Taxonomy regulation.\n\nTo prove the greenhouse gas emission saving potential of the equipment included in the eco portfolio, we conducted a series of life cycle assessments (LCAs) in 2022. By conducting LCAs, we are able to compare electric or low-emission equipment to the best performing alternative, which is typically a diesel-powered version of the same equipment. The results confirm that electric or low-emission versions of the equipment enable substantial savings in life cycle emissions. During 2023, to ensure continued consistency in conducting similar LCAs in the future, we will develop a clear process for carrying out such studies at Cargotec. For more detailed information on our interpretation of the EU Taxonomy and the LCAs we conducted during the year, see the Board of Directors' report .\n\nIn 2022, Kalmar rolled out its EcoFlex Rental Solution which incentivises emission-efficient behaviour by combining data from equipment with an automated invoicing system. Customers using this solution pay a fixed monthly fee when operating Kalmar equipment in Eco drive mode, while an additional hourly fee is charged when using Normal or Power mode. When operating in Eco mode, customers can reduce emissions and fuel consumption by up to 15%.\n\nKalmar received its first order intakes for the electric reachstacker from Sweden and Norway in 2022. The reachstackers will produce zero greenhouse gas emissions at source, supporting our customers in reaching their sustainability targets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, while Cargotec's products are mainly made of materials from finite resources, the materials are highly recyclable. By further advancing circularity in our operations and value chain, we can minimise these negative impacts and maximise positive ones.\n\nWe foresee many opportunities to contribute to a circular economy and to capture profitable growth through new business models and solutions. For example, Kalmar already offers refurbishments and updates to its equipment to keep them in operation for longer and to improve eco efficiency. Hiab's services and maintenance retain its equipment's original performance levels and reliability for extended periods of time.\n\nThe work for further developing circularity in Cargotec's operations and value chain will be kicked off in 2023 by evaluating the related impacts and how to best manage them while seizing business opportunities. Circular solutions, such as used and refurbished equipment and service offering, are an essential part of Cargotec's eco portfolio. In 2022, we assessed the existing eco portfolio to ensure that these solutions fulfil the updated circular economy criteria of the portfolio.\n\n## Cargotec's eco portfolio\n\nCargotec's objective is to seize profitable growth through sustainability. This means that we must integrate sustainability into  product development and actively drive up the sales of our eco-efficient solutions. Our eco portfolio, established in 2017, is one of our most important tools in this work. The portfolio highlights the equipment, services and software that enhance our customers' sustainability.\n\nIn 2022, Cargotec updated the eco portfolio criteria so that it is structured according to the EU Taxonomy design. Cargotec has the potential to substantially contribute to the Taxonomy's objectives on climate change mitigation and the transition to a circular economy and consequently, the eco portfolio consists of two categories: climate solutions and circular solutions. The portfolio's climate solutions are taxonomy-aligned and thus considered sustainable in the eyes of the Taxonomy regulation.\n\nIn 2022, the sales of the revised eco portfolio accounted for 31 percent of our total sales 1 . Our strategic performance target is to double the eco portfolio sales growth compared to traditional products.\n\nAccording to the updated criteria, all eco portfolio equipment will need to have a life-cycle assessment (LCA) done and verified by a third party. During the year, we conducted a series of these LCAs to ensure that all equipment in the portfolio fulfil the updated criteria.\n\nWe reported on Cargotec's taxonomy-eligible business activities for the first time in 2021. In 2022, we are also reporting on our taxonomy-aligned activities. For our EU Taxonomy reporting and more information about our eco portfolio, our interpretation of the EU Taxonomy and the LCAs conducted 2022, see the Board of Directors's report . A summary of the updated criteria is publicly available here.\n\n## Other environmental impacts\n\nAlthough not material, we monitor and report on other environmental impacts and emissions besides those related to climate change and circularity. For details, see our GRI Index.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FROM CLIMATE COMMITMENTS TO CLIMATE ACTION\n\nWith all the ambitious climate targets out there, what does action look like? At Cargotec, we focus on where it matters most: emissions in the use phase of our equipment.\n\n'To reduce these emissions, we need to have an offering that is electric, low carbon and circular to the largest extent possible,' says Henna Rautanen , Sustainability Director for Climate and Circularity at Cargotec.\n\nAfter the update of the eco portfolio criteria, all its climate solutions are sustainable in the eyes of the EU Taxonomy.\n\n'I think this is a great example of how regulation can drive true change,' says Rautanen.\n\nREAD MORE ONLINE",

The Cargotec class B share is listed at Nasdaq Helsinki and the Company complies with the rules and guidelines of Helsinki Stock Exchange and the Finnish Financial Supervision Authority as well as with all the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020, published by the Securities Markets Association (www.cgfinland.fi/en).\n\nThe corporate governance statement has been reviewed by the Board's Audit and Risk Management Committee. It is issued as a separate report and disclosed, together with the financial statements, Board of Directors' report and the remuneration report, on the Company website. Up-to-date information on governance and remuneration is available on the website.\n\nCargotec's shareholders exercise the highest decision making power at the Shareholders' meeting. The Annual General Meeting (AGM) appoints the members of the Board and the Auditors. The Company is managed by the Board of Directors and the CEO, appointed by the Board.\n\n## Shareholders' Meeting\n\nThe Annual General Meeting is held annually within three months of the closing of the financial period, on a day designated by the Board. An extraordinary Shareholders' meeting in respect of specific matters shall be held when considered necessary by the Board, or when requested in writing by a Company auditor or by shareholders representing at least 10 percent of all the issued shares of the Company.\n\nThe issues decided on by the AGM include the adoption of the financial statements, distribution of profit, granting of release from liability to the members of the Board of Directors and to the CEO as well as the election of and remuneration payable to the members of the Board and auditor. The Shareholders' meeting also has the right to amend the Articles of Association, decide on merger and demerger and make decisions and authorise the Board of Directors to make decisions on the acquisition of treasury shares, on share issues and on option programmes. Cargotec has two share classes, each with different voting rights. In the Shareholders' meeting, each class A share carries one vote, as does each set of ten class B shares, with the provision that each shareholder is entitled to at least one vote.\n\nCargotec's AGM was held on 17 March 2022. The shareholders and their proxy representatives were\n\nable to participate in the general meeting and exercise shareholder rights by voting in advance and by making counter proposals and asking questions in advance. The meeting adopted the financial statements, consolidated financial statements and the remuneration report as well as granted discharge from liability to the CEO and the members of the Board of Directors for the financial year 1 January-31 December 2021. The meeting appointed members of the Board of Directors and the Auditor and approved a distribution of a dividend of EUR 1.07 for each of class A shares and a dividend of EUR 1.08 for each outstanding class B shares. The dividend was paid to shareholders who on the record date of dividend distribution, 21 March 2022, were registered as shareholders in the company's shareholder register. The dividend payment day was 28 March 2022.\n\n## Board of Directors Responsibilities\n\nThe Board confirms Cargotec's strategy and monitors its implementation. As stipulated in the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act and the Articles of Association, the Board is responsible for the management and proper organisation of the Company's operations as well as for representing the Company. The Board has compiled a written charter for its work that defines its main duties and operating principles. The Board's responsibilities include approving the Company's\n\nannual, half-year and interim financial statements and ensuring that the supervision of the Company's accounting and financial matters is properly organised. The Board decides on significant loans, acquisitions and investments and approves the annual and long term operational and financial plans as well as risk management principles. Violations against Cargotec's Code of Conduct are reported to the Board. The Board approves the long- and short-term incentive programmes and their outcome. The Board appoints Cargotec's CEO and determines the related terms of employment. As defined in the Board's annual plan, the Board has theme meetings in which issues associated with the execution of the strategy or another current theme are discussed. In connection with each meeting, the Board holds discussions also without the presence of the executive management.\n\nIn 2022, the Board had 18 meetings. Some of these meetings were held remotely or the resolutions were recorded without convening. Attendance in the meetings is reported in the table further below. The Board agrees annually on focus areas for the coming year. The key themes on the Board's agenda have been Cargotec's strategic focus areas sustainability and profitable growth.

Cargotec will focus on core businesses Hiab and Kalmar and their independence will be increased. The Board decided to initiate the evaluation of strategic options of MacGregor, including also a potential sale of the business. Based on the evaluation, the Board concluded in November that MacGregor will not be part of Cargotec's portfolio in the future. The Board also confirmed the new performance targets for its core businesses Hiab and Kalmar. Cargotec's business areas and their R&D activities as well as supply chain development were discussed in specific theme meetings. Reports on the climate and sustainability work and business area climate actions were presented to the Board regularly. Johanna Lamminen, Board member, was nominated as the member responsible for sustainability issues in the Board.\n\n## Composition\n\nAccording to the Articles of Association, Cargotec's Board of Directors includes a minimum of six and a maximum of twelve members. Board members are elected at the AGM for a one-year term of office that expires at the end of the first AGM following the election. The Board elects a Chair and a Vice Chair from among its members. The Board's composition shall support the overall goal of implementing Cargotec's strategy. According to the Board's diversity principles, board composition shall reflect the operations strategy and the future needs of the Company. The diversity factors include work experience in Cargotec's strategic business areas and of the cultures in which Cargotec operates, as well as\n\neducational background, age and gender. There shall be both genders in the Board, the target being at least two directors of the underrepresented gender.\n\nAt the AGM in 2022, the number of Board members was confirmed to eight and the current Board members Jaakko Eskola, Ilkka Herlin, Teresa KemppiVasama, Johanna Lamminen, Casimir Lindholm, Kaisa Olkkonen, Teuvo Salminen and Heikki Soljama were re-elected to the Board of Directors. The former Board member Tapio Hakakari did not stand for re-election to the Board of Directors. In its organising meeting, the Board re-elected Ilkka Herlin as Chair and Jaakko Eskola was elected as Vice Chair. In April Ilkka Herlin stepped down from the position and Jaakko Eskola was elected as Chair. Ilkka Herlin was elected as Vice Chair. At the end of 2022, the age range of the members was between 51 and 68 years. Three Board members were women and five were men, and thus the underrepresented gender comprises 37.5 % of all members of the Board. Thus, the gender target the Board had set has been reached. The Board members have a wide range of educational backgrounds and they have executive experience in international companies in different cultures.\n\n## Self-assessment and assessment of independence\n\nThe Board conducts an annual internal selfassessment to review its own performance and procedures. In 2022 the self-assessment was conducted as a written questionnaire that the Board discussed among themselves.\n\nThe majority of the Board members shall be independent of the Company and a minimum of two\n\nof the independent directors are to be independent of significant shareholders. The Board conducts, annually and when necessary, an assessment of its members as regards their independence of the Company and major shareholders, as defined in the Corporate Governance Code. In 2022, the members were independent of the Company and all except Ilkka Herlin independent of major shareholders. Ilkka Herlin controls the company Wipunen varainhallinta oy, which is a significant shareholder of Cargotec, and he also is Board member of Mariatorp Oy, another significant shareholder. The Board considers that also Ilkka Herlin and Teuvo Salminen, who have been on the Board for more than ten years, are independent of the Company.\n\nOuti Aaltonen, Senior Vice President, General Counsel, served as the Secretary to the Board of Directors. The CV details of the Board members are available on the Company website and the remuneration of the Board is described in the Remuneration report 2022.\n\n## Board and committee members' participation in meetings 2022\n\n| Name                 | Board of Directors   | Audit and Risk Management  Committee   | Nomination and  Compensation Committee   |\n|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Eskola Jaakko        | 18/18                |                                        | 7/7                                      |\n| Hakakari Tapio*      | 4/4                  |                                        | 2/2                                      |\n| Herlin Ilkka         | 18/18                | 3/5                                    | 7/7                                      |\n| Kemppi-Vasama Teresa | 17/18                |                                        | 7/7                                      |\n| Lamminen Johanna     | 18/18                |                                        |                                          |\n| Lindholm Casimir     | 18/18                |                                        | 5/5                                      |\n| Olkkonen Kaisa       | 18/18                | 5/5                                    |                                          |\n| Salminen Teuvo       | 18/18                | 5/5                                    |                                          |\n| Soljama Heikki       | 18/18                |                                        |                                          |\n\n- * Board member until 17 March 2022",

The Board nominates the members and the Chairs of the committees from among its members annually in its organising meeting and confirms the committees' written charters. The committees have no independent decision-making power, but prepare issues to be resolved by the Board.\n\n## Audit and Risk Management Committee\n\nThe committee's duty is to supervise the financial reporting executed by the management, and to monitor the financial statement and interim reporting process. In accordance with its charter, the committee supervises the adequacy and appropriateness of the Company's internal control, internal audit and risk management, the development of operative and strategic risks and risk management, and handles Internal Audit plans and reports. Furthermore, the committee prepares a proposal to the AGM regarding the election and fees of the external auditor, and monitors the statutory audit of financial statements and consolidated financial statements. Cargotec's Board has confirmed a Non-audit services policy for defining the permitted non-audit services purchased from the auditors. The committee defines and monitors the nonaudit services to ensure the auditor's independence. Violations against Cargotec's Code of Conduct are reported to the committee. The committee also reviews the Corporate governance statement and the Nonfinancial information report.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Management Committee consists of a minimum of three members of the Board of Directors. In addition, the CEO, CFO, Chief Compliance Officer and Head of Internal Audit as well as representatives of the auditing firm attend the meetings.\n\nThe directors of Group Control, Treasury, Taxes, Legal, Information Management and Risk Management report to the committee on a regular basis. If the matters to be dealt with so require, the committee convenes without the presence of the Company's management.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Management Committee was chaired by Teuvo Salminen and its members were Ilkka Herlin and Kaisa Olkkonen. Committee members are independent of the Company and, with the exception of Ilkka Herlin, independent of major shareholders. Committee members possess years of experience in business management duties. In 2022, the committee met five times. The meeting attendance is reported in the above table. The committee handled and prepared financial and treasury topics for Board approval. The representatives of the auditing firm Ernst & Young presented their work and observations to the committee in connection with the Company's annual and interim reports. Reports on risk management, internal audit as well as ethics and compliance were presented quarterly to the committee. The committee received reports on tax and treasury issues, information security management, project risk management development, legal claims, internal controls, as well as the use of the non-audit services. The committee reviewed goodwill impairment testing results, related party transactions as well as actions to comply with any forthcoming IFRS and ESG reporting requirements. The committee held an annual self-assessment discussion to review whether its performance needs to be developed.\n\n## Nomination and Compensation Committee\n\nThe committee prepares a proposal to Cargotec's AGM concerning the composition and remuneration of the Board of Directors. The committee prepares the remuneration policy and remuneration report for the Company's governing bodies, i.e. the Board,\n\nthe CEO and the deputy CEO, if such is appointed. The committee discusses annually the Board's diversity principles and follows if the diversity target is met. The committee prepares a proposal to the Board regarding the appointment of the CEO and the terms of employment. The committee prepares Cargotec's long- and short-term incentive programmes and follows their outcome and functionality, and prepares the nomination and remuneration issues of other top management members as needed before Board approval.\n\nThe committee consists of a minimum of three Board members. The committee convenes as needed but at least three times a year. The committee members were Jaakko Eskola, Ilkka Herlin, Teresa KemppiVasama, Tapio Hakakari until 17 March 2022 and Casimir Lindholm as of the same date. Ilkka Herlin was the Chair of the committee until 27 April 2022 and Jaakko Eskola as of that date. Committee members are independent of the Company. The CEO and the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, attended the committee meetings, except when they themselves were the subject of discussion.\n\nIn 2022, the committee convened seven times. The meeting attendance is presented in the above table. In accordance with the annual cycle, the committee's agenda comprised top management short and long term incentive programmes and their outcome, top management reviews and compensation as well as talent review follow-up. The committee prepared the remuneration report for the governing bodies presented to the AGM in 2022. The committee discussed the Board's diversity principles and saw to it that the diversity criteria were met when preparing its proposal concerning the Board composition to the AGM in 2022.\n\n## CEO\n\nThe Board of Directors appoints Cargotec's CEO and determines the related terms of employment, defined in a written employment contract. The CEO is responsible for ensuring that the targets, plans, guidelines and goals set by the Board are carried out within Cargotec. According to the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act, the CEO ensures that the accounting practices of the Company comply with the law and that financial matters are handled in a reliable manner. The Board evaluates the performance of the CEO and the achievement of the targets it has set to him. Cargotec's CEO is Mika Vehvil\u00e4inen, Master of Science (Economics). In December 2022, Vehvil\u00e4inen informed Cargotec's Board of Directors of his intention to retire from Cargotec during 2023, in accordance with the terms of his CEO service contract. The Board initiated a search for a successor.\n\n## Leadership Team\n\nSupporting the CEO in his duties, the Leadership Team is responsible for business development and the Company's operational activities in accordance with the targets set by the Board of Directors and the CEO. The Leadership Team also defines operative principles and procedures in accordance with the guidelines set by the Board. The Leadership Team concentrates on the strategic issues of the group and the business areas. The agenda regularly includes reports and issues concerning financial development, governance, human resources, sustainability and development projects. The Leadership Team members report to Cargotec's CEO. The CEO's and the Leadership Team's CV details are available on the Company website. The CEO remuneration is described in the Remuneration report 2022 and the remuneration of the Leadership Team is described on the Company website at www.cargotec.com.",

The reporting channel is provided by an external partner, to ensure anonymity. All reports are investigated and processed in confidence by the Ethics and Compliance team. Corrective and disciplinary actions are discussed and agreed in the Code of Conduct panel of Cargotec Leadership Team.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe objective of Cargotec's internal control is to ensure that the Company's operations are efficient and profitable, that risk management is adequate and appropriate, and that financial and other information produced is reliable. Cargotec's internal control is based on the Company's Code of Conduct and Internal Controls Framework. With respect to the financial reporting process, these are supported by policies and guidelines, as well as with the internal financial reporting process and communication. Cargotec's Internal control policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors, specifies the applicable control principles, procedures and responsibilities. Similarly to other Cargotec operations, responsibility for internal control is divided into three tiers. The line management is principally responsible for internal control. This is backed by corporate support functions, which define instructions applicable across the Company and supervise risk management. Internal and external audits form the third tier, their task being to ensure that the first two tiers function effectively.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe role of Cargotec Internal Audit is an independent and objective assurance and consulting activity that is guided by a philosophy of adding value and improving the operations of Cargotec and its businesses. It helps and supports the business organisation to accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. To ensure the independence of the Internal Audit function, the Head of Internal Audit reports functionally to the Audit and Risk Management Committee, and administratively to the CFO. Internal Audit develops a flexible risk based audit plan which is approved by the Audit and Risk Management Committee.\n\n## Risk management\n\nCargotec's risk management is guided by the Enterprise risk management policy, approved by the Board of Directors. It specifies the objectives and principles of risk management as well as the process and responsibilities involved. Risk management is to be naturally built into all business decisions and plans. The core principle is continuous, systematic and preventive action taken to identify risks, define the Company's risk appetite, assess and handle risks and, if they materialise, deal with them effectively. The Board of Directors defines the overall risk appetite of the Company and ensures that the organisation has sufficient risk management and control. The CEO and the Leadership Team are responsible for the methods, implementation and supervision of risk management. Cargotec's risk management is spread across units and corporate support functions\n\nthat assign responsibility for risk management and that are in charge of identifying, managing and reporting risks. The Risk Management function is responsible for reporting any findings to the CEO and Leadership Team, and reports quarterly to the Board's Audit and Risk Management Committee on the risk reviews, identified risks and mitigation plans. Climate-related risks and opportunities are identified and assessed with the help of the general corporate risk management process as well as a dedicated climate-related risk management process, created by the corporate sustainability and strategy teams. The process is described in the Board of Directors report. Financial risks are managed centrally by the Corporate Treasury and reported on for corporate management and the Audit and Risk Management Committee on a regular basis. The Board of Directors' report includes an estimate on the Company's main risks and uncertainties and short-term risks.\n\n## Financial reporting process\n\nThe effectiveness of internal control measures related to financial reporting is monitored by the Board of Directors, the Audit and Risk Management Committee, the CEO, the Leadership Team and business area leadership teams. Various control measures, such as reconciliations, logic analyses and comparative analyses are performed at different organisational levels. The purpose of these control measures is to detect, prevent and correct any errors and deviations in financial follow-up. Cargotec's financial reporting is based on monthly performance monitoring in a centralised reporting system. Financial reports are first reviewed at a reporting unit level, and then at the operative management's review meetings on a\n\ndivision level, followed by business area level and group management level reviews. Finally, the reports are discussed at the Leadership Team's meeting. Financial information is also reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. Controllers report any deviations from the plans to the management teams, analyse the reasons for such deviations and support the management in decision-making. Monthly reviews also ensure that performance is in line with annual targets and that financial forecasts are up to date.\n\nThe financial reporting and planning instructions (Cargotec accounting standards and Cargotec reporting manual) are available to all employees on Cargotec's intranet. The Company's finance function aims to harmonise the practices and procedures applied by controllers, while ensuring consistent interpretation of instructions and further improving them. Cargotec Business Services offer shared financial, HR and indirect procurement services for Cargotec companies and target a harmonised way of working with common processes, controls and tools. A corporate-wide development programme regarding internal controls has clarified and reinforced the shared principles and ways of working and strengthened internal control. The programme's processes are part of the company's daily operations and help ensure compliance with Cargotec's Code of Conduct and internal policies. Multifaceted reporting tools based on common systems have been developed to support the financial performance monitoring and comparability.",

This report includes information concerning remuneration of the Board of Directors ('Board') and the CEO of Cargotec between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2022. The Report is based on the Recommendations on Corporate Governance Code 2020 in Finland as well as the provisions to the Finnish Securities Market Act and Limited Liability Companies Act. The Report has been reviewed by the Board's Nomination and Compensation Committee ('Committee') and approved by the Board of Directors. The shareholders will make an advisory decision on the approval of the Remuneration Report at the Company's Annual General Meeting 2023.\n\n## Letter from the Chair of the Board\n\nRemuneration of the Cargotec governing bodies is based on the Remuneration Policy that was presented for an advisory decision at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 May 2020. Cargotec has followed the Remuneration Policy's decision making process and remuneration governance model in 2022. There haven't been any claw-backs made in 2022. Our Remuneration Policy and overall remuneration philosophy reinforce Cargotec's values and ethical principles, aligning remuneration with the successful delivery of our strategy and creating long-term shareholder value. The variable, performance-based incentives - shortand long-term incentive programmes (STI and LTI programmes) - are designed to be the largest component of remuneration, thereby strengthening the alignment between remuneration and Company performance, and reflecting our philosophy that CEO\n\nremuneration should be closely tied to the strategy aimed at long-term value creation. Performance measures for the variable pay programmes are determined annually by the Board and reflect our key performance indicators.\n\nAs part of Cargotec's remuneration principles, sustainability has had a central role ever since the Company was founded. Over the years Cargotec's Board of Directors has evaluated various models about how to connect sustainability topics to leadership remuneration. Based on assessments, sustainability themes have been prudently and rationally included in the leadership incentive programmes in recent years.\n\nThe eco portfolio order intake and the Mission Climate programme roadmap were included in the 2022 performance share programme evaluation criteria. These concrete, measurable issues have brought the increasing of offering and sales of solutions that reduce the emissions of our customers into our remuneration criteria. The inclusion of sustainability metrics in the evaluation of management remuneration is a process that will develop over the coming years.\n\nIn October 2020, Cargotec and Konecranes Plc announced their plans to combine the two companies through a merger. Competition authorities in the EU and China had already approved the merger but, in March 2022, the UK Competition & Markets Authority blocked the merger. The completion of the planned merger would have required approvals from all relevant competition authorities. Thus, Cargotec and Konecranes cancelled the planned merger.\n\nThe merger would have created substantial value for our industry as well as shareholders and the combination would have created a strong European company. The cancellation, however, was a reality that could not be avoided, and the Company took a determined step forward, announcing its refocused strategy at the beginning of the year.\n\nAs per the refocused strategy, the Company will focus on sustainability and growth in the profitable core businesses Hiab and Kalmar, and exit from Kalmar's heavy port cranes business. In terms of MacGregor, after evaluating its strategic options, the Board of Directors announced in November that MacGregor will not be part of Cargotec's portfolio in the future.\n\nThe implementation of the strategy progressed well during 2022. With regards to Kalmar's heavy crane business, the related intellectual properties and assets have been transferred to Cargotec's subcontractor, and the majority of the heavy cranes order book is planned to be delivered in 2023. The changes in the operating model, aimed at increasing the independence of the business areas, have also been taken into use.\n\nSupported by the refocused strategy, Cargotec's business performance in 2022 was good. While the year was characterised by various global crises, Cargotec's orders received, sales and comparable operating profit were at a record level. Also the service and eco portfolio sales were record-high. Customer interest in eco-efficient equipment is constantly growing, which creates a clear and increasing business opportunity for Cargotec.\n\nIn December 2022, Cargotec's CEO Mika Vehvil\u00e4inen informed Cargotec's Board of Directors of his intention to retire from Cargotec during 2023, after which the Board initiated a search for a successor.\n\nUnder Mika's leadership, Cargotec has made critical changes to its strategy, structure and performance that position the Company strongly for success. The work to develop Cargotec to its full potential continues, and we thank Mika warmly for his leadership and work for the benefit of Cargotec.\n\n## Jaakko Eskola\n\nChair of the Board and Board's Nomination and Compensation Committee\n\n## Cargotec 2022 Remuneration in brief\n\nCargotec's Remuneration Policy's key principles were followed through 2022.

Each performance period includes one to three measuring periods. One measuring period can be three calendar years at maximum, which is the total length of one performance period. The reward is granted and settled in Cargotec class B shares on top of which Cargotec pays taxes and tax-related expenses. No reward will be paid, if a key employee's employment or service ends before the reward payment.\n\n## 2019-2022 Matching Share Programme\n\nProgramme participants have made an investment to Cargotec shares at the inception of the programme and receive an equivalent amount of shares in accordance with the matching share programme. The reward is granted and settled in Cargotec class B shares on top of which Cargotec pays taxes and tax-related expenses. The vesting condition related to matching shares is tied to working condition so that one third of the reward is earned annually over the three year period after which the vested shares have a lock-up period of one year except the shares vested during the last year for which there is no lock-up period.\n\n## 2022-2024  Restricted Share Unit Programme\n\nThe reward from the Restricted Share Unit Programme 2022-2024 is conditional on the achievement of strategic goals set by the Board of Directors.

This was in/fluenced by, for example, Russia's attack on Ukraine, global supply chain challenges, increased interest rates, high in/flation, and weakened consumer con/fidence.\n\nThe demand for Cargotec's core businesses Hiab and Kalmar is affected by the development of the global GDP per capita. According to the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects report published in January 2023, the global economy grew by 2.9 percent in 2022. In the World Bank's advanced economies group (a group of countries which includes several key Cargotec markets, such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany), the World Bank estimates a 2.5 percent growth in 2022. 1\n\nThe demand for MacGregor's cargo handling solutions is driven by the level of merchant ship contracting which, against a strong comparison period, declined to 1,286 2 (1,613 3 ) new orders in 2022. Higher new vessel construction costs and extended lead times due to shipyard capacity restrictions weakened the ordering activity which, however, was still signi/ficantly higher compared to previous years. In the offshore sector, the number of the new unit contracts was 137 (107), which was still below the historical average (365).\n\n## Orders received and order book\n\nOrders received increased in 2022 by 10 percent from the comparison period and totalled EUR 4,862 (4,427) million. Orders received increased in all business areas from the comparison period. Service orders received increased by 11 percent and totalled EUR 1,286 (1,162) million.\n\nThe order book increased by 24 percent from the end of 2021, and at the end of 2022 it totalled EUR 3,541 (31 Dec 2021:\n\n2,847) million. Kalmar's order book totalled EUR 1,428 (1,302) million, representing 40 (46) percent, Hiab's EUR 1,185 (985) million or 33 (35) percent and MacGregor's EUR 927 (560) million or 26 (20) percent of the consolidated order book.\n\nIn 2022, the share of orders received was 42 (46) percent in EMEA and 35 (34) percent in the Americas. Asia-Paci/fic's share of orders received was 23 (20) percent.\n\n## Sales\n\nSales in 2022 increased from the comparison period by 23 percent to EUR 4,089 (3,315) million. Sales increased in all businesses. Service sales increased by 17 percent from the comparison period and totalled EUR 1,264 (1,076) million, representing 31 (32) percent of consolidated sales. Software sales decreased by 51 percent and amounted to EUR 47 (95) million. The decrease in software sales was due to the divestment of the Navis software business in 2021. Service and software sales amounted to EUR 1,311 (1,172) million, representing 32 (35) percent of consolidated sales.\n\nCargotec's eco portfolio consists of products and services that enhance customers' sustainability with tangible environmental bene/fits. In 2022, the eco portfolio sales increased by 54 percent according to the old criteria and totalled EUR 964 (626) million, representing 24 (19) percent of consolidated sales.\n\nIn 2022, EMEA's share of consolidated sales was 47 (50) percent, Americas' 36 (31) percent and Asia-Paci/fic's 17 (19) percent.\n\n## Financial result\n\nOperating pro/fit in 2022 totalled EUR 106 (356) million. The operating pro/fit includes items affecting comparability worth\n\nEUR -226 (124) million. EUR -48 (224) million of the items were related to Kalmar, EUR -7 (-22) million to Hiab, EUR -154 (-25) million to MacGregor and EUR -17 (-53) million to corporate administration and support functions. Of the items related to Kalmar, EUR -36 million were related to the decision to transfer the heavy crane immaterial rights to Rainbow Industries Co. Ltd. in China, and to the plans to ramp down the heavy cranes business. Of the items related to MacGregor, EUR -108 million concern restructuring costs of the business area, write-downs of the MacGregor product range rationalisation, and MacGregor goodwill write-down. In addition, around EUR -18 million of the MacGregor items concern a provision for possible consequences related to a project delivered to the U.S. government. Of the corporate administration and support functions items affecting comparability, EUR -10 (-50) million were related to the cancelled merger plan with Konecranes Plc. Of the items affecting comparability, EUR -8 million, all businesses combined, were related to the ramp down of businesses in Russia. Of the items affecting comparability, about half is estimated to impact cash /flow. More information regarding items affecting comparability is available in Note 2.4, Comparable operating pro/fit.\n\nComparable operating pro/fit in 2022 increased by 43 percent and totalled EUR 332 (232) million, representing 8.1 (7.0) percent of sales. The comparable operating pro/fit increase was driven by higher sales in Kalmar and Hiab.\n\nIn 2022, net interest expenses for interest-bearing debt and assets totalled EUR 14 (18) million. Net /finance expenses totalled EUR 27 (23) million. Group /financing expenses increased as a result of higher hedging costs, and the change in exchange rate differences. The hedging cost increase was due to a higher amount of hedges and change in interest rate",

Pro/fit in 2022 totalled EUR 23 (247) million, and basic earnings per share was EUR 0.37 (3.82).\n\n## Balance sheet, cash flow and financing\n\nAt the end of the year 2022, the consolidated balance sheet total was EUR 4,189 (31 Dec 2021: 4,027) million. Equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent was EUR 1,528 (1,544) million, representing EUR 23.69 (23.95) per share. Property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet amounted to EUR 420 (410) million and intangible assets to EUR 1,017 (1,139) million.\n\nReturn on equity (ROE, last 12 months) was 1.5 (31 Dec 2021: 17.3) percent at the end of the year, and return on capital employed (ROCE, last 12 months) was 4.6 (14.5) percent. The return on equity and capital employed of the comparison period include the pro/fit from the Navis software business divestment. In 2022, the return on capital employed was weakened by the negative result and high capital employed of the MacGregor business area.\n\nCash /flow from operating activities before /financial items and taxes totalled EUR 231 (169) million during 2022. The increase in inventories caused by bottlenecks in the supply chain still burdened cash /flow.\n\nCargotec's liquidity position is strong. In December, Cargotec entered into a new EUR 330 million sustainabilitylinked revolving credit facility with a syndicate of its seven relationship banks. The facility has a tenor of /five years with two one-year extension options. The purpose of this facility is to re/finance the EUR 300 million revolving credit facility maturing in June 2024. With this facility, Cargotec strengthened its long-term liquidity and included sustainability targets to the facility.\n\nThe liquidity reserves, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and the above mentioned undrawn EUR 330 million longterm revolving credit facility, totalled EUR 782 million on\n\n31 December 2022 (31 Dec 2021: 789). In addition to the liquidity reserves, Cargotec had access to a EUR 150 million commercial paper programme, of which undrawn EUR 150 (150) million, as well as undrawn bank overdraft facilities, totalling EUR 95 (111) million.\n\nThe company liquidity requirement - repayments of interestbearing liabilities due within the following 12 months - totalled EUR 87 (43) million, which includes EUR 37 (35) million lease liabilities.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the interest-bearing debt amounted to EUR 838 (31 Dec 2021: 919) million, of which EUR 165 (163) million was in lease liabilities. Of the interest-bearing debt, EUR 87 (43) million was current and EUR 751 (876) million non-current debt. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities, excluding on-balance sheet lease liabilities, was 2.1 (1.3) percent. Cash and cash equivalents, loans receivable, and other interest-bearing assets totalled EUR 459 (505) million. Interest-bearing net debt totalled EUR 378 (414) million.\n\nAt the end of the year, Cargotec's equity to assets ratio was 39.2 (31 Dec 2021: 40.6) percent. Gearing was 24.8 (26.8) percent.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch and product development expenditure in 2022 totalled EUR 100 (102) million, representing 2.4 (3.1) percent of sales. The decrease in the R&D expenditure was mainly due to the divestment of the Navis software business. Research and development investments were focused on solutions supporting climate targets such as digitalisation, electri/fication, and robotisation as well as projects that aim to improve the competitiveness and cost ef/ficiency of products. During the year, research and development efforts focused for example on the following:\n\n## Kalmar\n\nDuring the year, Kalmar continued the development of its electric offering as well as the future robotic product portfolio. With the help of electri/fication, customers can achieve signi/ficant lifetime cost and greenhouse gas emission reductions. The development of electric equipment also offers Kalmar a signi/ficant business opportunity.\n\nIn 2022, Kalmar started /field testing the Kalmar Electric Reachstacker in Norway, and the /field tests of the world's /first Kalmar Heavy Electric Forklift started in Sweden. In December, Kalmar started serial production of fully electric reachstackers at its assembly unit in Poland.\n\nKalmar collaborates with other industry players to speed up the development of novel technologies in the area of cargo handling. In December, Kalmar announced a collaboration with Toyota Tsusho America Inc., and global strategic environmental engineering consultancy Ricardo in a project to develop fuel cell powered terminal tractors. As part of the project, a Kalmar customer in the USA will trial two Kalmar Ottawa Terminal Tractors powered by fuel cell technology at its container terminal on the US west coast.\n\n## Hiab\n\nIn 2022, Hiab launched a record amount, over 40, of new products. These included signi/ficant developments to loader cranes, a range of railway cranes, new electric MOFFETT truck mounted forklifts to complete the eSeries, a new generation of LOGLIFT forestry cranes, and tail lifts. Hiab also introduced the world's /first hooklift, a MULTILIFT Ultima, made mostly from fossil-free steel from SSAB. The steel offers the same properties as conventionally produced steel.\n\nIn addition, Hiab presented the comprehensive and intelligent service solution HiPerformTM which enables optimising the performance of customers' Hiab equipment. Hiab also launched multiple solutions addressing sustainability, such as the ePTO 44, an electric and emission-free alternative",

HiVision allows equipment operations from inside the truck cabin by using an external camera system to show the equipment surroundings.\n\n## MacGregor\n\nDuring 2022, MacGregor completed its range of electric cranes with the release of a heavy-duty transfer loading crane that consumes approximately 60 percent less energy compared to a hydraulic drive system.\n\nThe SEAMLESS project, part of the EU Horizon innovation programme, received EUR 15 million in funding from the EU for developing inland transport waterway automation. Of the funding, MacGregor is to receive EUR 2.6 million. In the project, MacGregor aims to develop a so-called Dock'n'Load system which includes automated docking, mooring and departure systems, enabling autonomous vessels to operate within inland waterway ports with limited infrastructure. MacGregor also further develops Voyage and Container Optimisation Platform which would enable transparency of hinterland connections and transhipments of the container supply chain to all stakeholders. In addition, connection to various existing platforms would also be secured.\n\nMacGregor is actively working on the carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) segment, utilising its offshore know-how and capabilities, and is in close dialogue with other industry stakeholders.\n\nMacGregor also continued the project towards offshore wind energy that started in 2020, where the developed prototype enables the veri/fication of simulation models and the control of system performance and, for example, the evaluation of various situations in a safe and regulated environment. The research and development project is supported by the Norway Research Council, the Norwegian government's research\n\npolicy adviser, and is implemented in cooperation between the University of Agder and MacGregor.\n\nMacGregor was awarded the 2022 SMART4SEA Technology Award for the development of the OnWatch Scout service that monitors conditions and anticipates maintenance needs.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure, excluding acquisitions and customer /financing, totalled EUR 81 (64) million in 2022. Investments in customer /financing were EUR 32 (16) million. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment amounted to EUR 204 (117) million. The amount includes impairments worth EUR 88 (7) million, of which EUR 63 million is related to MacGregor's goodwill impairment and EUR 25 million to intangible asset write-downs related to the MacGregor product range rationalisation.\n\n## Acquisitions and divestments\n\nIn December, Hiab entered into an agreement to acquire the family-owned Swedish industrial group Olsbergs. Olsbergs is the technological leader in the design and manufacture of hydraulic valves and remote control systems. Its solutions are used to manoeuvre Hiab's truck mounted loader cranes and forestry cranes. The closing of the transaction took place on 1 January 2023.\n\nInformation regarding acquisitions and divestments is available in Note 7.1, Acquisitions and disposals.\n\n## Operational restructurings\n\nRestructuring costs in 2022 amounted to EUR 91 (33) million. In November, Cargotec announced that it had started a restructuring programme in MacGregor's offshore business. Cargotec booked a EUR 45 million restructuring cost related to MacGregor's restructuring programmes in 2022. Cargotec booked in 2022 a EUR 36 million restructuring cost related to the decision announced in July to transfer Kalmar heavy crane immaterial rights to Rainbow Industries Co. Ltd. in China,\n\nand to the plans to ramp down the heavy cranes business. In addition, Cargotec booked a EUR 8 million impairment provision in 2022 to assets that relate to ramping down its businesses in Russia. For the year 2023, the restructuring costs of ongoing restructuring programmes are estimated to be approximately EUR 20 million. The estimate does not include all costs related to Cargotec's refocused strategy, and the restructuring cost estimate may be subject to change.\n\nMore information regarding restructuring costs and other items affecting comparability is available in Note 2.4, Comparable operating pro/fit.\n\n## Personnel\n\nCargotec employed 11,526 (31 Dec 2021: 11,174) people at the end of the year 2022. The average number of employees in 2022 was 11,405 (1-12/2021: 11,232).\n\nSalaries and remunerations to employees totalled EUR 608 (611) million in 2022.\n\nCargotec's annual Compass Employee Engagement survey provides valuable information on work-related feelings and thoughts of our employees. Through the survey, employees are encouraged to share their thoughts on a wide range of topics, such as work-life balance and wellbeing, social responsibility and leadership, and team climate.\n\nThe completion rate of the 2022 Compass survey was 75 percent (2021: 76). According to the results, teamwork remains our stronghold, which is evident from the top score of 82 (82) percent in the team climate and performance category. On the other hand, the results show that we must focus more attention on topics such as work-life balance, stress management and the future direction of the company. As per Cargotec's personnel procedures, managers organise feedback sessions and plan actions with their teams, focusing especially on items where improvement is needed.",

Automated, robotised and zero emission equipment help Kalmar and Hiab customers to overcome sustainability challenges.\n\nAs part of its strategy, Cargotec has exited Kalmar's heavy port cranes business and has completed the evaluation of strategic options of MacGregor, announced in March 2022. Based on the evaluation, Cargotec's Board of Directors has concluded that MacGregor will not be part of Cargotec's portfolio in the future. An active sales process of the MacGregor business has not been initiated yet and the Board of Directors continues to evaluate the timing of the divestment.\n\n## Performance targets for core businesses 4\n\nCargotec's performance targets re/flect the company's strategy and ambition to grow pro/fitably by solving customers' sustainability challenges. Performance targets are set for core businesses Kalmar and Hiab and were announced on 15 November 2022.\n\n- \u00b7  Eco portfolio sales: double the growth compared to traditional products\n- \u00b7  Reduce CO 2 emissions in Cargotec's value chain 5 by 25% by 2025 and by 50 % by 2030\n- \u00b7  Sales growth faster than market 6\n- \u00b7  Comparable operating pro/fit 12% by 2025 and 15% by 2030\n\nCargotec also aims for a growing dividend 30-50% of EPS and to keep gearing below 50%.\n\n## Core businesses' key figures\n\nIn 2022, sales of Cargotec's core businesses increased from the comparison period by 31 percent and amounted to EUR 3,445 (2,633) million. Eco portfolio sales of the core businesses according to the old criteria increased by 78 percent and totalled EUR 859 (482) million, representing 25 (18) percent of core businesses' consolidated sales. The comparable operating pro/fit of Cargotec's core businesses increased by 47 percent and amounted to EUR 388 (264) million. The comparable operating pro/fit margin of Cargotec's core businesses was 11.3 (10.0) in 2022. The CO 2 emissions of the core business' value chain increased by 15 percent from the year 2019 level. The emission intensity decreased but not enough to compensate for the increase in emissions brought about by the increase in sales.\n\n## Disclosure on non-financial information\n\nCargotec discloses its key non-/financial information in this section to respond to the obligations laid in the accounting act amendment (1376/2016), based on the EU Directive on non-/financial reporting. More information about the non/financial and sustainability matters is provided in the Annual Report and in a separate GRI Index. This disclosure is based on the materiality principle covering environmental, social and employee matters, human rights, and ethics and compliance matters, and provides an understanding of the performance, development, position and impacts of Cargotec's activities in the value chain. When preparing this disclosure, several reporting frameworks and guidelines have been consulted, including the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), CDSB Framework for reporting environmental and climate change information, and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\n\n## Business model\n\nCargotec is one of the leading providers of cargo and load handling solutions, and its three business areas Kalmar, Hiab and MacGregor are recognised leaders in their /fields around the world.

These commitments are re/flected in the Cargotec Code of Conduct that describes the general requirements, guidelines and ethical principles, and de/fines the company's way of working. The practical implementation of the Code of Conduct is ensured through topic area-speci/fic policies, processes and training.\n\nCargotec's Board of Directors (BoD) has the overall responsibility for non-/financial matters. Since sustainability is an integral part of Cargotec's business strategy, the BoD reviews non-/financial related issues twice a year as a separate topic. Additional meetings are held as needed. The BoD has a nominated person who is responsible for overseeing non/financial matters and their management and for ensuring that the BoD is kept up to date on the topic. As the BoD con/firms Cargotec's strategy and monitors its implementation, it is also responsible for con/firming the company's management approach to non-/financial matters, approving related targets and monitoring progress towards the targets. The BoD is also responsible for setting the ambition level on non-/financial initiatives and cascading these responsibilities to the CEO and Cargotec Leadership Team (CLT).\n\nCargotec Leadership Team (CLT) reviews non-/financial matters twice a year according to prede/fined reporting schedules. The group functions supporting the target setting for non/financial matters and the implementation of those targets include sustainability (including environment and safety management), human resources, ethics and compliance, legal, sourcing, research and development (R&D) as well as strategy. The CLT conducts sustainability reviews and approves group-level sustainability-related policies as well as annual objectives and targets. Key long-term sustainability targets are approved by Cargotec's Board of Directors (BoD).\n\nThe CEO and the CLT are responsible for the implementation of the targets and business plans set by the BoD. More details on the management principles of non-/financial matters can be found in the Corporate governance statement 2022 and in Cargotec's Annual report 2022.\n\nCargotec's Sustainability Council consists of the CEO (chair), Business Area Presidents, Senior Vice President Communications, Senior Vice President Strategy, Chief Financial Of/ficer, Chief Information Of/ficer, Chief Compliance Of/ficer and Vice President Sustainability. The Sustainability Council acts as a steering group for the Sustainability Management Team and holds the responsibility for sustainability target implementation. The Sustainability Council meets on a quarterly basis to review the Sustainability Management Team's activities. The council agrees on resourcing and actions taken regarding the development, implementation and follow-up of sustainability targets and policies.\n\nCargotec's Sustainability Management Team manages, coordinates and executes Cargotec's sustainability objectives and targets on an operational level. The Sustainability Management Team consists of group sustainability experts, Business Area Sustainability heads and material topic leads. Each material topic has a nominated lead who is responsible for systematically driving the management and improvement actions of their designated topic. Cargotec has identi/fied seven material topics where its potential and actual impacts are most signi/ficant: climate change, circular economy, human rights, health and safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, sustainable /finance and responsible sourcing. The Sustainability Management Team meets monthly to drive cross-group collaboration and review action plans, resource allocation and improvement areas. Cargotec's VP Sustainability leads the Management Team and reports to the Sustainability Council.\n\n## Environment\n\nClimate change is considered a material topic for Cargotec from a /financial, environmental and social perspective. Climate change mitigation and the transition to a low-carbon economy are seen as major business opportunities within the company. Cargotec operates in the cargo and load handling sector, which has a signi/ficant carbon footprint, as much of the equipment used in the industry is still powered with fossil fuels today. Reducing the carbon footprint of the sector is a signi/ficant business opportunity for the company. In addition, the use of natural resources is identi/fied as a topic of high importance. Cargotec's products are mainly made of materials from /finite resources, although the materials are highly recyclable.\n\nThe transition to a circular, low-carbon economy is anticipated to lead to rethinking the material /flows. When compared to the impacts of the complete value chain, the impact from the energy used in Cargotec's own operations is fairly limited. Similarly, because waste generation and water use in the company's operations are relatively low, they are considered non-material topics. Moreover, steel is the most common material used in the products and it is recycled to a high extent. Due to their potential signi/ficant impact, Cargotec's main focus is on climate-related topics throughout the value chain.\n\nCargotec's strategy focuses on electri/fication, which will lead to an increase in the usage of batteries. Therefore, responsible sourcing and mineral management are seen as topics of high importance. Cargotec is a member of the cross-industry initiative Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). The goal of RMI is to support responsible mineral sourcing globally through developing business practices. While Cargotec does not directly source minerals from mines, smelters or re/finers, the company recognises that it is part of their downstream value chain. As such, Cargotec can play a role in addressing con/flicts, human rights abuses and environmental issues",

Cargotec has acknowledged the need to operate within planetary boundaries and strives to contribute to tackling global challenges, such as climate change, resource depletion, biodiversity loss and pollution. Cargotec has joined the Science Based Targets initiative as well as the UN Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign and is committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with the 1.5\u00b0C warming scenario, which is the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.\n\nAs Cargotec's climate work is strongly embedded into the strategy process, the BoD reviews it twice a year. During 2022, the BoD agreed on two main action points to further support Cargotec's sustainable development: setting remuneration incentives and establishing a new governance model for sustainability. The remuneration incentives help to ensure that the company's sustainability targets are achieved. Consequently, the eco portfolio order intake and climate programme roadmaps were included in the Cargotec leadership remuneration incentive programme in 2022. With these concrete and measurable actions, increasing the offering and sales of solutions that reduce the emissions of Cargotec's customers becomes part of the company's remuneration criteria. The BoD also agreed on a new sustainability governance model with a more structured approach to the management of Cargotec's material impacts within the company. In the new model, each material topic has a nominated lead responsible for systematically driving the management and improvement actions for their designated topic.\n\nWhile the BoD has oversight of strategy execution, risk management, business plans, related performance objectives and major capital expenditures, the CEO and Cargotec Leadership Team (CLT) are responsible for the implementation of the targets and business plans. The CLT approves grouplevel sustainability targets, monitors the progress of climate initiatives and cascades targets further into the organisation. Cargotec's Senior Vice President Strategy is responsible for the climate strategy as part of Cargotec's overall strategy and reports to the CEO. As the company's strategy covers climate-related risks and opportunities, the CEO is responsible for assessing and managing them.\n\n## Strategy\n\nCargotec's vision is to be the global leader in sustainable cargo /flow. Within the strategic vision, Cargotec published a refocused strategy in March 2022. According to the refocused strategy, Cargotec will lower its exposure to project related businesses. In November, Cargotec further speci/fied the priority of its strategic aims and published for the /first time a set of sustainability-related performance targets. Sustainability and pro/fitable growth remain the company's breakthrough objectives, but Cargotec will raise climate change mitigation and sustainability to the forefront of its agenda to secure pro/fitable growth - proving to the industry, competitors and customers that these topics go hand-in-hand. The refocused strategy enables additional investments in R&D and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the core businesses, providing a good position to further strengthen business opportunities through electri/fication, robotics and digitalisation.\n\nCargotec's vision is well aligned with the company's climate ambition, which includes absolute emission reduction targets for both own operations and the value chain. To ensure strategic relevance, and in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Cargotec has conducted a scenario analysis to outline its most pressing climate-related risks and opportunities. The chosen scenarios help the company understand the potential\n\n/financial impacts of climate change in both favourable and unfavourable circumstances. In the favourable scenario, the world achieves the objectives of the Paris Agreement and manages to limit global warming to 1.5\u00baC. This scenario follows the carbon emission pathway RCP 2.6 of the IPCC 5th Assessment report (SSP1-2.6 of the IPCC 6th Assessment Report) and the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), complementing Net Zero Emissions by 2050 analysis as described in the IEA World Energy Outlook 2020. In the unfavourable scenario, the world continues business as usual, leading to a global warming of 4\u00baC. The scenario is based on the IPCC RCP 8.5 carbon emissions pathway.\n\nCargotec considers time horizons of less than one year as short-term, 1-3 years as medium-term and 3-30 years as long-term. The company's /financial planning period is three years, while the underlying megatrends are assessed with a long-term time horizon. The climate scenario analysis covers Cargotec's short, medium and long-term time horizons, with the long-term time horizon extending to 2050. The scenarios cover policy, legal, technological and societal aspects. Some certainties, such as digitalisation, electri/fication, renewable energy and circular economy, are acknowledged in all scenarios. These are also integrated into Cargotec's strategy, which builds trust in the resilience of the strategy, regardless of the future warming pathway.\n\nTechnology and market risks and opportunities are deemed as the most material ones. Transforming the industry and mitigating climate change by providing low-carbon solutions for customers is a great opportunity for Cargotec. The demand for low-carbon products and solutions is expected to increase, resulting in increased eco portfolio sales. With further investments in R&D and innovation, Cargotec is seizing the opportunity to develop new products and access new and emerging markets, in addition to responding to the increasing demand in existing markets.",

They have all been taken into account in the company's strategy and /financial planning already in previous years. The EU Taxonomy regulation considers manufacturing as a key sector in enabling GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy. Cargotec has great potential in helping its customers to become low-carbon in their operations by providing technologies that are aimed at substantial GHG emissions reductions. For example, Cargotec established its eco portfolio as early as in 2017, to bring together the products and services that enhance its customers' sustainability. In 2022, Cargotec's eco portfolio criteria was revised to increase the ambition level so that it is aligned with the EU Taxonomy regulation.\n\nBesides electri/fication, automation and connectivity are considered promising measures to improve the ef/ficiency of Cargotec's customers' operations. The company has invested in software and digital businesses, as digitalisation is seen to make cargo handling more ef/ficient, and as there will be an increasing demand for ef/ficient solutions in the future. Digitalisation will also be a major enabler for a wider societal change towards a more circular economy. Data sharing, common platforms and collaboration act as key drivers in achieving these targets and connecting industries.\n\nOn the other hand, even though sustainable technologies are evolving and maturing rapidly, many uncertainties exist. Failing to invest in the right technology can result in increased indirect costs if the R&D investments are not realised. High demand for certain materials can also lead to increased direct costs. Steel prices are expected to increase due to more aggressive CO 2 taxation or because low-emission alternatives are more expensive to produce. As a result of the electri/fication trend, demand for lithium batteries is also expected to increase. Limited availability and the potential rise in steel and lithium battery prices pose a market risk as price increases can impact direct costs. In the case of more expensive low-carbon\n\nproducts, the customers' demand and willingness to pay may become more uncertain. Producing high-quality low-carbon technologies in a cost ef/ficient manner can be challenging; however, with its R&D and supply chain expertise, Cargotec aims to provide solutions that meet customer needs also in this respect.\n\nIn terms of the physical consequences of climate change, the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events is expected to increase. Cargotec is well positioned to develop intelligent solutions to improve the climate resilience of its customers' operations, which is seen as a great business opportunity. Automation, robotisation, digitalisation and remote services remove the need to be physically present. For instance, by automating port operations, Cargotec can help reduce safety risks and ensure business continuity during social distancing requirements.\n\nOn the other hand, business interruption is recognised as a potential risk, as Cargotec's business model is based on a multi-tier supply chain, which is more vulnerable in case of an extreme weather event. A major weather event in one region may impact suppliers, causing delays that trickle down and compromise timely deliveries to clients. This could impact the company's production capacity and revenues, making business continuity plans essential when mitigating such risks.\n\nThe scenarios, including associated risks and opportunities, have been discussed by the Cargotec Leadership Team (CLT). The results of the scenario analysis have directly in/fluenced the company strategy, of which the commitment to be a 1.5\u00b0C company is visible evidence. Since the commitment, Cargotec's business areas have been embedding the climate ambition in their business strategies.\n\n## Risk management\n\nCargotec has two processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks and opportunities. First, the general corporate risk management process (e.g. Enterprise Risk\n\nManagement, Business Continuity Planning) and second, a dedicated specialised climate-related risk management process. Due to the long time horizon of climate-related impacts and the broadness of risk assessments in corporate processes, Cargotec does not consider the corporate process to be fully suf/ficient to capture all material climate risks.\n\nIn the corporate risk management process, climate-related risks are assessed using the general approach of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. The ERM process includes both the assessment and the management of various broad-based business risks (e.g. market, competitor and /financial risks). Risks are identi/fied and discussed on business area and corporate levels. On a group level, risks informed by business areas are consolidated together with relevant group risks.\n\nCargotec also conducts Business Continuity Planning where, together with the insurer, a set of approximately /five facilities (mainly assembly sites) are evaluated on an annual basis, based on prioritisation and risk level. Assessments include matters such as supply chain risk, property damage and natural hazards. Business areas also have integrated management systems in place, including quality, health and safety, and environmental management systems. All of these systems include risk assessments on an asset level, including potential short-term impacts of climate change at the location.\n\nTo complement the general corporate risk management process, corporate sustainability and strategy teams have created a speci/fic climate-related risk management process. This process addresses climate-related opportunities in addition to the risks, and also provides a dedicated space for climate-related matters separate from other business risks and opportunities. While the ERM process focuses on direct operations, the speci/fic climate-related risk management process considers the full value chain.",

The company's business areas are responsible for validating the outcome and taking the process to a more detailed level as deemed necessary. This speci/fic climate-related risk management process is conducted as a part of the company's overall strategy process to ensure that a long-term time horizon is properly considered and suf/ficient actions are taken.\n\nSeveral risk types are considered in the climate-related risk management process, such as current regulation that affects both Cargotec's own and its customers' operations. For example, energy and emissions-related regulation can in/fluence raw material availability and prices. In addition, products must comply with noise and other pollution-related regulations, which affect customer operations. Cargotec sees climate related regulation as a business driver. The transition to a low-carbon economy will come with new regulations, such as those related to zero-emission vehicles and shipping, which can have a signi/ficant positive impact on Cargotec's business.\n\nTechnology-related risks are also considered central as Cargotec's low-carbon solutions are developed based on new and emerging technology. Electri/fication, automation and digitalisation play a key role in Cargotec's strategy, and they are all very dependent on technological improvements and seen as the main measures to improve ef/ficiency and reduce emissions. Market-related risks are always considered, as the demand for products and services is dependent on the surrounding conditions. For example, depending on the political conditions de/fining the market situation, the driver behind a customer decision can be costs or emissions. This can impact the overall demand for eco-ef/ficient low-carbon solutions. A high demand for low-emission products might also impact the availability and price of certain materials and components that are crucial in making new low-\n\nemission technologies. Cargotec also considers reputation increasingly important as customers and consumers have higher expectations towards the sustainability of the cargo handling industry. It is also important in terms of attracting and retaining talent.\n\nAcute and chronic physical risks are also deemed relevant. Extreme weather events are especially relevant for suppliers located in high risk areas. Of the chronic risks, sea level rise and increasing temperatures set new requirements for products as they may cause operating conditions to become more challenging. Extreme working conditions also increase risks related to health and safety.\n\nDuring acquisition and divestment cases, Cargotec conducts an environmental due diligence process to ensure that potential environmental risks are accounted for.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nFollowing Cargotec's commitment to the 1.5\u00b0C climate ambition, the company's greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target is set in line with the latest climate science. The target, validated by the Science Based Targets initiative, is to reduce GHG emissions in all three emission scopes by at least 50 percent by 2030 compared to a 2019 baseline. Setting an absolute emission reduction target for Cargotec's entire value chain means that engaging with suppliers and customers is crucial in order to reduce emissions from their operations.\n\nIn line with Cargotec's strategy, the company's climate target for 2021-2024 is to reduce CO 2 emissions by 1 million tonnes by 2024 compared to a 2019 baseline. To further build on this target, Cargotec introduced new strategic performance targets for its core businesses in November 2022, which, for the /first time, also include sustainability-related targets. The targets are to reduce emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030 and by 25 percent by 2025 (in line with the company's sciencebased climate target) and to double the sales growth of the\n\neco portfolio compared to traditional products. Embedding sustainability-related targets in Cargotec's performance targets demonstrates that sustainability is truly integrated into the company strategy. To achieve the targets, systematic transformation and focus on implementable, scalable and replicable business solutions around eco offerings, responsible sourcing, automatisation, robotics and data utilisation are needed.\n\nCargotec aims to achieve carbon neutrality in its own operations by 2030. The majority of Cargotec's own emissions originate from electricity consumption, and the company is committed to increasing the share of renewable electricity to 100 percent by 2030. Another big contributor is the fuel use of the company's service /fleet. In order to achieve carbon neutrality, the plan is to increase remote services and transition to low- or zero-emission vehicles. During the year, Cargotec updated its European car policy to begin the transition to only using zero-emission company cars and service vans in Europe. Country-speci/fic policies will consider the local infrastructure and availability of hybrid and electric vehicles.\n\nCargotec's biggest climate impact and, consequently, mitigation potential, lies in its value chain, as greenhouse gas emissions related to the use of sold products and purchased goods constitute more than 95 percent of the company's total emissions. Due to long product lifetimes and the use of diesel engines, emissions from the use of sold products are high. On the upstream side of the value chain, the manufacturing of steel structures for Cargotec's equipment is the biggest single contributor. Due to light assembly-only operations, the impact of Cargotec's own operations is relatively minor.\n\nTo drive Cargotec's climate ambition and emission reductions in practice, Cargotec focuses on decarbonising the supply chain and its own operations, while boosting the offering of customer-centric sustainable solutions. To enable this, the company has launched a development project focusing on",

During 2022, the focus was on decarbonising the supply chain and further developing Cargotec's sustainable offering, as they contribute to the most signi/ficant climate impacts. Much effort was put into improving Cargotec's climate data and the scope 3 calculation methodology. As a consequence of the methodology improvements, Cargotec's scope 3 emissions for 2019-2021 were restated, which resulted in a change in the baseline of the company's science-based climate target. A Supplier Decarbonisation Handbook was /finalised and distributed to Cargotec's suppliers. The Handbook provides guidance on how third parties can support Cargotec's journey in becoming net-zero in its operations.\n\nA top priority in 2022 was also to enable reporting in accordance with the EU Taxonomy regulation. The EU Taxonomy regulation considers manufacturing as a key sector in enabling emission reductions in other sectors of the economy. Cargotec has great potential in helping its customers to become low-carbon in their operations by providing technologies that are aimed at substantially reducing GHG emissions. Please see the following chapter for more information about the Disclosures pursuant to the Taxonomy regulation.\n\n## Disclosures pursuant to the EU Taxonomy regulation\n\nThe EU Taxonomy regulation establishes a classi/fication system to de/fine which economic activities are environmentally sustainable. The regulation applies to Cargotec and requires disclosure of the share of environmentally sustainable revenue, capital expenditures and operating expenditures.\n\nCargotec established its eco portfolio as early as in 2017 to highlight the solutions that enhance its customers' sustainability with tangible environmental bene/fits. The 2022 eco portfolio criteria revision supports the company's commitment to be a 1.5\u00b0C company.

Out of the six environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy, Cargotec considers its solutions to have the potential to substantially contribute to climate change mitigation and the transition to a circular economy (interpretation subject to review when remaining delegated act is published). Consequently, the eco portfolio consists of two categories: climate solutions and circular solutions. Cargotec's climate solutions are compatible with the greenhouse gas emission reductions needed in the 1.5\u00b0C scenario of the Paris Agreement, whereas the circular solutions contribute to the transition to a circular economy by promoting resource ef/ficiency throughout the value chain. Starting with this annual report, Cargotec will disclose the eco portfolio related metrics based on the new criteria. The sales of the eco portfolio consists of the revenue of climate solutions (equal to the KPI of the taxonomy-aligned revenue) and circular solutions (equal to the KPI of the revenue that Cargotec considers to support\n\nthe draft objective of transitioning to a circular economy). The eco portfolio sales totalled 1,288 MEUR, representing 31 percent of consolidated sales.\n\n## Interpretation of eligibility\n\nThe EU Taxonomy refers to so-called NACE codes as indicative guidance to determine the taxonomy-eligibility of a company's economic activities. The NACE codes relevant to Cargotec's economic activities of equipment, service and software are C28 Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c., C33 Repair and installation of machinery and equipment and J62 Computer programming, consultancy and related activities. The respective activities in the EU Taxonomy are: 3.3 Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport, 3.6 Manufacture of other low carbon technologies, 6.12 Retro/fitting of sea and coastal freight and passenger water transport and 8.2. Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions. These activities were all considered eligible",

The assessment was conducted on a high level, based on the NACE codes, with the respective activities taken into consideration. Based on this interpretation, Cargotec reported 100 percent eligibility.\n\nIn 2022, Cargotec's eligibility was reassessed with a different approach, giving less emphasis to the NACE codes and paying particular attention to the description of the activity. As a result, the company's interpretation of relevant taxonomy categories changed. Due to the increased availability of information and the company's improved understanding of the EU Taxonomy, changes occurred in the codes where Cargotec considers its activities eligible under. Cargotec's equipment is intended to be used in the transportation value chain, but, in terms of EU Taxonomy activities, the equipment can fall into 3.3 or 3.6, depending on whether it is considered a road vehicle or non-road mobile machinery. The Taxonomy activity 3.3 Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport is currently not directly applicable to non-road mobile machinery and therefore Cargotec's equipment are reported under activity 3.6 Manufacture of other low carbon technologies. Activity 8.2. Datadriven solutions for GHG emissions reductions is also reported under activity 3.6 as the solutions relate to sold equipment.\n\nCargotec's services will be reported under activity 2.10 Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing, and sale of spare parts, which fall under both the climate change mitigation objective and the transitioning to a circular economy objective. Services will also be reported under activity 6.12 Retro/fitting of sea and coastal freight and passenger water transport, which fall under the objective of transitioning to a circular economy. As the transitioning to a circular economy objective is not yet /finalised, it is not applicable, and therefore Cargotec does not report any taxonomy-related KPIs for its services in 2022. As a result, Cargotec reports an eligibility of 63 percent in 2022.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy regulation considers the transportation and manufacturing industries high-emitting sectors in the objective for climate change mitigation. Although Cargotec does not directly operate in these sectors, they are industries where Cargotec's solutions enable its customers to perform their activities. Due to this, Cargotec considers its activities eligible within these sectors and the climate change mitigation objective under EU Taxonomy activity 3.6 Manufacture of other low carbon technologies. When considering the eligibility of its solutions, Cargotec has chosen to focus on the performance provided by its equipment instead of the technology applied to it. In Cargotec's view, the equipment's technology per se has no value, but the value comes from the performance of the equipment.\n\n## Assessment of alignment\n\nIn order for an economic activity to be considered taxonomyaligned, it shall meet the criteria of substantial contribution, do no signi/ficant harm (DNSH) and comply with minimum safeguards. Substantial contribution is assessed on a product level, whereas the DNSH criteria and minimum safeguards are assessed on Cargotec group level. Cargotec's activities that meet all of the Taxonomy criteria (substantial contribution, DNSH, and minimum safeguards) are considered sustainable, i.e. taxonomy-aligned.\n\nCargotec has analysed the potential impacts its eco portfolio solutions, which can signi/ficantly contribute to the climate change objectives of the EU Taxonomy, may have on the /five other environmental objectives. Based on this analysis, Cargotec has concluded that its activities do not cause signi/ficant harm to water and marine resources, as no process water is used at Cargotec's assembly sites. Similarly, Cargotec's assembly operations do not cause signi/ficant emissions to air, water or soil that would have the potential to cause signi/ficant harm to biodiversity and ecosystems. In addition, solutions considered for the eco portfolio must ful/fil speci/fic DNSH criteria that require climate risk and\n\nvulnerability assessments, promote circularity and ban the use of harmful substances.\n\nWhile Cargotec's environmental impacts beyond climate and circularity are minimal, the company has comprehensive management processes in place that cover various environmental topics, such as waste management and pollution. These processes are mainly implemented through ISO 14001-certi/fied environmental management systems. The management systems require that Cargotec assesses and addresses the potential and actual impacts of its activities, products and services on the environment. If negative impacts are identi/fied, appropriate controls and improvement plans, including relevant target setting, are implemented and maintained. This helps Cargotec ensure its activities do no signi/ficant harm to the environment.\n\nCargotec has also performed an internal analysis of its policies and processes and believes it complies with the principles of each of the EU Taxonomy's minimum safeguards. Cargotec has implemented procedures to ensure alignment with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Declaration of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights. Cargotec's Code of Conduct and related policies set the foundation for responsible business conduct, and processes supporting the principles have been developed and implemented. Detailed descriptions of these policies and processes are available throughout this Disclosure.\n\n## Climate solutions\n\nCargotec's climate solutions consist of (new) equipment and service (limited to maintenance and wearable spare parts, i.e. what is not in scope of service in circular solutions) and are all considered enabling activities under the climate change mitigation objective.",

Since the technical screening criteria leaves room for interpretation, Cargotec leans on its 1.5\u00b0C climate ambition when setting the ambition level and de/fining which products meet the screening criteria. Cargotec's interpretation has also been in/fluenced by the criteria for activity 3.3 Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport as Cargotec's equipment is similar to transport vehicles, especially vehicles in categories N2 and N3. The technical screening criteria for N2 and N3 vehicles states that zero-emission and low-emission heavyduty vehicles are considered taxonomy-aligned (given that certain additional requirements are met). Cargotec considers zero-emission and low-emission equipment as taxonomyaligned. Since the Taxonomy's de/finitions are not directly applicable to Cargotec's equipment, Cargotec uses slightly modi/fied versions of the de/finitions given in the regulation (EU) 2019/1242 on CO 2 emission performance standards for new heavy-duty vehicles.\n\nTo prove the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, Cargotec conducts product life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to prove life cycle greenhouse gas emission savings. The LCAs compare the company's zero-emission or low-emission equipment to the best performing alternative, which typically is a diesel-powered version of the same equipment with the same functionality and capacity. The LCA studies are conducted for equipment that is considered representative of the entire product group, so that the results can be generalised. The studies follow the ISO 14067 standard and have been reviewed by an independent third party. The results indicate that the use of zero-emission equipment brings higher emission reductions than the required threshold (42%) for low-emission equipment.\n\n## Turnover, capex and opex\n\nCargotec discloses the proportion of environmentally sustainable economic activities that align with the EU\n\nTaxonomy criteria using the turnover, capital expenditures (capex) and operating expenditures (opex) KPIs.\n\n- \u00b7  The turnover KPI represents the proportion of the net turnover derived from products or services that are taxonomy-aligned.\n- \u00b7  The capital expenditures KPI represents the proportion of the capital expenditure of an activity that is either already taxonomy-aligned or is part of a credible plan to extend or reach taxonomy alignment.\n- \u00b7  The operating expenditures KPI represents the proportion of the operating expenditure associated with taxonomyaligned activities or to the capex plan. The opex covers direct non-capitalised costs relating to research and development, renovation measures, short-term lease, maintenance and other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective use of such assets.\n\nThe proportion of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-noneligible economic activities, as well as taxonomy-aligned and taxonomy-non-aligned economic activities in the total turnover, capex and opex are presented below in tables 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. Turnover consists of revenues recognised from sales of products and services sold net of sales taxes, discounts and translation differences from foreign currency denominated revenues, pursuant to IFRS. Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures consist of additions to tangible and intangible assets, including right-of-use assets related to leases, considered before depreciation, amortisation and any re-measurements, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, for the relevant /financial year and excluding fair value changes. Additionally, taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures include the corresponding additions resulting from business combinations. Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditures consist of direct non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair, and /fixed costs\n\ndirectly related to the servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment.\n\nTo the extent the capital and operating expenditures relate to assets and processes that are associated with taxonomyeligible activities such as manufacturing, provision of services, or R&D, they are considered taxonomy eligible. The taxonomy-aligned portion of capital and operating expenditures associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities are estimated by using the ratio of aligned turnover in comparison to the eligible turnover as the allocation key. This is because typically these expenditures cannot be allocated clearly to a single activity. No expenditure has been reported as taxonomy-aligned based on a capex plan.\n\nRegarding the disclosed amounts, double counting has been avoided by taking the following precautions:\n\n- \u00b7  Turnover related to each aligned activity is based on reported external revenue, and presented as relevant under single contribution criteria and taxonomy activity.\n- \u00b7  Capital expenditure related to aligned activities is based on /financial reporting compiled from entities having relevant activities. Taxonomy-aligned capex is presented based on estimation under single contribution criteria and taxonomy activity.\n- \u00b7  Operating expenditure related to aligned activities is based on /financial reporting compiled from entities having relevant activities. Taxonomy-aligned opex is presented based on estimation under single contribution criteria and taxonomy activity.",

Safety covers Cargotec's employees, suppliers and subcontractors, as well as safety related to the usage of the company's products and services.\n\n## Governance\n\nCargotec is committed to full compliance with all applicable national and international laws and regulations. Cargotec values transparency, supports business integrity and recognises that economic, environmental and social performance together form the basis for endorsing sustainability in its business operations. The main international codes Cargotec supports are United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, UN Global Compact, International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and OECD's Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nCargotec's Code of Conduct sets the company's social objectives. Cargotec respects human rights and values employee engagement, diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities. Cargotec's Employment policy, complementing the Cargotec Code of Conduct, de/fines the company's basic employment principles and workplace practices. Compliance with the Code of Conduct is expected of all Cargotec employees as it describes the mission, goals and development process speci/fic to human resources. The Employment policy applies to all Cargotec employees worldwide and its enforcement is subject to local legislation. As a global policy, it applies to all locations and conditions where Cargotec conducts business.\n\nCargotec promotes high safety levels and continuously works towards zero accidents in its operations and also through its products, services and solutions. Health & Safety (HS) management is a fundamental element of sustainable\n\noperations, supporting Cargotec's commitment to minimise the risk of injury and ill health at the workplace. It also ensures protection, so far as is reasonably practicable, for persons not employed by the company who may be affected by its activities. HS management is a set of practices through which Cargotec develops and implements its HS work and manages aspects and risks in that area. As stipulated in Cargotec's Code of Conduct, the company encourages its employees to report unsafe conditions and safety incidents, and to take appropriate action to remedy and learn from those situations. Cargotec promotes awareness of safe behaviour and best practices, and prioritises safety even with time, cost or customer pressure. All employees are trained to work in a safe manner. Interaction between management and staff is promoted by collaborating with personnel on group and country level.\n\nCargotec supports social dialogue within the company. All employees have the right to join a trade union of their choice and to bargain collectively. Cargotec ensures that employee representatives are not subject to discrimination and have access to their fellow employees.\n\nAt Cargotec, cooperation between management and personnel is based on local legislation and organised on group and country level. The Cargotec Personnel Meeting in Europe promotes interaction between management and staff and enhances relationships between personnel in different business areas.\n\nIn 2022, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) was identi/fied as a key element of Cargotec's strategy implementation. During the year, a leader was appointed to drive the development, implementation and monitoring of the topic. Diversity is a driver for creativity, /flexibility, productivity, innovation and growth, as it acts as an incentive for individuals to fully reveal their knowledge, competences and skills. By promoting diversity, Cargotec strives to create a better social climate and overall environment of acceptance\n\nand inclusion. The company is committed to ensuring equal opportunity and a non-discriminatory work environment in its employment policies, procedures and practices, regardless of gender, race, religion, nationality, age or physical ability or any other such characteristic. Cargotec has zero tolerance for harassment in all its forms - be it verbal, physical or sexual. The company does not act partially, nor does it support political parties or religious groups.\n\n## Strategy\n\nCargotec deems occupational health and safety risks as material to its employees. As a knowledge and engineering company, Cargotec also considers human capital-related risks, such as attracting and retaining talent.\n\nCargotec is dedicated to safeguarding the health and safety of employees at work. Employees have the responsibility to protect themselves, their colleagues, the work site, community and environment by reporting unacceptable health or safety conditions, taking preventive measures and minimising potential damages. As a technology leader, Cargotec develops innovative systems and related services that meet the individual needs of its customers. Through product development and quality assurance, the company strives to minimise health and safety risks related to the use of its products and services.\n\nCargotec believes its people are key in creating customer value through innovation, experimenting, lifelong learning and development as well as adopting new skills and competences in a complex and ever-changing world. Skills that are considered relevant today may not be relevant tomorrow.\n\nIn broad terms, the purpose of people development at Cargotec is to ensure that the company has the necessary capabilities, skills, competences, knowledge and attitudes to achieve its organisational goals and for people to personally develop as individuals. To ensure continuous development,",

Cargotec's Talent Review process focuses on evaluating and developing its present leaders, ensuring succession of leaders, planning for successors' development and identifying future leaders and planning for their development.\n\nCargotec's reward strategy is based on a pay-for-performance approach. Regardless of country, business or task, attracting, retaining and motivating talent by linking rewards to business and individual performance is encouraged. Cargotec's reward strategy is characterised by /five key principles:\n\n- 1.  Align total compensation funding with strategic and business plans\n- 2.  Reinforce a high-performing culture\n- 3.  Promote pay-for-performance differentiation\n- 4.  Balance shareholder and employee needs\n- 5.  Enhance ability to attract, retain, and motivate a diverse group of talented individuals.\n\nIn addition to adequate and fair remuneration, suf/ficient development opportunities, an ef/ficient talent review process and a smooth onboarding process can also have a positive impact on productivity, wellbeing and employee retention. The success of the employee onboarding process depends on its ef/ficiency. The quicker employees are empowered to do their jobs, the faster they become valuable, contributing members of the organisation. Therefore, the onboarding process and practices are continuously developed in order to offer new (and returning) employees a good employee experience and a positive impression of the company.\n\nCOVID-19 has changed the way of working at Cargotec, which has required resilience and modi/fication of existing\n\npolicies and practices. Hybrid working has become part of the new normal and the requirements on of/fice premises have changed. For example, increased remote work has led to adjustments in Cargotec's global and local remote work policies. Also the war in Ukraine has impacted our personnel. Health and safety practices across the organisation have been adjusted with more attention being given to the mental wellbeing of employees.\n\n## Risk management\n\nCargotec's risk management activities are divided into segments, with responsibilities distributed to the appropriate corporate functions. The responsibility for the safety of employees lies within human resources. To secure a safe working environment for all employees, occupational health and safety issues are continuously developed. Health and safety programmes include, for example, various types of training, health and safety practice development, audits and target follow-ups. Cargotec's assembly sites have implemented safety management systems, wherein safety risks, safety compliance and related mitigation actions are de/fined.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nCargotec's safety performance is monitored primarily with the industrial injury frequency trend (IIFR, number of injuries per million hours worked). Cargotec's safety target for 2022 was to have an IIFR rate below 5 across the whole organisation. In 2022, Cargotec's IIFR improved and was 4.8 (2021: 6.0), meaning the target was achieved. The IIFR improved at both the assembly sites 5.7 (7.3) and at the non-assembly sites 4.3 (5.3). Cargotec's safety /figures cover the company's own employees and external contractors, excluding subcontractors due to missing information on working hours. Cargotec's goal for 2023 is to have an IIFR below 4.0. Key actions in pursuing this goal include introducing new software for reporting and managing safety-related risks and measures, as well as launching a global programme on behaviour-based safety and strengthened safety processes.\n\nCargotec's employee engagement survey Compass is used to encourage all employees to share their thoughts on a wide range of topics, ranging from work-life balance, wellbeing, and social responsibility to leadership and team climate. By learning what employees share about their business area, organisation, leaders and colleagues, appropriate actions can be taken to create a better working environment for everyone. The 2022 survey completion rate was 75 percent (2021: 76). The survey consisted of a total of 42 scaled questions and one open-ended one. The Team Climate index and the Sustainability index were the categories with the highest scores, both reaching a favourability of 82 percent (2021: 82 and 81). In addition to the Compass survey, Cargotec runs a monthly People Pulse survey. The survey is a great opportunity for the HR team to collect feedback from the organisation on a regular basis. Based on the survey results, discussions and actions can be initiated as needed. The Pulse survey also enables managers to listen to their employees.\n\nMoreover, people analytics are continuously developed to better support different processes and to achieve desired outcomes and targets. Pivotal HR dashboards and metrics are provided for HR Business Partners to support them in their decision-making and planning.",

The company's human rights work is based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and is guided by Cargotec's Code of Conduct and its associated policies and guidelines. The Code of Conduct lists the main international codes the company supports: UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UN Global Compact, International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and OECD's Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. All partners are required to adhere to similar principles.\n\nAs a topic, human rights is coordinated by Cargotec's ethics and compliance and sustainability teams. Cargotec HR manages employment principles and workplace practices within the organisation. The principles are de/fined in\n\nCargotec's Employment policy. The company's Business Partner Code of Conduct requires all suppliers to conduct their business in compliance with international human rights and environmental laws and practices. The Business Partner Code of Conduct covers not only suppliers but also other third parties.\n\nCargotec's ethics and compliance team reports regularly to Cargotec's Board of Directors' (BoD) Audit & Risk Committee on the subject of compliance in all areas mentioned in the Code of Conduct, including possible risks related to human rights. The company's human rights risk assessment and its implementation are carried out in cooperation with business areas and several functions, such as Human Resources, Ethics and Compliance, and Mergers and Acquisitions.\n\n## Strategy\n\nIn addition to occupational health and safety, Cargotec considers human rights a material social topic. Human rightsrelated risks are considered biggest within the company's supply chain due to its complexity and global reach.\n\nCargotec's own operations are managed with relevant safety and HR policies, processes and follow-up tools that aim to mitigate the risk of non-compliance. Code of Conduct e-learning is mandatory for all Cargotec employees, and a speci/fic human rights section is included in the Code.\n\nCargotec has identi/fied that its most signi/ficant human rights risks exist in the supply chain and business partner operations. Health and safety, freedom of association as well as prohibition of child and forced labour are examples of the basic principles Cargotec demands from its Business Partners. In addition, mergers and acquisitions are identi/fied as potential areas for human rights risks. In 2019, the mergers and acquisition process was developed to ensure that human rights risks can be identi/fied with better accuracy.\n\n## Risk management\n\nHuman rights risks are managed as part of Cargotec's compliance programme. Compliance risk management is based on a prevent-detect-respond approach. Risks are assessed regularly and reported to Cargotec's BoD's Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nCargotec's human rights work focuses on identifying and mitigating any risks of breaching international human rights within the value chain. The main policies and processes supporting the programme are the Business Partner Code of Conduct, the supplier approval process, onsite audits and the SpeakUp line. More information about the SpeakUp line is found in the ethics and compliance section.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nDuring Cargotec's supplier approval process, which follows a risk-based approach, new suppliers must meet prerequirements and pass an audit conducted by Cargotec. The pre-requirements include committing to Cargotec's Business Partner Code of Conduct, a risk assessment conducted by Cargotec and a supplier self-assessment in a thirdparty platform. The supplier audit focuses on the suppliers' compliance with management of labour and human rights, anti-corruption and the environment. Approximately 20 percent of the questions in the supplier audit checklist are related to sustainability topics.\n\nDuring 2022, Cargotec kicked-off a comprehensive human rights due diligence programme covering all Cargotec business areas and functions. As a /first step, a human rights impact assessment was initiated to identify adverse impacts on people in Cargotec's value chain. The due diligence programme will continue in 2023 and focus on preventing, mitigating and remedying Cargotec's salient human rights issues.\n\n## Ethics and compliance\n\nCargotec conducts business in a complex global environment and the industry is exposed to ethics and compliance risks",

The purpose of the compliance programme is to support Cargotec, the CEO and the Board of Directors in ensuring that compliance risks are managed effectively and consistently throughout the organisation.\n\nThe company's Code of Conduct sets the foundation for how business is done at Cargotec - always in line with the highest ethical standards. The Code of Conduct sets out /five important principles: 'we follow laws and company policies'', 'we act with respect', 'we are honest', 'we are responsible for our actions' and 'we speak up'. The Code is available in 20 languages. In 2022, Cargotec introduced a new Groupwide Code of Conduct e-learning course focusing on three areas - con/flicts of interest, health and safety, and workplace environment.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance (E&C) function at Cargotec reports directly to the CEO and the Audit and Risk Management Committee of the Cargotec Board of Directors' (BoD). The BoD receives an annual update from the Chief Compliance Of/ficer. In addition, the Audit and Risk Management Committee of the BoD receives regular updates on all new investigations, anti-corruption activities and other Code of Conduct matters during the year. The Cargotec Leadership Team also has a Code of Conduct panel, chaired by the CEO, where compliance topics are communicated and discussed on a bi-monthly basis. The Code of Conduct is approved by the BoD and de/fines the ethical standards that directors and employees must follow.\n\nThe Cargotec Anti-Corruption Policy, Gift and Hospitality Instruction, Con/flict of Interest Instruction, SpeakUp and Non-Retaliation Instruction, as well as the Third Party Policy guide Cargotec's compliance efforts against unethical or corrupt business practices. The practical implementation of these policies, as well as related instructions, are guided by the compliance programme whose main principles include detecting, preventing and responding to potential misconduct. The main pillars of the compliance programme are: 1) Risk Assessment; 2) Policies, Procedures and Controls; 3) Training, Communication and Advice; 4) Concern Reporting & Resolution; 5) Monitoring; and 6) Tone from the Top and Oversight. The Cargotec SpeakUp line is an externally hosted reporting tool for reporting potential Code of Conduct violations. It enables anonymous reporting and can be accessed by both internal and external stakeholders. In addition, the ethics and compliance team receives direct reporting from managers and the line organisation. All reported cases are evaluated con/fidentially and investigated according to the Code of Conduct response process. In proven cases, the Code of Conduct panel of Cargotec's Leadership Team reviews the need for possible disciplinary and remedial measures.\n\n## Strategy and Risk Management\n\nCargotec continues to build and implement a robust riskbased compliance programme to ensure that compliance risks are managed effectively and consistently throughout the organisation. The company conducts annual compliance risk assessments in all of its business areas. Third-party risk management continued to be a priority in 2022 and related scope, processes and procedures were further strengthened, with focus on third parties in sales (agents, dealers) and high-risk suppliers. Further awareness and controls around con/flicts of interest was also prioritised. For example, the company's Con/flicts of Interest Instruction was renewed to ensure that con/flicts are handled in an ef/ficient and transparent manner, and the topic was chosen as one of the three key areas in the annual Code of Conduct e-learning course for all employees. A key focus area in 2022 was also to\n\nfurther improve the process around trade sanctions screening and the export controls compliance programme, as well as the continuous effective handling of compliance cases.\n\nCargotec's business areas, as per the risk-based compliance programme, focused on speci/fic areas of compliance during the year. A new initiative for the Kalmar's Ethics and Compliance function in 2022 was the introduction of inperson site visits. These visits feature dedicated and tailored risk and compliance discussions with the relevant site and/ or organisational leadership teams; training sessions for high-risk employee populations, including sales teams and line managers; and numerous meetings with key personnel and staff. When possible, visits to key sales third parties (i.e., dealers and/or agents) and customers are included in these visits.\n\nIn 2022, Kalmar's E&C function conducted /five full site visits. In addition to site visits, the function was prominently featured in a number of regional dealer conferences, which pulled together sales third parties (dealers and agents) from around the respective regions to engage on a range of business topics. The participation of Kalmar's E&C in these events raises the importance and awareness of ethics and compliance to Kalmar among this critically important but highrisk stakeholder group. This also complements the ongoing screening, evaluation and consultative work that Kalmar E&C provides throughout the year on sales third parties issues and other matters.\n\nIn 2022, Hiab's Leadership Team reaf/firmed its commitment to ethics and compliance, showing clear leadership on how employees should handle challenging business situations. This commitment has been cascaded to employees and is used in real life problem solving. A training initiative by Hiab's E&C function shared dilemmas and examples around every sales of/fice in Hiab, ensuring management teams remain highly aware of ethics issues and how best to respond to them. Heightened awareness and engagement has been prioritised throughout 2022 for sales third parties. Based on",

As a key member of the MacGregor Deal Review Board, the MacGregor E&C function played a key role in improving the Deal Review process for high-risk projects. A key focus and improvement area in 2022 was strengthening the MacGregor Export Compliance Program. Extensive training, in person and virtually, was provided to management and operations, together with updates on controls, policies and communications.\n\nIn 2022, the Cargotec Ethics and Compliance function continued with several targeted education and awareness efforts around areas where compliance risk has been identi/fied. In particular, workshops and training sessions, both in person and online, were held with key risk groups and stakeholders across the company. In addition to anticorruption-related topics, the focus of the sessions has been on third-party risk, con/flict of interest, trade sanctions and export controls as well as fraud. The E&C function provided in-person and online training to management, sales, IT, HR and project teams at locations in Europe, MEA, APAC, and the Americas. As part of the third-party risk management process, training Cargotec's high-risk third parties on key ethics and compliance matters, including anti-corruption, was also organised.\n\nIn June 2019, the National Bureau of Investigation in Finland reported that it has been working on a preliminary investigation about a suspected aggravated fraud in connection to the MacGregor business area of Cargotec. The suspected /financial fraud was detected by Cargotec in an internal review and the investigation request was made to the National Bureau of Investigation. In 2020, the District Attorney pressed charges against former employees of MacGregor. The case hearing took place in early 2021, and the verdict\n\nwas rendered by the District Court of Turku on March 8, 2022, awarding criminal liability for three defendants and /financial compensation for Cargotec and MacGregor. The case has been appealed and the hearing in the Turku Appellate Court will take place in 2023. Cargotec has a zero tolerance policy for misconduct, and is fully supporting the judicial process. Neither MacGregor nor Cargotec are suspected of criminal actions.\n\nIn 2022, Cargotec and its subsidiary MacGregor USA, Inc. made a voluntary self-disclosure to US authorities regarding compliance with certain export regulations related to information management in the context of MacGregor's US Government business. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined with speci/ficity at this point in time. In order to be prudent, Cargotec has made a provision of approximately EUR 18 million to cover possible consequences. The provision was booked as an item affecting comparability in the third quarter of 2022. The amount of the possible penalty is yet to be con/firmed; hence the /final costs related to the process may change. The company is committed to cooperating with applicable authorities in resolving the matter and will make further disclosures as appropriate.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nDuring 2022, 93 reports (2021: 60 reports) of alleged misconduct were made to the Cargotec Ethics and Compliance (E&C) team. E&C decided to open an investigation in 31 cases (2021: 23). The cases were referred to the Code of Conduct Panel of the Cargotec Leadership Team. The Code of Conduct Panel decides upon case closure, remediation and disciplinary action. In 2022, nine (2021: 6) cases concerned HR-issues, /five (2021: 11) cases related to possible con/flict of interest issues and two to export control issues. A disclosure was made regarding an export control issue in the company's third interim 2022 report. Other cases were related to unethical business conduct such as fraud, corruption or policy violations. There were no cases related to environmental grievances, human rights nor privacy matters. During the year, a total of 26 investigations were completed\n\nand improvement actions were initiated. In 73 percent of the completed cases (in 2021: 73%), the allegations were substantiated at least partly with some cases resulting in disciplinary actions, such as warnings and personnel dismissals, and other remedial measures, such as policy and process improvements.\n\nThe investigations were reported to the Board of Directors' Audit and Risk Management Committee on a quarterly basis, and the Chief Compliance Of/ficer provided an annual update to the full Board of Directors. As part of the investigation process, the Cargotec Ethics and Compliance function agrees with relevant business area management team members on remedial actions, such as improved controls, training, disciplinary actions or termination of third-party relationships. The /final decision on disciplinary actions is made by the Code of Conduct Panel.\n\nTo further understand employee views on Cargotec's ethical practices, Code of Conduct-related questions in the 2022 Compass Employee Engagement survey were analysed. According to the results, 83 percent of respondents consider Cargotec an ethical company (2021: 82%). The Code of Conduct is a key step towards a more sustainable future and a benchmark for ethical behaviour within the company, and the annual Code of Conduct e-learning is aimed to educate Cargotec's employees on the company's high ethical standards. The e-learning course consists of exercises that help employees with their day-to-day dilemmas around ethics and compliance, and it is available in 20 languages. The target group of the e-learning course includes employees with an individual company email address and access to the company intranet. In 2022, the Code of Conduct training was completed by 92 percent of Cargotec employees (2021: 84%). The training completion rate covers employees who were employed by Cargotec at the launch of the training in September and remained employees by the year's end. In addition, onsite training workshops were arranged for employees without an email address or access to the intranet.",

Cargotec's internal control is based on the Company's Code of Conduct and Internal Controls Framework. With respect to the /financial reporting process, these are supported by policies and guidelines, as well as with the internal /financial reporting process and communication. Cargotec's Internal control policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors, speci/fies the applicable control principles, procedures and responsibilities. Similarly to other Cargotec operations, responsibility for internal control is divided into three tiers. The line management is principally responsible for internal control. This is backed by corporate support functions, which de/fine instructions applicable across the Company and supervise risk management. Internal and external audits form the third tier, their task being to ensure that the /first two tiers function effectively.\n\nThe role of Cargotec Internal Audit is an independent and objective assurance and consulting activity that is guided by a philosophy of adding value and improving the operations of Cargotec and its businesses. It helps and supports the business organisation to accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. To ensure the independence of the Internal Audit function, the Head of Internal Audit reports functionally to the Audit and Risk Management Committee, and administratively to the CFO. Internal Audit develops a /flexible risk based audit plan which is approved by the Audit and Risk Management Committee.\n\nCargotec's risk management is guided by the Enterprise risk management policy, approved by the Board of Directors. It speci/fies the objectives and principles of risk management as well as the process and responsibilities involved. Risk management is to be naturally built into all business decisions\n\nand plans. The core principle is continuous, systematic and preventive action taken to identify risks, de/fine the Company's risk appetite, assess and handle risks and, if they materialise, deal with them effectively.\n\nThe Board of Directors de/fines the overall risk appetite of the Company and ensures that the organisation has suf/ficient risk management and control. The CEO and the Leadership Team are responsible for the methods, implementation and supervision of risk management. Cargotec's risk management is spread across units and corporate support functions that assign responsibility for risk management and that are in charge of identifying, managing and reporting risks. The Risk Management function is responsible for reporting any /findings to the CEO and Leadership Team, and reports quarterly to the Board's Audit and Risk Management Committee on the risk reviews, identi/fied risks and mitigation plans.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are identi/fied and assessed with the help of the general corporate risk management process as well as a dedicated climaterelated risk management process, created by the corporate sustainability and strategy teams. The process is described in the Board of Directors report.\n\nFinancial risks are managed centrally by the Corporate Treasury and reported on for corporate management and the Audit and Risk Management Committee on a regular basis. The Board of Directors' report includes an estimate on the Company's main risks and uncertainties and short-term risks.\n\n## Board of Directors and Leadership Team\n\nOn 27 April 2022, Cargotec Corporation's Board of Directors elected by the Annual General Meeting on 17 March 2022, announced the appointment of Jaakko Eskola as the new Chair of the Board. Jaakko Eskola succeeds Mr. Ilkka Herlin who had chosen to step down as the Chair of the Board, having served as Chair for 17 years since 2005. The change took effect immediately. Ilkka Herlin continues as a member of the Board and as the Vice Chair.\n\nOn 20 December 2022, Cargotec announced that Cargotec CEO Mika Vehvil\u00e4inen has informed Cargotec's Board of Directors of his intention to retire from Cargotec during 2023, in accordance with the terms of his CEO service contract. The Board has initiated a search for a successor.\n\nOn 31 December 2022, Cargotec's Leadership Team consisted of Mika Vehvil\u00e4inen, CEO; Mikko Puolakka, Executive Vice President, CFO; Mikko Pelkonen, Senior Vice President, Human Resources; Mikael Laine, Senior Vice President, Strategy; Soili M\u00e4kinen, CIO, as of 1 January 2023 Senior Vice President, Sustainable Business Development; Outi Aaltonen, General Counsel; Carina Geber-Teir, Senior Vice President, Communications; Michel van Roozendaal, President, Kalmar; Scott Phillips, President, Hiab; and Leif Bystr\u00f6m, President, MacGregor.\n\n## Reporting segments Kalmar\n\nKalmar's orders received in 2022 increased slightly and totalled EUR 2,081 (2,063) million. Kalmar's order book increased by 10 percent from the end of 2021, totalling EUR 1,428 (31 Dec 2021: 1,302) million at the end of the year 2022.\n\nKalmar sales in 2022 increased by 28 percent from the comparison period and totalled EUR 1,943 (1,512) million. Service sales increased by 18 percent and totalled EUR 551 (468) million, representing 28 (31) percent of sales.\n\nKalmar's operating pro/fit in 2022 totalled EUR 142 (345) million. The operating pro/fit includes EUR -48 (224) million in items affecting comparability. Of the items affecting comparability, EUR -36 million were related to the decision to transfer the heavy crane immaterial rights to Rainbow Industries Co. Ltd. (RIC) in China and to the plan to exit the heavy cranes business. The comparable operating pro/fit amounted to EUR 190 (120) million, representing 9.8 (7.9) percent of sales. The comparable operating pro/fit increased due to higher sales.",

Hiab's comparable operating pro/fit increased due to higher sales.\n\n## MacGregor\n\nMacGregor's orders received in 2022 increased by 50 percent and totalled EUR 976 (652) million.\n\nMacGregor's order book increased by 65 percent from the end of 2021, totalling EUR 927 (31 Dec 2021: 560) million at the end of the year 2022. Of the order book, around four /fifths relate to merchant ships and one /fifth to the offshore sector.\n\nMacGregor's sales in 2022 increased by 3 percent and totalled EUR 569 (553) million. Service sales increased by 17 percent and totalled EUR 301 (257) million, representing 53 (47) percent of sales.\n\nMacGregor's operating pro/fit in 2022 totalled EUR -190 (-40) million. The operating pro/fit includes EUR -154 (-25) million in items affecting comparability. The comparable operating pro/fit amounted to EUR -36 (-15) million, representing -6.3 (-2.7) percent of sales. Comparable operating pro/fit decreased due to cost overruns in projects related to new technologies in the offshore business.\n\nAs part of its refocused strategy announced in March, Cargotec initiated an evaluation of the strategic options of MacGregor, which was completed in November. Based on the evaluation, Cargotec's Board of Directors concluded that MacGregor will not be part of Cargotec's portfolio in the future. During the strategic evaluation, it became clear that there is considerable interest in MacGregor. However, from a value creation perspective, the timing for divesting the business is not ideal at the moment. This is due to the current uncertainty in the /financial market combined with the early phase of MacGregor turnaround. Hence, Cargotec decided not to initiate an active sales process. Cargotec's Board of Directors continues to evaluate the timing of the divestment. MacGregor will focus on improving the pro/fitability of the business and has started restructurings in its unpro/fitable offshore business.\n\nCargotec has also reviewed MacGregor's offering, ongoing projects and growth estimates. Based on the review, the company plans to discontinue the business activities related to /fishery and research vessels as well as offshore mooring solutions. In the fourth quarter, a EUR 63 million write-down was made to the MacGregor goodwill, which was recorded as an item affecting comparability in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn addition, Cargotec booked a total of EUR 37 million restructuring costs in MacGregor's fourth quarter, which include a EUR 25 million write-down of intangible assets and a EUR 3 million write-down of other assets. Furthermore, Cargotec recorded a total of EUR 24 million loss in its fourth quarter comparable operating pro/fit from cost overruns\n\nand risk provisions in relation to ongoing offshore business projects.\n\nThe development of wind power-related new technologies as well as projects related to those technologies have been challenging and caused additional costs. As such, however, offshore wind power constitutes a very attractive business opportunity. Despite low sales, MacGregor's business in the merchant ship segment and service business has been pro/fitable. Excluding the offshore wind business, MacGregor's comparable operating pro/fit margin in 2022 would have been around 3 percent.\n\n## Decisions taken at the Annual General Meeting\n\nCargotec Corporation's Annual General Meeting was held on 17 March 2022 in Helsinki, Finland. The Annual General Meeting approved a distribution of a dividend of EUR 1.07 for each of class A shares and a dividend of EUR 1.08 for each outstanding class B shares. The dividend was paid to shareholders who on the record date of dividend distribution, 21 March 2022, were registered as shareholders in the company's shareholder register. The dividend payment day was 28 March 2022.\n\nThe meeting adopted the /financial statements and consolidated /financial statements and approved the remuneration report. The meeting granted discharge from liability to the CEO and the members of the Board of Directors for the /financial year 1 January-31 December 2021.\n\nThe number of the Board members was con/firmed at eight. The current Board members Jaakko Eskola, Ilkka Herlin, Teresa Kemppi-Vasama, Johanna Lamminen, Casimir Lindholm, Kaisa Olkkonen, Teuvo Salminen and Heikki Soljama were re-elected to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe yearly remuneration of the Board of Directors was con/firmed as follows: EUR 95,000 will be paid to the Chairman of the Board, EUR 70,000 to the Vice Chairman, EUR 70,000 to the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Management",

Altogether no more than 6,400,000 shares in the company may be purchased and/or accepted as pledge, of which no more than 952,000 are class A shares and 5,448,000 are class B shares. This authorisation shall remain in effect for a period of 18 months from the resolution by the general meeting and it will supersede the previous one.\n\nCargotec Corporation's Annual General Meeting, held on 19 March 2019 in Helsinki, authorised the Board to decide on the issuance of shares as well as the issuance of options and other special rights entitling to shares referred to in chapter 10 section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act as follows: The amount of shares to be issued based on this authorisation shall not exceed 952,000 class A shares and 5,448,000 class B shares. The authorisation covers both the issuance of new shares as well as the transfer of treasury shares. The issuance of shares and of special rights entitling to shares may be carried out in deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights, on the condition that the distribution of shares is based on weighty /financial grounds. The Board of Directors was authorised to decide on all the conditions of the issuance of shares and of special rights entitling to shares.\n\nThe authorisation remains in effect for a period of /five years following the date of the decision of the general meeting.\n\n## Shares and trading Share capital, own shares and share issue\n\nCargotec Corporation's share capital totalled EUR 64,304,880 at the end of the year 2022. The number of class B shares was 55,182,079, while the number of class A shares totalled 9,526,089.\n\nOn 17 March 2022, Cargotec's Board of Directors decided on a directed share issue related to the reward payments for a share-based incentive programme.

The performance share programme, approved by the Board of Directors in 2020, includes three performance periods, calendar years 2020-2022, 2021-2023 and 2022-2024. Each performance period includes one to three measuring periods. One measuring period can be three calendar years at maximum, which is the total length of one performance period. For the measuring periods, the Board of Directors will annually resolve the length, the performance criteria supporting the implementation of the strategy and the required performance levels for each criterion. Sustainability is an important part of the target setting and rewarding of the key employees.\n\nFor the performance period of 2020-2022, the potential reward of the last measuring period 2022 will be based on the business areas' Mission Climate roadmap and development of the eco portfolio for the key employees of the business areas Kalmar, Hiab and MacGregor. For Cargotec Corporate key employees, the performance criterion is Cargotec's Mission Climate roadmap and development of the eco portfolio.\n\nFor the performance period of 2021-2023, which started in 2021, the potential reward of the second measuring period 2022 will be based on the business areas' service gross pro/fit for the key employees of the business areas Kalmar, Hiab and MacGregor. For Cargotec Corporate key employees, the performance criterion is Cargotec's service gross pro/fit.\n\nIn May 2022, Cargotec's Board of Directors decided to establish a new share-based incentive programme for the Group key employees. The reward from the new Restricted Share Unit Programme 2022-2024 is conditional on the achievement of strategic goals set by the Board of Directors. The reward is paid in two instalments, half in the spring of 2023 and half in the spring of 2024. The shares received as a reward from the programme's /first instalment may not be sold,\n\ntransferred, pledged or otherwise assigned during a lock-up period which ends on 31 December 2023. The Programme is intended for approximately 60 Cargotec Group's key employees, including selected Leadership Team members. The rewards to be allocated on the basis of the Programme will amount up to an approximate maximum total of 108,000 Cargotec Corporation class B shares. In addition, a cash proportion is included in the reward to cover taxes and taxrelated costs arising from the reward.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors resolved on the performance criteria for the share-based incentive programme's new performance period 2022-2024. The performance share programme, approved by the Board of Directors in 2020, includes three performance periods, calendar years 2020-2022, 2021-2023 and 2022-2024. During the performance period 2022-2024, the programme is directed to approximately 110 key employees, including the members of Cargotec Leadership Team. The Board of Directors has resolved that the performance period's /first measuring period is one calendar year. For the key employees of the business areas Kalmar, Hiab and MacGregor, the potential reward of the programme from the measuring period 2022 will be based on the business areas' comparable operating pro/fit. For the Cargotec Corporate key employees, the performance criteria is Cargotec's comparable operating pro/fit. The rewards to be paid on the basis of the performance period 2022-2024 will amount up to an approximate maximum total of 280,000 Cargotec's class B shares. In addition, the rewards include cash proportions that are intended to cover taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward to the key employees.\n\nThe Board of Directors also resolved that share allocation for the restricted share programme's third period 2022-2024 will amount up to an approximate maximum total of 31,000 Cargotec's class B shares. In addition, the rewards include cash proportions that are intended to cover taxes and taxrelated costs arising from the reward to the key employees.\n\nThe Board of Directors approved the restricted share programme in 2020.\n\n## Market capitalisation and trading\n\nAt the end of 2022, the total market value of class B shares on Nasdaq Helsinki was EUR 2,271 (2,409) million, excluding own shares held by the company. The period-end market capitalisation, in which unlisted class A shares are valued at the average price of class B shares on the last trading day of the period, was EUR 2,668 (2,828) million, excluding own shares held by the company. The class B share closed at EUR 41.32 (43.84) on the last trading day of December on Nasdaq Helsinki. The volume-weighted average share price in 2022 was EUR 34.82 (44.70), the highest quotation being EUR 48.46 (52.80) and the lowest EUR 24.90 (33.60). During the period, a total of 44 (37) million class B shares were traded on Nasdaq Helsinki, corresponding to a turnover of EUR 1,541 (1,644) million. In addition, class B shares were traded in several alternative marketplaces.\n\nAt the end of the year 2022, the number of registered shareholders was 40,526. The number of Finnish household shareholders was 38,498, corresponding to around 17 percent ownership of Cargotec's listed B shares. At the end of the period, around 29 percent of Cargotec's listed B shares were nominee registered or held by non-Finnish holders.\n\n## Loans, liabilities and commitments to related parties\n\nCargotec had no loans, liabilities or commitments to its related persons and their related parties on 31 December 2022.\n\n## Board of Directors and CEO\n\nCargotec's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders decides on the election of the members of the Board of Directors, the auditor and their remunerations, as well as changes on the Articles of Association. The Board of Directors elects Cargotec's CEO and determines the terms of his/her employment.",

Changes in the global economy and supply chains, geopolitical tensions and wars, energy availability, sanctions and trade wars can have an impact on global /flow of goods and therefore on the demand of Cargotec's solutions.\n\nRussia's condemnable and unjusti/fied attack on Ukraine and the countermeasures against Russia have exacerbated the existing and created new market disruptions. Disruptions in supply chains, problems with the availability of raw materials and energy, accelerating in/flation, weakened consumer con/fidence, as well as increased uncertainty are slowing down economic growth and may lead to recession. As the crisis continues, its effects can become more widespread.\n\nThe instability of the operating environment has hampered Cargotec's operations. Problems with the availability of raw materials and components, as well as logistics, have signi/ficantly extended the product delivery times and increased inventories. The extension of delivery times has had a negative effect on Cargotec's net sales. Component availability problems as well as strongly increasing labour and energy costs maintain high manufacturing costs, increasing the challenges to control costs and passing them on to the prices of end products. Also the interest rates are expected to continue to stay on a higher level than during the recent years.\n\nCargotec's sales to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine have been low. Cargotec complies with the sanctions imposed on Russia and has announced to be retrieving from the country. At the end of 2022, there are no active operations in Russia anymore. Cargotec does not have a direct representation in Ukraine.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic can have direct and indirect impacts on Cargotec's business. The removal of safety measures and travel restrictions has eased the situation, although China's rapidly lifted pandemic restrictions and the resulting possible\n\nincrease in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country may limit Cargotec's business prerequisites, hamper the selling, operating and delivering of Cargotec's solutions, and complicate the global component shortage. The amount of personnel sick leaves may also increase.\n\nIn a changing market situation, customers may also try to postpone or cancel orders. Deterioration of the global economic outlook and access to /finance as well as increases in interest rates can lead to economic and /financial dif/ficulties among Cargotec's customers. In some cases their /financial position may deteriorate signi/ficantly or even lead to insolvency. The turnover, availability, and cost of skilled personnel can create disturbances to Cargotec and its supplier operations.\n\nContainer traf/fic growth rate and a possible slowdown or contraction in global economic growth may in the longer term have an effect on the demand of Kalmar's cargo handling solutions. Kalmar's project executions face risks related to schedule, cost and delivery guarantees.\n\nIn addition to economic growth, for example, Hiab's demand is also impacted by the development of the construction market. The rising prices and availability challenges of building materials can have a negative effect on construction activity, which in turn can negatively impact the demand for Hiab's solutions. A signi/ficant share of Hiab's orders are from the United States. Even though the cash /flows are hedged for the existing order book, the weakening of the US dollar could in the longer term weaken Hiab's results. Similarly, a stronger dollar can improve Hiab's results. The Hiab solutions are installed on trucks, and the truck delivery bottlenecks can have a negative impact on Hiab's sales development.\n\nMacGregor's market development is affected by the tightening emission regulation for ships and related uncertainty. The increases in the new vessel construction costs and high amounts of order bookings at shipyards may slow down new vessel orders, and the recent drop in container shipping\n\nrates may increase ship operators' reluctance to make new investments. Global decarbonisation targets have led to a fall in investments by the oil industry, which has long been re/flected in decreased offshore vessel investments. However, increase in contracting for wind turbine installations and service vessels is estimated to partly compensate for that in the future. Project executions face risks related to schedule, cost and delivery guarantees, especially those related to new product developments. Downward revision of market estimates or rising interest rates could result in an impairment of MacGregor's goodwill.\n\nIn November 2022, Cargotec's Board of Directors concluded that MacGregor will not be part of Cargotec's portfolio in the future. Taking into account MacGregor's losses in recent years and signi/ficant project cost overruns in the offshore business, in the sale alternative the buyer's view of the company's value may differ signi/ficantly from Cargotec's estimate, which could result in an impairment of MacGregor's goodwill. The planned actions can also include risks related to the retention of skilled personnel, customer relationships, the execution of potential transactions, and costs, for example.\n\nCargotec is exposed to climate-related risks via environmental, regulatory and technological changes, and due to the commitments it has made to reduce emissions. Evaluation of the /financial impacts of climate change on Cargotec is complicated because the occurrence and timing of the resulting effects are dif/ficult to predict, let alone quantify. To reduce emissions generated in its supply chain, Cargotec must reduce emissions through its whole supply chain from raw materials to components and manufacturing, which may result in changes in the suppliers used, limit the number of potential suppliers, and increase costs.\n\nReaching the set emission targets requires efforts in every aspect of Cargotec's business. In addition to being exposed to climate-related risks, the ongoing transition process causes new risks, the realisation of which can have signi/ficant /financial effects. These effects can lead, for",

The interpretation of international agreements and legislation may weaken the predictability of the end results of legal disputes and trials.\n\nRisks regarding Cargotec's acquisitions are related to, for example, the knowledge of the local markets, authority processes, customers, corporate culture, integration, costs, achieving targets, as well as key employees.\n\nInformation security risks are also materially related to Cargotec's operations. A cyber attack on systems that are critical to the operations of the company, its customers or suppliers can disrupt operational stability, lead to a decrease in sales and damage Cargotec's reputation, for example.\n\nThere are also ethical risks related to the industries and the geographical scope where Cargotec operates. Cargotec has increased actions to ensure compliance with its business guidelines, regulations and ethical principles. Related internal processes are constantly being developed.\n\nMore information on risks is available at www.cargotec.com, under Investors > Governance > Internal control and risk management.\n\n## Board of Directors' proposal on the distribution of profit\n\nThe parent company's distributable equity on 31 December 2022 was EUR 588,411,010.54. The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting convening on 23 March 2023 that of the distributable pro/fit, a dividend of EUR 1.34 for each of the 9,526,089 class A shares and EUR 1.35 for each of the 54,957,239 outstanding class B shares be\n\npaid, totalling EUR 86,957,231.91. The remaining distributable equity, EUR 501,453,778.63 will be retained and carried forward.\n\nThe dividend shall be paid to shareholders who on the record date for dividend distribution, 27 March 2023, are registered as shareholders in the company's shareholder register. The dividend payment date proposed by the Board of Directors is 4 April 2023.\n\nNo signi/ficant changes have occurred in Cargotec's /financial position after the end of the /financial year. Liquidity is at a healthy level and the proposed distribution of dividend poses no risk on the company's /financial standing.\n\n## Events after the reporting period\n\nIn December 2022, Hiab entered into an agreement to acquire the family-owned Swedish industrial group Olsbergs. Olsbergs is the technological leader in the design and manufacture of hydraulic valves and remote control systems. Its solutions are used to manoeuvre Hiab's truck mounted loader cranes and forestry cranes. The closing of the transaction took place on 1 January 2023. As a result of the acquisition, approximately 100 employees transferred to Hiab. The transaction has no material impact on Cargotec's /financial information.\n\n## Outlook for 2023\n\nCargotec estimates its core businesses' 7 2023 comparable operating pro/fit to improve from 2022 (EUR 384 8 million) and MacGregor's comparable operating pro/fit in 2023 to be positive (EUR -47 8 million) 9 .\n\n## Annual General Meeting 2023\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of Cargotec Corporation will be held on Thursday, 23 March 2023.\n\nHelsinki, 1 February 2023 Cargotec Corporation\n\nBoard of Directors",

BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\n## 1.1 Accounting principles for the consolidated financial statements\n\n## General information\n\nCargotec Corporation (1927402-8) is a limited liability company domiciled in Helsinki, Finland. The registered address is Porkkalankatu 5, 00180 Helsinki, Finland. Cargotec Corporation and its subsidiaries form the Cargotec Group (later referred to as Cargotec or company).

Their global network is positioned close to customers, offering extensive services to ensure a continuous, reliable and sustainable performance according to customer needs.\n\nThese consolidated /financial statements were approved for publishing by the Board of Directors on 1 February 2023. Pursuant to the Finnish Limited-Liability Companies Act, the shareholders have the right to approve or reject the /financial statements in the Annual General Meeting held after their publication. The Annual General Meeting also has the right to amend the /financial statements. A copy of the /financial statements is available at www.cargotec.com or from Cargotec Corporation, Investor relations, P.O.

Control is achieved when Cargotec is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee, and control is lost when this criteria is no longer met.

The annual improvements to other standards are minor or not relevant to Cargotec.\n\nAmendments to IAS 16, Property, Plant, and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use. The amendment clari/fies how to account for sales proceeds when items are produced and while an item of property, plant, and equipment is brought to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. In accordance with the clari/fication, such proceeds should be reported as revenues and not as a reduction of costs.\n\nAmendments to IAS 37, Onerous Contracts - Cost of Ful/filling a Contract. The amendment clari/fies that the cost of ful/filling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract including incremental costs such as labour and materials, and allocation of other costs that relate directly to ful/filling the contract such depreciation charge related to property, plant, and equipment used in ful/filling the contract.\n\nThe amendments effective from 1 January 2022 had no material impact on the reported /figures.\n\n## New or amended IFRS standards and interpretations from 2023\n\nIn 2023 and afterwards, Cargotec will adopt the following new and amended standards and interpretations by the IASB. The amendments are not expected to have a signi/ficant impact on Cargotec's reporting.\n\n## Effective from 1.1.2023\n\nAmendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction. The amendment clari/fies how deferred taxes should be recognised in a single transaction such as a lease.\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting policies. The amendment clari/fies in which situations a change in an accounting policy is material and should be disclosed.\n\nAmendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: De/finition of Accounting Estimates. The amendment clari/fies the de/finition and application of an accounting estimate.\n\n## Effective from 1.1.2024 or later\n\nAmendments to IAS 1, Classi/fication of Liabilities as Current or Non-current, amendments clarify the classi/fication of a liability as current or non-current in a situation where an entity has a right to defer its settlement for at least twelve months. In accordance with the amended guidance, a liability that is due within 12 months after the reporting date should be presented as non-current if the entity has a right to extend it for at least 12 months after the reporting date. In this case, the liability is classi/fied as non-current on reporting date even regardless of the probability or intention of the management to settle it within the next 12 months. Similarly, a liability is classi/fied as non-current even if the right to extend it for at least 12 months is conditional and the entity is not expected to meet these conditions provided that the covenant assessment is taking place only after the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback\n\nThe amendment clari/fies the accounting and measurement of a sale and leaseback transaction in particular related to the value of right of use asset that the seller-lessee measures based on the economic interest retained. The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on Cargotec.",

In addition, management judgement may be required in applying the accounting principles.\n\nEstimates and assumptions requiring management judgement are based on the management's historical experience as well as best knowledge about the events and other factors, such as expectations on future events, which can be considered reasonable. The actual amounts may differ signi/ficantly from the estimates used in the /financial statements. Cargotec follows the changes in estimates, assumptions and the factors affecting them by using multiple internal and external sources of information. Possible changes in estimates and assumptions are recognised in the /financial period the estimate or assumption is changed. The most important items in the consolidated statements, which require the management's estimates and which may include uncertainty, are presented in following note or note section:\n\n| Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement                                  | Note or note section                                    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenue recognition                                                                       | 2.2 Revenue recognition                                 |\n| Defined benefit plans                                                                     | 3.4 Post-employment benefits                            |\n| Income taxes                                                                              | 4 Income taxes                                          |\n| Inventories                                                                               | 5.2 Inventories                                         |\n| Provisions                                                                                | 5.5 Provisions                                          |\n| Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets                                      | 6.1 Goodwill                                            |\n| Amortisation and depreciation periods                                                     | 6.2 Intangible assets 6.3 Property, plant and equipment |\n| Impairment testing                                                                        | 6.4 Depreciation, amortisation and  impairment charges  |\n| Business combinations and assessment of control, joint control and  significant influence | 7 Group structure                                       |\n| Fair value of financial assets and liabilities                                            | 8 Capital structure and financial  instruments          |\n| Leases                                                                                    | 9.1 Leases                                              |\n\n## 2.

The revenue recognition criteria are usually applied separately to each contract, unless multiple contracts effectively form a single transaction, and within contracts, revenue recognition is determined separately for each distinct product or service. A product or service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation if it is separable from other contractual promises to a customer, and if the customer can bene/fit from it on its own or together with other readily available resources. Therefore, a single agreement including multiple deliverable elements may include one or more distinct items of revenue. Cargotec has the main responsibility to ful/fil the performance obligations, and, therefore, mainly acts as principal in its customer contracts, also when subcontractors are used.\n\nThe transaction price allocated to distinct promised goods or services is based on the amount Cargotec expects to receive from the sale by taking into account the agreed contractual transaction price and the assessment of impact of any related variable price elements, such as performance bonuses or late delivery penalties. Although variable price elements are commonly used in contracts, the project outcomes are mostly reliably predictable and the impact of variable price elements in the overall revenue recognition of projects is not determinant. The transaction price is allocated to distinct products and services in accordance with their relative fair values that are based either on list prices or expected production costs and margins, depending on the product or service.\n\nRevenue is recognised separately for each distinct product or service either over time or at a certain point in time, based on the ful/filment of the performance obligations and how control of the product or service is transferred to the customer. Control is considered to be transferred over time if the bene/fit received from performance is produced and consumed simultaneously, or if the produced performance improves an asset controlled by the customer. In addition, control is considered to be transferred over time when delivering products with a highly customised design, if it is assessed that a product is not suitable as such or with minor modi/fications for another customer and if Cargotec has a contractual right to a payment regarding the produced output. In other situations, revenue is recognised at a point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer.",

Depending on the type of product, the applied delivery method and the contract terms, the risks and rewards are considered to be transferred either in accordance with the applied delivery term, when the installation of the product is ready, or when the customer accepts the product.\n\nIf a customer contract is expected to be loss-making, the costs arising from the contract are estimated with the same principles that are applied to provisions and the expected loss is recognised immediately in the statement of income.\n\nRevenue from sales of machines and equipment that are either manufactured in large quantities or their manufacturing requires no signi/ficant amount of design work is recognised at a point in time when signi/ficant risks and rewards related to the product have been transferred to the buyer and the company no longer has the authority or control over the product. When products are sold without delivery or installation, revenue is recognised when the product is handed over or otherwise made available to the customer. If standard products are sold with delivery but without installation, the timing of revenue recognition is stipulated by the applied delivery clause (Incoterm). If standard products are sold together with an installation service, the timing of revenue recognition is determined based on the complexity of the installation work. Complex installation services are considered to be performance obligations closely related to the installed products, and, therefore, the revenue from both is recognised only after the installation is completed. On the contrary, the non-complex installation services that are typically of short duration and low in value do not determine the timing of the product's revenue recognition.\n\nRevenue from sales of machines and equipment, the manufacturing of which requires a signi/ficant amount of design work, is recognised over time by using the percentage of completion method if it is assessed that the product is not suitable as such or with minor modi/fications for another customer, and if Cargotec has a contractual right to a payment regarding the produced output. Due to this two-tier rule, the timing of the revenue recognition of these products is in practice determined by the payment terms of the contract. The percentage of completion is determined either by reference to the individual contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost method) or by completion of a certain physical milestone (milestone method). If it is not possible to reliably estimate the outcome of a contract, costs are recognised as incurred and revenues only to an extent the corresponding costs are expected to be recovered.\n\nRevenue from sales of ready-to-use software is recognised when the software is delivered or otherwise made available to the customer. Revenue is recognised at a point in time if the customer obtains a perpetual right to use it as it exists at the point in time at which the licence is granted. If the software sold with perpetual licence requires signi/ficant customerspeci/fic customisation, the software licence and the customisation work are considered to be a combined performance obligation, and the related revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion based on the amount of work performed. If it is not possible to reliably estimate the outcome of a contract, costs are recognised as incurred and revenues only to an extent the corresponding costs are expected to be recovered. If a software licence is sold for a de/fined period of time, or as a service, the related revenue is recognised over the licence or service period.\n\nRevenue from sales related to service contracts is recognised in accordance with the percentage of completion method when the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated. The stage of completion is determined by reference to the individual contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost method) or by reference to the amount of service work performed from the expected total amount of service work to be performed (milestone method). The percentage of completion related to long-term and small-value service contracts is not assessed at an individual contract level based on the costs incurred or amount of work performed, but it is based on an estimate of how the costs are generally incurred and services performed over a contract period with a similar length. If the service is continuous or includes an inde/finite number of deliverables, such as software maintenance and support services, cloud-based data services and extended warranties, the revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the contract period. If the outcome of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, the project costs are recognised in the statement of income during the period in which they are incurred and the revenue only to the extent that the corresponding costs are expected to be recovered. Expected contract losses are recognised as expenses immediately. Revenue from short-term service orders is recognised when the service has been rendered.\n\nCargotec offers customer /finance services to certain customer segments and distribution channels. In these transactions, Cargotec is involved in arranging /financing to the customer or dealer either directly by itself or in cooperation with a /financing partner. It is typical that in these arrangements Cargotec continues to carry some level of residual value risk related to the sold product or credit risk related to the end customer. Depending on the type and level of risk retained, Cargotec accounts for its sales under customer /finance arrangements as normal sales, operating or /finance leases, or /financing arrangements in accordance with the true nature of the transaction.",

Contract liabilities relate to advances received from customer contracts and represent the amount of prepayments received, or invoiced, in excess of the revenue recognised. Contract liabilities are recognised as advances received on the balance sheet. Contract assets and liabilities are determined separately for each customer contract.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue recognition requires a use of judgement and estimates in many ways. Judgement is used for example in identi/fication of separate units of revenue i.e. performance conditions when treating the deliverable products and services together or separately is not unambiguous. This is for example when the deliverable products and services alone do not form a functioning end-product. It is also customary that contracts with customers include variable price elements that require use of judgement in revenue recognition, especially in situations when there is no prior experience about the deliverable product or entirety. However, judgement is needed the most in determining the timing of revenue recognition.\n\nRevenue related to long-term service contracts and separately identi/fied construction contracts is recognised on an over time basis in accordance with the percentage of completion. Application of the percentage of completion method is allowed if the delivered machine is considered to have no alternative use for Cargotec, and at all times during the project Cargotec has a right to payment regarding the work already performed. Revenue recognised on reporting date in accordance with the over time model is either based on the cumulative costs in relation to the contract's estimated total costs, or an estimate of the construction contract's physical stage of completion. If the estimate of the /final outcome of the contract changes, the recognition of revenue and pro/fit is adjusted in the period the change has come to attention and can be estimated. The expected loss from the construction contract is expensed immediately. In 2022, approximately 11.2 (2021: 13.4) percent of sales was recognised on an over time basis.\n\n| 1 Jan-31 Dec 2022  MEUR       | Kalmar   | Hiab    | MacGregor   | Internal  sales   | Cargotec  total   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|---------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Equipment sales               | 1,344.2  | 1,167.0 | 267.7       | -0.9              | 2,778.0           |\n| Service sales                 | 551.5    | 411.4   | 301.0       | -0.4              | 1,263.5           |\n| Software sales                | 47.1     | -       | -           | -                 | 47.1              |\n| Total sales                   | 1,942.8  | 1,578.4 | 568.7       | -1.3              | 4,088.6           |\n| Recognised at a point in time | 1,664.6  | 1,564.6 | 402.1       | -1.3              | 3,630.0           |\n| Recognised over time          | 278.2    | 13.8    | 166.6       | -                 | 458.6             |\n\n| 1 Jan-31 Dec 2021  MEUR       | Kalmar   | Hiab    | MacGregor   | Internal  sales   | Cargotec  total   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|---------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Equipment sales               | 948.4    | 899.0   | 295.9       | 0.0               | 2,143.3           |\n| Service sales                 | 468.3    | 351.4   | 257.2       | -0.7              | 1,076.3           |\n| Software sales*               | 95.5     | -       | -           | 0.0               | 95.4              |\n| Total sales                   | 1,512.2  | 1,250.4 | 553.1       | -0.7              | 3,315.0           |\n| Recognised at a point in time | 1,267.9  | 1,237.2 | 365.4       | -0.7              | 2,869.9           |\n| Recognised over time          | 244.3    | 13.2    | 187.7       | -                 | 445.2             |\n\n## Contract assets and liabilities\n\n## Contract assets MEUR\n\n|                                                                        | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Contract assets 1 Jan                                                  | 111.1  | 93.9   |\n| Translation differences                                                | -1.5   | 3.8    |\n| Transfers to receivables                                               | -162.3 | -299.3 |\n| Companies acquired and sold                                            | -      | -7.8   |\n| Change in provision for doubtful accounts and impairments +/-          | 0.0    | 0.0    |\n| Progress, cost estimate and price adjustments                          | 156.6  | 313.2  |\n| Assets held for sale*                                                  | -      | 7.4    |\n| Contract assets 31 Dec                                                 | 104.0  | 111.2  |\n| Contract assets not expected to be invoiced within the next 12  months | 0.0    | -      |",

The shares granted under the incentive schemes are contingently issuable, and therefore, are considered like options when calculating the diluted earnings per share. Shares and share options are dilutive when their subscription price, including the value of the employee's yet undelivered service, is lower than the average share price during the reporting period. Dilutive effect is the difference between the number of shares to be issued and the number of shares that would have been issued at the average share price of the reporting period.\n\n|                                                                      | Note 1 Jan-31 Dec   2022   | 1 Jan-31 Dec   2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Profit attributable to the shareholders of the parent  company, MEUR | 23.9                       | 246.5                 |\n| Weighted average number of shares during financial  period, ('000)*  | 64,479                     | 64,443                |\n| Basic earnings per share, EUR                                        | 0.37                       | 3.82                  |\n\n|                                                                            | Note   | 1  Jan-31  Dec    2022   | 1 Jan-31 Dec   2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Profit attributable to the shareholders of the parent  company, MEUR       |        | 23.9                     | 246.5                 |\n| Weighted average number of shares during financial  period, ('000)*        |        | 64,479                   | 64,443                |\n| Effect of share-based incentive programmes, ('000)                         | 3.2    | 194                      | 127                   |\n| Diluted weighted average number of shares during  financial period, ('000) |        | 64,674                   | 64,569                |\n| Diluted earnings per share, EUR                                            |        | 0.37                     | 3.82                  |\n\n## 2.7 Prevailing economic uncertainty\n\nThe restrictions due to the pandemic and the strong shift in consumer demand from services to goods led to supply chain disruptions and in/flationary pressures for many raw materials and products. Market disturbances have continued due to in/flation, rising interest rates and energy prices, and instability caused by Russia. Under the prevailing conditions, consumer con/fidence has decreased and global economic growth is slowing down.\n\nThe instability of the operating environment has hampered Cargotec's operations. Problems with the availability of raw materials and components, as well as logistics, have signi/ficantly extended the product delivery times and increased inventories. The extension of delivery times has had a negative effect on Cargotec's net sales. Component availability problems as well as strongly increasing labour and energy costs maintain high manufacturing costs, increasing the challenges to control costs and passing them on to the prices of end products. The weakening of the economic situation may reduce freight traf/fic, which would have an impact on the demand for Cargotec's products.\n\nDue to the weakening of the market situation and the availability of /financing and the rise in interest rates, Cargotec's customers may run into /financial dif/ficulties, which may lead to the postponement or cancellation of orders. In some cases, the /financial position of customers can deteriorate signi/ficantly and even lead to insolvency.\n\nCargotec's sales to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine have been low. Cargotec complies with the sanctions imposed on Russia and has announced to be retrieving from the country. At the end of December, the retrieval process was at its /final stages. Cargotec does not have a direct representation in Ukraine, or in Belarus. At the time of reporting, the assets of Cargotec's Russian subsidiaries totalled EUR 9.1 million which mainly consisted of cash and cash equivalents. In addition, Cargotec's subsidiaries outside of Russia had trade receivables from Russia totalling EUR 1.1 million. Cargotec has a provision of EUR 4.7 million related to the above-mentioned balance sheet items, which is recognised in restructuring costs. In addition, Cargotec has reversed revenues and recognised impairments related to its ongoing long-term projects to be delivered to Russia, resulting in a total loss of EUR 3.7 million, which has been recognised as a restructuring expense.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic can have direct and indirect impacts on Cargotec's business. In some areas, such as in China, safety measures and travel restrictions may limit Cargotec's business prerequisites, hamper the selling, operating and delivering of Cargotec's solutions, and complicate the global component shortage. Ensuring a safe working environment for Cargotec personnel may be challenging. The amount of personnel sick leaves may also increase.",

Cargotec announced in November that it has decided to divest MacGregor, but the sale of the company will be postponed due to the market situation and the early stage of MacGregor's business recovery. As a result of the decision, the recoverable amount of the MacGregor segment was determined in the goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter, based on the fair value less costs to sell. The testing showed a EUR 63.4 million impairment to MacGregor's goodwill due to several factors. MacGregor launched a restructuring programme in the fourth quarter, which will lead to the discontinuation of the businesses related to /fishery and research vessels and offshore mooring solutions. In addition, the value was weakened by the reassessment of MacGregor's business risk level and growth forecasts. In addition to the writedown of goodwill, MacGregor made a EUR 25.0 million write-down of intangible assets, which were mainly related to the offshore business within the scope of the restructuring programme. The post-tax WACC (weighted average cost of capital) used in the testing was 9.0 (December 31, 2021: pre-tax WACC was 9.9) percent.\n\nWith the recorded impairment, MacGregor's recoverable amount is at the same level relative to the tested assets, and thus very sensitive to changes in WACC and forecasts. The goodwill of the MacGregor segment was EUR 392.6 (December 31, 2021: 469.0) million at the time of reporting.\n\nAs part of MacGregor's impairment testing, sensitivity analyses have been performed for the key assumptions based on three different scenarios. The changes tested in the analyses are a 2 percentage point increase in the discount rate in the /first scenario, a 10 percent decrease in turnover and a 2 percentage point decrease in operating pro/fit margin throughout the estimation period in the second scenario, and the combined effect of the previous scenarios in the third scenario. The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in the table below.\n\n## MacGregor goodwill sensitivity analysis\n\n|             |                                                               | Sensitivity analysis scenarios and results Scenario 1 Scenario 2   | Sensitivity analysis scenarios and results Scenario 1 Scenario 2   | Sensitivity analysis scenarios and results Scenario 1 Scenario 2                                      |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|             | Recoverable amount  in excess of book  value of assets,  MEUR | WACC +2  percentage points                                         | Sales -10 percent  and operating profit  -2 percentage points      | Scenario 3 Sales -10 percent,  operating profit -2  percentage points  and WACC +2  percentage points |\n| 31 Dec 2022 | 0.0                                                           | Impairment*                                                        | Impairment**                                                       | Impairment                                                                                            |\n| 31 Dec 2021 | 86.0                                                          | Impairment*                                                        | Impairment**                                                       | Impairment                                                                                            |\n\nDue to the current minor excess value of MacGregor's recoverable amount compared to the book value of assets, should the scenarios considered in the sensitivity analysis realise, the amount to be written off would be; EUR 142 (31 Dec 2021: 56) million in the /first scenario, EUR 257 (183) million in the second, and EUR 306 (269) million in the third.\n\n## Goodwill impairment testing of Kalmar and Hiab\n\nAs part of the annual goodwill impairment testing, the recoverable amounts of the Kalmar and Hiab segments were determined based on value in use. The pre-tax WACC used in the testing was 13.9% (2021: 9.4%) for Kalmar and 13.7% (2021: 9.0%) for Hiab. Based on the testing, no impairment was recorded in the goodwill of either segment, nor did any of the sensitivity analyses indicate an impairment. Sensitivity analyses were performed based on the same principles as the sensitivity analyses performed for MacGregor described above.\n\n## Changes in Cargotec's strategy\n\nFollowing the cancellation of the merger between Cargotec and Konecranes, Cargotec announced on 30 March 2022 its refocused strategy to sell or close down Kalmar's heavy cranes business. In addition, Cargotec decided to launch a process to evaluate MacGregor's strategic options, with MacGregor's sale as one option. As a result of the decisions, it has been assessed for both businesses whether the business should be presented as a continuing business or as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. Analyses of both Kalmar's heavy cranes business and MacGregor's business have concluded that the conditions for presentation as held for sale are not met on 31 December 2022.",

Ltd. (RIC) entered into an agreement in July whereby Kalmar transfers heavy cranes' related intellectual properties and assets to RIC in China. The transfer of intellectual properties relate to rubber-tyred gantry cranes (RTG), rail-mounted gantry cranes (RMG), ship-to-shore cranes (STS), and automatic stacking cranes (ASC) which are currently assembled and manufactured at RIC's facility in Taicang, China. RIC has been Cargotec's Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) subcontractor providing assembly services for Cargotec's business areas, Kalmar and MacGregor, since 2020 and prior to that Cargotec and Rainbow operated through a joint venture in China since 2013.\n\nIn the future, Kalmar would focus on offering industry shaping, eco-ef/ficient cargo handling equipment in the mobile equipment product categories, straddle and shuttle carriers, Bromma spreaders and lifecycle services. Further, Kalmar would continue to offer crane automation and crane related services for its customers globally.\n\nAs a result of the transfer of the intellectual property rights of heavy cranes to RIC in China and the plan to ramp down the heavy crane business, Kalmar has recorded EUR 35.7 million in restructuring costs by the end of the the year 2022. As part of the agreement, about 30 local Kalmar employees in China transferred to RIC's service.\n\n## Financial risks related to climate change\n\nCargotec is exposed to climate-related risks via environmental, regulatory, and technological changes, and due to the commitments it has made to reduce emissions. Evaluation of the /financial impacts of climate change on Cargotec is complicated because the occurrence and timing of the resulting effects are dif/ficult to predict, let alone quantify. On the other hand, the impacts of climate-related regulation, changing technologies, and the commitments made by Cargotec are already visible and thus easier to analyse. Cargotec is committed to reducing the carbon dioxide emissions of its value chain by 25% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 compared to the 2019 emission level. In order to succeed in this, Cargotec must reduce not only emissions related to its own operations but also emissions generated in its supply chain and the use of the sold equipment.\n\nTo reduce emissions generated in its supply chain, Cargotec must reduce emissions through its whole supply chain from raw materials to components and manufacturing, which may result in changes in the suppliers used, limit the number of potential suppliers, and increase costs. Reduction of emissions in Cargotec's own operations can be achieved for example by investing in energy ef/ficiency and renewable energy technology as well as reducing work-related travelling and commuting. These improvements are also expected to create cost savings. Reduction of emissions related to the use of Cargotec's products can only be achieved if there is suf/ficient demand for low-emission products. In order to achieve this, Cargotec must\n\nsucceed in developing and selling low-emission products. Cargotec's product development has a critical role in achieving this. Cargotec has invested heavily to electrify its product offering and customers are increasingly choosing low-emission products although the majority of products sold are still based on combustible engine technology. In the future, Cargotec's product offering may be based on multiple low-emission technologies, which may increase complexity and cost.\n\nReaching the set emission targets requires efforts in every aspect of Cargotec's business. In addition to being exposed to climate-related risks, the ongoing transition process causes new risks, the realisation of which can have signi/ficant /financial effects. These effects can lead, for example, to impairments of assets due to the shortened life cycles of products, as well as additional costs related to the introduction of new technologies, which may arise in product development, the realisation of project risks, the growth of inventories, and new types of warranty defects.",

Number of employees is presented in note 2.1, Segment information.\n\n## 3.2 Share-based payments\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nCargotec Corporation has share-based incentive plans which include incentives paid as shares or in cash. The bene/fits granted in accordance with the incentive plan are measured at fair value at the grant date and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value of the equity-settled incentives is based on the market price of the share at the grant date. Equity-settled incentives include bene/fits paid in shares and the portion of share bene/fits that is used to pay income taxes if Cargotec has an obligation to withhold them. The share-based payments settled with equity instruments are not revalued subsequently, and cost from these arrangements is recognised as an increase in equity. The cash-settled share-based incentives are valued at fair value at each closing until the settlement date and recognised as a liability.\n\nThe expensed amount of the bene/fits is based on the group's estimate of the amount of bene/fits to be paid in accordance with the ful/filment of service and performance-based vesting conditions at the end of the vesting period. Market conditions and non-vesting conditions are considered in determining the fair value of the bene/fit. Instead, the nonmarket criteria, like pro/fitability or increase in sales, are not considered in measuring the fair value of the bene/fit but are taken into account when estimating the /final amount of bene/fits. The estimate is updated at each closing date and changes in estimates are recorded through the statement of income.\n\n## Restricted share unit programme 2022-2024\n\nThe incentive programme is targeted to the members of the Leadership team and other key persons. The reward of the programme is conditional on the achievement of the strategic goals determined by the Board of Directors and it is paid in two instalments, half in the spring of 2023 and half in the spring of 2024. The shares paid as a reward for the /first instalment of the programme may not be sold, transferred, pledged or otherwise given away during the restriction period which ends on 31 December 2023. The reward is granted and paid in Cargotec's class B shares, in addition to which Cargotec pays the taxes and tax-related fees related to the reward.\n\n| Range of reward per participant based on the level of participation and  fulfilment of the earnings criteria   | 0-29,350 shares and a cash  portion for taxes   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Expected total cost of the programme on grant date, MEUR                                                       | 5.5                                             |\n| Initial number of participants                                                                                 | 55                                              |\n| Participants fullfilling the minimum earnings criteria on 31 Dec 2022                                          | 52                                              |\n| Number of class B shares granted                                                                               | 106,450                                         |\n| Number of class B shares forfeited in 2022                                                                     | 2,800                                           |\n| Number of class B shares subject to vesting conditions on 31 Dec 2022                                          | 103,650                                         |",

Persons participating in the programme make an investment to Cargotec shares at the inception of the programme and receive an equivalent amount of shares in accordance with the matching share programme. The reward is granted and settled in Cargotec class B shares on top of which Cargotec pays taxes and tax-related expenses. The vesting condition related to matching shares is tied to working condition so that one third of the reward is earned annually over the three-year period after which the vested shares have a lock-up period of one year except the shares vested during the last year for which there is no lock-up period. The amount of reward is restricted if during a year when its vesting conditions are met, the average price of Cargotec share exceeds 60 euros.\n\n## 2019\n\n| Earnings criteria                                                                                            | Service condition,  shareholding condition   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Range of reward per participant based on the level of participation and  fulfilment of the earnings criteria | 0-24,770 shares and   cash for taxes         |\n| Expected total cost of the programme on grant date, MEUR                                                     | 6.0                                          |\n| Initial number of participants                                                                               | 7                                            |\n| Participants fullfilling the minimum earnings criteria on 31 Dec 2021                                        | 6                                            |\n| Participants fullfilling the minimum earnings criteria on 31 Dec 2022                                        | Ended                                        |\n| Number of class B shares granted                                                                             | 98,413                                       |\n| Number of class B shares forfeited in 2021 and earlier                                                       | 3,906                                        |\n| Number of class B shares forfeited in 2022                                                                   | 0                                            |\n| Number of class B shares paid during 2021 and earlier                                                        | 65,604                                       |\n| Number of class B shares paid during 2022                                                                    | 28,903                                       |\n| Number of class B shares subject to vesting conditions on 31 Dec 2021                                        | 28,903                                       |\n| Number of class B shares subject to vesting conditions on 31 Dec 2022                                        | Ended                                        |\n\n## Restricted shares incentive programmes 2020-2024\n\nRestricted incentive programme is targeted to key persons selected by the Board of Directors.

The value of the retention programme was EUR 1.5 million, and the payment under the programme would have been paid as a one-off payment to the CEO's supplemental pension plan after the completion of the merger.\n\nThe CEO Mika Vehvil\u00e4inen's pension is provided according to the statutory Finnish Employees Pensions Act, for which a pension cost of EUR 0.1 (2021: 0.2) million was recorded in year 2022. Additionally, the CEO is entitled to a supplemental de/fined contribution pension bene/fit in Finland, for which a pension cost of EUR 0.7 million was paid in year 2022. According to the pension agreement, the CEO is entitled to retire at the age of 65. If the CEO's service ends before the retirement age of 65 determined in the pension agreement, the CEO is entitled to begin taking the supplemental pension at the age of 62. Other Finnish members of the Leadership Team are entitled to a statutory pension, additionally in 2022 was paid to one member of the Leadership Team a EUR 0.5 million supplemental pension payment. Their retirement age is determined in line with the statutory pension scheme in Finland. Kalmar Business Area President has a supplemental de/fined contribution pension plan, following the local market practice. The members of the Leadership Team have a period of notice of 6 months and are entitled to compensation for termination of employment, corresponding to 6 to 12 months' salary.\n\nCargotec had no loans, liabilities or commitments to persons belonging to Cargotec's top management at the end of the /financial year 2022 or 2021, except at the end 2021 a EUR 1.5 million pledge  given as security for the CEO's pension agreement promise.\n\n## Salaries and remunerations paid\n\n| 1,000 EUR            |                                                                                             | 1 Jan-31 Dec  2022   | 1 Jan-31 Dec  2021   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Mika Vehvil\u00e4inen*    | CEO                                                                                         | 1,521.1              | 2,453.6              |\n| Jaakko Eskola        | Chairman of the Board (as of 27 May  2022), member of the Board (as of  23 March 2021)      | 91.2                 | 59.0                 |\n| Ilkka Herlin         | Vice Chairman of the Board (as of 27  May 2022), Chairman of the Board  (until 27 May 2022) | 79.8                 | 109.2                |\n| Tapio Hakakari**     | Vice Chairman of the Board (until 27  May 2022), Member of the Board  (until 27 May 2022)   | 6.0                  | 78.2                 |\n| Peter Immonen        | Member of the Board (until 23 March  2021)                                                  | -                    | 5.0                  |\n| Teresa Kemppi-Vasama | Member of the Board                                                                         | 62.3                 | 64.0                 |\n| Johanna Lamminen     | Member of the Board                                                                         | 57.3                 | 60.0                 |\n| Casimir Lindholm     | Member of the Board (as of 23 March  2021)                                                  | 61.3                 | 57.0                 |\n| Kaisa Olkkonen       | Member of the Board                                                                         | 62.3                 | 64.0                 |\n| Teuvo Salminen**     | Member of the Board                                                                         | 73.5                 | 79.0                 |\n| Heikki Soljama       | Member of the Board                                                                         | 57.3                 | 59.0                 |\n\nFurther information on share ownership of the Board of Directors and key management is available under Shares and shareholders.",

The plans are classi/fied either as de/fined contribution plans or de/fined bene/fit plans.\n\nA de/fined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays /fixed contributions into a separate entity with no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold suf/ficient assets to pay all employees the bene/fits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions to the de/fined contribution plans are charged directly to the statement of income in the year to which these contributions relate.\n\nA de/fined bene/fit plan is a pension plan under which the group itself has the obligation to pay retirement bene/fits and bears the risk of change in the value of plan liability and assets. The liability recognised on the balance sheet in respect of de/fined bene/fit pension plans is the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation at the end of reporting period less fair value of plan assets. The de/fined bene/fit obligation regarding each signi/ficant plan is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out/flows using interest rates of high-quality corporate or government bonds with approximating terms to maturity and that are denominated in the currency in which the bene/fits are expected to be paid. The applied discount rates are determined in each country by an external actuary. If an asset is recognised on the balance sheet based on the calculation, the recognition is limited to the present value of economic bene/fits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nActuarial gains and losses related to remeasurements of a de/fined bene/fit plan and the effect of the asset ceiling, if any, are recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income. Interest and all other expenses related to de/fined bene/fit plans are recognised directly in the statement of income.\n\nIf a plan is amended or curtailed, the portion of the changed bene/fit related to past service by the employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised directly in the statement of income when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe present value of pension obligations depends on a number of factors determined on an actuarial basis by using a number of /financial and demographic assumptions, and changes in these assumptions impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. The key /financial assumption used in determining the net cost (income) for pensions is the discount rate. The appropriate discount rate is determined at the end of each year and is used in calculating the present value of estimated cash out/flows to settle the pension obligation. In determining the appropriate discount rate, Cargotec considers the yields of high-quality corporate or government bonds, depending on the country, that are denominated in the currency in which the bene/fits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation. Other key assumptions related to pension obligations include /financial assumptions such as estimated increases in salaries and pensions, and demographic assumptions such as mortality rates.\n\nCargotec has various post-employment bene/fit plans throughout the world. Pension arrangements are made in accordance with local regulations and practices in line with the de/fined contribution pension plans or de/fined bene/fit pension plans.\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit arrangements determine the amount of pension to be paid and the bene/fits to be paid for disability and at termination of employment. The bene/fits in these arrangements are usually based on the length of employment and the level of /final salary.\n\nThe main countries having de/fined bene/fit plans are Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway. The most signi/ficant plans are in Sweden. The de/fined bene/fit pension plans are funded by the relevant group companies to satisfy local statutory funding requirements.",

The sensitivity analysis has been prepared for one variable at a time while holding all other variables constant. Regardless of the actual volatility of the given variable, for presentation purposes the analysis has been prepared by assuming a /fixed change in the key variable as indicated in table. Consequently, the purpose of the analysis is not to quantify possible or expected change in the de/fined bene/fit obligation but to illustrate the sensitivity of the value of obligation to these variables, the /fluctuation of which may deviate from the /figures presented in practice. The sensitivity analysis covers 91 (31 Dec 2021: 87) percent of the net de/fined bene/fit liability recognised on the balance sheet.\n\nThe analysis above assesses only the pension liability's sensitivity to given variables without considering the plan assets. Although the changes in the discount rate create the most signi/ficant risk to plan based on the sensitivity analysis, in practice, the interest rate sensitivity is partly offset by the plan assets that include investments in bonds. The plan assets also include instruments such as equities and funds that in the near term may be volatile, but on the long run are expected to outperform corporate bond yields. The risks related to asset performance are signi/ficant both due to the absolute size of plan assets and due to their relative size compared to plan liability. This risk is mitigated by suitable asset allocation and balancing between risk and return. The de/fined bene/fit obligation is determined based on the current best estimate of the life expectancy. If the assumed life expectancy proves to be underestimated, also the recognised plan liability will be insuf/ficient. Uncertainty regarding the reliability of this estimate is also a risk to the plan.\n\n## 4. INCOME TAXES\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes in the statement of income include group companies' taxes based on the taxable income, changes in deferred taxes and adjustments to taxes for previous periods. Income taxes based on the taxable income are calculated by using the local tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Tax is recognised in the statement of income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income, in which case the tax is presented in the statement of other comprehensive income.  Deferred taxes are calculated on the temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated /financial statements and on the unutilised tax losses. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and unutilised tax losses can be utilised. Deferred taxes are measured with the tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or liability settled. When there is uncertainty over an income tax treatment, Cargotec considers uncertain tax positions either separately or together as a group based on the approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. Recognised income taxes are adjusted where it is considered probable that a tax authority or competent court will not accept an uncertain tax treatment applied by Cargotec in an income tax /filing. Income taxes are in that case adjusted either based on an estimate of the most likely amount or the expected weighted average value of the /final tax amount, taking into account the tax authorities' expected acceptance of the chosen tax treatment.",

Cargotec assesses regularly uncertainties related to income tax treatments and where required, adjusts the recognised taxes either to an estimate of the most likely amount or the expected weighted average value of the /final tax amount taking into account the tax authorities' expected acceptance of the chosen tax treatment.\n\n## 4.1 Income tax reconciliation\n\n## Taxes in statement of income\n\n| MEUR                                                         |   1 Jan-31 Dec  2022 |   1 Jan-31 Dec  2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Current year tax expense                                     |                 79.9 |                 88   |\n| Change in current year's deferred tax assets and liabilities |                -12.4 |                 -3.4 |\n| Tax expense for previous years                               |                -11.7 |                  1.8 |\n| Total                                                        |                 55.8 |                 86.4 |\n\n## Reconciliation of effective tax rate\n\n| MEUR                                                  |   1 Jan-31 Dec  2022 |   1 Jan-31 Dec  2021 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Profit before taxes                                   |                 79   |                333.1 |\n| Tax calculated at Finnish tax rate (20%)              |                 15.8 |                 66.6 |\n| Effect of different tax rates in foreign subsidiaries |                  0.8 |                 21.1 |\n| Tax expense for previous years                        |                -11.7 |                  1.8 |\n| Tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses         |                 16   |                -20.2 |\n| Realisability of deferred tax assets                  |                 30.9 |                 15.8 |\n| Withholding tax, non-creditable                       |                  4.9 |                  3.1 |\n| Effect of changes in tax rates                        |                 -0.6 |                 -0.6 |\n| Other                                                 |                 -0.3 |                 -1.2 |\n| Total taxes in statement of income                    |                 55.8 |                 86.4 |\n| Effective tax rate, %                                 |                 70.6 |                 25.9 |\n\n## Taxes relating to components of other comprehensive income\n\n|                                                              | 1 Jan-31 Dec 2022   | 1 Jan-31 Dec 2022   | 1 Jan-31 Dec 2022   | 1 Jan-31 Dec 2021   | 1 Jan-31 Dec 2021   | 1 Jan-31 Dec 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| MEUR                                                         | Before  taxes       | Taxes               | After  taxes        | Before  taxes       | Taxes               | After  taxes        |\n| Cash flow hedges                                             | 5.8                 | -2.3                | 3.5                 | -13.7               | 2.3                 | -11.3               |\n| Translation differences                                      | 11.3                | -                   | 11.3                | 65.9                | -                   | 65.9                |\n| Actuarial gains (+) / losses (-) from defined  benefit plans | 27.7                | -5.6                | 22.1                | -0.5                | 0.0                 | -0.5                |\n| Designated share investments measured at  fair value         | -11.0               | -                   | -11.0               | 14.2                | -                   | 14.2                |\n| Total other comprehensive income                             | 33.7                | -7.9                | 25.8                | 65.9                | 2.4                 | 68.3                |",

Where there is a recent history of loss, Cargotec assesses if that loss arises from factors which are likely to recur. The recognition of deferred tax assets is supported by an offsetting deferred tax liabilites and where applicable an assessment of earnings history and pro/fit projections in the relevant jurisdictions.\n\nOn 31 December 2022, Cargotec had EUR 496.2 (31 Dec 2021: 361.9) million of tax losses and credits carried forward for which no deferred tax assets were recognised because the realisation of the tax bene/fit is not probable. Tax losses and credits of EUR 12.4 (31 Dec 2021: 9.6) million will expire during the next /five years and EUR 483.9 (31 Dec 2021: 352.3) million have no expiry date or will expire after /five years. Unrecognised tax losses and credits relate mainly to Norway and Germany.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, Cargotec had income tax payables of EUR 0.4 (31 Dec 2021: 14.6) million to re/flect uncertainty related to taxes.\n\nA deferred tax liability on undistributed pro/fits of subsidiaries located in countries where distribution generates tax consequences is recognised when it is likely that the earnings will be distributed in the foreseeable future. On 31 December 2022, Cargotec had EUR 216.5 (31 Dec 2021: 315.1) million of undistributed pro/fits for which no deferred tax liability was recognised.",

Unallocated liabilities comprise loans and other interest-bearing liabilities, income tax payables, deferred tax liabilities, accrued interests, deferred considerations on acquisitions, dividend liabilities and derivatives designated as hedges of future treasury transactions.\n\n## 5.2 Inventories\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at acquisition cost or lower estimated net realisable value. The acquisition cost is mainly determined using the weighted average price method. The acquisition cost of inventory includes the purchase price as well as transportation and manufacturing costs. The acquisition cost of self-manufactured /finished and work-inprogress products includes raw materials, direct manufacturing wages and other direct expenses, as well as a proportional share of variable manufacturing costs and /fixed overheads. The net realisable value is the estimated sales price obtained in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completing and selling the product. If the acquisition cost of the inventory exceeds its net realisable value, an obsolescence provision is recorded in the value of the inventory. The recorded obsolescence provision is included in the book value of the inventory.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe inventory obsolescence provision is estimated based on the systematic and continuous monitoring of the inventory. When assessing the amount of obsolescence, the nature, condition and age structure of the inventory and the amounts based on the estimated need are taken into account.\n\n| 31 Dec 2022  MEUR                     | Gross value   | Obsolescence   | Net value on  balance sheet   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| Raw materials and supplies            | 515.5         | -68.0          | 447.5                         |\n| Work in progress                      | 214.6         | 0.0            | 214.6                         |\n| Finished goods                        | 342.8         | -34.9          | 307.9                         |\n| Advance payments paid for inventories | 43.3          | -              | 43.3                          |\n| Total                                 | 1,116.2       | -103.0         | 1,013.3                       |",

Finished products include ready-made new and replacement products in stock as well as /finished products in delivery.\n\n## 5.3 Accounts receivable and other non-interestbearing assets\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Accounts receivable and contract assets\n\nAccounts receivable are invoiced customer receivables representing Cargotec's rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that have been transferred to customers when those rights are conditioned only on the passage of time. Contract assets are unbilled customer receivables representing Cargotec's rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that have been transferred to customers when those rights are conditioned on something other than merely the passage of time such as the agreed timing or project milestones for invoicing. Contract assets include mostly unbilled receivables related to customer contracts in which the revenue is recognised on an overtime basis based on the stage of completion and the amount of revenue recognised exceeds the invoicing.\n\nAccounts receivable and contract assets are initially recognised at fair value less expected credit losses and subsequently at amortised cost less expected credit losses. Credit risk is evaluated based on systematic and continuous monitoring of receivables as part of the credit risk control. Credit loss allowance is recognised based on expected credit losses that is measured based on both historical and forward-looking credit loss assessment. The backward-looking credit loss assessment is determined mechanically by using a provision matrix in which the impairment is determined based on risk weights derived from the historical credit losses and ageing of customer receivables. The forward-looking credit loss assessment is determined by a forward-looking analysis under which additional impairment exceeding the /first component of credit loss allowance may be recognised for a receivable or group of receivables. Impairments and allowances are recognised in the statement of income under cost of goods sold. Bad debts are written off upon an of/ficial announcement of liquidation or bankruptcy con/firming that the receivable will not be collected.",

In measuring the component of the credit loss allowance based on historical credit losses, judgement is needed in determining risk levels for different groups of receivables based on their aging. Judgement and estimation is also needed in assessing suf/ficiency of the credit loss allowance based on historical credit losses and in increasing the credit loss allowance based on a forward-looking credit loss assessment.\n\n## Customer receivables and other non-interest-bearing assets\n\n| MEUR                                                             | Note

In these projects, the amount of revenue to be recognised according to the stage completion is based on an estimate of the value to the customer, which is not directly proportional to the costs incurred by Cargotec for all manufacturing stages. Cost accrual enables the margin recognised from the project to be kept from one stage of completion to another at the level of the expected project margin.\n\nPrepayments from customer /finance agreements include received prepayments in which the residual value of the sold equipment has not been substantially transferred to the customer and, as a result, the agreement is treated as an operating lease.\n\n## Accounts payable and other non-interest-bearing liabilities\n\n| MEUR                                                         | Note   | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------|---------------|\n| Non-current                                                  |        |               |               |\n| Other non-interest-bearing liabilities                       | 8.2    | 74.8          | 68.3          |\n| Current                                                      |        |               |               |\n| Accounts payable                                             | 8.2    | 617.1         | 518.8         |\n| Contract liabilities                                         | 2.2    | 291.1         | 217.2         |\n| Other non-interest-bearing liabilities                       |        | 484.8         | 462.5         |\n| Accounts payable and other non-interest-bearing  liabilities |        | 1,467.7       | 1,266.7       |",

Provisions are accounted for using the best estimate for the costs required to settle the obligation on the balance sheet date. In case the time value of money is signi/ficant, the provision is stated at present value.\n\nProvisions for warranties cover the estimated costs to repair or replace products that are still under warranty on the balance sheet date. Provision for warranty is calculated based on historical experience of levels of repairs and replacements.\n\nProvisions for product claims consist of expected costs arising from settling customer claims for which the value, probability and realisation can be estimated.\n\nA provision is recognised for an onerous contract when the unavoidable costs required to ful/fil the commitment exceed the gain to be received from the contract.\n\nA restructuring provision is recognised when Cargotec has prepared a detailed restructuring plan and started the implementation of the plan or communicated the plan. A restructuring plan shall include the following information: business which is affected, the main units and personnel affected by the restructuring, as well as the costs to be incurred and the timetable of the plan. A restructuring provision and other restructuring related expenses are booked to the function costs to which they by nature belong. However, in case of a signi/ficant restructuring programme of Cargotec or its business area, restructuring costs are presented separately in the statement of income.",

INTANGIBLE AND TANGIBLE ASSETS\n\n## 6.1 Goodwill\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is recognised in a business combination based on the difference between the consideration paid and net assets received. It represents the value of unidenti/fied intangible assets and expected future bene/fits that do not meet the de/finition of an asset such as the value of acquired workforce, and expected synergies that are considered to be available only for Cargotec.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the fair value of previously owned interest and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the fair value of the net identi/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of income. Goodwill is measured at cost less impairment. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of income. Goodwill is derecognised when subsidiaries are disposed of. The amount of disposed goodwill is determined in relation to the change in the value of the related reporting segment before and after the disposal, based on the value-in-use analysis, or alternatively, based on fair value less cost to sell.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets with inde/finite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment when any indication of impairment exists, or at least annually. Impairment testing is performed on the level of the CGU. Goodwill is allocated to those units or groups of units, identi/fied in accordance with the operating segments, that are expected to bene/fit from the business combination. The testing of intangible assets with inde/finite useful lives is either performed as part of a CGU, or on an individual asset level if it is possible to determine independent cash /flows for it. The determined recoverable amount of a CGU is based on value-in-use calculations. The value-in-use is determined by calculating the present value of the estimated future net cash /flows of the tested CGU. The discount rate applied is the weighted average pre-tax cost of capital that re/flects the current market view of the time value of money and risks related to the tested unit.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the statement of income when the carrying amount of the CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment loss is /first allocated to goodwill and then to other assets on a pro rata basis.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets with inde/finite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill and intangible assets with inde/finite useful lives are allocated to cash-generating units. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on calculations that require management to make estimates and assumptions in determining both future cash /flows and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) used to discount them.\n\n| MEUR                    | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Book value 1 Jan        | 966.8  | 971.9  |\n| Translation differences | -16.1  | 20.2   |\n| Impairment              | -63.4  | -      |\n| Companies acquired      | 4.8    | 5.8    |\n| Companies sold          | -      | -24.2  |\n| Assets held for sale*   | -      | -6.8   |\n| Book value 31 Dec       | 892.1  | 966.8  |",

Impairment testing of goodwill is carried out by allocating goodwill to the lowest cash generating unit level (CGU) which generates independent cash /flows. These levels have been identi/fied according to the operative business organisation to be the reported operating segments. Due to the way the operating segments are managed and organised, it is not possible to de/fine independent cash /flows for lower level product divisions.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (CGU) are determined based on the value-in-use calculations for Kalmar and Hiab, and regarding MacGregor, a model based on fair value less cost to sell was adopted in the last quarter. The change was due to the decision announced by Cargotec in November to divest MacGregor in the future after the market situation and MacGregor's pro/fitability have improved. The main difference between the models is that the fair value model is based on estimated post-tax cash /flows re/flecting assumptions that market participants would apply in pricing the asset whereas the value in use model is based on estimated pre-tax cash /flows and assumptions re/flecting current use. In both models, the future cash /flow projections used in the calculations are based on the strategic plans approved by the top management and the Board of Directors and taking into account the prevailing risks and uncertainties in the market environment. Cash /flow forecasts cover /five years, of which the last year is used to derive the terminal value. The value of the last year of the forecast period is determined by extrapolating it based on the average development over the past years and the esimated development over the forecasted period, by taking into account the cyclical nature of the CGU's business. Cash /flows beyond the forecast horizon have been projected using a growth rate that is based on an estimate of the long-term growth rate of the industries, taking into account the OECD long-term growth projections but capped by the level of risk-free rate used in the calculations. Long-term growth rates have been 2.0 (2021: 1.7) percent for Kalmar, 2.0 (0.8) percent for Hiab, and 2.0 (2.0) percent for MacGregor.\n\nThe key assumptions made by the management in the projections relate to market and pro/fitability outlooks. Future growth estimates are based on information available by external market research institutions on market development and timing of business cycles. Additionally, market share and growth potential in both new equipment and service markets have been taken into account when estimating future sales growth. Key factors affecting pro/fitability are sales volume, competitiveness and cost ef/ficiency. The relative share of service business from total revenue has also signi/ficance in the cash /flow projections due to its lower cyclicity and better than average pro/fitability. Additionally, in Kalmar and Hiab segments the utilisation rate of factories and assembly units and their cost competitiveness have a signi/ficant impact on pro/fitability. The ef/ficiency improvements over the past years in Kalmar and Hiab have affected positively in /financial performance, and the ongoing pro/fit improvement programmes are expected to further improve the pro/fitability in the coming years. MacGregor has continued streamlining its operations in adapting to the dif/ficult market conditions. Cash /flow projections in the analyses re/flect typical working capital build-up in upturns and release during downturns in the Kalmar and Hiab segments. MacGregor's business model ties little working capital, but the estimated timing of orders and related advances received have been taken into account in cash /flow estimates.\n\nThe discount rate used in the impairment testing is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) determined for each segment that re/flects the total cost of equity and debt, and the market risks related to the segment. Components of WACC are a risk-free interest rate based on the average of government bond yields weighted by the sales of a cash-generating unit in respective countries, market risk premium, comparable peer industry beta, gearing, and credit spread. In the impairment testing based on value-in-use, the WACC is determined on a pre-tax basis whereas, in the impairment testing based on fair value less cost to sell, the WACC is determined on a post-tax basis. The pre-tax discount rates used in the impairment testing for Kalmar and Hiab were determined in the same way as last year. The WACC used for Kalmar was 13.9 (2021: 9.4) percent and for Hiab 13.7 (9.0) percent. The post-tax WACC used for MacGregor was 9.0 (2021: Pre-tax WACC 9.9) percent. The changes in discount rates from the previous year mainly re/flect growth in risk-free interest rates and the market risk premium.",

MacGregor launched a restructuring program in the fourth quarter, which will lead to the ramp down of the businesses related to /fishing and research vessels and offshore mooring solutions. In addition, the value decreased due to the reassessment of risk level and growth forecasts related to MacGregor's business. In addition to the write-down of goodwill, MacGregor made a EUR 25.0 million writedown of intangible assets, which were mainly related to the offshore business within the scope of the restructuring program. Kalmar's and Hiab's impairment tests showed no impairment in 2022 and in 2021 none of the performed impairment tests showed an impairment.\n\nSensitivity analyses of the key assumptions have been prepared as part of the impairment testing process for each CGU based on three different scenarios. The tested change in the /first scenario is an increase of 2 percentage points in the discount rate, in the second scenario a 10 percent decrease in sales together with a decrease of 2 percentage points in operating pro/fit margin, and in the third scenario the combined effect of the previous scenarios. The sensitivity analyses performed in 2022 and 2021 indicated no risk of impairment for the Hiab and Kalmar segments. The results of MacGregor segment's sensitivity analysis are presented in the table below.\n\n|             |                                                               | Sensitivity analysis scenarios and results   | Sensitivity analysis scenarios and results                    | Sensitivity analysis scenarios and results                                                |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|             | Recoverable amount  in excess of book  value of assets,  MEUR | WACC +2  percentage points                   | Sales -10 percent  and operating profit  -2 percentage points | Sales -10 percent,  operating profit -2  percetage points  and WACC +2  percentage points |\n| 31 Dec 2022 | 0.0                                                           | Impairment*                                  | Impairment**                                                  | Impairment                                                                                |\n| 31 Dec 2021 | 86.0                                                          | Impairment*                                  | Impairment**                                                  | Impairment                                                                                |\n\n- ** Threshold for impairment was any decline in estimation period sales or operating profit\n\nMacGregor's goodwill has been tested for impairment in the years 2022 and 2021 on a quarterly basis. With the recorded impairment, MacGregor's recoverable amount is at the same level relative to the tested assets, and thus very sensitive to changes in WACC and forecasts. Therefore, the amount to be written off would be signi/ficant if the scenarios considered in the sensitivity analysis realize; EUR 142 (31 Dec 2021: 56) million in the /first scenario, EUR 257 (31 Dec 2021: 183) million in the second, and EUR 306 (31 Dec 2021: 269) million in the third.\n\n## 6.2 Intangible assets\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets include patents, trademarks, licences, software, capitalised development costs, technologies, acquired order book, and customer relationships. These assets are recognised on the balance sheet at their original cost less cumulative amortisations and impairment losses, if any, except for intangible assets acquired in a business combination which are measured at fair value at acquisition date.\n\nIntangible assets with de/finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Developed and acquired technologies 3-10 years\n- \u00b7  Customer relationships and trademarks 3-15 years\n- \u00b7  Order book 1-5 years\n- \u00b7  Others 2-5 years\n\nThe assets' useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if necessary, on each balance sheet date. Trademarks with inde/finite useful lives or intangible assets under development are not amortised, but tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment testing is described in detail in the accounting principle Goodwill, disclosed in note 6.1 Goodwill.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch and development costs are primarily expensed when incurred. However, development costs are capitalised when certain criteria related to economic and technical feasibility are met, and it is expected that the product will generate future economic bene/fits. Capitalised development costs include mainly materials, supplies and direct labour costs. The development costs that are once expensed are not subsequently capitalised. Capitalised development costs related to intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life. Un/finished development projects are tested for impairment annually.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Amortisation periods applied for the intangible assets\n\nThe amortisation periods determined for intangible assets and the related amortisation costs recognised in the statement of income are based on management's estimates of the economic useful lives of the assets.\n\n125\n\n/\n\n196",

Some of the trademarks have been assessed to have inde/finite useful lives, including MacGregor trademark. It is estimated that they will create cash /flow for an inde/finite period. The estimate is based on their global, regional or customer segment speci/fic market leadership and their long history. The MacGregor trademark has been used since the 1930s and it is continuously developed. The trademarks are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that their current value would not be recoverable.

Gains and losses on sales of property, plant and equipment are included in the operating pro/fit.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\nDepreciation periods applied for the items of property, plant and equipment The depreciation periods determined for items of property, plant and equipment and the related depreciation costs recognised in the statement of income are based on management's estimates of the economic useful lives of the assets.\n\n|                                                | Owned assets       | Owned assets             | Owned assets                 | Owned assets   | Right-of-use assets   | Right-of-use assets      |        |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------|\n| 2022  MEUR                                     | Land and buildings | Machinery and  equipment | Equipment leased   to others | Others*        | Land and buildings    | Machinery and  equipment | Total  |\n| Acquisition cost 1 Jan                         | 187.4              | 277.6                    | 186.3                        | 6.1            | 191.5                 | 63.5                     | 912.4  |\n| Translation differences                        | -0.8               | -0.7                     | -2.3                         | 0.0            | -1.3                  | 0.7                      | -4.3   |\n| Additions                                      | 2.7                | 13.1                     | 32.3                         | 13.2           | 32.8                  | 14.7                     | 108.9  |\n| Disposals                                      | -7.8               | -21.8                    | -23.6                        | -0.6           | -4.4                  | -10.6                    | -68.8  |\n| Reclassifications                              | 3.3                | -5.0                     | 13.8                         | -10.3          | -1.7                  | -1.3                     | -1.2   |\n| Companies acquired and sold                    | -                  | 0.0                      | -                            | -0.1           | 0.0                   | 0.0                      | -0.2   |\n| Acquisition cost 31 Dec                        | 184.8              | 263.2                    | 206.6                        | 8.3            | 216.8                 | 67.0                     | 946.8  |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment 1 Jan  | -94.4              | -221.6                   | -70.7                        | 0.0            | -82.2                 | -34.1                    | -502.9 |\n| Translation differences                        | 0.4                | 0.6                      | 1.0                          | 0.0            | 1.0                   | 0.0                      | 3.0    |\n| Depreciation during the financial period       | -5.8               | -19.4                    | -24.9                        | -              | -27.9                 | -15.3                    | -93.3  |\n| Impairment charges                             | 1.8                | -                        | -                            | -              | -1.3                  | -                        | 0.5    |\n| Disposals                                      | 6.5                | 17.3                     | 11.0                         | -              | 4.8                   | 9.9                      | 49.5   |\n| Reclassifications                              | 0.0                | 11.9                     | 1.5                          | -              | 1.8                   | 1.1                      | 16.3   |\n| Companies acquired and sold                    | -                  | 0.0                      | -                            | -              | 0.0                   | 0.0                      | 0.0    |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment 31 Dec | -91.5              | -211.2                   | -82.0                        | 0.0            | -103.7                | -38.4                    | -526.8 |\n| Book value 31 Dec                              | 93.4               | 52.1                     | 124.5                        | 8.3            | 113.1                 | 28.6                     | 420.0  |\n\n- * Includes EUR 8.3 million of assets under construction.",

In assessing impairment, both external and internal sources of information are considered. External sources include a signi/ficant decline in market value that is not the result of the passage of time, normal use of the assets or increase in interest rate. Internal sources of information include evidence of obsolescence of, or physical damage to, an asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the amount that is recoverable from its use or sale, an impairment loss is recognised immediately so that the carrying amount corresponds to the recoverable amount.\n\n## Depreciation, amortisation and impairment by function\n\n| MEUR                     |   1 Jan-31 Dec  2022 |   1 Jan-31 Dec  2021 |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Cost of goods sold       |                 67.3 |                 64   |\n| Sales and marketing      |                 13.2 |                 14.6 |\n| Research and development |                  9.4 |                 10.1 |\n| Administration           |                 25.3 |                 24.2 |\n| Restructuring            |                 25   |                  2.8 |\n| Other*                   |                 63.7 |                  1.7 |\n| Total                    |                203.9 |                117.4 |\n\n* Includes EUR 63.4 million impairment of MacGregor's goodwill in 2022.\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and impairment charges by asset type are disclosed in notes 6.1, Goodwill, 6.2, Intangible assets, and 6.3, Property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Impairments\n\nThe book values of assets are reviewed for potential impairment on each balance sheet date. Should any indication arise, the asset is tested for impairment. Impairment testing determines the recoverable amount of an asset. The recoverable amount of items of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and goodwill is the fair value less costs to sell, or, if higher than that, the cash /flow-based value in use. If the recoverable amount of a single asset cannot be reliably determined, the need for impairment is assessed on the lowest level of the cash generating unit (CGU) that is mainly independent of the other units, and whose cash /flows are separately identi/fiable from the cash /flows of the other units.\n\nAn impairment loss related to goodwill is recognised in the statement of income when the carrying amount of the CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment loss is /first allocated to goodwill and then to other assets on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill cannot be subsequently reversed.\n\nAn impairment loss related to other assets is recognised in the statement of income when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a signi/ficant change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The impairment loss can only be reversed to the extent that the carrying value of an asset is returned to a level where it would have been without the recognised impairment loss.",

GROUP STRUCTURE\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Consolidation principles\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements comprise the /financial statements of Cargotec's parent company and its subsidiaries in which the parent exercises control. Control is achieved when Cargotec is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. When less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee are held, all relevant facts and circumstances are considered in assessing whether Cargotec has control over an investee. Cargotec reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes in the relevant elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when Cargotec obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the control is lost. Assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated /financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\n\nPro/fit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the shareholders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a de/ficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the /financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group's accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses, and cash /flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. In acquiring non-controlling interests' shares in subsidiaries, the difference between any consideration paid and the share of net assets acquired in the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains and losses realised on disposals to noncontrolling interests are also recorded in equity./uni00A0Distribution of net income for the period to the equity holders of the parent company and to non-controlling interests is presented in the statement of income. Equity attributable to non-controlling interest is disclosed as a separate item on the balance sheet.\n\nIf the Group loses control over a subsidiary, the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities,/uni00A0non-controlling interest and other components of equity are derecognised and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in/uni00A0pro/fit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.\n\nAll intercompany transactions, receivables, liabilities, unrealised pro/fits and distribution of pro/fits within Cargotec are eliminated in the consolidated /financial statements. The accounting principles of the subsidiaries have been changed, where necessary, to ensure consistency with the principles adopted by Cargotec Corporation.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Open foreign currency-denominated monetary receivables and liabilities at the end of the /financial period, both intercompany and external, are translated using the exchange rate of the balance sheet date, and the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the statement of income except when hedge accounting is applied. Foreign exchange gains and losses related to normal business operations are treated as adjustments to sales or costs. Exchange rate differences on other hedges relating to business operations are recorded in other operating income and expenses.\n\nExchange rate gains and losses related to foreign currency hedges designated as hedges of sales and purchases under hedge accounting are /first recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, and /finally in the statement of income as adjustments to sales and purchases simultaneously with the related transactions. Exchange rate differences on other hedges relating to business operations are recorded in other operating income and expenses. Foreign exchange gains and losses associated with /financing are included in /financial income and expenses.\n\n## Foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe stand-alone /financial statements of subsidiaries are reported using the currency that best re/flects the operational environment of that subsidiary (the functional currency'). In the consolidated /financial statements, the statement of income and the cash /flows of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the euro are translated into euros using the average exchange rate of the /financial period, and the assets and liabilities on",

Translation differences caused by different exchange rates are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income in the cumulative translation differences in equity. Intercompany loan agreements may form a part of net investment if their settlement is neither planned nor probable in the foreseeable future, and thus the exchange rate gains and losses of these contracts are also recognised as translation differences in equity. When applying hedge accounting for a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, exchange rate differences on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income, and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of income.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Translation differences arising are recognised in equity.\n\nTranslation differences from acquisition cost eliminations and post-acquisition pro/fits and losses of subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures outside the euro area are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. When a foreign entity or part of it is disposed, accumulated translation differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassi/fied to the statement of income as a part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classi/fied as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction instead of normal use and a sale is considered highly probable. Non-current assets held for sale are measured immediately before reclassi/fication in accordance with the normal measurement principles after which they are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment losses or gains are recognised in the statement of income. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.\n\n## 7.1 Acquisitions and disposals of businesses\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Acquisitions and disposals of businesses\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations in which Cargotec obtains control of the acquired business regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a business is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interest issued by the group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. If a contingent consideration is classi/fied as a /financial liability, it is measured at fair value on each reporting date, and the changes in the fair value are recognised in the statement of income. Contingent consideration classi/fied as equity is not revalued.\n\nIdenti/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their acquisition date fair values. The share of non-controlling interest in the acquiree is recognised on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets. The difference, if any, between the consideration transferred and the fair value of net assets obtained is recognised as goodwill. Businesses acquired during the /financial period are included in the consolidated /financial statements from the date the control is obtained, and divested businesses until the date the control is lost. When control is lost, all assets and liabilities related to the disposed business are derecognised. Additionally, if relevant, the related hedging result recognised in other comprehensive income and translation differences accumulated in equity are reclassi/fied to the statement of income on disposal.\n\nIf a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is revalued at fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from remeasurement are recognised in the statement of income. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Acquisitions of businesses\n\nNet assets acquired through business combinations are measured at fair value. The consideration exceeding the value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. The measurement of fair value of the acquired net assets is based on market values of similar",

The valuation, which is based on prevailing repurchase value, expected cash /flows or estimated sales price, requires management judgement, estimates and assumptions. Management trusts that the applied estimates and assumptions are suf/ficiently reliable for determining fair values.\n\n## Disposals in the year 2022\n\nIn January, Hiab sold its Ukrainian subsidiary Cargotec Ukraine LLC to the company's executive management. The company has mainly sold Hiab equipment to the Ukrainian market. The transaction had no material effect on the reported /figures.\n\n## Acquisitions in the year 2021\n\nIn September, Hiab acquired the share capital of Galfab LLC in the United States at a purchase price of EUR 2.3 million. Galfab is specialised in designing and manufacturing waste equipment including roll-off hoists and containers, compactors and balers for the waste industry in the US. The acquisition expands Hiab's product portfolio of demountables and Galfab's distribution network as part of Hiab's nationwide US sales and service network. In determining fair values, EUR 3.5 million of intangible assets, and EUR 8.8 million of goodwill, which are tax-deductible, were identi/fied. As a result of the acquisition, approximately 100 employees transferred to Hiab.\n\nIn April, Hiab acquired Damen Hydrauliek Best B.V., Damen Hydrauliek Venray B.V. and Damen Hydrauliek Elsloo B.V. companies' sales and service businesses in the Netherlands at a purchase price of EUR 2.0 million. Half of the purchase price was paid on closing and the remainder is expected to be paid within the next 12 months. Acquired operations and assets together with the transferring/uni00A0employees meet the de/finition of business and are accounted for as a business combination. In determining fair values, EUR 1.0 million of intangible assets based on customer relationships and EUR 0.2 million of goodwill, that is not tax deductible, were identi/fied. As a result of the acquisition, 30 employees transferred to Hiab.\n\nIn January, Hiab acquired the sales and service business of FNS - Fahrzeugbau und Nutzfahrzeugservice GmbH in Germany at a purchase price of EUR 2.8 million. Acquired operations and assets together with the transferring/uni00A0employees meet the de/finition of business and are accounted for as a business combination. In determining fair values, EUR 1.0 million of intangible assets based on customer relationships and EUR 1.7 million of goodwill, that is not tax deductible, were identi/fied. As a result of the acquisition, 15 employees transferred to Hiab.\n\n## Acquired net assets and goodwill related to Galfab, Damen and FNS acquisitions MEUR\n\n| Intangible assets                                           |   5.5 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Property, plant and equipment                               |   2.1 |\n| Inventories                                                 |   9.5 |\n| Accounts receivable and other non-interest-bearing assets   |   3.6 |\n| Deferred tax assets                                         |   0.2 |\n| Accounts payable and other non-interest-bearing liabilities |  -5.2 |\n| Interest-bearing liabilities                                | -18.9 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                    |  -0.2 |\n| Net assets                                                  |  -3.4 |\n| Purchase price, payable in cash                             |   7.2 |\n| Total consideration                                         |   7.2 |\n| Goodwill                                                    |  10.6 |\n| Purchase price, paid in cash                                |   7.3 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents acquired, including overdrafts    |  -0.1 |\n| Cash flow impact                                            |   7.4 |\n\nThe contribution of Galfab, Damen and FNS to Hiab's sales in 2021 was EUR 15.0 million. Had these acquisitions took place in the beginning of the year, the estimated contribution to Hiab's sales would have been EUR 36.0 million. The acquisitions had no material impact on Hiab's operating pro/fit.\n\n## Changes related to previous acquisitions in the year 2021\n\nFurther to the completion of the acquisition of the marine and offshore businesses of TTS Group ASA (now Nekkar ASA) in July 2019, MacGregor concluded in January 2021 a settlement agreement with Nekkar after challenging the calculation of the purchase price. In accordance with the settlement agreement, Nekkar made a total payment of NOK 94.0 million (EUR 9.1 million) to MacGregor as the /final settlement of the disputed purchase price. The received payment included a deduction of NOK 8.0 million (EUR 0.8 million) that was previously withheld by MacGregor related to the ful/filment of Nekkar's tax obligations in China following the completion of the acquisition. The settlement amount had an approximately EUR 7 million positive impact on MacGregor's /first quarter 2021 operating pro/fit.",

The presented sales pro/fit is /final and taking into account transaction costs and other related non-recurring items, the transaction had a positive impact of EUR 230,7 million on Cargotec's operating pro/fit in 2021.\n\nThe transaction follows the release issued in March 2021, in which the signing of the sale was announced, and the release issued in February 2020, in which Cargotec announced that it is evaluating strategic options for the future development of Navis. In December 2020, Cargotec announced its decision to launch the sale process for the Navis software business. Navis software solutions for terminal operators, carriers, and ship owners are used to optimise global container /flows, and the main product of Navis, the N4 terminal operating system is used by 340 customers in more than 80 countries. Navis recorded sales of EUR 49 million from the /first six months of 2021 and EUR 107 million in 2020. As a result of the transaction, Cargotec's personnel reduced by approximately 700 persons.\n\nThe table below summarises the assets and liabilities derecognised from Cargotec's balance sheet in connection with the sale, and the realised sales pro/fit.\n\n## Navis, sales profit calculation MEUR\n\n| Goodwill                                                    |   -80.4 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Intangible assets                                           |   -66.8 |\n| Property, plant and equipment                               |    -7   |\n| Inventory                                                   |    -0.5 |\n| Accounts receivable and other non-interest-bearing assets   |   -38.4 |\n| Loans receivable and other interest-bearing assets          |    -0.5 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                   |   -18.7 |\n| Deferred tax assets                                         |    -3.1 |\n| Accounts payable and other non-interest-bearing liabilities |    64   |\n| Interest-bearing liabilities                                |     6.2 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                    |    13.5 |\n| Net assets                                                  |  -131.7 |\n| Sales price, receivable in cash                             |   374.7 |\n| Total consideration                                         |   374.7 |\n| Translation differences                                     |    -3.8 |\n| Sales profit                                                |   239.1 |\n| Sales price, received in cash                               |   372.8 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents sold, including overdrafts        |   -18.7 |\n| Cash flow impact                                            |   354.2 |\n\nIn July, Hiab sold its South African subsidiary Hiab SA Proprietary Limited for EUR 1.1 million.

Associated companies are entities over which Cargotec has signi/ficant in/fluence based on right to participate in the /financial and operating policy decision-making but over which Cargotec has no control or joint control. Investments in joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for in the consolidated /financial statements under the equity method. Investments in joint ventures and associated companies are initially recognised on the balance sheet at the acquisition cost, which includes goodwill and intangible assets identi/fied on acquisition as well as the costs for acquiring or establishing the joint venture or associated company. Subsequently, the value of investment is adjusted in accordance with changes in the net assets of the investee in proportion to Cargotec's ownership, and in accordance with the amortisations of the intangible assets identi/fied in the acquisition. Investment in a joint venture, or an associated company is derecognised when Cargotec no longer has a joint control, or signi/ficant in/fluence over the investee.\n\nCargotec's share of the joint venture's or associated company's pro/fit for the /financial period is presented as a separate item before the operating result in the consolidated statement of income. The results of joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for with equity method based on their most recent /financial statements. Any change in other comprehensive income of those investees is presented as part of the Cargotec's other comprehensive income. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate or joint venture, Cargotec recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity.\n\nBusiness transactions between the group and the joint ventures or associated companies are recognised in the group's /financial statements only to the extent of the unrelated investor's interest in the joint venture or associated company. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred assets. The accounting principles of the joint ventures and associated companies have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the principles adopted by Cargotec.\n\nThe carrying amount of investments in joint ventures and associated companies is reviewed on a regular basis and if any impairment in value has occurred, it is written\n\ndown in the period in which these circumstances are identi/fied. If Cargotec's share of the joint venture's or associated company's losses exceeds its interest in the company, the carrying amount is written down to zero. After this, losses are reported only if Cargotec is committed to ful/filling the obligations of the joint venture or associated company.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Assessment of joint control and significant influence\n\nCargotec applies judgement in determining an appropriate method to account for its ownership in the investees.  Cargotec's investments in joint arrangements are classi/fied as joint ventures based on shared control, rights to net assets of the arrangement, and other relevant circumstances related to the arrangements. Cargotec's investments in associated companies include investments, in which Cargotec's voting rights are normally more than 20 percent. Accounting for the investment as an associated company is based on Cargotec's signi/ficant in/fluence in the investee.

Jumbo Logistics Limited, and by increasing its ownership in the subsidiary Hatlapa (Eastmed) Limited to 100% by acquiring 30% of the share capital. In total, transactions resulted in a net cash out/flow of EUR 0.7 million.\n\nAdditionally, MacGregor is /finalising changes to its two Chinese joint ventures, which it acquired as part of the acquisition of TTS and that are jointly owned with China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC).\n\nRegarding TTS Hua Hai Ships Equipment (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (THH), MacGregor is selling its share of ownership to CSSC. The sales contract has been signed and the deal is awaiting for authority approval. The transaction is expected to be closed during the /first quarter of 2023. With the transaction, THH will cease manufacturing and selling hatch covers in China under the TTS brand. MacGregor has recognised an impairment of EUR 2.0 million in the value of its holding, and reimbursement of EUR 2.4 million from the use of the TTS brand during the year 2022, which have been included in other items affecting comparability. The balance sheet value of the holding in the joint venture was EUR 6.5 (31.12.2021: 9.0) million on the reporting date and the sale of ownership is not expected to have a material impact on pro/fit or loss. The consolidation of THH using the equity method has ended in 2022.\n\nRegarding TTS Bohai Machinery (Dalian) Co., Ltd. (TBH), MacGregor and CSSC have transferred the business of the joint venture to CSSC MacGregor Marine Equipment Co., Ltd. (CMME), a joint venture established in 2021. With the transfer, the liquidation process of TBH is underway. In June, MacGregor recorded an impairment of EUR 2.0 million in the value of its holding, which has been included in other items affecting comparability. Additionally, EUR 0.5 million of intangible assets and EUR 3.4 million of goodwill included in the carrying value of TBH were transferred to the carrying value of CMME. The balance sheet value of the holding in the joint venture was EUR 4.3 (31.12.2021: 10.2) million on the reporting date and liquidation of the/uni00A0company is not expected to have a material impact on pro/fit or loss. The consolidation of TBH using the equity method has ended in 2022.\n\nHiab continued its preparations for the closure of the joint venture Sinotruk Hiab (Shandong) Equipment Co., Ltd. During the /first quarter of 2022, Hiab repaid the loan of EUR 2.8 million it had guaranteed for the joint venture, which had a cost impact of EUR 1.4 million.\n\n## Changes in joint ventures and associated companies in 2021\n\nIn January 2021, MacGregor established a joint venture in China with CSSC Nanjing Luzhou Machine Co., Ltd (LMC). The joint venture will further enhance MacGregor's cooperation with the China State Shipping Company (CSSC), the world's largest shipbuilding group by strengthening customer access, local presence, and competitiveness in China. The new CSSC MacGregor Marine Equipment (CMME) joint venture is providing electro-hydraulic merchant cargo cranes, merchant winches, and steering gear to the Chinese shipbuilding market. The relevant technologies and brands are licensed to the joint venture, and manufacturing of the products is outsourced. MacGregor is committed to contribute EUR 3.3 million of capital to CMME of which EUR 1.9 million has been contributed and the remaining amount is expected to be contributed during the /first quarter of 2022. MacGregor recognised a loss of EUR 12.7 million on establishment mainly due to the customer relationships and goodwill related to the transferred business derecognised from the balance sheet and allocated as the cost of the transaction.\n\nIn 2021, the parties to the Sinotruk Hiab (Shandong) Equipment Co., Ltd. joint venture have decided to close down the company. The value of guarantees issued by Cargotec on behalf of Sinotruk on December 31, 2021 amounted to EUR 4.2 (December 31, 2020: 3.7) million, of which EUR 1.2 (December 31, 2020: 2.5) million has been recognised as a liability at the end of year 2021.",

Non-current assets held for sale are measured immediately before reclassi/fication in accordance with the normal measurement principles after which they are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment losses or gains are recognised in the statement of income. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.\n\nOn July 1, 2021, Cargotec sold its Navis business to Accel-KKR, a Silicon Valley-based leading technology-focused investment /firm for an enterprise value of EUR 380 million. Additional information about the sale is disclosed in note 7.1, Acquisitions and disposals.\n\nNavis was presented from December 31, 2020 on as a disposal group classi/fied as held for sale, according to which the balance sheet items related to Navis are presented in the consolidated balance sheet on a separate line as a disposal group, but in the statement of income, Navis is not separated. The table below provides additional information on the held-for-sale assets and related liabilities.",

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## 8.1 Financial risk management\n\n## Organisation of finance function and financial risk management\n\nCargotec's /finance function and /financial risk management are conducted according to the Treasury Policy, approved by the Board of Directors. Organisation, responsibilities and principles of /financial risk management, monitoring and reporting are de/fined in the Treasury Policy. Treasury Committee, appointed by the Board, is responsible for Treasury Policy compliance and for organising and monitoring the treasury function. Detailed guidelines for /financing functions in accordance with Treasury Policy are de/fined in Treasury Instructions, approved by the Treasury Committee.\n\nThe objectives of the treasury function are to secure suf/ficient funding for business operations, avoiding /financial constraint at all times, to provide business units with /financial services, to minimise the costs of /financing, to manage /financial risks (currency, interest rate, liquidity and funding, credit, counterparty and operational risks) and to regularly provide management with information on the /financial position and risk exposures of Cargotec and its business units.\n\nCargotec Treasury is responsible for funding at corporate level, for managing liquidity and /financial risks, for providing ef/ficient set up of /financing operations and for monitoring business unit /financial positions. Cargotec Treasury reports on these issues monthly. The business units are responsible for hedging their /financial risks according to the Treasury Policy and instructions from Cargotec Treasury.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCargotec operates in more than 100 countries and is, due to its global operations, exposed to risks arising from foreign exchange rate /fluctuations. A signi/ficant proportion of Cargotec sales and costs are generated in foreign currencies, mostly in US dollars, Swedish Krona and Chinese yuan.\n\nThe objective of the currency risk management is to hedge operations against exchange rate /fluctuations, thus allowing time for the business units to react and adapt to changes in exchange rates. Foreign currency positions, which include contractual cash /flows, related to sales, purchases and /financing, are fully hedged. Other highly probable cash /flows may be hedged, if deemed necessary by Cargotec Treasury and the business unit. The business units report their risk exposures to Cargotec Treasury and hedge the positions via intercompany forward\n\ncontracts. In countries where hedging is restricted, foreign currency denominated loans and deposits may be used as hedging instruments.\n\nCash /flow hedge accounting is generally applied to qualifying foreign currency hedges. Under the Cargotec hedge accounting model, the portion of the fair value change related to a change in the spot rate is recognised in the fair value reserve within equity until the cumulative pro/fit or loss is recycled to the statement of income simultaneously with the hedged item. The portion of the fair value change related to interest rate is excluded from hedge accounting and recognised directly in pro/fit or loss. Hedge accounting is started when a qualifying risk exposure is identi/fied and Cargotec enters into a hedge, and terminated when the hedged item impacts pro/fit or loss. Hedge accounting is not applied in cases where its impact on the consolidated statement of income is deemed insigni/ficant by Cargotec Treasury.\n\nCargotec is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from both on- and off-balance sheet items. The net balance sheet exposure in the table below represents the foreign currency risk arising from the on-balance sheet /financial items, and the net exposure illustrates the total outstanding foreign currency risk as de/fined and monitored by Cargotec Treasury.\n\n| 31 Dec 2022  MEUR         | EUR    | USD    | SEK   | PLN    | NOK   | CNY    | Others   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|----------|\n| Balance sheet items       | -65.5  | 89.9   | -24.8 | 32.4   | -10.5 | -6.8   | -6.5     |\n| Hedges                    | 386.6  | -676.7 | 100.3 | 22.6   | 64.0  | 127.5  | -33.5    |\n| Balance sheet  exposure   | 321.1  | -586.8 | 75.5  | 55.0   | 53.5  | 120.7  | -40.0    |\n| Order book and  purchases | -278.4 | 599.8  | -70.8 | -96.3  | -61.4 | -122.2 | 35.6     |\n| Net exposure              | 42.7   | 13.0   | 4.7   | -41.3  | -7.9  | -1.5   | -4.3     |\n| 31 Dec 2021  MEUR         | EUR    | USD    | SEK   | PLN    | NOK   | CNY    | Others   |\n| Balance sheet items       | -42.1  | 33.9   | -17.4 | 51.3   | -6.2  | -12.6  | -6.5     |\n| Hedges                    | 299.1  | -532.5 | 50.7  | 82.0   | 42.9  | 90.6   | -48.6    |\n| Balance sheet  exposure   | 257.1  | -498.6 | 33.3  | 133.3  | 36.7  | 78.0   | -55.1    |\n| Order book and  purchases | -286.9 | 517.0  | -28.9 | -144.5 | -37.4 | -72.5  | 56.2     |\n| Net exposure              | -29.9  | 18.4   | 4.3   | -11.2  | -0.7  | 5.5    | 1.1      |",

In this table, amounts are presented on a gross basis including foreign currency amounts and counter values in local currencies.\n\nCargotec's subsidiaries constantly monitor their foreign currency exposures and report them on a monthly basis to Cargotec Treasury which is responsible for monitoring the overall exposure and arranging hedges for identi/fied exposures. Cargotec Treasury also monitors the translation risk arising from different currencies and, where deemed signi/ficant, translation risk positions are hedged and net investment hedge accounting is applied.\n\nForeign exchange rate /fluctuations have an effect on the consolidated income and equity. The effect in the statement of income arises from foreign currency denominated /financial assets and liabilities in the subsidiaries' balance sheets, including derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied. The effect in equity arises from derivatives under hedge accounting from which the fair value /fluctuations related to changes in exchange rates are recognised in the fair value reserve of the other comprehensive income. Foreign exchange rate impact in the fair value reserve is expected to be offset by the corresponding opposite impact in the value of the hedged item when recognised in the statement of income. The majority of the hedges mature and the hedged cash /flows realise within the next year. Cargotec has recognised the following currency pairs to be the most signi/ficant and estimated their impact on pro/fit before taxes and on other comprehensive income through sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis assumes that cash is held at subsidiaries functional currency.\n\n|                                      |   Profit before taxes |   Profit before taxes |   Other comprehensive  income |   Other comprehensive  income |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| MEUR                                 |                2022   |                2021   |                        2022   |                        2021   |\n| USD appreciates 10% against the euro |                  -1.8 |                  -1.3 |                         -32.5 |                         -18.3 |\n| SEK appreciates 10% against the euro |                   3.9 |                   2.8 |                          -3.1 |                          -1.5 |\n| USD depreciates 10% against the euro |                   1.8 |                   1.3 |                          32.5 |                          18.3 |\n| SEK depreciates 10% against the euro |                  -3.9 |                  -2.8 |                           3.1 |                           1.5 |\n\nNet investments in non-euro area subsidiaries cause translation differences, recognised in the consolidated equity (translation risk). Translation risk is mitigated by managing the capital structure so that the effect of foreign exchange rate /fluctuations on debt and equity are in balance. Cargotec Treasury regularly monitors the translation exposure and evaluates the materiality of the risk position. The impact of the translation risk from currencies to Cargotec's gearing is evaluated not to be signi/ficant and hedging the translation risk has not been considered necessary.\n\n| 31 Dec 2022  MEUR    | USD   | PLN   | NOK   | SGD   | SEK   |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Translation exposure | 254.2 | 175.1 | 228.9 | 146.3 | 214.2 |\n| Translation risk     | 254.2 | 175.1 | 228.9 | 146.3 | 214.2 |\n| 31 Dec 2021  MEUR    | USD   | PLN   | NOK   | SGD   | SEK   |\n| Translation exposure | 419.3 | 156.1 | 305.0 | 216.2 | 92.9  |\n| Translation risk     | 419.3 | 156.1 | 305.0 | 216.2 | 92.9  |\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nFluctuations in market interest rates have an effect on consolidated interest out/flows and the fair values of interest-bearing loans, receivables and derivative instruments. The objective of interest rate risk management is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on the statement of income, balance sheet and cash /flow. To manage interest rate risk, the duration of the /financial portfolio is maintained within the limits set by the Treasury Committee, by balancing between /fixed and /floating rate debt and by using derivative instruments.\n\nOn 31 December 2022, Cargotec's consolidated interest-bearing debt totalled EUR 837.5 (31 Dec 2021: EUR 919.5) million, of which EUR 348.9 (348.5) million were /fixed rate corporate bonds, and EUR 164.6 (163.0) million were lease liabilities. The rest, EUR 324.0 (408.0) million, consisted of /fixed and /floating rate loans, short term loans, bank overdrafts and other interestbearing liabilities. On 31 December 2022, the average interest duration of interest-bearing debt excluding lease liabilities, was 19 (24) months.\n\nThe EUR 459.2 (31 Dec 2021: 505.0) million investment portfolio consisted mainly of short-term deposits and bank account balances. Interest-bearing loan receivables totalled EUR 7.0 (14.7) million and /finance lease receivables EUR 0.3 (1.5) million. The average interest duration of the interest bearing assets was less than one month (less than one month).\n\nBased on the sensitivity analysis, a one percentage point increase/decrease in the interest rates would have decreased/ increased net interest cost by EUR 0.6 (31 Dec 2021: decreased/ increased by 0.5) million. The sensitivity in the statement of income is affected by variable rate loans, short term loans, loans receivable, deposits, bank accounts and bank overdrafts. The sensitivity is calculated as an annual effect assuming that the group's balance sheet structure remains unchanged.\n\nWith respect to all currency forward contracts, the fair value changes related to /fluctuations in interest rates are recognised directly in /financial income and expenses, and, hence, the changes in short-term market rates may affect /financial result also via currency hedging contracts.

Business units are responsible for identifying and mitigating the risks as well as possible hedging measures. Risks are managed through careful selection of suppliers, long-term cooperation with key suppliers and contract terms.\n\nCargotec has evaluated that the discontinuation of LIBOR reference rates and transition to alternative risk free rates will not have material impact on Cargotec /financing agreements or /financial risk management operations.",

On 31 December 2022, the liquidity reserves, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term undrawn credit facilities, totalled EUR 781.9 (31 Dec 2021: 788.8) million. Short-term liquidity requirement covers the repayments of short- and long-term debt within the next 12 months, as well as the strategic liquidity requirement, as determined by the Treasury Committee, which covers the operative funding demand within the following 12 months. On 31 December 2022, repayments of short- and long-term interest-bearing liabilities due within the following 12 months totalled EUR 86.6 (43.4) million, of which EUR 37.4 (34.8) million are lease liabilities.\n\nOn 31 December 2022, Cargotec held undrawn EUR 330.0 (31 Dec 2021: 300.0) million longterm revolving credit facility, which will mature in December 2027 and it includes two one-year extension options.  According to the facility agreement, Cargotec has a right to withdraw funds on three business days' notice on agreed terms. Additionally, to ful/fil short-term cash management requirements, Cargotec holds available short-term bank overdraft facilities of EUR 95.5 (111.1) million and a EUR 150.0 (150.0) million domestic Commercial Paper facility which on 31 December 2022 was unused (unused). Cargotec's total liquidity position includes EUR 94.3 (107.0) million of cash and cash equivalents in different currencies subject to currency-related or other regulatory restrictions, and, therefore, these balances may not be utilised outside these countries within a short period of time. Nevertheless, these restricted balances are typically available for immediate use locally in these countries and therefore these balances are included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Total liquidity/uni00A0\n\n| MEUR                                                             |   31 Dec 2022 |   31 Dec 2021 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                        |         451.9 |         488.8 |\n| Committed long-term undrawn revolving credit facilities          |         330   |         300   |\n| Repayments of interest-bearing liabilities during next 12 months |         -86.6 |         -43.4 |\n| Total  liquidity                                                 |         695.3 |         745.4 |\n\nThe objective of funding risk management is to avoid an untenably large proportion of loans or credit facilities maturing at a time when refunding is not economically or contractually feasible. The risk is minimised by balancing the repayment schedules of loans and credit facilities, as well as retaining /flexible credit facility agreements. Cargotec's bilateral bank loan agreements and syndicated revolving credit facility include a covenant restricting the corporate capital structure. According to the covenant, the relation between net debt and equity (gearing) must be retained below 125 percent. According to management assessment, Cargotec is in a good position regarding liquidity and there are no signi/ficant concentrations of risks relating to refunding.\n\nThe following tables represent the maturity analysis of the company's /financial liabilities and derivatives. The /figures are non-discounted contractual cash /flows.",

Because of the diverse and global clientele, Cargotec is not exposed to signi/ficant credit risk concentrations. Credit risk related to sales contracts is mitigated by using payment terms that are based on advance payments, bank guarantees or other guarantees, and by monitoring the creditworthiness of customers. Credit risks related to large contracts are shared with /financial institutions, insurance companies or export guarantee institutions, when feasible. More information on accounts receivable is presented in note 5.3, Accounts receivable and other noninterest-bearing assets.\n\nThe Treasury Committee sets /financial counterparty limits based on their solvency and creditworthiness. Cargotec Treasury actively reviews counterparty risks and, if needed, may reject a counterparty with immediate effect. Only large /financial institutions with a high credit rating are accepted as counterparties. Deposits of liquidity reserves and trading in /financial instruments are only accepted with counterparties con/firmed by the Treasury Committee.\n\nCargotec's total credit risk exposure on 31 December 2022 including credit risk related to both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items amounted to EUR 1,421.6 (1,370.8) million. From the total exposure, EUR 34.6 (17.8) million relates to /financial assets measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss.\n\n## Credit risk position\n\n| 31 Dec 2022                                                  |      | Credit risk   | Credit risk   | Credit risk   | Credit risk   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| MEUR                                                         | Note | Low           | Increased     | High          | Total         |\n| On-balance sheet credit risk from customer  contracts        |      |               |               |               |               |\n| Accounts receivable                                          | 5.3  | 694.9         | 30.5          | 9.3           | 734.7         |\n| Contract assets                                              | 5.3  | 104.0         | -             | -             | 104.0         |\n| Total                                                        |      | 798.8         | 30.5          | 9.3           | 838.7         |\n| On-balance sheet credit risk from other  financial assets    |      |               |               |               |               |\n| Loans receivable and other interest- bearing assets          | 8.2  | 7.0           | 0.3           | -             | 7.3           |\n| Derivative assets (risk after ISDA netting)                  | 8.5  | 32.1          | -             | -             | 32.1          |\n| Equity warrants                                              | 8.5  | 1.1           | -             | -             | 1.1           |\n| Other non-interest-bearing assets                            | 5.3  | 9.8           | -             | -             | 9.8           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                    | 8.3  | 443.4         | -             | 8.4           | 451.9         |\n| Total                                                        |      | 493.4         | 0.3           | 8.4           | 502.2         |\n| Off-balance sheet credit risk from contracts  with customers |      |               |               |               |               |\n| Customer financing                                           | 9.2  | 10.0          | -             | -             | 10.0          |\n| Operating lease receivables                                  | 9.1  | 70.8          | -             | -             | 70.8          |\n| Total                                                        |      | 80.8          | -             | -             | 80.8          |\n| Total credit risk exposure                                   |      | 1,373.0       | 30.9          | 17.7          | 1,421.6       |",

Credit risk related to less than 90 days overdue receivables is considered to be low, and increased if receivables are 90-360 days overdue. Over 360 days overdue customer receivables are classified as high risk. Regarding the other financial assets, the classification to increased or high credit risk is based on an asset-specific credit risk assessment.\n\nThe credit losses recognised in the statement of income amounted to EUR 2.7 (2.4) million of which EUR 3.4 (3.0) million relates to credit losses from customer receivables disclosed in note 5.3, Accounts receivable and other non-interest-bearing assets and EUR -0.7 (-0.7) million of reversals of earlier impairment losses related to loan receivables.\n\nCargotec holds no signi/ficant amounts of external loan receivables except for the EUR 5.4 (31 Dec 2021: 12.4) million vendor note from the associated company Bruks Siwertell Group. Additional information about the vendor note is disclosed in note 8.2 Financial instruments by measurement category.\n\nThe derivative assets and liabilities are presented at their gross fair values as the IFRS offsetting criteria are not met. Cargotec has derivative positions with several banks, and related transactions are effected under the ISDA agreement that allows for settling on a net basis all outstanding items within the scope of the agreement, such as in the event of bankruptcy. At the reporting date, the remaining counterparty risk after net settlement, as allowed by ISDA, was EUR 32.1 (31 Dec 2021: 5.5) million for Cargotec and none (EUR 1.5 million) for the counterparties.\n\nThe maximum credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents corresponds to their carrying amount. According to management assessment, no signi/ficant credit losses are anticipated on the investments of liquidity reserves. The off-balance sheet customer /finance and operating lease receivables are collateralised, and, therefore, the related credit risk is considered to be low.\n\n## Operational risks of the treasury function\n\nThe management of operational risks aims to eliminate losses or increased risk levels due to errors in procedures or insuf/ficient monitoring. The risks are minimised by maintaining a high level of pro/ficiency, identifying and documenting routine procedures and organising responsibilities.\n\nRisks relating to transactions are minimised by conducting regular general assessments and monitoring trading limits, market valuations and daily trade con/firmations.\n\n## Capital structure management\n\nThe goal of Cargotec's capital structure management is to secure operational preconditions at all times and to maintain the optimum capital cost structure. The target capital structure is determined by shareholders and it is regularly monitored by the Board of Directors.",

Financial assets are classi/fied at the initial recognition in accordance with the features and planned use of the asset. Financial assets are presented as non-current when their maturity exceeds one year.\n\nFinancial assets are measured at amortised cost if there is no intention to sell the asset and the expected contractual cash /flow from it is based on interest and repayment of the principal amount. The loans and receivables measured at amortised cost mostly consist of accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents. Loan receivables are measured initially at fair value plus transaction costs and less expected credit losses, and subsequently at amortised cost in accordance with the effective interest method. Changes in the amount of expected credit loss are re/flected in the expected cash /flows included in amortised cost.\n\nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if the asset can be sold before it matures and the contractual cash /flow from it is based on interest and repayment of principal. The /financial assets included in the class are measured initially at fair value plus transaction costs and less expected credit losses, and subsequently at fair value less expected credit losses. Equity instruments can be irrevocably classi/fied into this category on initial recognition after which all subsequent fair value changes are recognised in other comprehensive income except dividends that are recognised in the statement of income. In addition, the effective portion of fair value changes related to derivatives under hedge accounting is measured in accordance with this category throughout the hedge relationship.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss are those /financial assets that do not belong to the previous classes, including equity investments, derivative instruments to which no hedge accounting is applied, and /financial assets held for trading, or from which the expected contractual cash /flows on initial recognition are not solely based on interest and repayment of principal.

Financial liabilities are presented as non-current when their maturity exceeds one year.\n\nFinancial liabilities recognised at fair value through pro/fit or loss include derivative instruments unless hedge accounting is applied. The transaction costs and subsequent fair value changes of /financial liabilities recognised at fair value through pro/fit or loss are recognised directly in the statement of income. Fair value changes related to derivatives under hedge accounting are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and, subsequently, recycled to the statement of income when hedge accounting is ceased.\n\nFinancial liabilities recognised at amortised cost include mainly interest-bearing liabilities and accounts payable. Financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently, at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nBought and sold derivative instruments are recognised on the trade date while transactions with the other /financial liabilities are recognised on the settlement date.\n\nA /financial liability is derecognised when the related obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. When an existing /financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi/fied,\n\nsuch an exchange or modi/fication is treated as derecognition of the original liability and recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of income.\n\n## Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and /financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported on the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions requiring management judgement\n\n## Fair value of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe fair values of /financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined by using valuation techniques. The fair value of the over-the-counter derivatives used for hedging is determined by using a commonly applied valuation technique, and by maximising the use of available market prices. In applying these techniques, judgement is used to select the applied method, and where appropriate, to make assumptions that are mainly based on existing market conditions at the reporting date.\n\nCargotec recognises impairments on customer receivables at the end of the reporting period based on the expected credit losses. Expected credit loss is estimated based on systematic and continuous follow-up as part of the credit risk control that is based on both historical and forward-looking credit loss assessment. Additional information regarding the impairment of accounts receivable is disclosed in note 5.3, Accounts receivable and other non-interest-bearing assets.",

Comparison /figure includes also a vendor loan receivable related to the sale of RCI ownership and a conditional consideration related to a business combination.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include forward exchange contracts subject to hedge accounting. Comparison /figure also includes an equity investment in Jiangsu Rainbow Heavy Industries Co., Ltd (RHI), which was separately classi/fied in this category and was sold in 2022. Fair value changes related to derivatives for which hedge accounting is applied are accumulated in other comprehensive income during hedge accounting and recycled to statement of income when hedge accounting related to sales transaction ceases, and to value of inventory when hedge accounting related to purchase transaction ceases. The recurring measurement of derivative instruments at fair value is based on commonly applied valuation methods and uses observable market-based variables based on which these measurements are categorised in the fair value hierarchy as level 2 fair values.The fair values of other instruments measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss are partly based on non-market based variables, and, therefore, these measurements are categorised in the fair value hierarchy as level 3 fair values. Other items are recognised on balance sheet at amortised cost and information about their fair values is presented under each respective note to the extent that the difference between the book value and fair value is signi/ficant.\n\nLoans receivable and other interest-bearing assets mainly consist of receivables from sales of businesses. The largest of these receivables is a EUR 5.4 (31 Dec 2021: 12.4) million vendor loan related to the sale of Siwertell AB in 2018. Loan repayments are tied to the annual result of Bruks Siwertell Group, and its maximum length is 10 years.

Derivative instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at cost, which equals the fair value, and are subsequently measured at fair value on each balance sheet date. Derivatives are classi/fied at the inception either as hedges of binding agreements and future cash /flows, in which case cash /flow hedge accounting is applied to them, or as derivatives at fair value through pro/fit or loss, when the preconditions for hedge accounting are not fully met.\n\nFair values of foreign currency forward contracts are based on quoted market rates on the balance sheet date. The fair values of cross-currency and interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash /flows. Derivative instruments are presented as non-current when their maturity exceeds one year.\n\nCash /flow hedge accounting is mainly applied to hedges of operative cash /flows. In addition, hedge accounting is applied to hedges of certain foreign currency denominated borrowings. To qualify for hedge accounting, the company documents the hedge relationship of the derivative instruments and the underlying items, group's risk management targets and the strategy of applying hedge accounting. When starting hedge accounting and at least in every interim and annual closing, the company documents and estimates the effectiveness of the hedge by measuring the ability of the hedging instrument to offset changes in fair value of the underlying cash /flow. Because the critical terms of the hedging instrument are set to match with the hedged item as closely as possible, there is typically no inef/ficiency.\n\nFair value changes of hedging instruments under effective cash /flow hedge relationship are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income in the fair value reserve of equity, and under effective net investment hedges through the statement of comprehensive income in the translation differences of equity. However, only the exchange rate difference of foreign currency forward agreements is recognised in other comprehensive income whereas the changes in forward points are recognised as /financial income or expense in the statement of income. Cumulative gain or loss on the hedge recognised through the statement of comprehensive income in fair value reserve or translation differences is recognised in the statement of income simultaneously with the hedged item.

If the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is revoked or exercised, or the relation of the hedging instrument and the underlying item is revoked, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument remains to be recognised in the fair value reserve and is recycled to the statement of income when the underlying operative item materialises. If effectiveness testing results in ineffectiveness, the ineffective portion of the hedges is recognised immediately in the statement of income.\n\nChanges in the fair values of hedges, for which hedge accounting is not applied, are recognised in the statement of income, either in other operating income and expenses, or /financial income and expenses depending on the underlying exposure.\n\n| 31 Dec 2022  MEUR                              | Nominal  value   | Positive   fair value   | Negative   fair value   | Net fair value   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|\n| Non-current                                    |                  |                         |                         |                  |\n| Equity warrants                                | 0.0              | 1.1                     | -                       | 1.1              |\n| Total                                          | 0.0              | 1.1                     | -                       | 1.1              |\n| Current                                        |                  |                         |                         |                  |\n| Currency forwards, cash flow hedge  accounting | 2,687.6          | 17.7                    | 0.2                     | 17.5             |\n| Currency forwards, other                       | 1,617.8          | 21.8                    | 7.2                     | 14.6             |\n| Total                                          | 4,305.3          | 39.5                    | 7.4                     | 32.1             |\n| Total derivatives                              | 4,305.3          | 40.6                    | 7.4                     | 33.2             |\n| 31 Dec 2021  MEUR                              | Nominal  value   | Positive   fair value   | Negative   fair value   | Net fair value   |\n| Non-current                                    |                  |                         |                         |                  |\n| Equity warrants                                | 0.0              | 1.0                     | -                       | 1.0              |\n| Total                                          | 0.0              | 1.0                     | -                       | 1.0              |\n| Current                                        |                  |                         |                         |                  |\n| Currency forwards, cash flow hedge  accounting | 1,868.0          | 1.3                     | 2.1                     | -0.8             |\n| Currency forwards, other                       | 1,087.3          | 9.5                     | 4.8                     | 4.7              |\n| Total                                          | 2,955.3          | 10.8                    | 6.8                     | 4.0              |\n| Total derivatives                              | 2,955.3          | 11.8                    | 6.8                     | 5.0              |\n\nThe derivatives have been recognised at gross fair values in the balance sheet even when entered into with a same counterparty, as the netting agreements related to derivatives allow unconditional netting only in the occurence of credit events, but not in a normal situation.

The distribution of pro/fits proposed by the Board of Directors is recognised as a liability and a deduction of equity once the distribution is approved by Cargotec Corporation's shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nWhen the parent company or its subsidiaries purchase shares of Cargotec Corporation, the consideration paid and directly attributable costs are recognised as a deduction in equity. When such shares are sold, the consideration received, net of directly attributable transaction costs and income tax effect, is included in equity.\n\nTotal equity consists of share capital, share premium, translation differences, fair value reserves, reserve for invested unrestricted equity, retained earnings and non-controlling interest. Share premium includes the amount exceeding the accounting par value of shares received by the company in connection with share subscriptions if the stock options had been decided on under the old Limited Liability Companies Act (29 Sep 1978/734). Translation differences includes translation differences caused by translation of foreign subsidiaries' /financial statements into euro, exchange rate gains and losses from the intercompany loan agreements that form part of a net investment. Fair value reserve includes hedge accounted component of fair value changes of derivatives under hedge accounting. Reserve for invested unrestricted equity includes transactions with treasury shares and share subscriptions with stock options. Retained earnings include pro/fit for the period and previous periods. Paid dividends and donations approved by the Annual General Meeting are deducted from retained earnings. Additionally, retained earnings include actuarial gains and losses from de/fined bene/fit plans, gains and losses on designated share investments measured at fair value, and the cost of equity-settled share-based payments. Share-based payments are described in note 3.2 Share-based payments.\n\n## Shares and share capital\n\nAccording to Cargotec's Articles of Association, the company's share capital is divided into class A and class B shares, both without nominal value. Cargotec Corporation's class B shares are quoted on Nasdaq Helsinki. Cargotec's share capital is fully paid up.\n\nIn the Shareholders' Meeting, each class A share carries one vote, as does each set of ten class B shares, with the provision that each shareholder is entitled to at least one vote. According to the Articles of Association, class B shares earn a higher dividend in dividend distribution than class A shares. The difference between dividends paid on the two classes of shares is a minimum of one (1) cent and a maximum of two and a half (2.5) cents.\n\n| Number of shares                         | Class A  shares   | Class B  shares   | Total      |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|\n| Number of shares 1 Jan 2022              | 9,526,089         | 55,182,079        | 64,708,168 |\n| Number of shares 31 Dec 2022             | 9,526,089         | 55,182,079        | 64,708,168 |\n| Treasury shares 31 Dec 2022              | -                 | -224,840          | -224,840   |\n| Number of shares outstanding 31 Dec 2022 | 9,526,089         | 54,957,239        | 64,483,328 |\n| Number of shares 1 Jan 2021              | 9,526,089         | 55,182,079        | 64,708,168 |\n| Number of shares 31 Dec 2021             | 9,526,089         | 55,182,079        | 64,708,168 |\n| Treasury shares 31 Dec 2021              | -                 | -224,840          | -224,840   |\n| Number of shares outstanding 31 Dec 2021 | 9,526,089         | 54,957,239        | 64,483,328 |\n\n## Dividend distribution\n\nAfter 31 December 2022, the following dividends were proposed by the Board of Directors to be paid: EUR 1.34 per each class A share and EUR 1.35 per outstanding class B share, a total of EUR 86,957,231.91.",

OTHER NOTES\n\n## 9.1 Leases\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Leases, Cargotec as lessee\n\nCargotec leases property, plant and equipment in most of the countries it operates in under contracts that meet the de/finition of a lease. Short-term lease agreements, with contractual and expected lease periods not exceeding 12 months, are accounted for as off-balance sheet leases if there is no purchase option. Also long-term lease agreements in which the underlying leased asset is of low value are accounted for as off-balance sheet leases. Expenses related to these leases are recognised in the statement of income as incurred over the lease period.\n\nLease agreements which do not qualify for the short-term or low-value exemption are recognised on the balance sheet as lease liabilities and right-of-use assets at the commencement of the lease period. Lease liabilities are initially measured at present value by determining the expected reasonably certain lease payments and discounting them with an incremental borrowing rate that is determined separately for the main lease types in each relevant currency. Rent components not directly related to the leased asset are excluded from the lease value on the balance sheet. If a lease has no maturity date, the lease liability is determined based on the enforceable lease period considering the termination rights of both contractual parties. Lease payments are allocated to repayments of lease liabilities and /finance charges so that a constant interest rate on the outstanding balance is obtained. Lease liability is included in the interest-bearing liabilities on the statement of /financial position, and is measured at amortised cost. Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, comprising the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted by lease advances paid or incentives received, initial direct costs, and estimated dismantling, removal and restoration costs at the end of the lease period, if relevant. Right-of-use assets are included in the property, plant and equipment on the statement of /financial position, and they are depreciated over the lease period on a straight-line basis unless the asset is expected to be fully consumed before the end of the lease term or purchased, in which case the depreciation period is determined based on the expected\n\nuseful life of the asset. An off-balance sheet lease commitment becoming onerous leads to a recognition of a separate loss provision, whereas an on-balance sheet lease becoming onerous leads to an impairment of the related right-of-use asset.\n\nLease modi/fications are accounted for either as new lease contracts or as changes in the existing lease contracts depending on the type of the modi/fication. Modi/fications accounted for as changes in the existing leases, and changes in the estimates applied in lease accounting, such as those related to the use of an option to prolong a lease or to purchase a leased asset, trigger a remeasurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset at an updated discount rate. Contractual rent changes tied to indexes also trigger a remeasurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset but without a change in the applied discount rate.\n\n## Leases, Cargotec as lessor\n\nCargotec rents out equipment under contracts that meet the de/finition of a lease, and are accounted for either as operating or /finance leases. In an operating lease the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset remain with the lessor. The leased asset is recognised on the balance sheet according to the nature of the asset. Income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciation of the leased asset is determined by considering the normal depreciation policy of similar assets in own use and the planned use after the lease period.\n\nIn a /finance lease the risks and rewards of ownership are substantially transferred to the lessee. The sales pro/fit is recognised similarly to pro/fit from an outright sale. Finance lease receivables are recognised on the balance sheet at present value. The /financial income relating to the /finance lease contract is recognised in the statement of income over the lease term so as to achieve a constant interest rate on outstanding balance.",

If a lease contract includes an option to prolong or purchase the leased asset, the decision to include or exclude the option in the value of the capitalised lease liability and right-of-use asset is based on an estimate of the likelihood to exercise the option. In practice, the probability to exercise an option is estimated from the needs of the business as part of the real estate management process and taking into account the contractual conditions, leasehold improvements made or needed, and the local market situation. Additional information about the right-of-use assets related to leases is disclosed in notes 6.3, Property, plant and equipment.\n\nCargotec leases property and equipment in most of the countries where it operates. Leased properties include land and buildings mainly for use as of/fices, manufacturing facilities, workshops, and warehouses. The average length of Cargotec's property leases on reporting date is 8.7 (31 December 2021: 8.8) years and contracts typically include an option or options to prolong, or an option to early terminate the lease. Optional lease periods are re/flected in the capitalised value of the leases based on the real estate management process in which the remaining reasonably certain lease period is reassessed on a regular basis, and typically the capitalisation threshold is met, depending on the location and use of the property, from a few months to a couple of years before the end of the ongoing lease period. Leased equipment include mainly vehicles and machines with /fixed rents and lease terms. The average length of Cargotec's equipment leases on reporting date is 2.5 (31 December 2021: 2.7) years. Cargotec lease agreements typically do not include variable rent elements except for the rent escalation clauses tied to in/flation-related indexes. The weighted average discount rate applied to determine the present value of lease liability on reporting date is 5.4 (31 December 2021: 4.1) percent.",

Contingent liabilities also include obligations that are not recognised because their values cannot be measured reliably or because their settlement is not probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of /financial position but are disclosed unless the possibility of an out/flow of economic resources is remote. When an out/flow of economic resources becomes probable and can be reliably measured, a liability is recognised in the statement of /financial position.\n\nContingent assets are possible assets whose existence will be con/firmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events that are not wholly within the control of Newco. Contingent assets are not recognised in the statement of /financial position but are disclosed when it is more likely than not that an in/flow of bene/fits will occur. However, when the in/flow of bene/fits is virtually certain an asset is recognised in the statement of /financial position.\n\nCommitments relate to agreements or pledges to assume a /financial obligation at a future date, or present obligations not recognised in the statement of /financial position.\n\n| MEUR                                                                   | 31 Dec 2022   |   31 Dec 2021 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Guarantees given on behalf of joint ventures and associated  companies | -             |           2.9 |\n| Customer financing                                                     | 10.0          |          13.6 |\n| Off-balance sheet leases                                               | 6.1           |           3.1 |\n| Other contingent liabilities                                           | 1.1           |           2.5 |\n| Total                                                                  | 17.2          |          22.1 |\n\nCargotec Corporation has guaranteed obligations of Cargotec companies arising from ordinary course of business. The total amount of these guarantees on 31 December 2022 was EUR 471.0 (31 Dec 2021: 420.0) million.\n\nContingent liabilities are related to guarantees given by Cargotec in the ordinary course of business for the delivery of products and services. Guarantees are provided in different ways including direct guarantees, bank guarantees, and performance bonds. Various Group entities are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, they are not expected to result in a signi/ficant loss to the Group.\n\nCommitments related to joint ventures and associated companies include committed capital investments and other funding.\n\nCommitments related to leases include commitments related to off-balance sheet leases and on-balance sheet leases not yet commenced, and residual value risk related to equipment sold under customer /finance arrangements and accounted for as leases.\n\n## 9.3 Related-party transactions\n\nCargotec's related parties include the parent company Cargotec Corporation and its subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures. Related parties include also the members of the Board of Directors, the CEO and other members of the Leadership Team, their close family members and entities controlled directly or indirectly by them.

The merger required the approval of competition authorities in a number of countries. In July 2021, the European Commission and the UK Competition and Market Authority announced that they had begun considering the authorisation of the second phase of the proposed arrangement. In August 2021, the Chinese Market Authority approved the merger plan. In December 2021, Cargotec and Konecranes presented a remedy package to the European Commission, including a commitment to divest Konecranes' Lift Truck business and Cargotec's Kalmar Automation Solutions unit. In February 2022, the European Commission approved the proposed package of measures and gave its conditional approval to the merger. In contrast, in March 2022, the UK Competition and Market Authority issued a negative decision on the merger, which led the companies to cancel the merger plan.\n\nBy the end of December 2022, Cargotec had recognised EUR 67 million in merger-related expenses, of which EUR 10 million have been recognised in 2022. Cargotec estimates that the costs associated with the merger will no longer increase.\n\n## 9.5 Events after the reporting period\n\nIn December 2022, Hiab entered into an agreement to acquire the family-owned Swedish industrial group Olsbergs. Olsbergs is the technological leader in the design and manufacture of hydraulic valves and remote control systems. Its solutions are used to manoeuvre Hiab's truck mounted loader cranes and forestry cranes. The closing of the transaction took place on 1 January 2023. As a result of the acquisition, approximately 100 employees transferred to Hiab. The transaction has no material impact on Cargotec's /financial information.",

Accounting principles for the parent company financial statements\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nCargotec Corporation's (1927402-8) /financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Standards (FAS).\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency-denominated receivables and payables outstanding at the end of the /financial period are revaluated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Exchange rate gains/losses relating to operations are treated as adjustments to sales and costs. Exchange rate gains/losses associated with /financial instruments are included in /financing income and expenses.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nSales primarily include internal service charges. Revenue from the service sales is recognised when the services have been rendered.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences between the /financial statements and taxation are calculated using the future period's enacted tax rate at the closing date. Total deferred tax liability is included on the balance sheet in full and deferred tax asset at the estimated probable asset value.\n\nIncome taxes include a tax expense calculated from the taxable income of the period in accordance with the Finnish tax legislation.\n\n## Intangible and tangible assets, amortisation and depreciation\n\nIntangible and tangible assets are stated at original acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and depreciation, and impairment. Amortisation and depreciation are recognised on a straight-line basis in accordance with a predetermined plan based on the estimated useful economic life of assets. The amortisation and depreciation periods based on expected useful economic lives are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Intangible assets 3-10 years\n- \u00b7  Other capitalised expenditure 5-10 years\n- \u00b7  Machinery and equipment 3-5 years\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in the group companies and joint ventures are measured at acquisition cost less accumulated impairment. Other investments, for which fair value cannot be measured reliably due to non-existent public markets or lack of reliable valuation methods, are also mainly measured at acquisition cost less accumulated impairment.\n\n## Loans receivable\n\nLoans receivable include mainly loans to group companies. Loans receivable are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost less impairments in accordance with the effective interest method. Interest income from loans receivable is recognised as /financial income based on the effective interest rate.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash balances, short-term bank deposits and other shortterm liquid investments with maturities up to three months.\n\n## Loans payable\n\nLoans payable are initially recognised as a liability on the balance sheet at an amount received. Transaction costs and interests are recognised as /finance expense in the income statement by applying the effective interest rate.\n\n## Derivative instruments\n\nDerivative instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at cost, which equals their fair value, and subsequently they are measured at fair value on each balance sheet date in accordance with the principles of IFRS, as allowed by FAS, and the fair value changes are recognised in the income statement unless hedge accounting is applied. Fair values of currency forward contracts and cross-currency and interest rate swaps are determined by using commonly applied valuation methods and the valuations are based on observable market data for interest rates and currencies. Derivative instruments maturing after 12 months from the balance sheet date are included in the non-current assets and liabilities. Other derivative instruments are included in the current assets and liabilities.\n\nParent company applies hedge accounting only to hedges of cash /flows associated with foreign currency-denominated loans, in which interest rate swap is used as a hedging instrument. To qualify for hedge accounting, the parent company documents the hedge relationship of the derivative instrument and the related hedged item, the company's risk management targets and the hedging strategy. When starting hedge accounting and at least in every interim and annual closing, the company documents and estimates the effectiveness of the hedge by measuring the ability of the hedging instrument to offset changes in fair value of the underlying asset or cash /flow with respect to the hedged risk.",

Ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Cumulative gain or loss on the hedge deferred to equity is recognised in the income statement as an adjustment to the hedged item during the same period when the hedged item is recognised. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments relating to operative items that no longer are expected to materialise are recognised immediately in the income statement in other operating income/ expenses. If the hedging instrument matures, is sold, the contract is revoked or exercised or the relation of the hedging instrument and the underlying item is revoked, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the underlying operative item materialises.\n\nChanges in the fair values of hedges, for which hedge accounting is not applied, are recognised in the income statement, either in operative income and expenses or /financial income and expenses, depending on the hedged item. Changes in all forward contract fair values due to interest rate changes are always directly recognised in /financial income and expenses.\n\n## Equity\n\nEquity consists of share capital, share premium account, fair value reserves, reserve for invested non-restricted equity and retained earnings, deducted with dividends paid and donations approved at the Annual General Meeting. The amount exceeding the accounting par value of shares received by the company in connection with share subscriptions was recorded in share premium account under the old Limited Liability Companies Act (29 Sep 1978/734). Fair value reserves include the cumulative spot-component of the changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments de/fined as cash /flow hedges. Under the new (1 Sep 2006) Limited Liability Companies Act (21 Jul 2006/624), when stock options are exercised, the amount received is recorded in reserve for invested non-restricted equity. Changes in treasury shares are recorded in reserve for invested non-restricted equity. The net pro/fit/loss for the period is recorded in retained earnings.\n\n## Statutory provisions\n\nStatutory provisions are expenses to which the parent company is committed and that are not likely to generate the corresponding revenue, or losses, which are regarded as evident.\n\n## 2. Finance risk management\n\nThe parent company manages the /finance risks of the group and operates under the same policies and instructions as the group.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe parent company's treasury function operates as an internal bank for the group's subsidiaries. The parent company's currency exposure originates mainly from foreign currency funding given to subsidiaries and foreign currency loans taken by the parent company. In addition, the currency position includes internal forward agreements with the subsidiaries and external forward agreements. Foreign exchange differences arising from these transactions are booked in the statement of income in the /finance items. Furthermore, the parent company invoices the group companies for the services provided. Foreign exchange differences from these invoices are booked in the parent company's operational pro/fit.\n\nThe parent company's open currency exposure on 31 December 2022 was, in absolute terms, EUR 10.3 (31 Dec 2021: 7.5) million.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe parent company's interest rate risk originates from external loans and internal loans and deposits. The pricing of intercompany transactions is based on transfer pricing rules, and internal interest income and expenses are eliminated on group level. As a result, interest rate risk is not measured separately on parent company level, and the information presented in the consolidated /finance statements regarding interest risk and its management is the same for the parent company.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\nThe majority of the group's derivatives, loans and cash equivalents belong to the parent company. The maturity structure of these /finance liabilities is not separately followed on parent company level, because the information presented in the consolidated /finance statements provides a fair view of the liquidity and funding risk. Only account payables and account receivables vary signi/ficantly between the parent company and the group.\n\n## Credit and counterparty risk\n\nThe parent company's accounts receivable and loan receivables originate mainly from the other group companies, and the parent company is therefore not exposed to a counterparty risk.\n\nCargotec did not have external loan receivables on 31 December 2022  (31 Dec 2021: 10.1 million), and cash and equivalents EUR 281.9 (31 Dec 2021: 286.1) million. The parent company's cash and equivalents are held in banks that have a solid credit rating and are approved by the Treasury Committee. More information about the credit risk related to derivatives is disclosed in the note 8.1 in the consolidated /finance statements.\n\n## Operational risks of the treasury function\n\nThe treasury function operates as part of the parent company, and applies the same risk management goals as the group.",

Additionally in 2021 two members of the Cargotec's Board of Directors received each an EUR 150,000 compensation based on a separate consulting agreement for the merger related preparation work.\n\nThe salaries and remunerations paid to the CEO, including base salary, fringe bene/fits, shortterm incentive payout and taxable income from the share-based incentive programme 2020 and third instalment of the matching share programme 2019-2022 (2021: share-based incentive programme 2019 and second instalment of the matching share programme 2019-2022), totalled EUR 1,521,073 (2,453,614). The CEO is entitled to a supplemental de/fined contribution pension bene/fit. According to the pension agreement, the CEO is entitled to retire at the age of 65. If the CEO's service ends before the retirement age of 65 determined in the pension agreement, the CEO is entitled to begin taking the supplemental pension at the age of 62. He received in 2022 a supplemental pension contribution of EUR 700,000.

The /financial statements comprise the consolidated balance sheet, statement of income, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash /flows and notes, including summaries of signi/ficant accounting policies, as well as the parent company's balance sheet, statement of income, statement of cash /flows and notes.\n\nIn our opinion\n\n- \u00b7  the consolidated /financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's /financial position as well as its /financial performance and its cash /flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU.\n- \u00b7  the /financial statements give a true and fair view of the parent company's /financial performance and /financial position in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of /financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements.\n\nOur opinion is consistent with the additional report submitted to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland. Our responsibilities under good auditing practice are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to our audit, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nIn our best knowledge and understanding, the non-audit services that we have provided to the parent company and group companies are in compliance with laws and regulations applicable in Finland regarding these services, and we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of regulation (EU) 537/2014. The non-audit services that we have provided have been disclosed in note 2.3 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the /financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the /financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nWe have ful/filled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the /financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the /financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying /financial statements.\n\nWe have also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls. This includes consideration of whether there was evidence of management bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.",

The percentage of completion is determined either by reference to the individual contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract cost or by completion of a certain physical milestone.\n\nThe Group has significant projects, where revenue is recognized over time, in the Kalmar and MacGregor segments. In year 2022, approximately 11 % percent of total sales of 4,1 billion euro was recognized on an over time basis.\n\nThe recognition of revenue and the estimation of the outcome of a project require significant management judgment, in particular with respect to estimating the stage of completion and cost to complete.\n\nThe Group makes several types of provisions related to risks associated with long-term contracts and revenue recognition over time. These provisions require high level of management judgment and are a key audit matter due to that reason.\n\nBased on above, revenue recognition over time, including project related provisions, was a key audit matter. Revenue recognition over time was also a significant risk of material misstatement referred to in EU Regulation No 537/2014, point (c) of Article 10(2).\n\n## HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER\n\nOur audit procedures in connection with project related provisions, and to address the risk of material misstatement in respect of the revenue recognition over time, included, among others:\n\n- \u00b7  Assessment of the Group's accounting policies over revenue recognition over time and recognition of project related provisions;\n- \u00b7  Gaining an understanding of the revenue recognition process including related provisions;\n- \u00b7  Inspecting on a sample basis the project documentation such as contracts and other written communication;\n- \u00b7  Testing on a sample basis the percentage of completion and provision calculations as well as comparing the estimates to actuals;\n- \u00b7  Evaluation of financial development and current status by\n- \u00b7  analyzing the changes in assumptions relating to estimated revenues, costs, and related provisions and receipts of project payments, and\n- \u00b7  discussions with different levels of the organization including project level, segment and group management; and\n- \u00b7  Assessing the Group's disclosures in respect of revenue recognition and related provisions.\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTER\n\n## HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER\n\n## Valuation of goodwill\n\nThe accounting principles and disclosures relating to goodwill are included in notes 2.7 and 6.1.\n\nAt the balance sheet date December 31, 2022, the value of goodwill amounted to 892,1 million euros of which 268,1 million euros relate to Kalmar, 231,4 million euros to Hiab and 392,6 million to MacGregor.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. Due to the current uncertainty in the financial operating environment, MacGregor's goodwill has been tested for impairment on a quarterly basis. An impairment amounting to 63,4 million euro has been recognized relating to MacGregor's goodwill in 2022.\n\nThe annual impairment testing of goodwill was performed for Kalmar, Hiab and MacGregor segments. The impairment testing was based on the management's estimate about the value-in-use for Kalmar and Hiab segments and based on the management's estimate about fair value less cost to sell for MacGregor segment. There are a number of assumptions used to determine the value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell of the cash generating units, including revenue growth, margins and the discount rate applied on net cash-flows. The estimated value-inuse and fair value less cost to sell may vary significantly when underlying assumptions are changed and the changes in above-mentioned individual assumptions may result in an impairment of goodwill.\n\nThe valuation of goodwill was a key audit matter because the annual impairment testing required management judgment with respect to the key assumptions used and because of the significance of goodwill to the financial statements.\n\nValuation of goodwill related to the MacGregor segment is also a significant risk of material misstatement as defined by EU Regulation No 537/2014, point (c) of Article 10(2).\n\nOur audit procedures to address the risk of material misstatement in respect of valuation of goodwill included among others\n\n- \u00b7  Involvement of our valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the key assumptions used in impairment testing by comparing management's assumptions to externally derived data and to our independently calculated industry averages, in particular those relating to\n- \u00b7  the forecasted revenue growth,\n- \u00b7  the forecasted margin and\n- \u00b7  the weighted average cost of capital used to discount the net cash-flows.\n- \u00b7  Testing of the accuracy of the impairment calculations prepared by the management and comparison of the sum of discounted cash flows against Cargotec's market capitalization.\n- \u00b7  Evaluation of the adequacy of disclosures of the impairment testing results.",

The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of /financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the /financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability to continue as going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The /financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the /financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the parent company's or the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or the group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the /financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the /financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the /financial statements give a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7  Obtain suf/ficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the /financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated /financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi/ficant audit /findings, including any signi/ficant de/ficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signi/ficance in the audit of the /financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene/fits of such communication.",

Investor Relations is responsible for planning and executing /financial and investor communications at Cargotec, and all investor requests are processed centrally through Cargotec's Investor Relations.\n\nThe Investor Relations function prepares Cargotec's /financial statements and quarterly reviews, develops the investor website and writes stock exchange releases. It also organises roadshows, investor meetings and events, seminars, news conferences of result publications, as well as site visits, and participates in annual general meeting arrangements.\n\nInvestor Relations leads the Capital Markets Day and other IR events arrangements for investors and analysts. It also gathers and analyses market information and investor feedback to be used by Cargotec's management and the Board of Directors.\n\nInvestor relations prepares videos, blogs, podcasts etc. about current topics, such as about interim reports or speci/fic events. All material can be found from Cargotec website's Investor section.\n\n## Silent period\n\nCargotec follows a three-week silent period prior to publication of an interim report or /financial statements. During this time, Cargotec spokespersons do not comment on the company's /financial situation, market, or future outlook, hold any meetings with investors or analysts or attend any investor conferences. Before the silent periods in 2022, Cargotec hosted pre-silent calls and distributed a newsletter to the /financial markets' participants following Cargotec, which was also published on Cargotec's webpage.\n\n## Investor relations in 2022\n\nIn 2022, we have kept up our active engagement with the /financial markets. Investor and analyst meetings organised by Cargotec's investor relations were held virtually and physically. When virtually, participants convened online via various web conferencing applications while the material was distributed virtually to meeting participants. Physical meetings were also held throughout the year in Helsinki, but also in connection with roadshows, events, seminars and site visits in Finland and abroad in the USA, UK, Canada, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Sweden.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCargotec hosted a site visit in conjunction with the Capital Markets Day, which took 15 participants to Hiab's Raisio Product Supply Center. The visit provided insight to the whole Hiab portfolio and was well received among participants.\n\nIn total, the Investor Relations function organised dozens of meetings in 2022. The team members hosted the meetings and many meetings were attended by Cargotec's CEO Mika Vehvil\u00e4inen or CFO Mikko Puolakka, giving insight about Cargotec as an investment to those attending the meetings. In addition, Cargotec's Investor Relations function participated in various investor meetings organised by brokerage /firms; in many cases Cargotec's CEO or CFO was also attending these meetings.\n\nIn March, Cargotec's Annual General Meeting was held virtually. The Annual General Meeting approved a distribution of a dividend of EUR 1.08 for each outstanding class B shares. The dividend payment day was 28 March 2022.\n\nLater in March, Cargotec refocused its strategy for higher /financial performance through sustainability and growth in pro/fitable core businesses. Cargotec announced its refocused strategy on 30 March following the cancellation of the planned merger with Konecranes the day before. The announcement included actions, most importantly that Cargotec will focus on sustainability and growth in pro/fitable core businesses Hiab, Kalmar Mobile Solutions and",

Cargotec also initiated an evaluation of strategic options of MacGregor including a potential sale of the business, and announced an exit from Kalmar Heavy Port Cranes, both of which have now been completed.\n\nAs a highlight of the year, Cargotec's Capital Markets Day (CMD) was held in Helsinki on 15 November. Cargotec is prepared to continue its pro/fitable growth by solving customers' sustainability challenges.\n\nAbout 30 investors and analysts participated in the event on site, hearing leadership presentations and insights about Cargotec's core business Hiab and Kalmar prospects for the future, and the company ambitions in sustainability, service, technology and innovation. Read more about the event from Cargotec's IR blog here.\n\nOn the next day after the CMD, 15 participants climbed on a bus and took a ride to Raisio, Western Finland, to see and hear about Hiab business area's assembly unit activities there. The Raisio unit focuses on assembling Hiab's world leading Multilift hooklifts, a demountables solution. Read the story at Cargotec's IR blog.\n\nIn November, Cargotec also hosted a group of Finnish investors at Kalmar's Technology and Competence Centre in Tampere, providing hands-on experience with Kalmar's automation, electri/fication and digitalisation capabilities.\n\nCargotec hosted a group of investors at Kalmar customer Cabooter Group's intermodal terminal in Venlo, NL. Key takeaways from the visit were how Kalmar and the customer work together to solve sustainability challenges, strong growth prospects of the intermodal transportation in Europe and the essential role of Kalmar services to keep its customers' operations running 24/7.\n\nIn December, Cargotec IR function hosted the traditional Cargotec Christmas lunch meeting for analysts. The meeting was arranged again as a hybrid meeting where the participants were able to attend the meeting either in person in Helsinki, Finland, or virtually, participating in the discussion of CEO remarks over the web. Cargotec's CEO Mika Vehvil\u00e4inen and CFO Mikko Puolakka were present in the meeting with majority of analysts covering the company attending.\n\nCargotec's IR function also visited Tampere, where the Pirkanmaa shareholders' associations hosted a company introduction event on Cargotec and offered us a chance to meet with the investors and to answer questions directly. Cargotec's refocused strategy was well received among retail investors and many of the investors were also interested about Cargotec's strong presence in Tampere, home of Kalmar Technology & Competence Centre.\n\nIn 2022, the Investor Relations section on Cargotec's website was in many ways the centre of investor relations activities. The related material generated during the year was collected there (not forgetting extensive material from previous years). As examples, the material includes the investor presentation (updated regularly), interim report material (videos, webcasts, transcripts, presentation materials, reports, podcasts), and AGM materials, many of which the Investor Relations team also has created.\n\n## Cargotec IR in social media\n\nThe Investor Relations team produced 24 videos in 2022. The videos presented Cargotec's operations from many perspectives, covering interim report information and business areas, as well as strategy development during the year. At the end of 2022, the videos have been viewed about 5,000 times on Cargotec's Youtube channel.\n\nThe Investor Relations team wrote seven blog texts in 2022, which were published on the company website www.cargotec.com. The blog topics ranged from interim report Q&A, CMD reportage, retail investor Q&A, implications of Russia's attack on Ukraine and management remuneration policy.\n\nCargotec's LinkedIn account is quite popular, with almost 47,000 people currently following the company's activities through this channel. The number of Cargotec followers in LinkedIn increased by nearly 17 percent during the year. The IR team actively updates LinkedIn, providing updates about Cargotec and its business area events, /financial releases and other topics of interest to LinkedIn users.\n\nWith the aim to continuously improve investor relations, the IR team executed several development projects during 2022. As an example, we expanded the availability of information to investors with pre-silent videos and IR Blog articles. The IR newsletter service was actively developed as well during the year.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nRegi's IR Nordic Markets 2022-study shortlisted Cargotec to top-10 list in both Best Company and Best ESG-ratings in Finland.
