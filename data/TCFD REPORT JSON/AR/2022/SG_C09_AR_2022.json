We also substantially sold our existing inventory and completed four site acquisitions to replenish our landbank.\n\nOverseas, we continued to expand our Living Sector portfolio in our key markets of Australia, Japan and the UK. To build scale and leverage the rising demand for rental accommodation, we acquired two Private Rented Sector (PRS) development sites in Australia, three newly-built PRS projects in Japan and six Purpose-Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) assets in the UK.\n\nPROPERTY DEVELOPMENT\n\nSingapore\n\nSold\n\n1,487 UNITS*\n\nSales Value\n\n$ 2.9 BILLION*\n\nRESIDENTIAL LAUNCH PIPELINE\n\n>2,000 UNITS\n\nin Singapore*\n\nGLOBAL LIVING SECTOR PORTFOLIO Operational & Under Development\n\nPRS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2,288 UNITS\n\n- * Includes ECs and share of joint venture (JV) partners.\n\n^\n\n- Based on 8,578 new units (including ECs) sold in 2022, according to Urban Redevelopment Authority data.\n\nMarket Share\n\n17.3 % ^\n\nPBSA\n\n2,368\n\nBEDS\n\n<!-- image -->",

Beyond physical upgrades, such as a new alfresco dining area fronting Orchard Road, we also introduced our proprietary CityNexus smart building app to enhance our tenants' daily operations.\n\nIn Thailand, we completed the Phase 1 revamp of Jungceylon Shopping Center in Patong, Phuket, welcoming the return of both domestic and international tourists with a range of exciting new lifestyle attractions.\n\n## GLOBAL PORTFOLIO\n\n## 21 MILLION SQ FT\n\nTotal gross floor area in residential for lease, commercial and hospitality assets\n\nTOTAL ASSETS\n\n$ 23 BILLION\n\nUS 8%\n\nOthers 14%\n\nASSETS BY GEOGRAPHY\n\nChina 14%\n\nUK\n\n15%\n\nSingapore 49%\n\nDevelopment\n\nProperties 42% Others 6%\n\nASSETS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT\n\nHotel\n\n25%\n\nInvestment Properties 27%\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our innovation and digitalisation efforts continue to elevate our product offerings, strengthen our value proposition and enhance the customer experience.\n\nFund management forms an integral part of our transformation strategy. Besides nurturing existing listed platforms like CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT) and IREIT Global, we continue to seek out attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our value proposition and expand our offerings.\n\nIn the UK, we grew our commercial asset portfolio by strategically acquiring trophy assets that will allow us the option to inject our portfolio into listed or unlisted platforms at an opportune time. With our latest acquisition of the sizeable St Katharine Docks prime freehold estate, the total value of our UK commercial assets has increased to around \u00a31 billion.\n\n## FUND MANAGEMENT\n\nAssets Under Management (AUM)\n\nUS$ 3.1 BILLION\n\nPORTFOLIO RESTRUCTURING TO UNLOCK VALUE Distribution in specie (DIS) of\n\n144.2 MILLION CDLHT Units\n\nto CDL shareholders, completed in May\n\nDividend from DIS\n\n20.2 CENTS per share based on $1.27 per CDLHT Unit on 25 May\n\n## INNOVATION STRATEGY\n\nDriving business transformation through diversified platforms\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  include  the record sale of Millennium Hilton Seoul and the completion of the collective sale of Tanglin Shopping Centre in 2022 - both held by M&C.\n\nSpurred by the continued recovery and restored confidence in global travel, our hotel operations made a strong rebound in 2022, having recovered in most markets to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. The segment is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory, riding on the return of corporate travel and unabated pent-up demand for leisure travel.\n\nWe also continue to enhance our hospitality offerings and revitalise our assets through AEIs and repositionings, focusing on revenue generation and asset yield optimisation. Several key hotels will be rebranded to M Social. These include M Social Hotel Phuket, M Social Hotel Downtown, New York and M Social Hotel Knightsbridge, London.\n\nGLOBAL HOSPITALITY PORTFOLIO\n\nOver 150 hotels\n\n## STRONG REBOUND IN GLOBAL OPERATIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our  unwavering commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) integration for close to 30 years has helped us to mitigate climate  risks,  meet  rising  investor  expectations  and  open new  growth  opportunities  by  tapping  into  fast-growing sustainable investment and finance.\n\nIn 2022, we completed our third Climate Change Scenario Study. As one of the first four companies in Singapore to adopt the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in 2017, the study aims for us to be future-ready for physical and transitional risks. Given the rising urgency, scale, and severity of climate change, we expanded the scope and markets included under the CDL Group. The study also considered the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a prolonged and significant impact on business operations, financial performance and related climate risks and trends.\n\n## NET ZERO CARBON COMMITMENT\n\nFirst Singapore real estate developer to sign the World Green Building Council's Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment with whole life-cycle approach in two phases:\n\n- -2030: New developments and assets under direct management and control in Singapore\n- -2050: All buildings to be net zero carbon\n\n## SINGAPORE GOVERNANCE AND TRANSPARENCY INDEX 2022\n\nout of\n\n489\n\ncompanies\n\n#4\n\n## 120 BCA GREEN MARK\n\nCertifications for our developments and office interiors\n\n## ACHIEVED ENERGY SAVINGS OF\n\n>$ 38 MILLION from energy-efficient retrofitting and initiatives across all our managed buildings from 2012 to 2022\n\nCITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nCOLLAPSE OF MARINE FOOD WEBS\n\nMarine life is not only impacted by overfishing and pollution, but also impacted when waters warm and currents shift. The warming of our ocean could eventually cause marine food webs to collapse.\n\nThe collapse of marine food webs jeopardises the livelihoods of over one billion people that depend on the sea for sustenance.\n\nSEA ICE LOSS\n\nSea  ice,  which  forms  when seawater freezes each polar winter, is melting and thinning more and more each summer.\n\nSea  ice  loss  threatens  the survival of animals that live  on  and  below  the  sea ice  platform.  Likewise,  the livelihoods of communities in the Polar regions will suffer.\n\n## SEA LEVEL RISE\n\nAs global warming continues, it  is  inevitable  that  massive ice sheets  and  glaciers  in Greenland  and  Antarctica  will collapse and  melt  entirely, eventually pouring enough water into the ocean to raise global  sea  levels  by  several metres.\n\nSea level rise poses an imminent risk to many coastal cities  such  as  Singapore,  San Francisco,  Shanghai,  Sydney, Jakarta.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNISED ON 14 LEADING GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY RATINGS, RANKINGS AND INDEXES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOnly Company in Southeast Asia & Hong Kong to Maintain Double 'A's for Climate Change (since 2018) & Water Security (since 2019); Only Singapore Company to Score an A in 2022\n\nESG Regional Top Rated and Industry Top Rated in 2022\n\nCDL Green Gallery | Singapore\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop 8% amongst CDP Participants for Supplier Engagement on Climate Change\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2 nd in Asia (Diversified Office/Retail); GRESB 5-star rating\n\nOnly Singapore Real Estate Company since 2018\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWorld's Top Real Estate Management & Development Company; Top Singapore Company; Only Singapore Company Listed for 13 Consecutive Years; Ranked 5th overall in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'AAA' rating since 2010\n\nSince 2018\n\nTop-ranked Singapore Company in Equileap Gender Equality in Asia-Pacific Special Report 2022, and top-ranked Singapore Company globally in 2021\n\nSince 2014\n\nOnly Singaporebased Developer listed since 2022\n\nESG Leaders Index ESG Transparency Index since 2016\n\nRISING SEA TEMPERATURE\n\nAbout 90% of the excess heat trapped  by  atmospheric greenhouse gases is absorbed by our  ocean.  Warmer  waters  also hold  less  carbon  dioxide,  which means  more  will  stay  in  the atmosphere,  accelerating  global warming.\n\n90%  of  coral  reefs  may  perish by 2050 - this directly imperils the livelihoods of coastal communities that depend on reef fishes for sustenance.\n\nDow Jones Sustainability Indices (World) from 20112021, and Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (Asia-Pacific) since 2011; S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2022 Member\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRated Prime since 2018\n\nCHANGES IN OCEAN CURRENTS\n\nOcean  currents  are  vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Slower  ocean  currents  change the  Earth's  atmosphere,  and consequently, the weather.\n\nOcean  currents  change  affects food sources for fishes, marine mammals, and sea birds, which inherently  impacts  the  entire food chain.",

        "page_content": "## CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nThe Group delivered a record net profit of $1.3 billion for FY 2022, the highest ever since the Group's inception in 1963 (restated FY 2021: $84.7 million).\n\nPrudent divestments and strong operational performance from our core business segments drove the Group's stellar earnings. In FY 2022, we realised significant capital gains from our successful divestments of several major properties held at book value over a long period of time - a testament to the Group's ability to extract value at the most opportune time.\n\nRevenue increased by 25.4% to $3.3 billion for FY 2022 (FY 2021: $2.6 billion). While our property development segment remained the biggest contributor, the significant jump in FY 2022 revenue was propelled by our hotel operations segment, which registered a 58.1% increase in revenue and a 91% growth in revenue per available room (RevPAR), spurred by the post-pandemic travel rebound in the hospitality sector.\n\nIn Singapore, we remained a market leader for private home sales with a strong development pipeline. Our asset rejuvenation and portfolio enhancement initiatives achieved improved occupancies and positive rental reversions, and we pushed ahead to build scale in new growth areas, like the Living Sector.\n\n2023 marks the Group's Diamond Jubilee. Over the past six decades, the  Group  has  weathered  many economic storms, property cycles and unprecedented disruptions, but we have always tackled the odds head-on and successfully emerged stronger.\n\nThe Board and Management will continue to apply this same discipline and tenacity in executing our G rowth, E nhancement and T ransformation ( GET ) strategy and bring CDL to greater heights.\n\nNet Asset Value (NAV) per share increased 9.7% to $10.16 as at 31 December 2022 (restated 31 December 2021: $9.26). The Group adopts the policy of stating our investment and hotel properties at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Had fair value gains on the Group's investment properties been factored in, the Group's Revalued NAV (RNAV) per share would be $16.98 (restated 31 December 2021: $15.73). Had the revaluation surpluses of our hotels been included, the Group's RNAV per share would be $19.14 (restated 31 December 2021: $18.63).\n\nWith a strong balance sheet, the Group is well-positioned for strategic acquisition opportunities in our key markets.\n\n## Resilient Business Performance\n\nIn 2022, all our operating segments reported strong performance. For our property development business, the Group, together with our joint venture (JV) associates, sold 1,487 units, including Executive Condominiums (ECs), with a total sales value of $2.9 billion in Singapore.\n\nThe Group's office portfolio in Singapore reported a committed occupancy of 95.2%, above the island-wide occupancy of 88.7%. Our retail portfolio also remained healthy, with a committed occupancy of 96.1%, higher than the island-wide occupancy of 92.9%. The gain in traction from the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, coupled with the reopening of global economies in 2022, injected much vibrancy into the retail sector once again.\n\nWhile Singapore will always be the Group's home ground and core market, we continue to pursue our strategic diversification push to build our portfolio in our key overseas markets of Australia, China, Japan and the UK. On this front, we expanded our Living Sector portfolio in 2022, which our Group CEO will elaborate on more in his statement.\n\nOur hotel operations segment reported a strong performance in FY 2022. The Group's hotel RevPAR grew 91% to $137.9 (FY 2021: $72.2), attributable to higher room rates and improved occupancies across all geographies. Notably, hotels in London, Singapore and New York outperformed in 2022. Average Gross\n\n## ENERGISED FOR GROWTH\n\nIt has been three tumultuous years since COVID-19 emerged and dramatically altered how we live, work and operate. Fortunately, a sense of normalcy has returned. And while market uncertainties persist,  given  near-term  economic headwinds and ongoing challenges, including geopolitical tensions, inflation and interest rate hikes, we will remain steadfast in repositioning and growing our business.\n\nOur hospitality arm, led by Millennium and Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C), continues to be a key growth engine for the Group. We remain a sizeable hotel owner and operator with a diversified portfolio of over 150 hotels worldwide, many located in key gateway cities.\n\nWith pent-up travel demand and the easing of travel restrictions in most regions, we witnessed a strong recovery momentum in the hospitality sector in 2022. Our hotel operations have since recovered in most markets to prepandemic levels, a marker of the restored confidence in global travel.\n\n## Divestments and Capital Management\n\nThe Group recorded a pre-tax profit of $1.9 billion for FY 2022 (restated FY 2021: $214.8 million). The extraordinary gains were driven by the distribution in specie of 144.2 million stapled securities in CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT), resulting in the accounting deconsolidation of CDLHT from a subsidiary to an associate in May 2022 and the recognition of a total gain (inclusive of negative goodwill) of $492.4 million. The sale of properties amounting to $1.26 billion mainly from the record sale of Millennium Hilton Seoul and its adjoining land site in February 2022 and the completion of the collective sales of Tanglin Shopping Centre and Golden Mile Complex in 2H 2022, where the Group owns share values and strata areas, also bolstered our pre-tax gains.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group maintained a sizeable war chest with cash reserves of $2.4 billion, and cash and available undrawn committed bank facilities totalling $4.1 billion. After factoring in fair value on investment properties, the Group's net gearing ratio stands at 51% (FY 2021: 61%).\n\nOperating Profit (GOP) margin improved by 11.3 percentage points to 30.8%, surpassing FY 2019 levels, primarily led by the UK, US and Singapore markets.\n\n## Portfolio Sharpening\n\nWith a focus on revenue generation and asset yield optimisation, the Group continued to enhance our hospitality offerings and revitalise our assets through Asset Enhancement Initiatives (AEIs) and repositionings.\n\nIn Singapore, we completed the renovation of all 360 guestrooms at Studio M Hotel in May 2022. In Q4 2022, Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel in Singapore commenced its phased refurbishment for its 550 guestrooms and public areas.\n\nIn Thailand, in tandem with the ongoing AEI of the Group's Jungceylon Shopping Center in Phuket, Millennium Resort Patong  Phuket  started  renovating its  418  guestrooms  and  common areas. The hotel will be rebranded as M Social Hotel Phuket - the first M Social property in Thailand. Completion works for both assets are expected by 2H 2023.\n\nLooking ahead, other AEIs in the pipeline include a major renovation for Millennium Downtown New York, which will be rebranded to M Social Hotel Downtown, New York and the Millennium Knightsbridge London, which will be rebranded to M Social Hotel Knightsbridge, London.\n\nIn Singapore, the Group plans to unveil our newest hotel, The Singapore EDITION, in 2H 2023. The iconic eight-storey 204-room hotel on Cuscaden Road is EDITION's first hotel in Southeast Asia, a unique concept in the lifestyle hotel space conceived by Ian Schrager and Marriott International. Over in China, the 295-room five-star M Social Suzhou is scheduled to open in Q2 2023.\n\nRiding on the return of corporate travel and unabated pent-up demand for leisure travel, our hospitality segment will continue to strengthen and is poised to be a star performer for the year ahead, contributing meaningfully to our recurring earnings. A key focus for the hospitality portfolio will be to accelerate plans for asset optimisation, alignment with the Group's sustainability goals and driving growth.\n\n## APPRECIATION\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to all our shareholders, customers, business associates and partners for your continued support in our journey.\n\nTo my fellow Directors, I am grateful for your invaluable contributions, counsel and stewardship as we strive to grow our Group to its fullest potential.\n\nWe welcomed Mr Tan Kian Seng as the latest member to the Board, pursuant to his appointment as an Independent Non-Executive Director in March 2023. With his qualifications in finance and extensive experience in the hospitality and manufacturing sectors, his appointment would further strengthen the Board's core competencies, especially in the areas of hospitality and finance, which are identified in the Board's skills matrix.\n\nTo our shareholders, thank you for your confidence in the Group. For FY 2022, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 8.0 cents per share and a special final ordinary dividend of 8.0 cents per share. Together with the special interim ordinary dividend of 12.0 cents per share paid in September 2022, the total cash dividend for FY 2022 amounts to 28.0 cents per share.\n\nFinally, to the Management and staff, thank you for your unwavering dedication, hard work and commitment. Your tenacity in navigating the business challenges reflects the Group's spirit of enterprise and resilience.\n\nDespite the ever-changing macroeconomic landscape and inherent market unpredictability, we are confident that growth opportunities will always exist. Our Group remains poised to capitalise on these as they arise. We have gleaned from our past experiences and emerged stronger from each challenge. We are determined to pursue our strategic initiatives with nimbleness, pragmatism and a conviction to steer the Group towards sustained growth.\n\nKwek Leng Beng Executive Chairman",

        "page_content": "## GROUP CEO'S STATEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\n2022 was an exceptional year for the CDL Group. We unlocked significant shareholder value through strategic divestments and improved operational performance, achieving record earnings and marking a strong comeback after three years of living under the shadow of the pandemic.\n\nThe Group continues to steadfastly execute on our G rowth, E nhancement and T ransformation (GET) strategy that we unveiled in 2018, growing our traditional development and investment portfolio while accelerating our expansion into the Living Sector, both domestically and overseas.\n\nUnderscoring our conviction in the Living Sector's immense growth potential, namely  in  asset  classes  such  as multi-family rental apartments (also called the Private Rented Sector or PRS), Purpose-Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) and workers' dormitories, we made further inroads to expand our portfolio in this sector, bolstering our recurring income and creating potential fund management opportunities.\n\nTo drive performance and maximise value, we also implemented various\n\nAsset Enhancement Initiatives (AEIs) across our commercial and hospitality portfolio in Singapore and overseas.\n\nOur efforts to integrate and align the Group's core businesses have enhanced our operational efficiency and execution. Going forward, we will continue to sharpen our value proposition to grow market share and maximise value to all stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ENERGISED\n\n## GROWTH\n\nBuilding a development pipeline while strengthening recurring income\n\n## ENHANCEMENT\n\nEnhancing asset value and driving operational efficiency\n\n## TRANSFORMATION\n\nTransforming via strategic investments, fund management and innovation\n\nIn June 2022, we made our initial foray into the PBSA sector by acquiring Infinity, a 505bed asset in Coventry, UK. Subsequently, we acquired five more UK PBSA assets in Birmingham, Canterbury, Coventry, Leeds and Southampton in December 2022. With the completion of these acquisitions, our UK PBSA portfolio comprises six assets with about 2,400 beds.\n\nIn  Q4  2022,  our  UK  PRS  project  in Leeds, The Junction, obtained sectional completion for three out of five blocks and we recently welcomed our first batch of residents. Construction of The Octagon, our 370-unit PRS project located in the heart of Birmingham, is in progress with an estimated completion in 2025.\n\nOver in Japan, we acquired three newlybuilt PRS assets totalling 271 units in Yokohama and Osaka in 2022. This brings our PRS portfolio in Japan to eight assets in operation, comprising 513 units. To leverage the rising demand for rental accommodation in Australia, we also acquired two PRS development sites in Brisbane's Toowong riverside suburb and Melbourne's Southbank, totalling around 490 apartments. The construction of both projects is targeted to commence in 2H 2023.\n\n## Revitalising Our Portfolio\n\nAsset  rejuvenation  and  portfolio enhancement are key pillars of the Group's GET strategy. We tirelessly explore ways to derive more value from our asset portfolio, including AEIs, asset repositionings and redevelopment opportunities.\n\nIn 2022, we completed the AEI at Palais Renaissance, which included creating a unique alfresco dining area on the first floor and more F&B offerings. Beyond physical upgrades, we also introduced our proprietary CityNexus smart building app to enhance our tenants' daily operations - making Palais Renaissance the first retail property in CDL's portfolio to feature this digital solution. The AEI at our King's Centre office building was also completed within the year.\n\nIn Thailand, the Phase 1 revamp of Jungceylon Shopping Center in Patong, Phuket, was unveiled in December to welcome the return of both domestic and international tourists with a range of exciting new lifestyle attractions. The remaining phases of the AEI are on track for completion by the end of 2023.\n\n## EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS\n\nIn  2022,  CDL  continued  to  seize opportunities in our home market of Singapore to replenish our landbank, ensuring a stable launch pipeline and optimal inventory levels. Through selective land replenishment efforts, we now have a diversified pipeline of over 2,000 units in Singapore, ranging from suburban to luxury projects.\n\nWe secured four sites within the year, two via the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. In January 2022, we acquired a GLS site at Jalan Tembusu near the upcoming Tanjong Katong MRT station. Together with our JV partner MCL Land, the site is being developed into a 638unit condominium named Tembusu Grand, which we will launch in 1H 2023. In March 2022, we completed the acquisition of Central Square, which will be redeveloped alongside our Central Mall properties into an enlarged mixed-use development.\n\nIn April 2022, we completed the off-market acquisition of a site at 798 and 800 Upper Bukit Timah Road, which we are developing into a 408-unit development named The Myst, planned for launch in 2H 2023. In September 2022, we also acquired a GLS Executive Condominium (EC) site at Bukit Batok West Avenue 5, emerging as the top bidder by a razor-thin margin of 0.2%. A 510-unit EC project is being planned and will incorporate Super Low Energy features.\n\nAside from Tembusu Grand and The Myst, the Group plans to launch a third project in 2023 - Newport Residences - which is located at the site of the former Fuji Xerox Towers on Anson Road and part of a 45-storey mixed-use development called Newport Plaza. Comprising 246 rare freehold residences with all apartments elevated from level 23 to 45, Newport Residences will also feature a super penthouse, estimated at 13,000 sq ft and near the top of the 215-metre-tall building.\n\nWe continue to diversify our recurring income streams to build a more resilient portfolio across geographies and asset classes. Over the past few years, our expansion into the Living Sector has started to bear fruit as these recurring income assets have been resilient and outperformed other asset classes throughout the pandemic. Ever since our maiden PRS acquisition in 2019 of a build-to-rent site in Leeds, the Group now has 2,288 operational and pipeline PRS units across the UK, Japan, Australia and the US.\n\nBeyond rejuvenating existing assets, we have also embarked on the redevelopment of certain older properties to unlock value through various incentive schemes. The redevelopment of Central Mall and Central Square is at an advanced planning stage and they will be redeveloped under the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) Strategic Development Incentive Scheme. Provisional Permission has been obtained for a mixed-use development comprising commercial, hospitality and residential components yielding a GFA uplift of 67% to approximately 735,500 sq ft from the current GFA of 441,650 sq ft. The redevelopment will rejuvenate and transform the precinct into a vibrant lifestyle hub. Over at Tanjong Pagar and overlooking the Greater Southern Waterfront, we have already commenced demolition of Fuji Xerox Towers and have tapped on the URA's CBD Incentive Scheme to redevelop the site into an iconic mixeduse development, Newport Plaza, yielding a GFA uplift of 25%.\n\n## Transforming for the Future\n\nOur  hospitality  portfolio  is  a  key transformation lever. Since we privatised Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C) in November 2019, our hotel operations segment has undergone an upheaval, with the pandemic decimating the travel industry in 2020 and 2021. However, with the reopening of borders and easing restrictions in 2022, our hospitality segment has rebounded strongly, with operations in most markets having recovered to prepandemic levels. With a more stabilised position, we will accelerate our plans for asset optimisation and drive alignment to the Group's strategic plans and processes.\n\nFollowing a holistic review of our hospitality portfolio, we have executed strategic asset divestment and restructuring initiatives to unlock latent value during the year. These include the KRW 1.1 trillion (approximately $1.25 billion) sale of Millennium Hilton Seoul, the divestment of interest in Tanglin Shopping Centre held by M&C, as well as the accounting deconsolidation of CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT) from the Group following a distribution in specie of CDLHT units in May 2022 to reward shareholders.\n\nAnother integral component of the Group's transformation  strategy  is  our  fund management business. Besides nurturing existing listed platforms like CDLHT and IREIT Global, the Group continues to lay the foundation to drive future AUM growth.\n\nWhile the Group has paused our IPO aspirations  for  our  UK  commercial properties due to unfavourable market conditions, we continue to explore strategic acquisitions that will complement our ambitions. The Group's recent acquisition of the landmark 23-acre St Katharine Docks prime freehold estate in London is one such opportunity. Following the completion of the acquisition in March 2023, the total value of the Group's commercial assets in Central London has increased to around \u00a31 billion. This transaction allows us the option to inject our UK assets into listed or unlisted platforms at an opportune time.\n\n## AN ENERGISED SPIRIT\n\nAmidst all the challenges and disruptions we have faced over the past three years, our Group has navigated the trying times with courage, resilience and focus.\n\nThis took exceptional dedication from our greatest asset, which is our people. They are the ones who enabled the Group to steadfastly execute on our GET strategy and emerge stronger than ever. On behalf of Senior Management, I would like to thank our valued employees for their dedication and hard work. I am deeply grateful for their unwavering commitment to the company. I would also like to welcome Ms Lilian Tan, our Group Chief Human Resources Officer and newest member of the Key Management team, who joined us in March 2023. She will help to further strengthen the People Agenda by building an even stronger and more inclusive culture within our organisation.\n\nI would also like to thank our Chairman and the Board of Directors for their invaluable guidance in shaping our strategy and navigating our Group through choppy waters.\n\nLast but not least, I would like to express our heartfelt appreciation to our shareholders, customers and business associates for your continued support.\n\nAs we embark on our 60th Anniversary milestone, the Group will push ahead with an energised spirit to accelerate our growth and future-proof our business while embracing excellence, innovation, determination and discipline.\n\n## Sherman Kwek\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer",

The Board sets broad policies, provides guidance on and approves strategic objectives, ensures that necessary financial, operational and human resources are in place for the Company to meet its objectives, reviews the performance of the Group and Management and satisfies itself as to the adequacy and effectiveness of the framework and processes for internal controls (including financial, operational,\n\ncompliance and information technology ('IT') controls) and risk management for the safeguarding of shareholders' interests and the Group's assets.\n\nThe Board also assumes responsibility for good corporate governance and is responsible for setting the right 'tone at the top' in its policies and decisions to ensure that the Company's corporate values and ethical standards are observed and there is proper accountability throughout the Group and obligations to its shareholders and other stakeholders are clearly understood and met.\n\nThe Board is also committed to the Company's strategic approach to integrating sustainability in key aspects of its business and operations and to advance the Company's sustainability efforts and achievements.\n\n## Directors' Objective Discharge of Duties and Declaration of Interests (Provision 1.1)\n\nAll Directors are fiduciaries who exercise due diligence and objectively discharge their duties and responsibilities in the best interests of the Company. This ability to exercise objectivity is one of the assessment criteria in the NC annual evaluation of the Directors.\n\nDirectors, who are in any way, directly or indirectly, interested in a transaction or proposed transaction, declare the nature of their interests in accordance with the Company's Constitution and provisions of the Companies Act 1967, and in the case of any conflicts of interest (actual or potential), recuse themselves from participating in the deliberation and abstain from decision-making on such transactions, with abstention duly recorded within the minutes and/or the resolutions of the Board and/or the Committees.",

The Company has established various corporate policies as necessary which provide a communicable and understandable framework for employees to observe the Company's principles on honesty, integrity, responsibility and accountability at all levels of the organisation and in the conduct of the Company's business in their relationships with the Company's stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and employees. Further details of these policies are described in the segment entitled 'Corporate Values and Conduct of Business' at the end of this report.\n\n## Board Orientation and Training (Provision 1.2)\n\nEach newly appointed Director receives a formal letter, setting out his/her general duties and obligations as a Director pursuant to the relevant legislations and regulations. The new Director will also receive an electronic induction pack containing information and documents relating to the roles, duties and responsibilities of a director (and where applicable, as a member of the Committees), the Group's principal businesses, the Company's Board processes and corporate governance practices, relevant Company policies and procedures as well as a board meeting calendar for the year with a brief of the routine agenda for each meeting of the Board and where applicable, the Committees.\n\nThe  Company  also  conducts  a comprehensive induction programme for newly appointed Directors, and for existing Directors pursuant to their appointments to any of the Committees, which seeks to familiarise Directors with the Group's principal businesses, the Company's governance practices and processes,\n\ninternal controls and risk management systems, their responsibilities as directors and in the case of appointments to any of the Committees, the roles and areas of responsibilities of such Committees. The induction programme includes meetings with various key executives of the Management to allow the new Directors to be acquainted with the Management team and to facilitate their independent access to the Management team in future. The programme also includes briefings by the Management team on key areas of the Company's operations.\n\nFor a first-time Director who has no prior experience as a director of a listed company, in addition to the induction as detailed above, he/she will be required to also attend certain specific modules of the Listed Entity Director ('LED') Programme conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors ('SID') to acquire relevant knowledge of what is expected of a listed company director, this being a mandatory requirement under Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited ('SGX-ST') Listing Rules (the 'Mandatory Training'). Completion of the LED Programme, which focuses on comprehensive training of company directors on compliance, regulatory and corporate governance matters, should provide the first-time Director with a broad understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a director of a listed company under the requirements of the Companies Act 1967, the Listing Manual and the 2018 Code. A first-time director need not attend the Mandatory Training if the NC, in assessing the relevant experience of the director, is satisfied that he/she possesses relevant experience comparable to that of a person who has served as a director of an issuer listed on SGX-ST. Where such an assessment is made by the NC, the reasons are disclosed in the announcement made on the appointment of the director.\n\nMrs Wong Ai Ai and Mr Tan Kian Seng were appointed as IDs on 1 January 2022 and 10 March 2023 respectively. Mrs Wong had attended the induction programmes\n\nconducted by the Company in January 2022 while arrangements are being made for Mr Tan to attend the same in April 2023.\n\nThe Directors are also provided with updates and/or briefings from time to time by professional advisers, auditors, the Management and the Company Secretaries in areas such as directors' duties and responsibilities, corporate governance practices, relevant legislations and regulations, risk management and financial reporting standards. The Directors are also regularly kept informed by the Company Secretaries of the availability of relevant courses, conferences and seminars, including those conducted by the SID, and the Directors are encouraged to attend such training at the Company's expense. The NC and the Board are kept informed of the training sessions attended by the Directors during the year. As part of the NC's annual assessment of the skill set of the Board and the Committees, the NC will also recommend further training for the Directors in specific areas, if required, to supplement the regular updates/ briefings provided to the Directors from time to time.\n\nDuring the year, some of the training sessions attended by the Directors included the ACRA-SGX-SID Audit Committee Seminar 2022, SID Directors Conference  2022,  SID  Corporate Governance Roundup 2022, SID AC Chapter Pit-Stop Series, Launch of the Board of Directors Survey 2022, the LED Programme, SID Masterclass for Directors (MCD) Programme, briefings and seminars organised by SID, audit professionals and other consultants in relation to audit committee matters, risk management, financial and sustainability matters.\n\nIn-house seminars were also organised in 2022 and conducted by invited external speakers on the following topics:\n\n- \u00b7  Zero in on Future Value: Turning Risks to Growth Opportunities\n- \u00b7  Geopolitical Risks\n- \u00b7  Sustainability: Get Ready for IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards\n\n100% of the Board attended various training seminars and workshops in 2022\n\nAccounted for more than 222.25 training hours in aggregate\n\nIn addition, all Directors (except for Mr Tan) have undergone the mandatory sustainability training courses as prescribed by SGX. Arrangements will be made for Mr Tan to attend the mandatory training. Members of the ARC were also provided with regular briefings from the Company's external auditors on applicable Accounting Standards during the year.\n\nFurther to the training courses/ programmes and briefing updates, Directors are also at liberty to approach Management should they require any further information or clarification concerning the Company's operations.\n\n## Board Approval (Provision 1.3)\n\nKey matters which are specifically reserved for approval by the Board include the decisions over the strategic direction, plans and performance objectives of the Group (including its risk appetite); the Group's financial objectives and annual budget; decisions to commence, discontinue or modify significantly any business activity or to enter into or withdraw from a particular market sector which has or may have material impact on the profitability or performance of the Group; corporate or financial restructuring; decisions over new borrowings or amendments to the terms and conditions of existing borrowings; adoption of key corporate policies and corporate governance practices and any other matters which require the Board's approval as prescribed under the relevant legislations and regulations as well as the provisions of the Company's Constitution. All issuance of the Group's financial results requires the approval of the Board, including decisions with regard to the Company's dividend policy and payouts.\n\nAligned with the Group's strategy to develop growth platforms in Singapore\n\n=\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand key international markets, the Board has put in place an approval matrix with established authority limits in connection with the Group's investments and divestments, including funds and corporate holdings. The approval matrix is revised and updated when necessary, in line with the Group's strategic objectives.\n\nManagement is fully apprised of such matters which require the approval of the Board or the Committees. For operational efficiency, the Company also has a structured approval limits matrix which sets out the delegated authority to various levels of Management to approve operating expenditures up to pre-determined limits.\n\n## Delegation by the Board (Provision 1.4)\n\nThe primary functions of the Board are either carried out directly by the Board or delegated to the Committees with clear written terms of reference setting out their compositions, authorities and duties, including reporting back to the Board. The Committees established by the Board are the ARC, the NC, the RC and the BSC, all collectively referred to hereafter as the 'Committees'.\n\nEach Committee reports key matters to the Board at Board Meetings and submit its report at least once on an annual basis.\n\nAll terms of reference for the Committees are approved by the Board and reviewed annually to ensure their continued relevance, taking into account the changes in the governance and regulatory environment.\n\nThe delegation of authority by the Board to the Committees enables the Board to achieve operational efficiency by empowering these Committees to decide,\n\nreview and make recommendations on matters within their respective written terms of reference and/or limits of delegated authority, without abdicating the Board's overall responsibility.\n\nPlease refer to the sections on Principles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 in this report for further information on the activities of the NC, RC and ARC. Information on the activities of the BSC can be found under the 'Sustainability' segment towards the end of this report.\n\n## Board and Board Committees Meetings (Provision 1.5)\n\nMeetings of the Board and Committees are held regularly, with the Board meeting held at least four times a year. Four Board meetings were held in 2022. At the regular Board meetings, the Board agenda includes updates by the Management on the Group's strategic initiatives and implementation status, updates on the Group's investments and developments, and the review of the Group's financial and operational performance. Of the four scheduled meetings, two were the halfyear and full year Board meetings mainly to review and approve the Group's financial results, and two were scheduled primarily for the Board to focus on the review of the Company's strategic direction, including specific business strategies, business segmental and geographical allocation of assets, risk appetite and tolerance limits, as well as to review the Group's quarterly operational performance, where applicable.\n\nDuring the year, the Directors attended an off-site Board retreat where the Company's strategies, various initiatives and operational updates were presented by Management. The board strategies and various initiatives were subsequently formalised at a Board meeting held the day after and duly approved.",

Meetings of the NEDs, including IDs, are convened as often as may be warranted by circumstances. The IDs also meet regularly under the various Committees and the Lead ID is a member of some of these Committees.\n\nThe proposed meetings for the Board and all Committees for each new calendar year are set out in a schedule of meetings, which is notified to all Board members before the start of that calendar year. Additional meetings are convened as and when circumstances warrant. Records of all such meetings, including discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken, are maintained by the\n\nCompany Secretaries. The Company's Constitution allows for the meetings of its Board and the Committees to be held via teleconferencing and videoconferencing. The Board and the Committees may also make decisions by way of circulating written resolutions.\n\nThe attendance (including via electronic means) of the Directors at the Annual General Meeting of the Company ('AGM') and meetings of the Board, the Committees and the NEDs, as well as the frequency of such meetings in 2022, is disclosed in the table below. Directors who were unable to attend any meetings of the Board or the Committees, were provided with the meeting materials and encouraged to raise discussion points or queries with the Board Chairman or\n\nrespective Committee chairman or the Management. Nonetheless, the Board is of the view that the contribution of each Director should not be focused solely on his/her attendance at meetings of the Board and/or the Committees. A Director's contribution should also extend beyond the confines of the formal environment of such meetings, through the sharing of views, advice, experience and strategic networks which would further the interests of the Company. The Directors, whether individually or collectively, also engage with the Management, heads of the Group's business units and departments and the Group's external consultants in order to better understand the challenges faced by the Group and the input of the Directors, through such engagements, provide invaluable perspective to the Management.\n\nDirectors' Attendance (including via electronic means) at the AGM, and Meetings of the Board, the Committees and the NEDs in 2022 (Provision 1.5)\n\n|                                   | Board                               | ARC NC                              |                                     | RC                                  | BSC                                 |                                     | NEDs                                | AGM                                 |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Number of meetings held in 2022   | 4                                   | 5                                   | 2                                   | 3                                   |                                     | 2                                   | 1                                   | 1                                   |\n| Name of Directors                 | Number of meetings attended in 2022 | Number of meetings attended in 2022 | Number of meetings attended in 2022 | Number of meetings attended in 2022 | Number of meetings attended in 2022 | Number of meetings attended in 2022 | Number of meetings attended in 2022 | Number of meetings attended in 2022 |\n| Kwek Leng Beng (1)                | 4/4                                 | N.A.                                | 2/2                                 |                                     | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | 1/1                                 |\n| Sherman Kwek Eik Tse (1)          | 4/4                                 | N.A.                                | N.A.                                |                                     | N.A.                                | 2/2                                 | N.A.                                | 1/1                                 |\n| Lee Jee Cheng Philip (1)          | 4/4                                 | 5/5                                 | 2/2                                 |                                     | 3/3                                 | N.A.                                | 1/1                                 | 1/1                                 |\n| Philip Yeo Liat Kok (3)           | 3/4 (6)                             | N.A.                                | N.A.

The AGM was held via electronic means.\n- (2) Mrs Wong Ai Ai was appointed as a Director, member of NC and BSC on 1 January 2022.\n- (3) Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok ceased to be an ID with effect from 1 January 2022. Consequently, he has stepped down as the chairman of the NC and a member of the BSC. Mr Yeo was invited to attend one NC meeting held in August 2022.\n- (4) Mr Ong Lian Jin Colin was appointed as the chairman of the NC on 1 January 2022.\n- (5) Mr Chong Yoon Chou was appointed as a member of the BSC on 1 January 2022.\n- (6) Mr Philip Yeo was unable to attend one Board Meeting as he had prior travel arrangement.\n\n## Directors' Multiple Board Representations and Time Commitments (Provision 1.5)\n\nWhen considering the re-nomination of Directors for re-election, the NC also takes into account the competing time commitments faced by Directors with multiple listed company board representations  and/or  other principal commitments. An analysis of the directorships (which includes directorships by groups and executive appointments) held by the Directors is reviewed annually by the NC. Each Director is also required to confirm annually to the NC as to whether he/ she has any issue with competing time commitments which may impact his/ her ability to provide sufficient time and attention to his/her duties as a Director of the Company. Based on the analysis, the Directors' annual confirmation and the Directors' commitments and contributions to the Company, which are also evident in their level of attendance and participation at Committee and IDs' meetings, the NC is satisfied that all Directors are able to carry out and have been adequately carrying out their duties as a Director of the Company.\n\nThe  NC  noted  that  including  the directorship held in the Company, the number of listed company board representations currently held by each of the Directors ranged from one to three in number and those held by Mr Kwek Leng Beng are on the boards of the related companies of the Company. The NC has recommended that the maximum number of listed company board representations which each Director of the Company may hold, be set at six, to provide a guide to address potential competing time commitments that Directors may face serving on multiple listed company boards. The NC may review this guideline from time to time and will also consider the circumstances of individual Directors or potential candidates with multiple listed company directorships above the recommended number to determine their capacity to participate and contribute effectively to the Board.\n\nIn addition to the current procedures for the review of the attendance records and analysis of directorships/principal commitments, a policy has also been put in place for Directors to consult the Board Chairman or the chairman of the NC prior to accepting any new listed company board appointment or principal commitment and to notify the Board of any changes in their external appointments.  This  would  allow the Director to review his/her time commitments with the proposed new appointment, and in the case of an ID, to also ensure that his/her independence would not be affected.\n\n## Complete, Adequate and Timely Information (Provision 1.6)\n\nPrior to each meeting, members of the Board and the Committees are provided with the meeting agenda and the relevant papers submitted by the Management, containing complete, adequate and timely information to enable full deliberation on the issues to be considered at the respective meetings. The Management is in attendance at such meetings, whilst the Company's auditors and professional advisers who can provide additional insight into the matters for discussion are invited as required to attend the relevant meetings. The Management also provides all Directors with monthly updates on the Company's financial performance including an analysis of the same, with material variances between the comparative periods disclosed and explained. Where the Board's or a Committee's approval is sought, relevant background and explanatory information on the specific matter are provided to enable Directors to understand the issues and request for further information, as necessary.\n\nDraft agendas for Board and Committee meetings are circulated in advance to the Board Chairman and the Committee chairman respectively, for them to review and suggest items for the agenda. The Board and the Committees are also furnished routine reports, where applicable, from the Management. The chairman of the ARC, NC, RC and\n\nBSC provides an annual report of the respective Committees' activities during the year under review to the Board. The minutes of meetings of the Committees are circulated to all Board members.\n\n## Access to Management, Company Secretaries and Independent Professional Advice (Provision 1.7)\n\nAll Directors have direct and independent access to the Management. To facilitate this access, all Directors are provided with the contact details of the Key Management Personnel and other senior management team members. The contact details of the heads of internal audit and risk management are also provided to the ARC.\n\nThe Directors, whether as a group or individually, are entitled to take independent professional advice at the expense of the Company, in furtherance of their duties and where circumstances warrant the same. The Company has in place internal guidelines allowing the Directors to seek such independent professional advice.\n\nThe Company Secretaries, whose appointment and removal are subject to the Board's approval, attend all meetings of the Board and the Committees to provide guidance for Board procedures to be followed. The Company Secretaries, together with the Management, also ensure that the Company complies with applicable statutory and regulatory rules. Together with the Management, the Company Secretaries also advise the Board Chairman, the Board and the Committees on corporate governance matters and assist in implementing and strengthening corporate governance practices and processes, including ensuring good information flow within the Board and the Committees and between the Directors and Management, facilitating the induction for newly appointed Directors and newly appointed Committee members, and assisting in the continuing training and development programme for the Directors. On an ongoing basis, the Directors have separate and independent access to the Company Secretaries.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Principle 2: Board Composition and Guidance\n\n## Board Independence\n\n## (Provisions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3)\n\nThe  Board  currently  comprises ten members. Based on the NC's recommendation,  the  Board  has determined seven of them, being more than half of the Board, to be independent, thus providing for a strong and independent element on the Board, capable of exercising objective judgement on the corporate affairs of the Company. No individual or small group of individuals dominate the Board's decision-making. No alternate Directors have been appointed in respect of any of the Directors.\n\nThe non-independent Directors are the Board Chairman, the Group CEO, both holding executive appointments in the Company, and Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok who is an NED. Mr Yeo was considered as non-independent with effect from 1 January 2022 as he has served more than nine consecutive years on the Board. He was accordingly re-designated a non-independent nonexecutive Director with effect from that date.\n\nWhen reviewing the independence of the IDs (excluding Mr Tan who was appointed in March 2023)('6 IDs'), the NC has considered the applicable Listing Rule 210(5)(d) and the guidelines for independence set out in Provision 2.1 of the 2018 Code and its accompanying Practice Guidance (collectively, the 'Independence Guidance'). As part of the consideration of the 6 IDs' independence, the NC has also taken into account the following:\n\n- \u00b7  other directorships;\n- \u00b7  annual declarations regarding their independence;\n- \u00b7  disclosures of interest in transactions in which they have a direct/indirect interest;\n- \u00b7  their ability to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest especially by abstaining from deliberation on such transactions;\n\n- \u00b7  their ability to maintain objectivity in their conduct as Directors of the Company; and\n- \u00b7  their ability to objectively raise issues and seek clarification as and when from the Board, Management and the Company's external advisors on matters pertaining to their area of responsibilities whether on the Board or on the Committees.\n\nEach of the IDs on the NC recused himself/ herself from the NC's deliberations on his/ her own independence.\n\nMr Ong Lian Jin Colin, an ID, is a director of Summervale Properties Pte. Ltd. ('Summervale') which had entered into an Asset Management and Marketing Agreement with Trentwell Management Pte Ltd ('Trentwell'), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for Trentwell to manage and market Summervale's residential units at Nouvel 18. Mr Ong is not involved in the daily operations of and does not hold any executive position in Summervale or its holding company, Green 18 Pte. Ltd., other than being a board member of both companies and a shareholder of Green 18 Pte. Ltd. holding less than 5% shareholding. The Board has concurred with the NC's determination that Mr Ong's independence is not affected by this relationship between Trentwell and Summervale.\n\nNone of the 6 IDs and Mr Tan are currently employed or have been employed at any time during the past three financial years by the Company or any of its related corporations. These IDs also do not have immediate family members who are currently employed or have been employed at any time during the past three financial years by the Company or any of its related corporations, and whose remuneration is determined by the RC. For purposes of determining independence, the 6 IDs and Mr Tan have also provided confirmation that they are not related to the Directors or to any shareholders holding 5% interest in the Company. The NC is satisfied that there is no other relationship which could affect their independence. The Directors undertook a review of their independence, with each ID abstaining from participating\n\nin his/her own review by the Board and had concurred with the NC's determination of the independence of the IDs.\n\nWhen considering and recommending Mr Tan for appointment as an ID, the NC also considered his other directorships, the Independence Guidance and the declaration by Mr Tan on his own independence.\n\n## Board Composition, Size and Diversity (Provision 2.4)\n\nThe Company has in place a Board Diversity Policy ('BDP') which sets out the framework for promoting diversity on the Board. The Company recognises that a diverse Board is an important element which will better support the Company's achievement of its strategic objectives for sustainable development by enhancing the decision-making process of the Board through the perspectives derived from the various skills, business experience, industry discipline and other aspects of diversity (such as gender and age) of the Directors.\n\nThe BDP, which is available on the Company's corporate website, provides that the NC shall consider all aspects of diversity when reviewing and assessing the composition of the Board and when making recommendations to the Board for the appointment of Directors to arrive at an optimal balanced composition of the Board. The BDP also provides for the NC to discuss and recommend annually to the Board measurable targets and timelines for promoting and achieving diversity on the Board.\n\nThe NC has put in place a skills matrix to help identify gaps in the Board and Committees. The skills matrix classifies skills, experience and knowledge of the existing Directors into broad categories such as industry knowledge, namely real estate and hospitality-related businesses and management and fund management; management expertise for example strategic planning, leadership and customer-based experience; professional or skills in specific areas for example, audit/finance, risk, digital/information technology, sustainability and legal.\n\nWhen reviewing and assessing the size and composition of the Board and Committees and making recommendations to the Board annually including the appointment/re-appointment of Directors, the NC will consider all aspects of diversity based on targets and timelines set for promoting and achieving diversity on the Board to arrive at an optimal balanced composition of the Board. As prescribed under the BDP, the final decision on the selection of Directors will be based on merits against objective criteria and targets considered by the NC annually and recommended to the Board for approval.\n\n## Diversity Targets and Progress in FY 2022\n\n| Targets                                                                                                                                                              | Progress                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Expand/enhance the  Board skill set to achieve  the Company's strategic  objectives                                                                                  | The NC took diversity into account in its search for new directors to complement the skill set  on the Board. Mrs Wong Ai Ai was appointed to the Board in January 2022, bringing valuable  skills in the areas of extensive legal knowledge and experience and sustainability in relation  to climate change and its consequences.

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nThe NC and Board also agreed that there was no need to set a specific target for ethnicity/nationality so long as the candidates provide distinguishing qualities that complement and expand the skills and experience of the Board as a whole. Further information on the individual Directors' background, experience and skills can be found in the 'Board of Directors' section in this AR.\n\nHaving considered the scope and nature of the operations of the Group, the Board is satisfied that the current size and composition of the Board and Committees are appropriate as they reflect the Company's commitment to Board diversity with a good balance of skills, experience, industry knowledge, professional qualifications, gender and age, which serve to support the Company in achieving its strategic objectives and sustainable growth and development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NEDs' Participation (Provision 2.5)\n\nNEDs are encouraged to participate actively at Board meetings in the development of the Company's strategic plans and direction, and in the review and monitoring of Management's performance against targets. To facilitate this, they are kept informed of the Company's businesses and performance through monthly reports from the Management and have unrestricted access to the Management. They also sit on various Committees established by the Board to provide unbiased and independent views, constructive input and the independent review and monitoring of performance of the Company and Management. One meeting of the NEDs, chaired by the Lead ID,\n\nwas held in 2022 without the presence of Management. The NEDs would also confer among themselves without the presence of Management as and when the need arises. The Lead ID collates the views and feedback from the NEDs and communicates the same to the Board and/or the Board Chairman as appropriate.\n\n## Principle 3: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Roles of the Executive Chairman and the Group Chief Executive Officer (Provisions 3.1 and 3.2)\n\nThe roles of Chairman of the Board and the Group CEO are separate to ensure a clear division of responsibilities and increased accountability.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board, Mr Kwek Leng Beng, is also the Executive Board Chairman. Mr Kwek Leng Beng plays an instrumental role in providing the Company with strong leadership and vision, leading the Board in its review of the Group's strategies for sustainable growth. As the Board Chairman with written terms of reference approved by the Board, Mr Kwek Leng Beng also promotes and leads the Group in its commitment to achieve and maintain high standards of corporate governance. He bears primary responsibility for the workings of the Board, by ensuring effectiveness in all aspects of its role including setting the agenda for Board meetings with input from Management, ensuring sufficient allocation of time for thorough discussion of key agenda items\n\nat Board meetings, promoting an open environment within the Boardroom for constructive debate, encouraging the NEDs to speak freely and contribute effectively, and exercising control over the quality, quantity and timeliness of information flow between the Board and Management. At AGMs and other shareholders' meetings, he plays a pivotal role in fostering constructive dialogue between shareholders, the Board and Management.\n\nAs Executive Board Chairman, he is the most senior executive in the Company and bears overall executive responsibility for the Group's business. Mr Kwek Leng Beng is assisted by the Group CEO, Mr Sherman Kwek. The Group CEO leads the members of the Management team and is responsible for implementing and reviewing the business direction and strategies for the Group as endorsed by the Board, and for operational performance  and  organisational excellence. He is the elder son of the Executive Board Chairman.\n\nThe Board has considered Mr Kwek Leng Beng's role as an Executive Board Chairman and the strengths he brings to such a role by virtue of his stature and experience. Through the appointment of the Lead ID (see more information below) and the establishment of various Committees with power and authority to perform key functions without the undue influence from the Board Chairman, and the putting in place of internal controls for proper accountability and to allow for effective oversight by the Board of the Company's business, the Board ensures that there is an appropriate balance of power which allows the Board to exercise objective decision-making in the best interests of the Company. The Board is of the view that Mr Kwek Leng Beng's role as an Executive Board Chairman would continue to facilitate the Group's decision-making and implementation process without diminishing the capacity of the Board for independent decision-making.\n\n## Lead Independent Director\n\n## (Provision 3.3)\n\nCognisant that the Board Chairman is an Executive Director and thus not independent, the Board has designated a Lead ID who serves as a sounding board for the Board Chairman and as an intermediary between the NEDs/IDs and the Board Chairman. The current Lead ID is Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip.\n\nThe role of the Lead ID is set out in the written terms of reference for the Lead ID, which have been approved by the Board. The Lead ID is available to shareholders should they have concerns which cannot be resolved or are inappropriate to raise through the normal communication channels of the Board Chairman or the Management. No query or request on any matter which requires the Lead ID's attention was received from shareholders in 2022. Under the chairmanship of the Lead ID, a meeting of the NEDs was convened in 2022 without the presence of Management or the Board Chairman, and the views expressed by the NEDs at the meeting were communicated by the Lead ID to the Board Chairman and the Management, as appropriate.\n\n## Principle 4: Board Membership\n\n## NC Composition and Role (Provisions 4.1 and 4.2)\n\nFour out of the five members of the NC, including the NC chairman, are IDs. The Lead ID is one of the independent members of the NC.\n\nThe key responsibilities of the NC as set out in its written terms of reference approved by the Board, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 to examine Board size;\n- \u00b7 to review all Board and Committees composition and membership;\n- \u00b7  to review board succession plans for the Directors (including the Board Chairman and the Group CEO) and the Key Management Personnel ('KMP') who are not Directors;\n- \u00b7 to  determine  each  Director's independence annually and as and when circumstances require;\n- \u00b7  to evaluate the performance of the Board, Committees and the individual Directors;\n- \u00b7  to review appointment and reappointment of Directors (including alternate directors, if any) and the reasons for resignations of Directors;\n- \u00b7  to review appointments and the reasons  for  resignations  and terminations of the KMP who are not Directors;\n- \u00b7  to review and confirm the induction programmes for newly appointed Directors and for existing Directors in respect of their appointments to any of the Committees; and\n- \u00b7 to review the training and continuous professional development programme for the Directors.\n\nThe Company has identified the Group CEO, who is also a Director, the Group Chief Operating Officer ('Group COO'), the Group General Manager ('Group GM'), the Group Chief Investment Officer ('Group CIO'), the Group Chief Financial Officer ('Group CFO') and the Group Chief Human Resources Officer ('Group CHRO') (joined in March 2023) who are the most senior members of the Management team, as its KMP. The Group CIO left the Company in September 2022 and a successor will be identified in due course.\n\nTwo NC meetings were held in 2022. The Company Secretaries maintain records of all NC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the NC conducted a self-assessment of its own effectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist ('NC SelfAssessment Checklist'). The NC SelfAssessment Checklist covered, inter alia , the responsibilities of the NC under its terms of reference and also considered the contributions of NC members to the deliberation and decision-making process at NC meetings.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nBased on the self-assessment, the NC is of the view that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference.\n\n## Nomination of Directors and Determination of Independence (Provisions 4.3 and 4.4)\n\nThe NC reviews the nomination of the relevant Directors for election/reelection as well as the independence of Directors annually. When considering the nomination of Directors for election/ re-election, the NC takes into account their contribution to the effectiveness of the Board (which includes their participation and candour at Board and Committee meetings) as well as their time commitment especially for Directors who have multiple board representations and/or other principal commitments, and also reviews their independence having regard to the provisions in the applicable Listing Rule 210(5)(d) and Provision 2.1 of the 2018 Code. The recommendation of the NC on the annual nomination of the Directors for election/re-election is submitted to the Board for decision and thereafter tabled at the AGM of the Company for consideration and approval by shareholders.\n\nThe Constitution of the Company provides that not less than one-third of the Directors for the time being, shall retire as Directors at each AGM. All new Directors appointed by the Board shall hold office until the next AGM and are eligible for election at the said AGM.\n\nIn accordance with the Constitution of the Company, Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok, Mr Daniel Marie Ghislain Desbaillets and Mr Chong Yoon Chou are due to retire by rotation at the 60th Annual General Meeting ('2023 AGM'), and being eligible, have offered themselves for re-election at the 2023 AGM. The NC has considered their contribution and performance and recommended to the Board to nominate their re-election at the 2023 AGM.\n\nMr Tan Kian Seng who was appointed in March 2023 will retire at the 2023 AGM, and being eligible, has offered himself for election at the 2023 AGM. The NC has recommended to the Board his election at the 2023 AGM.\n\n## Criteria and Process for Nomination and Selection of New Directors (Provision 4.3)\n\nThe NC also reviews all nominations and interviews candidates before formally considering and recommending them for appointment to the Board and where applicable, to the Committees. Searches for potential candidates generally take into account recommendations from the Directors and various other sources. Where necessary, the NC may consider the use of external search consultants to find appropriate candidates. Shortlisted candidates would be required to furnish their curriculum vitae containing information on their academic/professional qualification, work experience, employment history and experience (if any) as directors of listed companies.\n\nIn reviewing and recommending to the Board any new Director appointments, including appointments to the appropriate Committees, the NC considers the following as well as factors prescribed under the Company's BDP, details of which as set out under the sub-header 'Board Composition, Size and Diversity (Provision 2.4)':\n\n- (a)  the  candidate's  track  record, experience and capabilities or such other factors including age and gender, as may be determined by the NC to be relevant and which would contribute to the Board's collective skill set;\n- (b)  any competing time commitments if the candidate has multiple listed company board representations and/ or other principal commitments;\n- (c)  the candidate's independence, in the case of the appointment of an independent NED; and\n- (d)  the composition requirements for the Board and Committees after matching the candidate's skill set to the requirement of the relevant Committees (if the candidate is proposed to be appointed to any of the Committees).\n\n## Key Information on Directors (Provision 4.5)\n\nPlease refer to the 'Board of Directors' section in the AR for key information on the Directors, including their dates of first appointment and last election/reelection to the Board (if applicable), their academic/professional qualifications, major  appointments/principal commitments, directorships held in listed companies for both the current and in the preceding five years, and other relevant information; 'Additional Information on Directors seeking election/re-election'; and the 'Notice of Annual General Meeting' for information on Directors proposed for election/re-election at the 2023 AGM.\n\n## Succession Planning for the Board, the Board Chairman and the KMP (Provision 4.1)\n\nThe Board believes in carrying out succession planning for itself, the Board Chairman and the KMP to ensure continuity of leadership. It has in place a formal Board (including the Board Chairman) and KMP succession plan which is reviewed annually. Board renewal is a continuous process and in this regard, the NC reviews annually the composition of the Board and Committees, which includes size and mix, and recommends to the Board the selection and appointment of new Directors, whether in addition to the existing Board members or as replacement of retiring Board members, with a view to identify any gaps in the Board's skill set taking into account the Group's strategy and business operations. The Board will be able to function smoothly notwithstanding any resignation or retirement of any Director given the present number of members and mix of competencies on the Board.\n\nAs part of the Board succession plan, Mrs Wong Ai Ai was appointed to the Board as an ID in January 2022. Mrs Wong's broad experience, especially in corporate law, provides further diversity to the core competencies and skill set of the Board. To further strengthen the Board skill set in the areas of hospitality and finance, Mr Tan Kian Seng was appointed as an ID in March 2023.\n\n## Board Development (Provision 4.5)\n\nThe NC reviews the training and development of the Directors to ensure that Directors receive appropriate development on a continuing basis, to perform their roles on the Board and where applicable, the Committees. The Directors are provided with updates and/or briefings to assist them to properly discharge their duties. The briefings are conducted either internally with invited speakers, or externally, at the Company's expense. A separate programme is established for new Directors, details of which together with details of the internal briefing and updates provided to the Directors in 2022 are set out in the paragraph under the subject heading 'Board Orientation and Training' in this report.\n\nThe Board is kept apprised twice yearly on the list of training programmes attended by the Directors during the year.\n\n## Principle 5: Board Performance\n\n## Board Evaluation Process (Provision 5.1)\n\nThe Company has in place a formal process  for  assessment  of  the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the various Committees and the contribution by each Director towards the effectiveness of the Board and the Committees. No external facilitator has been used. The NC assesses the Board's performance as a whole annually, using objective and appropriate criteria which were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board. When assessing the overall Board performance, the NC takes into consideration the feedback from individual Directors on areas\n\nrelating to the Board's role on strategy and performance, the Board's process and governance (including oversight on internal controls and risk management), the  Board's  competencies  and effectiveness and the effectiveness of the Board Chairman. The results of the overall evaluation of the Board by the NC, including its recommendation for improvements, if any, are presented to the Board.\n\nThe NC also undertook an evaluation of the performance of the Committees with the assistance of self-assessment checklists  completed  by  these Committees.\n\nThe annual evaluation process for the Board Chairman's and the individual Director's performance comprises two parts: (a) review of background information concerning the Director including his attendance records at Board, Committee and NEDs (where applicable) meetings; and (b) NC's evaluation based on certain assessment parameters, which were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board.\n\nWhen deliberating on the performance of a particular Director who is also a member of the NC, that member abstains from the discussions to avoid any conflict of interest.\n\nThe results of the individual evaluation of the Directors are also used by the NC, in its consultation with the Board Chairman (who is also a member of the NC), to review, where appropriate, the composition of the Board and Committees, and to support its proposals, if any, for appointment of new members and its recommendations for the reelection of retiring Directors. The Board Chairman, as a member of the NC, is fully apprised of the results of the performance evaluation for the individual Directors and would take into consideration such evaluation and act as appropriate on the recommendations of the NC. Comments from the Directors, if any, concerning the Board as a whole and the general\n\nperformance of the Directors, are also presented to the Board.\n\n## Board Evaluation Criteria\n\n## (Provision 5.2)\n\nThe qualitative criteria used by the NC to evaluate the Board covers five key areas relating to Board structure, the Board's review of the Company's strategy and performance, Board's oversight on the Company's governance, including risk management and internal controls, and the effectiveness of the Board Chairman and Board processes.\n\nThe quantitative criteria used to evaluate the overall Board performance comprises performance indicators which include a comparison of the Group's performance (including segmental performance) for the financial period under review against the Group's performance for the corresponding period in previous years, and other indicators such as the Company's share price performance over a historical period.\n\n## Individual Director Evaluation Criteria (Provision 5.2)\n\nFactors taken into account in the assessment of a Director's performance include their abilities and competencies, their objectivity and the level of participation at Board and Committee meetings including their knowledge and contribution to Board processes and the business strategies and performance of the Group. The performance evaluation of each Director is taken into account in the NC's consideration with regard to his/her election/re-election as Director.\n\n## REMUNERATION MATTERS\n\n## Principle 6: Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies\n\n## RC Composition and Role (Provisions 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4)\n\nThe RC comprises four NEDs, all of whom including the chairman of the RC, are independent.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nThe key responsibilities of the RC, as set out in its written terms of reference approved by the Board, are to review and recommend for endorsement by the Board, a framework of remuneration for the Directors, including the specific remuneration packages of the Executive Directors ('EDs') and the KMP. Further, in consultation with the NC and the Management, the RC also considers the talent management framework so as to align with its review of the overall remuneration framework.\n\nThe Company has in place a remuneration framework (which covers all aspects of remuneration) for the NEDs, EDs and KMP. On an annual basis, the RC reviews and recommends the fees payable to the Directors for the Board's consideration before approval is sought from the shareholders at the AGM. The RC also reviews and recommends annually specific remuneration packages for the EDs and the KMP, including the annual increments, short-term and long-term incentives, for approval by the Board. The RC also considers the termination terms in the contracts of employment of the KMP to ensure that they are not unfair or unreasonable.\n\nIn 2022, Willis Towers Watson, external remuneration consultants, provided benchmark data on the remuneration for top executives in regional listed real estate companies of comparable size to the Company as well as the benchmark data for top listed companies in Singapore across all industries to help the RC in its consideration and proposal of the appropriate level of remuneration for the Company's KMP to attract, retain and motivate for sustained performance and value creation. The Company has no relationship with the appointed remuneration consultants other than their engagement in providing such benchmark data, which could affect the said consultants' independence.\n\nThe Company Secretaries maintain records of all RC meetings including\n\nrecords  of  discussions  on  key deliberations and decisions taken. The RC held three meetings in 2022.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the RC conducted a self-assessment of its own effectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist ('RC SelfAssessment Checklist'). The RC SelfAssessment Checklist covered, inter alia , the responsibilities of the RC under its terms of reference and also considered the contribution of RC members to the deliberation and decision-making process at RC meetings.\n\nBased on the self-assessment, the RC is of the view that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference.\n\n## Principle 7: Level and Mix of Remuneration of Directors and KMP (Provisions 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3)\n\nThe Company's remuneration policy for Directors comprises the following distinct objectives:\n\n- \u00b7  to ensure that the procedure for determining  remuneration  for Directors is formal and transparent;\n- \u00b7 to  ensure  that  the  level  of remuneration is sufficient (without being excessive) to attract and retain Directors to exercise oversight responsibility over the Company; and\n- \u00b7 to ensure that no Director is involved in deciding on his/her own remuneration.\n\nIn reviewing the remuneration packages of the EDs and the KMP, the RC, with the assistance of external remuneration consultants, considers the level of remuneration based on the Company's remuneration policy which comprises the following distinct objectives:\n\n- \u00b7  to reward employees for achieving corporate and individual performance targets in a fair and equitable way; and\n- \u00b7  to ensure that the remuneration reflects employees' duties and responsibilities.\n\nThe Company advocates a performancebased remuneration system that is flexible and responsive to the market, and the performance of the Group's business units and individual employees. In designing the compensation structure, the Company seeks to ensure that the level and mix of remuneration is competitive, relevant and appropriate in finding a balance between the current and long-term objectives of the Company.\n\nThe remuneration packages for the EDs and KMP comprise the following components:\n\n## Total Remuneration\n\n| Fixed                            | Variable                                                                       |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Compensation                     | Compensation                                                                   |\n| Base salary                      | Short-term  incentive (STI)  in the form of  cash-based annual  variable bonus |\n| Annual wage  supplement  ('AWS') | *Long-term  incentive (LTI) in  the form of cash  awards                       |\n| Fixed                            |                                                                                |\n| Allowances                       |                                                                                |\n\n- *  Applicable only to the KMP\n\nThe total salary, including AWS, STI and LTI, is benchmarked to the market, to ensure that the remuneration commensurates with the position and responsibilities of the EDs and KMP. The STI in the form of annual variable bonus and the LTI in the form of cash awards, reward achievement of the Group, business units and individual performance based on key performance indicators (involving financial and nonfinancial indicators) determined annually. The RC approves the Company's balanced\n\nscorecard and the performance targets set out in the GET (Growth, Enhancement and Transformation) strategy to be achieved by the Company based on its short and long-term objectives, which are cascaded down to the various business units.\n\nThe LTI in the form of cash awards, has a three-year performance period, and aligns Management with long-term shareholder value creation. LTI payments are not guaranteed and are subject to Management achieving the performance conditions based on Board-approved budget and strategy. LTI payment will be made at the end of a three-year assessment period if performance conditions are met. Being a cash-based award, the LTI is not dilutive to current shareholders. Claw-back provisions are included within the LTI which would give the right to the Company to reclaim incentive components from the EDs and KMP in exceptional circumstances such as misstatement of financial results or of misconduct resulting in financial loss to the Group.\n\nThe overall level of remuneration of the EDs and KMP is not considered to be at a level which is likely to promote behaviour contrary to the Group's risk profile. The RC\n\nand the Board believe that the executive compensation framework is aligned with the short-term and long-term interests of the shareholders and stakeholders, and that it promotes the long-term success of the Company.\n\nWhen reviewing the structure and level of Directors' fees, which comprise the base director fee and additional fees for services rendered on Committees and fee for the Lead ID, the RC takes into consideration the Directors' respective roles and responsibilities on the Board and Committees and the changes in the business, corporate governance practices and regulatory rules. The RC also compares the Company's fee structure against industry practices annually. Other factors taken into consideration in the fee revision include the frequency of Board and Committee meetings and the interval since the last fee revision. The RC is mindful that the remuneration for IDs should not be excessive so as to compromise or reasonably be perceived to compromise their independence. No Director is involved in deciding his/her own remuneration.\n\nEach of the Directors receives a base Director's fee. The Lead ID also\n\nreceives an additional fee to reflect his expanded responsibility. Directors who serve on the various Committees also receive additional fees in respect of each Committee that they serve on, with the chairmen of the Committees receiving a higher fee in respect of their service as chairmen of the respective Committees.

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nThe ARC receives regular reports on the risk management activities of the Company and updates on the ERM framework. Key risks including Tier 1 risks are reviewed regularly or at least quarterly and refreshed to ensure that relevant emerging risks are being considered and included for proper assessment, monitoring and reporting as appropriate. Based on the reports of the RMC, the ARC is satisfied that significant risks identified are assessed, managed and monitored adequately within the Group's ERM Framework. The ERM Framework includes a periodic review of the risk appetite statements and risk appetite and tolerance limits for these key risks, which statements and limits are considered and endorsed by the ARC and the Board.\n\nHaving regard to the risks which the Group is exposed, the likelihood of such risks occurring and the risk tolerance accepted by the Group, a system of internal controls has been designed and put in place by the Management to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, and transactions are authorised and properly recorded to enable the preparation of true and fair financial statements and maintain accountability of assets.\n\nThe Group's approach to risk is set out in the 'Risk Management' section on pages 60 to 66 of this AR.\n\nThe internal and external auditors, pursuant to their respective terms of reference and appointment, report to\n\nthe ARC any audit findings relating to internal controls, and the ARC reviews the adequacy of the actions taken by Management to address the recommendations of the internal and external auditors.\n\nThe ARC also receives regular reports, briefings and updates from the RMC, the Chief Technology Officer, the internal and external auditors and the Management team during its meetings to help the ARC review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's material internal controls that address the Group's financial, operational, compliance and IT controls.\n\n## Assurances from the Key Management Personnel (Provision 9.2)\n\nIn relation to Provision 9.2 of the 2018 Code and Listing Rule 1207(10), the ARC received:\n\n- (i) written assurance from the Group CEO and the Group CFO that the Group's financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's operations and finances; and\n- (ii)  written assurance from the KMP that the Group's risk management and internal controls systems in place were adequate and effective to address the principal risks (including financial, operational, compliance and IT risks) within the current scope of the Group's business operations for FY 2022.\n\nThe above written assurances on the Group's internal controls and risk management systems are provided half-yearly and are supported by similar written assurances provided by the heads of the Group's key operating divisions/ functions and key operating subsidiaries.\n\nThe  process  of  reviewing  and strengthening the Group's control environment is an evolving process. When controls should be enhanced, the Board and Management take actions to rectify and strengthen the internal controls and risk management systems. The Board and Management will continue to devote resources and expertise towards improving the internal policies and procedures to maintain a high level of governance and internal controls. However, the Board also notes that no system of internal controls and risk management can provide absolute assurance against poor judgement in decision-making, human errors, losses, frauds and other irregularities.\n\nBased on the work performed by Internal Auditors, the external auditors and the periodic reports from the RMC and Management, as well as the written assurances from the KMP to support the opinion to be given by the ARC and the Board, the Board with the concurrence of the ARC, is of the opinion that the internal controls and risk management systems in place as at 31 December 2022 are adequate and effective to address principal risks (including financial, operational, compliance and IT risks) within the current scope of the Group's business operations.\n\n## Principle 10: Audit & Risk Committee Composition of the ARC (Provisions\n\n## 10.2 and 10.3)\n\nThe ARC comprises four NEDs, all of whom including the chairman of the ARC are independent. The chairman of the ARC, Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip, possesses the relevant audit, accounting and related financial management and risk management expertise and experience. Mr Tan Kian Seng has accounting, financial and business management experience, whilst the other members of the ARC, Mr Chong Yoon Chou and Mrs Carol Fong each has financial and risk management experience as well as experience in investment banking and the financial markets respectively.\n\nWith the current composition, the ARC is of the opinion that it has the relevant accounting and related financial management expertise and experience to discharge its functions within its written terms of reference which have been approved by the Board.\n\nBased on the terms of reference of the ARC, a former partner or director of the Company's existing auditing firm or auditing corporation should not act as a member of the ARC: (a) within a period of two years commencing on the date of his/her ceasing to be a partner of the auditing firm or director of the auditing corporation; and in any case, (b) for as long as he/she has any financial interest in the auditing firm or auditing corporation. Mr Lee ceased as a partner of KPMG LLP ('KPMG'), the Company's existing auditors, in September 2018 and does not have any financial interest in KPMG. The other ARC members do not have any relationship with KPMG.\n\n## Powers and Duties of the ARC (Provision 10.1)\n\nThe ARC is authorised by the Board to review or investigate any matters it deems appropriate within its terms of reference and has direct and unrestricted access to the external and internal auditors. It may invite any Director, Management, officer or employee of the Company to attend its meetings. It is also authorised to engage any firm of accountants, lawyers or other professionals as it sees fit to provide independent counsel and advice to assist in the review or investigation on such matters within its terms of reference as it deems appropriate at the Company's expense.\n\nThe principal responsibility of the ARC is to assist the Board in maintaining a high standard of corporate governance, particularly by providing an independent review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's financial reporting process (including reviewing the accounting policies and practices of the Company and the Group on a consolidated basis) and key internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance, IT and risk management controls. Other duties within its written terms of reference include:\n\n- \u00b7  to review with Management and, where appropriate, with the external auditors the significant financial reporting issues and judgements to ensure the integrity of the half-year and full year financial statements of the Group to be issued by the Company before their submission to the Board and any other announcements relating to the Group's financial performance;\n- \u00b7 to review the scope annually and results of the external audit and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, and in this regard to also review the nature and extent of any non-audit services provided by the external auditors to the Group;\n- \u00b7 to make recommendations to the Board on the nomination for the appointment, re-appointment and removal of external auditors, and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors;\n- \u00b7  to assess the role and effectiveness of the internal audit ('IA') function in the overall context of the Group's internal controls and risk management systems, and to consider the results of their review and evaluation of the Group's internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance and IT controls, and risk management policies and systems;\n- \u00b7  to approve the appointment, resignation or dismissal of the Head of IA;\n- \u00b7  to  review  interested  person transactions falling within the scope of Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual; and\n- \u00b7  to oversee the establishment and operation of the Company's whistleblowing policy and arrangements put in place for raising concerns about possible improprieties on matters of financial reporting or any other matters.",

Refer to pages 110 to 111 of the AR.                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n## Internal Audit (Provisions 10.4 and 10.5)\n\nThe Internal Audit ('IA') function is independent of the activities it audits. The Head of IA's primary reporting line is to the ARC. The appointment, resignation and dismissal of the Head of IA is reviewed and/or approved by the ARC. The ARC also provides input on the annual performance appraisal of the Head of IA and reviews his compensation within the compensation policies of the Company. The ARC meets the Head of IA at least once annually without the presence of Management. The Head of IA has unfettered access to the ARC, the Board and Management as well as the Group's documents, records, properties and personnel relevant for the performance of audits.\n\nIA operates within the framework stated in its IA Charter which is approved and reviewed by the ARC on an annual basis. The standards of the IA Charter are consistent with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), an international professional association with global headquarters in the United States of America.\n\nThe Head of IA, Mr Benson Seah, is a Certified Internal Auditor and a member of various professional bodies, with over 20 years of experience. He has been with the Company since June 2019. All his team members have the relevant qualifications and experience and are members of The Institute of Internal Auditors of Singapore (IIAS) and/or members of other relevant professional bodies. The IA function is a corporate member of IIAS, an affiliate of the IIA. Processes are in place to ensure that the professional competence of IA staff is maintained and upgraded through continuing professional education programmes which comprised technical and non-technical training for the development of the IA staff.\n\n## Role and Activities of IA\n\nThe primary role of IA is to assist the Board to evaluate the reliability, adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management processes of the Company, reviewing the internal controls of the Company to ensure prompt and accurate recording of transactions and proper safeguarding of assets and reviewing the Company's compliance with the relevant laws, regulations and policies of the Company.\n\nThe ARC approved the annual IA plan and received regular reports during 2022 on the progress of the audit work under the IA plan. All IA reports are given to the ARC, the KMP and the Heads of the relevant business divisions, with a summary report of IA results presented at the ARC meetings. IA observations on internal control, operational and control lapses and recommendations to address them were also reviewed and discussed at ARC meetings. The ARC was satisfied that recommendations made were dealt with by the Management in a timely and appropriate manner, with outstanding exceptions or recommendations being closely monitored and reported back to the ARC.\n\nThe ARC reviewed the effectiveness and adequacy of the IA function including its resources through a review of the IA activities on a regular basis as well as its annual assessment of the IA function. The assessment was facilitated through the use of an evaluation framework which covers IA organisation, resources and continuing professional development, audit plans, work scope, quality of reports and recommendations, IA Charter and IA self-assessment. Based on the assessment conducted for 2022, the ARC is satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of the IA function and that the IA function is currently adequately resourced  and  has  appropriate independent standing within the Group to perform its functions effectively.\n\n## Provision 10.5\n\nThe ARC held five meetings during the year and carried out its duties as set out within its terms of reference. The Company Secretaries maintain records of all ARC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken. The ARC meets with the internal and external auditors, each separately without the presence of Management, at least once annually.\n\nThe ARC members continually keep themselves abreast of changes to accounting standards, risks and other issues which may have a material impact on financial statements.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the ARC conducted a self-assessment of its own effectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist ('ARC SelfAssessment Checklist').\n\nThe ARC Self-Assessment Checklist covered, inter alia , the responsibilities of the ARC under its terms of reference, and considered the contribution of the ARC members to the ARC's deliberation and decision-making process.\n\nBased on the self-assessment, the ARC is of the view that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference.\n\n## EXTERNAL AUDITORS (Provisions 10.1(d) and 10.1(e))\n\nCognisant that the external auditors should be free from any business or other relationships with the Group that could materially interfere with their ability to act with integrity and objectivity, the ARC undertook a review of the independence of KPMG and gave careful consideration to the Group's relationships with them during 2022. In determining the independence of KPMG, the ARC reviewed all aspects of the Group's relationships",

All non-prohibited non-assurance services require the approval of the ARC with the exception of non-prohibited pre-approved services below certain fee thresholds.\n\nThe ARC also considered the nature and volume of the provision of the nonaudit services by KPMG in 2022 and the corresponding fees and noted that the fees for non-audit services had not exceeded 50% of the aggregate amount of all fees paid/payable to KPMG in 2022. Based on the review, the ARC is of the opinion that KPMG is, and is perceived to be, independent for the purpose of the Group's statutory financial audit.\n\nDetails of the fees paid and/or payable by the Group in respect of audit and nonaudit services for FY 2022 are set out below:\n\n|                           | $'million   |\n|---------------------------|-------------|\n| Audit fees paid to:       |             |\n| - auditors of the Company | 3.5         |\n| - other auditors          | 3.6         |\n| Non-audit fees paid to:   |             |\n| - auditors of the Company | 1.2         |\n| - other auditors          | 2.0         |\n\nIn reviewing the nomination of KPMG for re-appointment for the financial year ending 31 December 2023, the ARC had considered the adequacy of the resources and experience of KPMG and the audit engagement partners assigned to the audit, the size and complexity of the audit engagement for the Group, and the number and experience of the supervisory and professional staff assigned to the Group's audit through a review of the curriculum vitae of the KPMG audit team. The ARC also considered the quality of\n\ndiscussions with the findings raised by KPMG, including the Audit Quality Indicators presented.\n\nKPMG has confirmed that they are registered with ACRA. The Company is thus in compliance with Rule 712 and Rule 715 (read with Rule 716) of the Listing Manual in relation to the appointment of its auditors.\n\nBased on the above, the ARC has recommended  to  the  Board  the nomination of KPMG for re-appointment as external auditors at the 2023 AGM.\n\n## Whistle-blowing Policy (Provision 10.1(f))\n\nCDL has in place a whistle-blowing policy and procedure where employees of the Company can in confidence, whether anonymously or otherwise, raise concerns on possible improprieties relating to accounting, financial reporting, internal controls and auditing matters or other matters without fear of reprisals in any form. The ARC has the responsibility of overseeing this policy to ensure that it is properly administered with the assistance of the Head of IA. Under these procedures, arrangements are in place for independent investigation of such matters raised and for appropriate follow-up action to be taken.\n\nThe Company is committed to maintaining procedures  for  the  confidential submission of reports and the identity of the whistle-blower concerned will not be disclosed if so requested by the whistle-blower who lodged the report. Investigations of such reports will be handled on a confidential basis to the extent permissible or deemed appropriate under the circumstances and involve persons who need to be involved in order to properly carry out the investigation and will, on a best-efforts basis, be carried out in a timely manner.\n\nTo facilitate and encourage the reporting of such matters, the whistle-blowing policy, together with the dedicated whistle-blowing communication channels\n\n(email and postal address as well as tollfree telephone contact numbers in various countries) are available on the Company's corporate website and intranet and are easily accessible by all employees.\n\nThe  whistle-blowing  policy  and procedures are reviewed by the ARC from time to time to ensure that they remain current.\n\nFor more information on the said policy and procedures, please refer to the Company's corporate website at www. cdl.com.sg.\n\n## INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe Company had obtained shareholders' approval at its Annual General Meeting held on 28 April 2022 ('2022 AGM') for the Company, its subsidiaries and its associated companies not listed on SGXST or an approved exchange, over which the Company, its subsidiaries and/or interested persons have control, to enter into transactions within the categories of Interested Person Transactions set out in the Company's Letter to Shareholders dated 30 March 2022 ('Letter to Shareholders'), with such persons within the class or classes of Interested Persons as described in the Letter to Shareholders, provided that such transactions are entered into in accordance with the review procedures set out in the Letter to Shareholders (the 'IPT Mandate'). The IPT Mandate is subject to annual renewal by the shareholders. Given that such Interested Person Transactions are expected to occur with some degree of frequency and may arise at any time, and to allow the Group to undertake such transactions in an expeditious manner, shareholders' approval will be sought at the 2023 AGM for the renewal of the IPT Mandate.\n\nThe  ARC  has  confirmed  that  an independent financial adviser's opinion is not required for the renewal of the IPT Mandate as the methods or procedures for determining the transaction prices of the IPTs conducted under the IPT\n\nMandate have remained appropriate since shareholders approved the renewal of the IPT Mandate at the 2022 AGM, and the methods or procedures continue to be sufficient to ensure that these IPTs will be carried out on normal commercial terms and will not be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority shareholders.\n\nParticulars of interested person transactions required to be disclosed under Rule 907 of the Listing Manual are as follows:\n\n| Name of   Interested Person                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                    | Aggregate value of all interested  person transactions in FY 2022  (excluding transactions less  than $100,000 and transactions  conducted under the IPT Mandate  pursuant to Rule 920)   | Aggregate value of all interested  person transactions conducted in  FY 2022 under the IPT Mandate  pursuant to Rule 920 (excluding                  | transactions less than $100,000)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                                             | Nature of relationship                                                                                                                                                             | $'000                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                      | $'000                              |\n| Subsidiaries  of Hong Leong  Investment  Holdings Pte.

To facilitate the exercise of shareholders' rights, the Company ensures that all material information relating to the Company and its financial performance is disclosed in an accurate and timely manner via SGXNET and uploaded at the Company's corporate website.\n\n## General Meetings (Provisions 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3)\n\nShareholders are informed of general meetings through notice sent to them. All shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings in person or by proxy or in the case of a corporate shareholder, through its appointed representative. At general meetings of the Company, shareholders are given the opportunity to communicate their views and are encouraged to ask the Directors and the Management questions regarding matters affecting the Company.\n\nThe rules for the appointment of proxies, including information that voting will be conducted by way of poll, are set out in the notice of general meetings. In accordance with the Constitution of the Company, shareholders who are not relevant intermediaries may appoint not more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote at general meetings in their absence, and shareholders who are relevant intermediaries may appoint more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote at general meetings. The proxy forms must be deposited at such place or places specified in the notice or document accompanying the notice convening the general meetings at least seventy-two hours before the time set for the general meetings.\n\nThe Company provides for separate resolutions at general meetings on each substantial issue, including treating the re-election of each Director as a separate resolution. Detailed information on each item in the AGM agenda is provided in the explanatory notes to the notice of AGM in the AR.\n\nAll Directors, including the Lead ID, the chairmen of the respective Committees, the Management, the external auditors and legal advisors (where necessary) are present at general meetings to address queries from the shareholders. At each AGM, the Group CEO and the Group CFO deliver presentations to update shareholders on the Company's operations and financial performance in the preceding year.\n\nHowever,  due  to  the  COVID-19 situation in Singapore, the 2020, 2021 and 2022 AGMs were convened and held by electronic means pursuant to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings for  Companies,  Variable  Capital Companies, Business Trusts, Unit Trusts and Debenture Holders) Order 2020 ('Temporary Order') and the checklist issued by ACRA, MAS and SGX RegCo ('Checklist'). For more details on the 2022 AGM and the forthcoming 2023 AGM, see sections below on the '2022 AGM and 2023 AGM'.\n\n## 2022 AGM and 2023 AGM\n\nIn view of the COVID-19 situation, the 2022 AGM was convened and held by electronic means on 28 April 2022 pursuant to the Temporary Order.\n\nThe alternative arrangements under the Temporary Order and the Checklist put in place for 2022 AGM included making available the Annual Report, the Notice of AGM, accompanying proxy form and other related AGM documents on the SGX website and the Company's\n\ncorporate website. Attendance at the 2022 AGM was via electronic means where shareholders could observe and/ or listen to the 2022 AGM proceedings via 'live' audio-visual webcast or 'live' audio only stream, submit questions to the Chairman of the Meeting in advance of the 2022 AGM as well as 'live' during the AGM. Substantial and relevant questions submitted were addressed prior to and at the AGM and live voting on the resolutions were put in place for the 2022 AGM.\n\nThe Board Chairman and the chairmen of the ARC, NC, RC and BSC, together with the KMP (who are not Directors) were present on site at the 2022 AGM. The other Directors and the external auditors attended the 2022 AGM virtually.\n\nThe forthcoming 2023 AGM will be held in a hybrid mode pursuant to the Temporary Order, with physical attendance of shareholders at Orchard Hotel on 26 April 2023 and via electronic means. Shareholders will be informed of the 2023 AGM through a notification sent by post.\n\nAs part of the Company's commitment towards environmental sustainability, the Notice of AGM, accompanying proxy form and other AGM related documents will only be made available on the SGX website and the Company's corporate website. Arrangements relating to attendance at the 2023 AGM, either physically or via electronic means, submission of questions in advance of, or at the 2023 AGM and voting at the 2023 AGM by shareholders or their duly appointed proxy(ies) or representative(s) in the case of corporate shareholder(s), are set out in a separate announcement to  be  released  by  the  Company on SGXNET.\n\n## Voting at General Meetings (Provision 11.4)\n\nShareholders are given the opportunity to vote at general meetings either in person or in absentia by way of appointed proxy (proxies). However, as the authentication of shareholder identity information and other related integrity issues still remain a concern, the Company has decided, for the time being, not to implement voting in absentia by electronic means.\n\nPursuant to Listing Rule 730A(2), all resolutions to be proposed at general meetings and at any adjournment thereof shall be put to the vote by way of poll.\n\nIn support of greater transparency and to allow for a more efficient voting system, the Company has been conducting electronic poll voting instead of voting by show of hands since the 2012 AGM up to the 2019 AGM. With electronic poll voting, shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting will be entitled to vote on a 'one-share, one-vote' basis. The voting results of all votes cast in respect of each resolution will also be instantaneously displayed on screen at the meeting. The detailed results setting out the number of votes cast for and against each resolution and the respective percentages will be announced via SGXNET after the AGM. An external firm is appointed as scrutineers for the AGM voting process, which is independent of the firm appointed to undertake the electronic poll voting process.\n\nFor the 2022 AGM which was held by electronic means, shareholders were able to vote 'live'. Proxy forms submitted by shareholders were also independently verified by the independent scrutineers. Results of the valid votes submitted, showing the number of votes cast for and against each resolution and the respective percentages, were announced by the Chairman at the AGM and thereafter, via SGXNET.\n\nThe Company will resume electronic poll voting at the 2023 AGM as well as 'live' voting for shareholders attending the 2023 AGM via electronic means.\n\n## Minutes of General Meetings (Provision 11.5)\n\nThe Company also maintains minutes of its general meetings, which include the key comments and queries raised by shareholders and the responses from the Board, Management and/or the external auditors. The minutes of the general meetings are available on the Company's corporate website and the SGX website as soon as practicable after the meetings.\n\n## Dividend Policy (Provision 11.6)\n\nThe Company has formalised its dividend policy which aims to provide a return to shareholders at least once a year through the payment of dividends, after taking into account the Group's financial performance, short and long-term capital requirements, future investment plans, general global and business economic conditions and any regulatory factors. The Board endeavours to maintain a balance between meeting shareholders' expectations and prudent capital management with a sustainable dividend policy. The Board will review the dividend policy from time to time and reserves the right to modify, amend and update the policy.\n\nIn line with the Company's dividend policy, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of $0.08 and a special final ordinary dividend of $0.08. This will bring the total dividend for FY 2022 to $0.28 per share. The dividend payouts in the current and past four years are set out in the '5-Year Financial Highlights' section of the AR.\n\n## Principle 12: Engagement with Shareholders\n\nThe Company notifies its investors in advance of the date of release of its financial results via SGXNET. In 2022, results for the half-year were released via SGXNET within 45 days of the end of 30 June 2022 whilst the full year results were released within 60 days from the financial year end. In presenting the Group's financial results, the Board aims to provide investors with a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group's performance and financial position with a commentary at the date of the announcement of the significant trends and competitive conditions of the industries in which it operates.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the Group CEO and the Group CFO provided assurance to the ARC and the Board on the integrity of the half-year unaudited financial statements and the Board in turn provided a negative assurance confirmation in respect of the unaudited financial statements for the half-year in accordance with the regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Company ensures that investors are notified of all material information in an accurate and timely manner. Should there be an inadvertent disclosure made to a select group, the Company will release the same information as promptly as possible via SGXNET. The financial statements and other presentation materials presented at the Company's general meetings, including material and price-sensitive information, are disseminated and publicly released via SGXNET on a timely basis. All shareholders are notified of general meetings and the documents relating thereto which are made available on the Company's corporate website and SGX website.",

In addition, the Company leverages on other communication platforms such as its online newsroom (www.cdl.com.sg/citynews) and social media channels (LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram) to provide the latest updates on the Group's business and performance milestones. Investors can subscribe to email alerts on the CDL corporate website or follow its social media channels to receive updates on its latest news.\n\nFrom time to time, the Board Chairman and the Company's Management hold briefings with analysts and the media\n\nto coincide with the release of the Group's half-year and full year financial results. Media presentation slides are also released on SGXNET and on the Company's corporate website. A live video webcast was arranged for investors at the analysts/media briefing for the full year 2022 results in February 2023. In addition, the Management takes an active role in investor relations, meeting local and foreign fund managers regularly as well as participating in investor roadshows and conferences both locally and overseas. The Head, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, is responsible for managing the Group's investor relations programmes, including the communications with the financial community, research analysts and relevant stakeholders.\n\n## Investor Relations Policy\n\n## (Provisions 12.2 and 12.3)\n\nThe Company is committed to building investor confidence and trust through effective open, two-way communication with shareholders and the investment community. The Company's Investor Relations (IR) Policy, available on the CDL corporate website (www.cdl.com. sg), sets out the process and mechanism to engage its stakeholders, including the channel of communication through which shareholders and investors may pose queries and through which the Company may respond. The IR Policy outlines the principles and framework in which the Company communicates and engages with investors, analysts and other IR stakeholders to provide balanced, clear and pertinent information. To provide investors with a better understanding of the Group's business and growth drivers, regular updates on the Group's strategies, operations and financial performance are available across multiple platforms.\n\nFurther information on the Company's investor relations policy and activities can be found on pages 67 to 68 of the AR.\n\n## Principle 13: Engagement with Stakeholders\n\n## Sustainability\n\nSince 2014, the Company started conducting materiality assessments annually, which is facilitated by a third party, to determine the key economic, environmental, social and governance ('EESG') issues that are important to the Company's stakeholders. These issues are foundational to the Company's annual sustainability reporting. Corresponding EESG targets, metrics, initiatives, and progress are reviewed by the Management team, reported to the BSC and the Board for approval, before they are published annually in the Company's Integrated Sustainability Report ('ISR').\n\nLearning from the unprecedented disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company adopted a more dynamic approach to the assessment of key ESG issues from 2020 to 2022, addressing the fast-changing landscape and supply chain issues. The exercise determined the actual and potential impacts of these issues on CDL's longterm value creation, and conversely, CDL's impact on them.\n\nThe process started with an extensive macro scanning exercise to determine the list of material risks and opportunities relevant to CDL's stakeholders and business  for  sustained  growth. Engagement with internal and external stakeholders, including the BSC, was then conducted through online surveys or interviews. Through interviews with selected management staff of headquarters and key subsidiaries, regulators, industry and sustainability experts, tenants and suppliers, the Company obtained additional insights into working towards its net zero carbon commitment and strategically addressing risks and opportunities for its businesses, while continuing to deliver long-term value for its stakeholders. The preliminary material issues were\n\nvalidated by the Company's Senior Management and approved by the BSC thereafter.\n\nWith the ever-evolving business landscape and externalities, the annual validation of CDL's key material issues is critical to help the Company sharpen its sustainability strategy and focus resources on areas that are deemed most material to its business and future growth using a forward-looking lens.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, CDL publishes an online Sustainability Report on its microsite at www.cdlsustainability.com. This voluntary initiative that started in July 2017 updates stakeholders of CDL's progress towards key goals and targets set under its Future Value 2030 Sustainability Blueprint, and sets benchmarks for the transparency and timeliness of ESG disclosures to investors and stakeholders.\n\nThe BSC assists the Board in the review and consideration of the Company's sustainability issues and approach to sustainability reporting, complementing the Company's corporate business strategy. The BSC comprises four Directors, with the Group CEO in the chair and three other IDs. The BSC's terms of reference sets out, inter alia , the objectives, roles and responsibilities of the BSC. It also includes the BSC's purview over matters relating to the Company's ESG strategy, ESG targets, the sustainability reporting framework and also the Company's policies, practices and performance on its material ESG factors which are significant and contribute to the Company's performance, business activities, and/or reputation as a global corporate citizen.\n\nThe annual ISR is dedicated to reporting on CDL's sustainability efforts and performance that addresses the social and environmental impacts pertinent to the Company's stakeholders and business. Over the years, CDL's robust sustainability reporting has evolved into a unique blended model using the Global Reporting Initiative ('GRI') Standards as its core since 2008. To address the diverse expectations of stakeholders, CDL embraced CDP since 2010, Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark since 2013, the Integrated Reporting Framework since 2015, Sustainable Development Goals ('SDG') Reporting since 2016, Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') framework since 2017, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ('SASB') Standards for Real Estate Sector and the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (\"CDSB\") Framework since 2020. CDL's ISRs are available on both its corporate website and the dedicated sustainability microsite. To enhance data credibility and instill confidence in readers, external assurance of its report started since 2009. ISR 2022 and ISR 2023's external audit has been further elevated in its scope against the GRI Standards, SASB Standards, as well as the TCFD and CDSB frameworks.\n\nFurther information on the Company's approach to stakeholder engagement and its materiality assessment can be found on pages 69 to 83 of the AR.\n\n## CORPORATE VALUES AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS\n\nThe  Board  and  Management  are committed to conducting business with integrity and consistent with high standards of business ethics, and in\n\ncompliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements. The Company has in place an internal code of business and ethical conduct crystallising the Company's business principles and practices with respect to matters which may have ethical implications.\n\nThe code, which provides a communicable and understandable framework for employees to observe the Company's principles such as honesty, integrity, responsibility and accountability at all levels of the organisation and in the conduct of the Company's business in their relationships with customers, suppliers and amongst employees, is available on the Company's intranet and is easily accessible by all employees.\n\nThe code provides guidance on issues such as:\n\n- \u00b7 conflicts  of  interest  and  the appropriate disclosures to be made;\n- \u00b7 the Company's zero tolerance stance against corruption and bribery;\n- \u00b7 compliance with applicable laws and regulations including those relating to the protection of the environment and the conservation of energy and natural resources;\n- \u00b7 compliance with the Company's policies and procedures, including those on internal controls and accounting;\n- \u00b7 safeguarding and proper use of the Company's assets, confidential information and intellectual property rights, including the respect of the intellectual property rights of third parties; and\n- \u00b7 competition and fair dealing in the conduct of the Company's business, in its relationships with customers, suppliers, competitors and towards its employees.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nIn line with the Board's commitment to maintain high ethical standards which are integral to its corporate identity and business, the Company has the following three key corporate policies in place:\n\n- (i) Anti-Corruption Policy & Guidelines which sets out the responsibilities of the Group companies and of each employee in observing and upholding CDL's 'zero- tolerance' position  against  all  forms  of corruption, bribery and extortion and provides information and guidance to employees on how to recognise, address, resolve, avoid and prevent instances of corruption, bribery and extortion which may arise in the course of their work.\n- (ii)  Fraud Policy & Guidelines which provides guidance on actions which may constitute fraudulent conduct and highlights the importance of the implementation, maintenance and compliance with the internal controls framework of the Group and its policies and procedures.\n- (iii) Competition Policy & Guidelines which states the Company's policy to compete fairly and ethically in the conduct of business in all its markets and provides direction and guidance to employees in their relationships and communications with competitors and customers.\n\nThese policies are available on the Company's corporate website, intranet and have also been disseminated to officers and employees of the Group's key subsidiaries. These policies have been translated into Mandarin and Thai for dissemination to employees of the Group in the People's Republic of China and in Thailand.\n\nThe  Company's  policy  on  how  it manages and protects personal data in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements are set out in the CDL Personal Data Policy.\n\nThe Company has also set out the following sustainability policies which are available on the Company's corporate website:\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) Policy - Established in 2003, the EHS Policy sets the strategic direction for all departments and employees towards creating a 'Safe & Green' corporate culture by adhering to regulatory compliance, reducing environmental impact, and ensuring a safe, fair and inclusive workplace.\n- \u00b7 Human Rights Policy - Sets out the Company's commitment in upholding fundamental principles of human and workplace rights in places where the Company operates. Beyond compliance to the local government's policies and regulations in protecting human rights, CDL is committed to respecting human rights in all aspects of its stakeholder engagement such as equitable employment practices, non-discrimination, welfare and fair compensation, as well as workplace health and safety within its developments.\n- \u00b7 Climate Change Policy - In line with CDL's sustainability strategy and commitment to its ethos of 'Conserving as We Construct' since 1995, the Company is dedicated to climate action and achieving low carbon operations. CDL became the first real estate conglomerate in  Southeast  Asia  to  sign  the World Green Building Council's\n\n('WorldGBC') Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment in February 2021. This is a global pledge to achieve net zero operational carbon by 2030, covering new and existing wholly-owned assets under CDL's direct management and operational control. In November 2021, during COP26, CDL extended its pledge towards a net zero whole life carbon emissions approach. Through this expanded commitment, the Company pledged  to  achieve  maximum reduction of embodied carbon in new developments, compensating for any remaining residual operational and upfront embodied emissions via offsetting for new developments by 2030 and advocating for all buildings to be net zero carbon by 2050. In 2018, CDL was the first real estate company in Singapore to set Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi')validated carbon reduction targets based on a 2\u00b0C warmer scenario with 2007 baseline year. CDL renewed its SBTi-validated targets in December 2021 by aligning with a more stringent 1.5\u00b0C warmer scenario and 2016 baseline year.\n\n- \u00b7 Green Building Policy - CDL is committed to incorporating decarbonisation, innovation, inclusivity, health and wellbeing into the design and operation of its buildings. To provide a safe, healthy and inclusive environment for its employees, customers and workers, it is crucial to proactively adopt smart and sustainable building technologies. The 3S Framework built on the three thrusts - Smart, Sustainable and Super Low Carbon will drive CDL's commitment to reduce its carbon footprint and environmental impact in line with CDL's net zero whole life carbon buildings commitment and the Singapore Green Plan 2030.\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity Policy - CDL supports Singapore's 'City in Nature' vision towards higher living standards while co-existing with flora and fauna. The Company aims to minimise and mitigate the impacts of its developments on natural habitats and to protect wildlife biodiversity. The policy complements Singapore's 'City in Nature' vision and takes reference from national frameworks, such as the new Biodiversity Impact Assessment guidelines set by URA and NParks.\n- \u00b7 Sustainable Investment Principles ('SIP') - As a responsible developer with a longstanding ESG commitment, the Company is focused on taking proactive action in assessing potential portfolio risks and opportunities for\n\nsustainable investment decisions via globally aligned principles set out in the policy. The SIP is formulated in line with the Glasgow Climate Pact, and aligned with the global best practices laid out in the UN SDGs, UN Principles for Responsible Investment, TCFD and UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative. It also complements CDL's existing ESG policies and guidelines, including the Climate Change Policy, EHS Policy, Green Building Policy, Biodiversity Policy and Human Rights Policy.\n\n## INTERNAL CODE ON DEALINGS IN SECURITIES\n\nThe Company has in place an internal code on securities trading which sets out the implications of insider trading and\n\nprovides guidance and internal regulation with regard to dealings in the Company's securities by its Directors and employees. These guidelines prohibit dealing in the Company's securities (a) on short-term considerations, (b) while in possession of unpublished material price-sensitive information in relation to such securities, and (c) during the 'closed period', which will be one month before the date of announcement of the Company's halfyear and full year financial results, and ending on the date of the announcement of the relevant results. The Directors and employees of the Company are notified in advance of the commencement of each 'closed period' relating to dealing in the Company's securities. The internal code on securities trading is available on the Company's intranet and is easily accessible by all employees.",

        "page_content": "## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## MANAGING RISKS TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTIES AND MAXIMISE OPPORTUNITIES\n\nManaging risk is an integral part of the Group's business and it continually strives towards best risk management practices. The Board, supported by the Audit & Risk Committee (ARC) and other Board committees, maintain an overall responsibility and oversight of the key risks to the Group's business. Relevant and material risk issues are surfaced for discussion with the ARC and the Board on a quarterly basis at a minimum, to keep them informed in a timely manner. The ARC considers the nature and extent of significant risks which the Group may undertake in achieving its strategic objectives and guides management in the formulation and implementation of the risk management framework, policies and processes. This ensures that significant risks are effectively identified, evaluated and mitigated, to safeguard shareholders' interests and the Group's assets, furthering corporate sustainability. The ARC also reports to the Board on critical risk issues, material matters, findings and recommendations.\n\nThe Group's risk management framework provides the principles and guidance for the Group's risk management activities.\n\n## CDL Group Risk Management Framework\n\nThe above five (5) key pillars serve as the foundation of ERM execution and implementation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Material risks are categorised into four key areas\n\n## Strategic\n\n## Treasury and Financial\n\nExternal environment as well as emerging or evolving threats on business execution\n\n## Operational and Compliance\n\nPeople, Processes, Systems\n\nDuring the year, the Group's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function implemented several initiatives targeted at strengthening various aspects of people and processes which are key elements of its risk management framework. Some of the notable initiatives include:\n\n- \u00b7  Conducting a risk culture survey and benchmarking studies to introduce right initiatives to target at-risk areas with the aim to support and reinforce a desired risk culture and mindset.\n\nMarket concentration, liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and internal financial management and control\n\n## Information and Technology\n\nLoss of information, data security, and service disruption of critical IT systems\n\n- \u00b7  Delivering customised training programmes covering trends in anti-money laundering/counter-terrorism financing, cyber threat and data privacy compliance requirements to raise the level of awareness and understanding, as well as to improve the capabilities of our first line of defence against such risks.\n- \u00b7  Enhancing the Group's data privacy handling and management protocols to ensure strong and robust data security and compliance.\n- \u00b7  Strengthening the Group's Cyber Security infrastructure and systems by identifying, prioritising and closing out the highrisk gaps within our subsidiaries.\n- \u00b7  Intensifying efforts in Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) management by reviewing the Group's sustainability goals and efforts with a focus on emerging climate and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks.\n- \u00b7  Partnering with risk consultancies to model Probable Maximum Loss exposure scenarios to validate the Group's risk transfer strategy.\n- \u00b7  Calibrating Group-wide risk transfer strategy to optimise the balance between risk retention and risk transfer.\n- \u00b7 Implemented first loss e-notification system across all Singapore properties, with plans to roll it out globally.\n- \u00b7  Updating the Control Self-Assessment (CSA) programme, with the assessment targeting drivers of identified key risks, to facilitate early identification of control gaps and areas for improvement.\n- \u00b7  Performing climate change scenario analysis, focused on 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C warmer scenario in 2030.\n\nThe Group's ERM Framework and initiatives are also rolled out to subsidiary companies and affiliates to ensure that risk management practices are aligned, and all material risk factors are duly considered and adequately addressed. The Group's ERM function facilitates the alignment process and provides guidance through training and knowledge-sharing sessions to raise employees' risk awareness and embrace the Group's risk culture.\n\n## RISK STRATEGY\n\nThe Group's risk strategy is based on the belief that risk management is the responsibility of all employees and that it must be integrated into strategy formulation, capital allocation, decision-making and day-to-day operations. The fostering of strong and sustainable 'self-driven' risk culture is guided by defined principles that underpin the ERM operating model.\n\n## Guiding Principles\n\n- \u00b7  Line managers are to own risks and be accountable\n- \u00b7  Risk management activities are to hinge not only on processes and systems, but equally on a right mindset and attitude\n- \u00b7  Risk management is to be benchmarked against global best practices\n\n## RISK CULTURE\n\nWith the belief that mindsets and attitudes are fundamental to effective risk management, the Group advocates a strong 'risk aware' culture to reinforce 'doing the right thing' naturally. Management is fully committed to fostering a strong riskcentric culture through setting the appropriate tone at the top and demonstrating strong support for risk management. Risk awareness and accountability are embedded in our culture through our governance structure that ensures appropriate oversight and accountability for effective management of risks throughout the Group, further supported by risk management principles that are embedded in all our decision-making and business processes.\n\n## RISK APPETITE\n\nThe risk appetite was set to define the extent of risks the Group is able and willing to take on to achieve our strategic and business objectives. The purpose of establishing a risk appetite framework is not to limit risk-taking but to ensure that the Group's risk profile remains within tolerable boundaries as opportunities are maximised. The risk appetite statements, along with the accompanying risk tolerance limits in both quantitative and/or qualitative terms, are reviewed annually.\n\nThe Board has approved the following risk appetite statements:\n\n- \u00b7  The Group will continue to focus on business activities in identified core markets. Apart from the core markets, the Group shall otherwise not be overly exposed to any other single country.\n- \u00b7  The Group is prepared to undertake new investment and innovation initiatives commensurate to expected returns and/or are in line with the Group's core strength and strategic objectives. From acquisition to divestment, all investments undertaken should not have potential loss exposure that could significantly threaten the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 The Group will avoid any situations and/or actions that may result in negative impact on our reputation and branding. Should such situations arise, they will be managed aggressively to preserve our reputation and brand image.\n- \u00b7  The Group will maintain adequate liquid assets to cover planned cash outflows and shall not take speculative positions  on  interest  rates  and  foreign  exchange.\n- \u00b7  The  Group  maintains  a  'zero-tolerance'  position  in relation to EHS breaches or lapses, non-compliance with laws and regulations, as well as criminally dishonest acts such as fraud, corruption, bribery and extortion.\n- \u00b7  The Group will minimise operational and IT risk, subject to the cost-benefit trade-off.\n\nThe Management Risk Committee monitors the Group's risk profiles and regulatory compliance status on a quarterly basis.",

        "page_content": "## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## RISK GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Group's risk governance structure comprises three lines of defence that illustrate how specific duties related to risk and controls are assigned and coordinated within the Group to facilitate timely risk identification, escalation and provision of Board assurance.\n\n## RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## First Line of Defence - Risk Owners -\n\nThe line managers of respective business and support functions are accountable and responsible for implementing and executing effective controls to manage the risks arising from their business activities. This includes establishing adequate managerial and supervisory controls to ensure compliance with policies, risk appetite, threshold limits and effective risk controls, and to highlight gaps, inadequacy of processes and unexpected risk events.\n\n## Second Line of Defence\n\n- ERM -\n\nThe ERM function is responsible for designing, implementing and improving the risk management framework as part of the ERM and control assurance program. It also provides independent identification, assessment and monitoring, and reporting of the Group's risk profiles and material risk issues to the Management Risk Committee and the ARC.\n\n## Third Line of Defence -Internal Audit & Management Risk Committee -\n\nThe Internal Audit department provides independent assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management framework to senior management and the ARC. Significant risk issues are also surfaced for discussion with the ARC and the Board by senior management, to keep them fully informed in a timely and accurate manner. All ARC members, including the Chairman of the ARC, are independent non-executive directors.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nThe Group adopts an integrated top-down and bottom-up risk review process that enables systematic identification and prioritisation of all material risks. An integral part of the process towards effective risk management is continuous communication and consultation with internal and external stakeholders. This enables the Group to understand the importance of risk management, to appreciate the decisions that are taken within the Group, and to implement the best policies and practices necessary for the benefit of the Group.\n\n## MATERIAL RISKS TO THE GROUP\n\nThe Group categorises its risk profiles into four key areas: Strategic, Treasury and Financial, Operational and Compliance, and Information Technology. These risks vary widely, with many being beyond the Group's control. The Group is committed to mitigate risk exposure through appropriate risk management strategies and adequate internal controls. Close monitoring and control processes, including the use of appropriate key risk and key performance indicators, are implemented to ensure the risk profiles are managed within  the  Group's  risk  appetite  and  tolerance  limits.\n\n## Strategic Risk\n\nA large part of the Group's strategic risks comprises market-driven forces, evolving business landscapes, changing customer demands and disruptive innovations. The Group remains vulnerable to uncertainties in the major economies, implications from geopolitical developments, keen competition and pressure in the real estate and hospitality industry.\n\n## Market and Competition\n\nGiven the geographical diversity of our business, the Group is exposed to various levels of event risks in major economies, as well as in key financial and property markets. The Group's principal business operations, comprising property development, property investment and hotel operations, face significant competition across the diverse markets in which they operate, and the failure to compete effectively in terms of price, market positioning, product quality, and levels of service could adversely affect the Group's financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Brand and Reputation\n\nThe Group's reputation is one of its most valuable assets, playing a major part in the continued success of the business. The assessment of reputational risk, due to the nature of this type of risk, is constantly evolving and dependent on numerous factors at any given point in time, and it is therefore not possible to define all matters and circumstances which may pose reputational risk, or to set out all the considerations which should be applied as part of the decisionmaking process.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nThe Group recognises that climate risks are business risks. A focal issue of the Paris Agreement and Singapore Green Plan 2030, climate change is one of the long-term key global risks that can potentially impact the Group's assets, revenue, operations, supply chain, product design, stakeholder engagement, and investor communication. Aside from physical risks arising from climate change, regulatory transition risks can result in stricter emission standards, increased carbon tax and water pricing, and stricter building design requirements. The Group prioritises ESG communication and reporting to proactively manage rising stakeholder  capitalism,  investor  and consumer activism. In the face of climate change, climate-proofing its buildings for a low-carbon future is key to the Group's growth strategy.\n\n## Regulatory Changes\n\nThe Group operates in many jurisdictions and is exposed to various levels of political and policy risks, such as political uncertainties, introduction or change in public policies, statutory and regulatory requirements.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Monitoring macroeconomic trends, market conditions, and developments and formulating responses and pre-emptive strategies accordingly.\n- b) Leveraging on our market analytics and project delivery expertise to introduce quality products and innovative solutions to meet the evolving consumer demands.\n- c) Strengthening our brand and competitiveness through product differentiation, market positioning, operational efficiency, transformation through innovation and creating new revenue generating platforms, as well as leveraging on a portfolio of distribution channel partners.\n- d) Diversifying of portfolio across geographies, focusing on core markets and cities where the Group has operational scale and where underlying economic fundamentals are more robust.\n- e) Distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of our lodging products and services by focusing on delivering a seamless customer experience, including our Loyalty Program, direct booking channels, and consumerfacing technology platforms and services, from those offered by others.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Undertaking active monitoring of both traditional and social media platforms, aggressively responding to and managing any undesirable situation(s) that may arise.\n- b) Raising the profile of our brands through marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships to build brand equity.\n- c) Focusing on a customer-centric approach and monitoring customer satisfaction closely through surveys, gathering of feedback, inspections and other forms of engagement.\n- d) Establishing brand standards that are designed to maintain a level of product consistency based on the brand collection to which a hotel belongs, whilst allowing flexibility in order to maintain the personality of the property.\n- e) Striving to avoid any situations and/or actions that could result in a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Pledging net zero whole life carbon for CDL's new developments and major renovations over which we have direct operational and management control in Singapore by 2030, in accordance with World Green Building Council's Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment.\n- b) Implementing robust climate mitigation and adaptation strategies to accelerate efforts towards a lowcarbon business model, such as setting carbon emissions reduction targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for a 1.5 o C warmer scenario.\n- c) Pushing the envelope in innovative green building technologies to enhance the resilience of its assets against physical and transition risks posed by climate change. Setting up the Green Building and Technology Application team under the Sustainability portfolio in 2020, the Group remains committed to exploring new frontiers in innovation and sustainable investing.\n- d) Measuring and disclosing CDL's management of climate-related risks using internationally recognised frameworks/ assessments, such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) and CDP.\n- e) Conducting climate change scenario analyses as a means of testing the Group's strategic resilience against different plausible and science-based climate scenarios. The analysis also covered climate-related risks from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as emerging net-zero regulatory landscapes across five key CDL markets.\n- f) Monitoring supply chain risks to better prepare for the increasing physical and social challenges impacting the Group's supplies of materials and workers.\n- g) Raising the bar on proactive, transparent and prompt ESG communication and reporting via digital platforms.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Actively engaging with regulatory bodies and professional firms on updates to laws and regulations.\n- b) Continuous monitoring and assessment of impact arising from regulatory changes, observing market reactions, and formulating our strategies accordingly.",

In this regard, it is paramount that the Group maintains high environment, health and safety standards across  the  Group,  particularly  at  the operational level.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Allocating appropriate attention to technically challenging and high-value projects.\n- b) Adopting a systematic assessment and monitoring process to identify and manage the key risks for each project. The Group adopts a rigorous project management process to ensure that project cost, build quality and time objectives are met and have put in place stringent pre-qualification and tendering procedures to appoint well-qualified vendors. Regular site visits are also conducted to closely monitor the progress of projects and manage potential risks of delays, poor workmanship and cost overruns.\n- c) Benchmarking our quality assurance processes against industry standards.

With the world at 1.2 o C warmer than pre-industrial times, extreme weather events are already affecting at least 85% of the world's population, with an increased frequency and severity of natural disasters over the last few years.\n\nAs  we  approach  a  climate  tipping point, the world must accelerate action to address climate change and limit global warming within 1.5\u00b0C by 2030. Decarbonisation efforts need to be accelerated this decade. CDL's corporate ethos of 'Conserving as We Construct', established in 1995, has positioned it well in the race to zero. CDL's World Green Building Council's (WorldGBC) Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment and more ambitious carbon emissions reduction  targets  assessed  and validated by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) marks a leap forward in its decarbonisation commitment. At COP27 in November 2022, CDL signed the Action Declaration on Climate Policy Engagement launched by Corporate Knights and the Global 100 Council to tackle climate emergencies through urgent and collective action in the global Race to Zero. Since mid-2022, with the Group's hotel operations arm emerging from  COVID-19  disruptions,  CDL proactively engaged its key subsidiaries Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited\n\n(M&C) and CBM Pte Ltd in setting clear targets and committing to action aligned with CDL's 2030 net zero goals.\n\nCDL remains dedicated to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) integration and is focused on capturing growth opportunities while mitigating ESG risks, creating value for all stakeholders. CDL's Integrated Sustainability Report (ISR) 2023, 'Zero in on Positive Impact', details the Company's ESG strategy and actions towards creating a positive impact in the communities it operates in, and charting its path towards a net zero future.\n\n## MAINTAINING SUSTAINABILITY LEADERSHIP & STRONG GOVERNANCE\n\n## Continued  Recognition  by  Global Sustainability Rankings and Awards\n\nAs a testament to CDL's long-standing commitment to sustainable development, its  corporate  sustainability  efforts have been affirmed by leading global sustainability ratings and rankings:\n\n- \u00b7 Global  100  Most  Sustainable Corporations in the World by Corporate Knights: Ranked 28th in 2023 and maintained the world's topmost sustainable real estate management and development company for the fifth consecutive year, and the only Singapore company listed for 14 consecutive years\n- \u00b7 CDP: Only  Singapore  company\n\nrecognised in the 2022 CDP A List; only company in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong to maintain double 'A's for climate change (since 2018) and water security (since 2019)\n\n- \u00b7 FT-Nikkei-Statista Asia-Pacific Climate Leaders 2022: One of four Singapore companies and only Singapore property company to be listed\n- \u00b7 MSCI ESG Research: Maintained 'AAA' rating since 2010\n- \u00b7 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI): Only Singapore real estate company listed since 2018\n- \u00b7 Sustainalytics: 2023 Global 50 TopRated, Industry Top-Rated and Regional Top-Rated\n\nSince 2014, CDL has established an integrated governance structure with everyone committed to their role in coordinating ESG efforts, both horizontally between the ESG pillars and business functions, and vertically across reporting lines up to the Group CEO and the Board. The Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) reports directly to the Board Sustainability Committee  (BSC),  which  comprises three independent directors, and CDL's Executive Director and Group CEO. The BSC has direct advisory supervision of CDL's sustainability strategy, material ESG issues, work plans, performance targets setting, tracking and reporting. At least two meetings are held annually for the management to update the BSC on CDL's sustainability plans and performance\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the CSO submits a quarterly report and communicates with the BSC on CDL's ESG performance and initiatives, as well as global and local ESG trends. CDL's sustainability governance, management and disclosures are in line with global best practices and SGX's mandate on climate disclosures and board supervision.\n\nTo achieve effective company-wide integration of sustainability, the CSO chairs the Sustainability Committee, which comprises members across all departments and operational units. In 2021, CDL stepped up to strengthen the links between its ESG performance with  the  remuneration  of  the  Key Management Personnel (KMP). With Heads of Departments (HODs) reporting to the respective KMP, the ESG KPIs will cascade down to every level in the organisation. HODs are held accountable for their ESG performances, which are captured in their annual performance appraisal  that  is  linked  to  their remuneration and promotion.\n\nIn addition to the annual sustainability reporting,  CDL  publishes  an  online quarterly sustainability report at www. cdlsustainability.com. This voluntary disclosure, since July 2017, has set benchmarks  for  transparency  and timeliness of ESG disclosures to investors and stakeholders.\n\n## 2022 IN REVIEW - ZERO IN ON POSITIVE IMPACT\n\n## More Robust ESG Policies and Guidelines for Greater Alignment along the Value Chain\n\nCDL's Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy, Climate Change Policy and Biodiversity Policy underwent a review in 2022 for greater alignment with Paris-aligned regulations and global and local standards. Building upon CDL's long-established EHS Policy and Green Procurement Guidelines, the Company formalised a Green Building Policy to\n\nNotes\n\n:\n\n- 1 Based on the latest research and scenario analysis from global climate benchmarks such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, International Energy Agency, the Network for Greening the Financial System, and the World Bank.\n\nprovide greener, safer, healthier and more inclusive environments for its building users.\n\nAs  waterways  inevitably  incur  the downstream impact of activities on land, the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient green economy would not be possible without conserving the ocean. In this regard, CDL has a longstanding commitment to biodiversity protection and urban greenery. Since 2010, CDL has voluntarily conducted Biodiversity Impact Assessments (BIA) on greenfield sites before construction. To advance biodiversity protection and urban greenery at its sites and buildings, a Biodiversity Policy, expanding on BIA practices, was formulated in 2020. The policy complements Singapore's 'City in Nature' vision established in 2021. In 2016, CDL piloted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study for the Forest Woods residential development project, expanding the usual scope on biodiversity impact to cover the development's  potential  impact  on traffic, public health, heritage, and the environment. Based on this pilot, CDL is exploring possibilities of applying the EIA for future developments.\n\nScope 3 emissions are also increasingly becoming a priority for companies to tackle their climate risks. CDL has been actively engaging and empowering its value chain, including M&C, to identify opportunities for greater resource efficiencies to lower its carbon footprint. CDL was included in the 2022 CDP Supplier Engagement Leaderboard for the third consecutive year, placing CDL in the top 8% of companies assessed by CDP for supplier engagement on climate change.\n\n## ACCELERATING TOWARDS THE GLOBAL RACE TO ZERO\n\nTo tackle the climate emergency, CDL is well placed to accelerate climate action and create positive environmental, social, governance, and business impact. Building\n\nupon its corporate ethos of 'Conserving as We Construct', established in 1995, CDL's Economic, Environmental, Social and Governance (EESG) strategy continues to guide its value creation model to achieve its three deliverables with positive impact: 'Decarbonisation', 'Digitalisation and Innovation' and 'Disclosure and Communication'.\n\n## Decarbonisation - Expanding Scope and Managing Performance\n\nIn 2021, CDL became Southeast Asia's first real estate conglomerate to sign the World Green Building Council's (WorldGBC) Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment - a global pledge to achieve net zero operational carbon by 2030. This was then expanded to include maximum embodied carbon reduction in new developments and compensation of all residual upfront emissions. In December 2021, CDL revised its Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-validated GHG emissions intensity reduction targets (Scope 1, 2 and 3) to be aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C warmer scenario, with additional targets to reduce Scope 3 emissions. In 2022, CDL stepped up on operationalising and tracking its carbon reduction performance for Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions against these SBTi-validated targets.\n\nAs one of the first four companies in Singapore to adopt the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2017, CDL completed its third Climate Change Scenario Study in December 2022. 1 This study focused on CDL's readiness for physical and transitional risks. The scope and region included under the CDL Group were expanded, given the rising urgency, scale, and severity of climate change. The study considered the disruptions caused by the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted business operations and financial performance.\n\nThe IFRS Foundation's International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards, slated to be published in\n\n2023 2 , will require additional disclosures in Scope 3, along with Scopes 1 and 2. In anticipation of this, CDL has continued to raise the bar in tackling Scope 3 emissions through closer strategic alignment and integration with its wider global value chain, including key subsidiaries such as M&C, CBM Pte Ltd, and its supply chain. 3 CDL's renewed SBTi-validated targets aligned with 1.5\u00b0C emissions reduction target of 58.8% under Scope 3 (category 15) will extend to all major subsidiaries. 4\n\n## Digitalisation & Innovation Addressing Ever-Changing Market Risks & Opportunities\n\nDecarbonisation is only possible with effective collaborations amongst the wider ecosystem to create and implement smart and sustainable solutions. It is, therefore, unsurprising that innovation has risen to be the Company's top material issue in 2022.\n\nIn the past year, CDL has prioritised and intensified its use of innovative and viable green building technology and circular economy solutions. Its strategic partnerships with various start-ups continue, including using Cool Paint at the facade of its assets, such as Jungceylon Shopping Center in Phuket, Thailand, to reduce surface temperature by up to 8 o C. The installation of about 7,000 square metres of solar panels are slated to complete by Q2 2023 at the roof of Jungceylon Shopping Center as well. These solar panels have the capacity to generate approximately 1.6 million kWh of electricity, equivalent to 6% of the building's total annual energy consumption. At CDL's Irwell Hill Residences, the company piloted another start-up's battery energy storage system to replace diesel-powered generators at  construction  sites,  successfully achieving an 85% reduction in carbon emissions over a 90-day test period. By implementing an innovative selflearning building intelligence system at Republic Plaza, CDL optimised building\n\nair-conditioning performance, achieving a 22% improvement in occupants' comfort. Other emerging sustainability solutions test-bedded by CDL include solar films, and energy-optimising air-conditioner filters, amongst others. These advanced material solutions have helped to improve overall operational efficiency and minimise heat exposure risks to building users. More details can be found in CDL's ISR 2023, page 60.\n\nCDL  continues  to  advocate  climate action amongst its stakeholders. At the 8th World Cities Summit in August 2022, jointly organised by Singapore's Centre for Liveable Cities and the Urban Redevelopment Authority, CDL sponsored the City Innovators Stage. The Company showcased 13 innovator partners with solutions  to  future-proof  the  built environment and young start-ups with future-forward solutions to contribute to a low-carbon and sustainable future.\n\nCDL will continue to track sustainable building technologies in support of global and national goals for smarter, greener, and more resilient cities to achieve longterm resilience of CDL's businesses and its communities. Innovative thinking and adoption of Proptech with investment in longstanding R&D partnerships remain crucial in the Company's journey towards net zero emissions.\n\n## Accelerating Super-Low Carbon, Smart and Sustainable Buildings\n\nIn  line  with  the  SG  Green  Building Masterplan's 80-80-80 goals, CDL has been committed to enhancing its existing assets and achieving Super Low Energy Buildings (SLEB) for 80% of its owned and managed buildings by 2030. With this in mind, CDL set new benchmarks for two of its developments: Newport Plaza - Singapore's first Building and Construction Authority (BCA) Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy (SLE) Certification for Residential Building and first mixed commercial development\n\n## Notes :\n\n- 2 ISSB confirms requirement to use climate-related scenario analysis, IFRS, 1 November 2022.\n- \u00b3 In 2019, M&C announced its SBTi-validated 2 o C target for absolute emissions reduction by 27% for owned and managed hotels under Scope 1 and 2.\n- 4 Based on publicly disclosed data from 2016 to 2020.\n- 5 UN PRI Signatory Update (October to December 2022).\n\n(Service Apartment, Offices, Retail); and Copen Grand Executive Condominium (EC) - Singapore's first BCA Green Mark Platinum SLE EC.\n\nCDL is also proud to be a leading developer with a pioneering commitment to green buildings in Singapore, with 120 BCA Green Mark developments since the Green Mark scheme became mandatory in 2008.

As an affirmation of CDL's proactive human resource policies and practices, CDL was named 'Employer of Choice 2022' by HRM Asia, and also one of the 'Best Companies to Work for in Asia' by HR Asia Awards Singapore 2022.\n\nAs one of Singapore's earliest corporate signatories to pledge support to the UN Global Compact, CDL has been upholding the  principles  of  human  rights  and labour in its human resource practices. In addition, CDL has been a signatory of the Employers' Pledge of Fair Employment Practices with the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices since 2008. With a workforce that is majority female, CDL is committed to empower women in its workplace and supporting their pursuit of careers and personal development. In 2017, CDL's Group CEO joined over 1,600 leaders globally in pledging CDL's support for the Women's Empowerment Principles, established by UNGC and UN Women.\n\n## Occupational Health and Safety\n\nAs a responsible developer, CDL has continued to proactively engage and empower its key stakeholders, including builders, architects, engineers, and workers in adopting EHS best practices. For more than two decades, CDL has driven EHS\n\nexcellence at its worksites and across its supply chain. Under CDL's pioneering 5-Star EHS Assessment System established in 2001, all its builders must undergo quarterly EHS inspections and audits by an independent auditor, which grades them on a scale of one to five stars in areas including energy, water, waste, safety, noise and public health management. The CDL 5-Star EHS Awards launched in 2005 remains a core scheme to recognise exemplary builders and workers for their excellence in enhancing workplace safety, health and well-being. CDL has also introduced various innovative technology and construction methods since the early 2000s to enhance safety and productivity. Details can be found in CDL's ISR 2023 pages 84-85.\n\nThe occupational health and well-being of CDL employees, as well as workers at  construction  sites  and  managed properties, are vital for CDL's long-term business viability. While no occupational diseases  were  recorded,  there  was unfortunately one fatality at Copen Grand on 13 December 2022. Immediate action was taken to investigate the cause and ensure further preventive measures were established. This is in addition to regular briefings and action undertaken to remind CDL's contractors and workers of the importance of good health and safety practices on-site.\n\nIts overall minor injury rates are well below the national average for 2022, based on figures provided by the Ministry of Manpower. While the minor injury rates in CDL's Corporate Office and Construction Sites remained below the national average, the minor injury rate in\n\nManaged Buildings exceeded the national average. Similarly, CDL's overall major injury rates exceeded the national average mainly due to a single injury that occurred at the Orchard Boulevard construction site.\n\nCorrective actions for both minor and major  incidents  were  immediately implemented, and learnings from all incidents were actively shared with the respective managers, EHS working committees and contractors. CDL takes a serious stance on occupational health and safety and is committed to continual improvement of safety practices.\n\n## Standing Together with Stakeholders through COVID-19\n\nMany of CDL's tenants in Singapore and overseas were adversely impacted by COVID-19, particularly during Singapore's Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), which saw a tightening of measures. CDL continued to work directly with them to navigate the operational challenges. This included providing rental, operational and marketing support to tenants adversely impacted by stricter measures. Since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 and until 2021, CDL has committed more than $40 million in property tax and rental rebates. Close to 90% of CDL's rental tenants have received rental assistance.\n\n## Job Creation and Employment\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, CDL has a total of 406 employees for its operations headquartered in Singapore, where most of its business in property development and asset management is based, excluding hotel properties.",

The average tenure of the CDL Corporate Office's employees is about 8.8 years and more than 50% of its employees have been with the Company for over five years. The CDL Corporate Office's employee resignation rate of 16.8% continued to remain significantly lower than the national average of 20.8% in 2022. CDL experienced an involuntary turnover rate of about 1.5%, of which 0.5% is due to retirement.\n\n## Total Number of Employees at CDL's Corporate Office\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee Turnover Rate (%) at CDL's Corporate Office\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCDL*\n\nNational Average\n\n- *   Computation of annual employee turnover is based on cumulative monthly attrition rate derived from the number of resignations for the month divided by the headcount for the month.\n- +   Extrapolated from MOM's website as Q4 2022 national resignation rate was not available at the time of publication.\n\n## Training and Development\n\nIn 2022, CDL invested over $450,000 in training and development for its Corporate Office employees. More than 17,000 training hours or an average of more than five training days per staff were achieved across the workforce. To support workfrom-home arrangements, CDL expanded its suite of online learning offerings for its workforce. Throughout the year, CDL conducted 34 online workshops covering project management, big data and data\n\nanalytics, sustainability, occupational health and safety, mindfulness, and the cultivation of healthy lifestyles.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nCDL is committed to providing equal opportunities throughout employment. Its recruitment process adheres to strict guidelines on non-discrimination and fair treatment, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, or age. Women made up a significant 69% of CDL Corporate Office's workforce and 50% of HODs. The internal Diversity and Inclusion Task Force was formed in 2017 to promote diversity and inclusion within the workplace and the wider community.\n\n## Gender Diversity at CDL's Corporate Office\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Gender  Pay Gap across  Employee  Categories   | Mean Salary of  Female Employees  to Male Employees  (%) 18   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Executive                                      | 82%                                                           |\n| Non-management                                 | 97%                                                           |\n| Management                                     | 91%                                                           |\n\n## Community Investments and Active Stakeholder Engagement\n\nCDL's community outreach initiatives are aligned with SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). The Company has been actively initiating and providing support to programmes that deliver lasting and positive impact, focusing on these key areas:\n\n- \u00b7  Thought Leadership on Climate Action and Sustainable Development\n- \u00b7  Women Empowerment\n\n- \u00b7  Youth Engagement and Development\n- \u00b7  Community Outreach\n- \u00b7  Charity Initiatives\n\nBeing an early adopter of sustainability integration and reporting, CDL has built up over two decades of know-how and experience to support Singapore and the building industry's transition to sustainability practices. In partnership with Global Green Connect in January 2022, CDL's SSA launched Sustainability Connect (SC), a platform to connect and empower sustainability professionals amidst growing demand for ESG training. In August 2022, SC and Sustainable Finance Research Hub announced the launch of a new partnership to bring the Certified ESG Analyst\u00ae (CESGA) exam to Singapore, a pioneering initiative to help analysts acquire and build up essential ESG knowledge.\n\nCDL also held its fifth Youth4Climate Festival, in partnership with the Singapore Botanic Gardens and in support of the President's Challenge and Singapore's Climate  Action  Week  organised  by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment. The festival comprised a sharing by Robert Swan OBE, renowned explorer and the first person in history to walk to both the North and South poles, a family movie screening and a youth concert. This is one of CDL's flagship programmes in support of youth empowerment, social good and the UN SDGs.\n\n## Singapore Sustainability Academy A Hub for Advocacy on Climate Action, Sustainable Development and Capacity Building\n\nBuilding a sustainable future requires the collaboration of a larger ecosystem. Engaging, educating and empowering communities are pivotal for a more climate-resilient future. Designed and built by CDL with industry partners, the SSA is the first ground-up initiative and zero-energy facility in Singapore dedicated to capacity building and thought leadership for climate action.\n\nNote:\n\n- 18 Calculated as the mean salary of female staff over the mean salary of male staff. Executive: executives to Assistant Vice Presidents, and secretaries; Nonmanagement: officer grades and below; Management: Vice Presidents and above.\n\nSince its opening in 2017 to the end of 2022, the SSA has reached out to over 100 partners, including government agencies, industries, businesses and NGOs, and hosted more than 780 sustainabilityrelated  training  programmes  and advocacy events involving close to 27,800 attendees. In 2022, with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in Singapore, both physical and hybrid programmes reached out to thousands of local and international participants.\n\n## CDL Green Gallery - A Net Zero Exhibition Space for Climate Action\n\nLaunched by CDL and opened alongside the Singapore Botanic Gardens Heritage Museum by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in 2013, the CDL Green Gallery is the first zero-energy gallery in Singapore.\n\nIn support of SDG 14 (Life Below Water) and  SDG  17  (Partnerships  for  the Goals) and as part of its long-standing partnership with National Parks Board, CDL launched the second edition of its Climate Action Exhibition series at the CDL Green Gallery in Singapore Botanic Gardens in April 2022. Themed 'Change the Present, Save the Ocean.\", the exhibit illustrated the interconnectedness of climate change and the health of the oceans, people, and the planet. The exhibition reached and educated 33,318 visitors through in-person visits and its virtual platform in 2022.\n\nMore details can be found in CDL's ISR 2023, page 110.\n\n## Employee Volunteerism\n\nSince 1999, CDL's dedicated employeeled volunteering body, City Sunshine Club (CSC), has been actively reaching out to the less fortunate and underprivileged, providing an avenue for CDL employees to serve the community. CSC organises monthly food distribution drives where CDL employees distribute household necessities to the low-income elderly living in rental flats. During festive seasons, CSC collaborates with the\n\nNorth-West Community Development Council by distributing festive packs to families staying in one-room rental flats and organises festive celebrations for terminally ill patients and beneficiaries at Assisi Hospice and Arc Children's Centre.\n\nNotwithstanding the restrictions and strict adherence to social distancing and safety measures, CDL's employees managed to achieve a participation rate of 46.6% and clocked 682 volunteer hours in 2022.\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\n\nThe world economy could shrink by 18% in the next 30 years if no action is taken to mitigate the impacts of climate change, the Swiss Re Institute warns. 19 This figure can lessen to approximately 11% to 14% and could even be as low as 4% if the 2015 Paris Agreement targets are met. This simply reflects the strong business case of embracing sustainability into businesses.\n\nFor the past two decades, sustainability has been integral to CDL's business strategy and has sharpened its competitive advantage. With the support of multiple stakeholders, CDL will continue to step up its climate action and advance the transition to a low-carbon future.\n\n## Adding Greater Purpose to CDL's Triple Bottom Line\n\nHumanity has less than three years to halt the rise of planet-warming carbon\n\n## Integrating UN SDGs has added purpose for a more balanced triple bottom line for CDL\n\nPlease refer to CDL Integrated Sustainability Report 2023 and www.cdlsustainability.com for the complete set of information.\n\nemissions and less than a decade to slash them almost in half. 20 Global emissions are estimated to go beyond the 1.5\u00b0C warming limit envisioned in the 2015 Paris Agreement and reach 3.2\u00b0C by the end of the century.\n\nReleased at COP27, the 2022 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction found that the sector accounted for over 34% of energy demand and around 37% of energy and process-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2021. 21 According to the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction report, the gap between the sector's climate performance and the 2050 decarbonisation pathway is widening.\n\nCDL will remain steadfast in its longstanding commitment to accelerate change along its value chain and create positive impact through its business. With CDL's Future Value 2030 Sustainability Blueprint guiding the Company's ESG goals and strategies, CDL is confident that its robust and multi-pronged sustainability strategy will help to future-proof its business.\n\nAs CDL celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2023, sustainability continues to be  a  priority,  enhancing  long-term value creation for its business and the environment in the years to come. CDL will remain unwavering in its net zero commitment and strategy, turning risks to opportunities for positive impact and sustained growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 19 World economy set to lose up to 18% GDP from climate change if no action taken, reveals Swiss Re Institute's stress-test analysis | Swiss Re, 22 April 2021.\n- 20 UN climate report: It's \"now or never\" to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, UN News, 4 April 2022.\n- 21 2022 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction, UNEP, 9 November 2022.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\nThe Group reported its highest net profit after tax and non-controlling interest (PATMI) of $1.3 billion for FY 2022 since its inception in 1963 (restated FY 2021: $84.7 million 1 ). The stellar FY 2022 performance was boosted by a bountiful year of divestment gains, including the record sale of Millennium Hilton Seoul and the gain on deconsolidation of CDLHT from the Group following the distribution in specie of CDLHT Units in 1H 2022, as well as the completion of the collective sales of Tanglin Shopping Centre and Golden Mile Complex in 2H 2022.\n\nRevenue  for  FY  2022  increased  by 25.4% to $3.3 billion (FY 2021: $2.6 billion), propelled by a 58.1% increase in revenue from the hotel operations segment. The Group's hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR) grew 91.0% for FY 2022. The RevPAR growth for FY 2022 is attributable to a 48.9% increase in average room rates and a 14.2 percentage points improvement in occupancies across all geographies. Notably, hotels in London, Singapore and New York outperformed in 2022.\n\nThe property development segment continued to be the biggest contributor accounting for 42% of FY 2022 revenue, led by three strong-performing Singapore projects - Amber Park, Haus on Handy and Irwell Hill Residences. This does not include revenue from the substantially sold joint venture (JV) projects such as Boulevard 88 and CanningHill Piers, which are equity accounted for.\n\nThe Group recorded a pre-tax profit of $1.9 billion for FY 2022 (restated FY 2021: $214.8 million 1 ). The extraordinary profits were driven by the distribution in specie of 144,191,823 stapled securities in CDLHT, resulting in the accounting deconsolidation of CDLHT from a subsidiary to an associate in May 2022 and the recognition of a\n\ntotal gain (inclusive of negative goodwill) of $492.4 million, as well as pre-tax divestment gains on the sale of properties amounting to $1.26 billion.\n\n## PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT\n\nRevenue increased by $127.8 million to $1,382.3 million (FY 2021: $1,254.5 million) for FY 2022, while the pre-tax profit decreased by $83.5 million to $161.3 million (FY 2021: $244.8 million) for FY 2022.\n\nProjects that contributed to both revenue and profit in FY 2022 include Amber Park, Irwell Hill Residences and Haus on Handy in Singapore, Hong Leong Tech Park Shenzhen and Hongqiao Royal Lake Shanghai in China, Sydney Street and Teddington Riverside in the UK as well as New Zealand land sales. In accordance with the Group's policy of equity accounting for the results of its joint ventures, whilst revenue from joint venture developments such as Boulevard 88, The Jovell and Sengkang Grand Residences had not been consolidated into the Group's total revenue, the Group's share of profit arising from these joint venture developments had been included in pre-tax profit.\n\nThe increase in revenue for FY 2022 was attributable to higher progressive revenue contribution from Amber Park, Irwell Hill Residences and Haus on Handy, due to a higher percentage of completion achieved and units sold.\n\nPre-tax profit decreased for FY 2022 mainly due to allowance for foreseeable losses made on four development properties in the UK and one development property in China. Included in the pre-tax profit for this segment for FY 2021 was the negative goodwill recognised by the Group for the acquisition of Hong Leong Tech Park Shenzhen. Excluding the allowance\n\nfor foreseeable losses and the aforesaid negative goodwill, pre-tax profits for this segment would have remained relatively constant at $223.1 million (FY 2021: $219.0 million) for FY 2022.\n\n## HOTEL OPERATIONS\n\nRevenue for this segment increased $507.6 million to $1,380.7 million (FY 2021: $873.1 million) for FY 2022. This segment reported a pre-tax gain of $1,383.2 million (FY 2021: pre-tax loss of $71.0 million) for FY 2022.\n\nThe increase in revenue is attributable to the recovery of the hospitality sector, backed by improved occupancy and room rates achieved by the Group's hotel portfolio. The Group's hotel RevPAR grew 91.0% for FY 2022.\n\nThe substantial pre-tax profits recognised for FY 2022 was mainly due to the divestment gains recognised from the disposal of Millennium Hilton Seoul and the deconsolidation of CDLHT in FY 2022. This was partially offset by lower reversal of impairment losses made by the Group of $31.8 million (FY 2021: $96.4 million) on its hotel properties during the year.\n\n## INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\n\nRevenue for this segment remained relatively constant at $341.2 million (FY 2021: $341.1 million) for FY 2022. This segment reported a pre-tax gain of $383.6 million (restated FY 2021: $11.4 million 1 ) for FY 2022.\n\nThe substantial pre-tax profit recognised for FY 2022 was due to profit from the collective sale of Tanglin Shopping Centre and Golden Mile Complex in 2H 2022, partially offset by higher impairment losses made on investment properties of $35.7 million (restated FY 2021: $2.1 million 1 ).\n\n## OTHERS\n\nRevenue, comprising mainly income from building maintenance contracts, project management, club operations, laundry services and dividend income, increased by $32.2 million to $189.3 million (FY 2021: $157.1 million) for FY 2022. The increase for FY 2022 was due to higher project management fees earned. This segment reported a pre-tax loss of $71.3 million (FY 2021: pretax gain of $29.7 million) for FY 2022.\n\nDespite the increase in revenue, the Group recognised pre-tax loss for FY 2022, mainly due to the impairment loss made on the loans granted to Sincere Property Group of $62.7 million and the USD denominated bonds issued by Sincere Property Group which the Group had subscribed to of $18.0 million, totalling $80.7 million. With this final impairment, the Group has no further exposure to Sincere Property Group.\n\n## Revenue by Business Segment\n\n($ million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Profit Before Tax by Business Segment* 1\n\n($ million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Includes share of after-tax profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures.\n\n## Revenue by Business Segment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Profit Before Tax by Business Segment*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEBITDA by Business Segment\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its asset rejuvenation and portfolio enhancement initiatives achieved improved occupancies and positive rental reversions. Fund management aspirations and capital recycling initiatives remain integral to the Group's transformation strategy. In addition to growing its Assets Under Management (AUM), the Group continued to streamline its portfolio through several opportunistic asset divestments to unlock latent value while also building scale in new growth areas, like its Living Sector portfolio.\n\n## PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Singapore\n\nThe property market remained resilient, with private home prices increasing by 8.6% in 2022 compared to the 10.6% increase in 2021. Developers sold 7,099 units excluding Executive Condominiums (ECs) in 2022, reflecting a 46% dip in transaction volume due to fewer new launches, low inventory and buyers' concerns over rising interest rates.\n\nFor FY 2022, the Group and its joint venture (JV) associates sold 1,487 units including ECs, with a total sales value of $2.9 billion (FY 2021: 2,185 units with a total sales value of $4.3 billion). The sales were largely attributed to the successful launch of two projects during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn May, the Group launched the 407unit Piccadilly Grand, a JV integrated project on Northumberland Road, linked to Farrer Park MRT station. To date, 350 units (86%) have been sold 2 . In October, the Group launched Copen Grand EC at Tengah New Town. The 639-unit JV project sold 73% of its units on launch day and was fully sold out a month after its launch. Sales of the Group's earlier launched projects also progressed well and are substantially sold.\n\nWith strong sales achieved and low inventory, the Group acquired four sites in 2022 as part of its landbank replenishment strategy. Three sites were secured in 1H 2022. In January, the Group secured a prime 210,623 sq ft Government Land Sales (GLS) site at Jalan Tembusu for $768 million (or $1,302 psf ppr). Located near the upcoming Tanjong Katong MRT station, the site will be developed into a luxury condominium with 638 units.\n\n## Healthy Sales for Existing Inventory of Projects\n\n| Project                | Location          | Launched      |   Total Units | Units Sold 2   |\n|------------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Irwell Hill Residences | Irwell Bank Road  | April 2021    |           540 | 514 (95%)      |\n| CanningHill Piers 1    | Clarke Quay       | November 2021 |           696 | 676 (97%)      |\n| Boulevard 88 1         | Orchard Boulevard | March 2019    |           154 | 135 (88%)      |\n| Amber Park 1           | Amber Road        | May 2019      |           592 | 586 (99%)      |\n| Nouvel 18 3            | Anderson Road     | July 2019     |           156 | 154 (99%)      |\n| Haus on Handy          | Handy Road        | July 2019     |           188 | 178 (95%)      |\n\n- 1 JV project\n- 2 As at 28 February 2023\n- 3 Divested project marketed by CDL\n\nIn March, the $315 million Central Square acquisition was completed. Subject to authorities' approval, the property will be redeveloped alongside the Group's Central Mall properties into an enlarged mixed-use development comprising office, retail, hospitality and residential. In April, the Group completed the offmarket acquisition of a 179,007 sq ft site at 798 and 800 Upper Bukit Timah Road for $126.3 million. The Group intends to redevelop the site into a residential project with 408 units.\n\nThe Group also successfully acquired a GLS EC site at Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 in September. It won the 178,936 sq ft site at $336.1 million or $626 psf ppr, beating the next highest bidder by a mere 0.2% or $1 psf ppr. The site is located at the junction of Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 and Bukit Batok Road, opposite the upcoming Tengah New Town and with three MRT stations in the vicinity. A 510-unit EC project is being planned and will incorporate Super Low Energy (SLE) features.\n\nThe Group obtained Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) for its fully sold 718-unit Whistler Grand (including two retail units) in April. All units have been handed over to purchasers.\n\nGiven the fast-rising interest rates, the Government introduced another round of cooling measures in September 2022 to ensure prudent borrowing. The base interest rate for the computation of loans was adjusted from 3.5% to 4.0%. Other measures were more targeted at the HDB market - Loan-to-Value (LTV) was reduced to 80% from 85%, and a 15-month wait for private property owners wishing to purchase a HDB resale flat was implemented. With a limited supply of new residential units onstream and a recovering economy, the market is expected to remain stable with sustained interest from local and foreign buyers.\n\n## INTERNATIONAL\n\n## Australia\n\nIn Melbourne, the Group's 60-unit Fitzroy Fitzroy is 40% presold, and The Marker, where 82% of its 198 units have been sold to date 2 , achieved practical completion in September 2022. In Brisbane, the 215unit Brickworks Park has sold 47% of the total units to date 2 and has commenced its early construction. The 97-unit Treetops at Kenmore JV project has sold 46% of the total units to date 2 and the construction of Stage 1 started in Q4 2022.\n\n## UK\n\nThe Group's prime developments in Belgravia,  Chelsea  and  Teddington continue to receive enquiries from both local and international buyers. The former Stag Brewery site in Mortlake and three other development projects in London by the Group continue to be in various stages of planning.\n\n## China\n\nIn FY 2022, the Group's wholly-owned subsidiary, CDL China Limited, and its JV associates sold 88 residential, office and retail units, with a total sales value of RMB 349 million ($67.4 million).\n\nIn Suzhou, Hong Leong City Center (HLCC), a mixed-use development in Suzhou Industrial Park, has sold 1,670 (92%) of its 1,813 residential and retail units to date 2 .\n\nIn Shanghai, Hongqiao Royal Lake, a luxury development in the prime residential enclave of Qingpu District, has sold 74 (87%) out of the 85 villas to date 2 .\n\nIn Shenzhen, Hong Leong Technology Park Shenzhen (previously named Shenzhen Longgang Tusincere Tech Park) has sold 389 units comprising apartments, office and retail units with a sales value of RMB 1.05 billion ($202.8 million) 2 ever since the Group acquired this project in March 2021.\n\n## INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\n\n## Singapore\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group's office portfolio 4 reported a committed occupancy of 95.2%, above the island-wide occupancy of 88.7% 5 . Republic Plaza, the Group's flagship Grade A office building, is 97.6% occupied with a full-year positive rental reversion of 8.4%. King's Centre, where Asset Enhancement Initiative (AEI) works were completed in 1H 2022, has achieved 98.4% occupancy, with a full-year rental reversion of 8.9%.\n\nThe Group's retail portfolio 4 also remained healthy, with a committed occupancy of  96.1%,  higher  than  the  islandwide occupancy of 92.9% 5 . The strong performance was driven by City Square Mall, which is 93.5% occupied, and Palais Renaissance, which completed an AEI in 1H 2022, achieving 98.2% occupancy. The gain in traction from the removal of COVID-19 restrictions, coupled with the reopening of global economies in 2022, led to the recovery of the retail sector, injecting much vibrancy into the market once again.\n\nThe Group's retail portfolio's average monthly footfall in 2022 rose 21.7% yearon-year (y-o-y) and has recovered to over 73% of pre-COVID levels. In tandem with this, the average monthly tenants' sales increased by 20.1% y-o-y, exceeding pre-COVID levels. While the retail market is bustling again with increased shopper traffic, retailers remain cautious with looming economic uncertainties and rising operating costs.\n\nThe redevelopment of Central Mall and Central Square is at an advanced planning stage and they will be redeveloped under the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Strategic Development Incentive Scheme. Provisional Permission has been obtained for a mixed-use development comprising commercial, hospitality and residential components yielding a GFA uplift of 67% to approximately 735,500 sq ft\n\n- 4 Includes South Beach (in accordance with CDL's proportionate ownership). Excludes Central Mall Office Tower, Central Mall Conservation Unit and 11 Tampines Concourse.\n- 5 Based on Urban Redevelopment Authority's real estate statistics for Q4 2022.",

        "page_content": "## OPERATIONS AND MARKET REVIEW\n\nfrom the current GFA of 441,650 sq ft. Subject to authorities' approval, the Group plans to develop a Grade A office building, a residential project with over 300 apartments, commercial units at the first two storeys, and a hospitality-related component on the site. The redevelopment will rejuvenate and shape the precinct's transformation into a vibrant lifestyle hub.\n\n## INTERNATIONAL\n\nIn China, Hong Leong Plaza Hongqiao, a five-tower office development in Shanghai, is 76% leased. Suzhou HLCC's Grade A office tower is now 94% occupied while HLCC mall is 82% occupied.\n\nFollowing the easing of China's prolonged zero-COVID policy, infection rates have increased significantly. It is anticipated that Q1 2023 will remain challenging for businesses before consumer confidence rebounds.\n\nIn the UK, demand for best-in-class buildings remains healthy, which bodes well for the Group's Grade A buildings in\n\nCentral London. 125 Old Broad Street and  Aldgate  House  have  achieved committed occupancy of 93.9% and 98.1% respectively.\n\nIn Thailand, the Phase 1 revamp of Jungceylon Shopping Center in Patong, Phuket, was unveiled on 16 December 2022 to welcome the return of both domestic and international tourists with a range of exciting new lifestyle attractions. The remaining phases are targeted to complete by the end of 2023.\n\n## THE LIVING SECTOR\n\n## UK\n\nThe UK Private Rented Sector (PRS) has proven to be a defensive asset class across the pandemic. Despite short-term challenges such as rising construction costs, higher interest rates and an inflationary environment, structural undersupply and mortgage affordability issues  are  expected  to  drive  rents upwards. Strong rental demand is evident from healthy leasing rates and occupancy across newly-launched schemes. Rising\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwages, especially among those in the 25 to 34 age group, also support rental growth.\n\nIn Q4 2022, the Group's first PRS project in the UK - The Junction, located in Leeds, obtained sectional completion for three out of five blocks (307 out of 665 units) and the Group recently welcomed its first batch of residents. Construction of The Octagon, the Group's 370-unit PRS project located in the heart of Birmingham, is in progress with an estimated completion in 2025. Rents for new PRS projects launched in Leeds and Birmingham performed exceedingly well in 2022 and the Group expects its own PRS projects to similarly outperform.\n\nThe Group made its initial foray into the  UK's  Purpose-Built  Student Accommodation (PBSA) sector in June 2022 with the acquisition of Infinity, a 505-bed PBSA asset in Coventry. In December 2022, the Group enlarged its portfolio by acquiring five additional PBSA assets for \u00a3215 million (approximately $350 million) in Birmingham, Canterbury, Coventry, Leeds and Southampton. These six assets, comprising about 2,400 beds, enjoy committed occupancy of about 98%.\n\n## Japan\n\nIn  2022,  the  Group  acquired  three newly-built PRS assets for \u00a56.61 billion (approximately $66.9 million) - two properties in Yokohama (City Lux Tobe and LOC's Yokohama Bayside) and one in Osaka (Gioia Namba) - totalling 271 units. The Group now owns eight operational PRS assets in Japan, comprising 513 units. The easing of border restrictions and the return of foreign nationals to Japan in 2H 2022 have significantly contributed to the recovery in the residential sector. The Group continues to enjoy stable rental income for its PRS portfolio and strong occupancies of above 95%.\n\n## Australia\n\nTo leverage the rising demand for rental accommodation in Australia, the Group\n\nacquired two PRS development sites in Brisbane's Toowong riverside suburb and Melbourne's Southbank, totalling around 490 apartments. Construction of both projects is targeted to commence in 2H 2023.\n\n## HOSPITALITY\n\nWith the continued recovery and restored confidence in global travel following the relaxation of travel restrictions and borders reopening, the Group's hotels achieved a strong performance in FY 2022, registering a y-o-y revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth of 91% to $137.9 (FY 2021: $72.2). The RevPAR growth for FY 2022 is attributable to a 48.9% increase in average room rates and a 14.2 percentage points improvement in average occupancy rates across all geographies. Notably, hotels in London, Singapore and New York outperformed in 2022.\n\nThe total revenue of the Group's hotels in Asia, the UK and the US have mostly surpassed  their  FY  2019  respective performance  from  September  2022 onwards, despite the soft market conditions in Taipei, Beijing and New Zealand. Average GOP margin increased by 11.3 percentage points y-o-y and has normalised to FY 2019 levels registering a slight growth of 3 percentage points, primarily led by the UK, US and Singapore markets.\n\nWith a focus on revenue generation and asset yield optimisation, the Group continues to enhance its hospitality offerings and revitalise its assets through AEIs and repositionings.\n\nIn Singapore, the Group completed the renovation of all 360 guestrooms at Studio M Hotel in May 2022. Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel commenced its phased refurbishment in Q4 2022, for its 550 guestrooms and public areas. In the same quarter, in tandem with the ongoing AEI of the Group's Jungceylon Shopping Center, Millennium Resort Patong Phuket started renovating its 418 guestrooms and common areas. The hotel will be rebranded as M Social Hotel Phuket - the first in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThailand. Completion works for both assets are expected by 2H 2023.\n\nOver in New Zealand, Copthorne Hotel Greymouth was rebranded on 1 March 2022 (previously named Kingsgate Hotel Greymouth). Millennium Buffalo Hotel in the US ceased operations in October 2022 due to a non-renewal of the lease.\n\nIn 2H 2023, the Group is planning to unveil its newest hotel in Singapore, the iconic eight-storey 204-room The Singapore EDITION, located on Cuscaden Road. It is EDITION's first hotel in Southeast Asia, a unique concept in the lifestyle hotel space conceived by Ian Schrager and Marriott International. In China, the 295-room five-star M Social Suzhou is scheduled to open in Q2 2023.\n\nGoing forward, the Group has other AEIs in the pipeline for 2H 2023 / 2024. They include a major renovation for Millennium Downtown New York, which will be rebranded to M Social Hotel Downtown, New York. and the Millennium Knightsbridge London, which will be rebranded to M Social Hotel Knightsbridge, London.\n\nWith its hotel operations having recovered in most markets to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, the Group can now accelerate its plans for asset optimisation, alignment to the Group's sustainability goals and driving growth. The Group expects its hotel operations to strengthen further, riding on the reopening of China, postpandemic 'revenge travel' and the return of corporate travel.",

Besides nurturing existing listed platforms like CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT) and IREIT Global, the Group continues to lay the foundation for future AUM growth.\n\nIn June 2022, the Group partnered HThree City Australia Pte. Ltd. (HThree) to acquire 330 Collins Street, a freehold Grade A commercial tower in Melbourne, for A$236 million (approximately $214.7 million). Located in the heart of Melbourne's CBD, the 18-storey office tower has a net lettable area of over 18,000 sqm, which includes retail space on the ground floor. It has a committed occupancy of 90%. The joint acquisition marked the Group's expansion into the Australian office sector. The asset will be managed by HThree, which owns another office asset on Collins Street.\n\nWhile the Group has paused its IPO aspirations  for  its  UK  commercial properties, it continues to explore strategic acquisitions that will complement its fund management objectives.\n\n## GROUP DIVESTMENTS\n\nDuring the year under review, the Group completed  several  major  property divestments, which enabled it to realise significant capital gains as the Group had held these assets at book value over a long period of time.\n\nThey include the sale of the Millennium Hilton Seoul and its adjoining land site in February, as well as the collective sales of Tanglin Shopping Centre and Golden Mile Complex in November, where the Group owns Share Value and Strata areas. Additionally, the Group also recognised substantive gains from the deconsolidation of CDLHT from a subsidiary to an associate, following the distribution in specie exercise of stapled securities in CDLHT completed in May 2022.\n\n## GETTING RE-ENERGISED\n\nThe outlook for 2023 remains uncertain, given near-term economic headwinds and ongoing challenges, including geopolitical tensions, inflation and interest rate hikes.\n\nWhile  Singapore  will  always  be  its home ground and core market where it maintains a sizeable presence, the Group will continue to pursue its diversification strategy to build its global portfolio in its key overseas markets of China, UK, Japan and Australia. The Group will selectively and prudently examine opportunities to strategically expand its footprint as well as build scale in the Living Sector. This will enable the Group to diversify its geographical and asset class risks while strengthening its sustainable income streams.\n\nLooking ahead, the Group will remain steadfast in the execution of its GET strategy to expand, unlock value and transform its business - and emerge re-energised for the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROPERTY PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS\n\nCDL GROUP'S ATTRIBUTABLE SHARE AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal Lettable/Strata Area\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7.2\n\nMILLION SQ FT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n91",

In accordance with the M&C Group's accounting policy on share-based payment transactions, the fair value of share options and long-term incentive awards is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.  The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the share options and long-term incentive awards.  There was no charge to the statement of profit or loss for the current year.\n\nThe M&C Group has applied IFRS 2 to its active employee share-based payment arrangements from 1 January 2005 except for arrangements granted before 7 November 2002.\n\nThere were no options granted by M&C during 2022 in line with the recommended final cash offer (Final Offer) made by the Company in 2019 and any outstanding options are to close out per the final vesting dates.\n\n## (i) Annual Bonus Plan\n\nUnder the Annual Bonus Plan, deferred share awards were granted annually to selected employees of the M&C Group.

        "page_content": "## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\n\nMEMBERS OF THE COMPANY CITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\n## REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the accompanying financial statements of City Developments Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2022, the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies as set out on pages 114 to 272.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the Act), Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)s) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2022 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group for the year ended on that date.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs).  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ' Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements ' section of our report.  We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period.  These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Valuation of hotel assets\n\n(Refer to note 4 to the financial statements)\n\n## Risk\n\nThe Group has significant hotel assets classified as property, plant and equipment which are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and are subject to an annual assessment for impairment indicators.  In undertaking the impairment assessment, the Group takes into consideration several factors, including the economic outlook, the quantum of available headroom from previous valuations undertaken (where applicable) and the trading performance of the properties.  The properties with indicators of impairment are then subjected to a detailed impairment review whereby their recoverable amounts are estimated.\n\nThe Group uses a combination of internal and external valuations to estimate the recoverable amount of its properties identified as at risk of being impaired, which is determined to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use of these properties.  The valuations are sensitive to key assumptions applied and a change in the assumptions may have an impact on the recoverable amounts.\n\n## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\n\nMEMBERS OF THE COMPANY CITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures included challenging the Group's assessment of the properties at risk of being impaired.  These include comparing the actual asset performance to previous forecasts and to market data, and assessing the quantum of available headroom from previous valuations.  For a sample of properties selected for a detailed impairment review, we considered the valuation methods used against those applied by valuers for similar property types.  We evaluated the key assumptions applied in the valuations, particularly those assumptions relating to occupancy rates, average room rate growth, discount rates and terminal rates, by comparing them to available industry data, taking into consideration comparability and market factors.\n\n## Our findings\n\nThe Group has a structured process in identifying hotel assets with impairment indicators.  We found that the valuation methods used were in line with generally accepted market practices and the key assumptions applied were generally comparable to currently observable market data.\n\n## Valuation of development properties\n\n(Refer to note 13 to the financial statements)\n\n## Risk\n\nThe Group has significant residential development properties held for sale in Singapore, China and the United Kingdom (UK). Development properties held for sale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable values.  The determination of the estimated net realisable value is highly dependent on the Group's expectations of future selling prices of unsold development properties.\n\nIn estimating the future selling prices of unsold development properties, the Group has taken into account real estate price trend information, local market conditions, its development plans and sale strategies for the properties and selling prices estimated by external valuers when necessary.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe focused our work on development properties with low margins.\n\nIn assessing the reasonableness of the Group's estimated future selling prices for its development projects, we considered recently transacted prices of units under development sold and/or prices of comparable properties located in the vicinity of the development projects, taking into account the prevailing market trends and the Group's development and selling plans for the properties.  Where applicable, we made enquiries of the external valuers to understand the approach adopted in estimating the future selling prices of the development properties.\n\n## Our findings\n\nWe found the Group's estimated future selling prices, which are used in determining the net realisable values and the resultant allowance for foreseeable losses on its development projects, to be comparable to currently available market data and have taken into consideration prevailing market conditions.",

Other information is defined as all information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon.\n\nWe have obtained all other information prior to the date of this auditors' report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nResponsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act, SFRS(I)s and IFRSs, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\nAuditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.  We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\n\nMEMBERS OF THE COMPANY CITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulations precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nIn our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report is Lo Mun Wai.\n\n## KPMG LLP\n\nPublic Accountants and Chartered Accountants\n\nSingapore 24 March 2023",

Ltd., a company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore.\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\n## 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)s) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs).  SFRS(I)s, issued by the Accounting Standards Council (ASC), comprises standards and interpretations that are equivalents to IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  All references to SFRS(I)s and IFRSs are subsequently referred to as SFRS(I) in the financial statements.\n\n## 2.2 Basis of measurement\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as otherwise described in the notes below.\n\n## 2.3 Functional and presentation currency\n\nThe financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the Company's functional currency.  All financial information has been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 2.4 Use of estimates and judgements\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  SFRS(I)  requires  management  to  make  judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.",

This includes a team that regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments and reports to the Group Chief Financial Officer who has overall responsibility for all significant fair value measurements.  If third party information, such as broker quotes or independent valuers' report, is used to measure fair values, then the team assesses and documents the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of SFRS(I), including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified.\n\nSignificant valuation issues are reported to the Group's Audit & Risk Committee and Board of Directors.\n\nWhen measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible.  Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:\n\n- \u2022 Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u2022 Level 2:\n\ninputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n\n- \u2022 Level 3:\n\ninputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 2.4 Use of estimates and judgements (cont'd)\n\nIf the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement (with Level 3 being the lowest).\n\nThe Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.\n\nFurther information about assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes:\n\nNote 5\n\nInvestment properties\n\nNote 26\n\nShare-based payment arrangements\n\nNote 40\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries\n\nNote 42\n\nFinancial instruments\n\n## 2.5 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## New standards and amendments\n\nThe Group has applied various new SFRS(I)s, amendments to and interpretations of SFRS(I) for the first time for the annual period beginning on 1 January 2022. In addition, the Group has early adopted the Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 Non-current Liabilities with Covenants . Under the amendments, only covenants with which an entity must comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. Covenants with which the entity must comply after the reporting date (future covenants) do not affect a liability's classification at that date. When non-current liabilities are subject to future covenants, information on the risk that the non-current liabilities could become repayable within 12 months after the reporting date is to be disclosed.\n\nThe application of these amendments to standards and interpretations did not have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities, except as explained in note 2.5, which addresses changes in accounting policies.\n\n## 3.1 Basis of consolidation\n\n## (i) Business combinations\n\nThe Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Group.  In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.\n\nThe Group has an option to apply a 'concentration test' that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business.  The optional concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.",

Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.\n\nWhen the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.\n\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.  If the contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.  Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nWhen share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are exchanged for awards held by the acquiree's employees (acquiree's awards) and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer's replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination.  This determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards compared with the market-based value of the acquiree's awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and/or future service.\n\nFor non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets in the event of liquidation, the Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure them at fair value, or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date.  All other non-controlling interests are measured at acquisition-date fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in another standard.\n\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity investments, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\n\nChanges in the Group's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no adjustments are made to goodwill and no gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.  The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.  Any difference between the adjustment to non-controlling interests and the fair value of consideration paid is recognised directly in equity and presented as part of equity attributable to owners of the Company.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.1 Basis of consolidation (cont'd)\n\n## (i) Business combinations (cont'd)\n\n## Acquisitions before 1 January 2017\n\nAs part of transition to SFRS(I), the Group elected not to restate those business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to SFRS(I), i.e. 1 January 2017.  Goodwill arising from acquisitions before 1 January 2017 has been carried forward from the previous FRS framework as at the date of transition.\n\n## (ii) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nThe accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.  Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the noncontrolling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.\n\n## (iii) Loss of control\n\nWhen the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity.  Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.  Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.\n\n## (iv) Investments in associates and joint ventures (equity-accounted investees)\n\nAssociates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over their financial and operating policies.  Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 20% or more of the voting power of another entity.  A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.  They are recognised initially at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income (OCI) of equity-accounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses exceeds its investment in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest, together with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part thereof, is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.",

The Group accounts for each of its assets, liabilities and transactions, including its share of those held or incurred jointly, in relation to the joint operation.\n\nThe Group is a 51% (2021: 51%) partner in Hong Realty (Private) Limited - Pasir Ris Joint Venture (the Pasir Ris Joint Venture), a joint arrangement formed with two fellow subsidiaries, whose principal activity is that of a property developer and the place of business is in Singapore.  The Group is also a 20% (2021: 20%) partner in Park Court Aoyama The Tower, a joint arrangement formed with a third party, whose principal activity is that of a property developer and the place of business is in Japan.  The Group has classified both joint arrangements as joint operations as the joint venture partners control the joint arrangements collectively and the joint arrangements are not structured through separate legal vehicles.\n\n## (vi) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nIntra-group  balances  and  transactions,  and  any  unrealised  income  or  expenses  arising  from  intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.  Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investee are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee.  Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\n## (vii) Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures in the separate financial statements\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are stated in the Company's statement of financial position at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## 3.2 Foreign currencies\n\n## (i) Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currencies at the exchange rates at that date.  The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the year.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.2 Foreign currencies (cont'd)\n\n## (i) Foreign currency transactions (cont'd)\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currencies at the exchange rates at the dates that the fair values were determined. Non-monetary items in foreign currencies that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transactions.  Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss.  However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in OCI:\n\n- \u00b7 differences arising on the translation of monetary items that in substance form part of the Group's net investment in a foreign operation;\n- \u00b7 an investment in equity securities designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI);\n- \u00b7 a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent that the hedge is effective; or\n- \u00b7 qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective.\n\n## (ii) Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.  The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.\n\nForeign currency differences are recognised in OCI.  However, if the foreign operation is a non wholly-owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests.  When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.  When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests.  When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhen the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item that are considered to form part of the Group's net investment in the foreign operation are recognised in OCI, and are presented within equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.",

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## As a lessee\n\nAt commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices.  However, for the leases of property, the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\nThe Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option.  In that case, the right-ofuse asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment.  In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.  Generally, the Group uses the lessee's incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nThe Group determines the lessee's incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; and\n- \u00b7 the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.\n\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the rightof-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.5 Leases (cont'd)\n\n## As a lessee (cont'd)\n\nWhere the basis for determining future lease payments changes as required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group remeasures the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using the revised discount rate that reflects the change to an alternative benchmark interest rate.\n\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in 'property, plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in the statement of financial position.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and shortterm leases.  The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## COVID-19-related rent concessions\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient allowing it not to assess whether eligible rent concessions that are a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic are lease modifications.  The Group applies the practical expedient consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances.  For rent concessions in leases to which the Group chooses not to apply the practical expedient, or that do not qualify for the practical expedient, the Group assesses whether there is a lease modification.\n\n## As a lessor\n\nAt inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\n\nWhen the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.\n\nTo classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset.  If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease.  As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.\n\nWhen the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately.  It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset.  If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.\n\nIf an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then the Group applies SFRS(I) 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.\n\nThe Group applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments to the net investment in the lease (see note 3.11(i)).  The Group further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease.\n\nThe Group recognises lease payments received from investment property under operating leases as income on a straightline basis over the lease term as part of 'revenue'.",

A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n\n## (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets\n\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; FVOCI - debt investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or FVTPL.\n\nFinancial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nA financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Debt investments at FVOCI\n\nA debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Equity investments at FVOCI\n\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI.

On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI or at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\n## Financial assets: Business model assessment\n\nThe Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management.  The information considered includes:\n\n- \u00b7 the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice.  These include whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;\n- \u00b7 how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;\n- \u00b7 the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed;\n- \u00b7 how managers of the business are compensated e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and\n- \u00b7 the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.\n\nTransfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group's continuing recognition of the assets.\n\nFinancial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets: Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest\n\nFor the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition.  'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.",

This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.  In making this assessment, the Group considers:\n\n- \u00b7 contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;\n- \u00b7 terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;\n- \u00b7 prepayment and extension features; and\n- \u00b7 terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).\n\nA prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract.  Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses\n\n## Financial assets at FVTPL\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value.  Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses.  Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.  Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Debt investments at FVOCI\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.  Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI.  On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n- 3.6 Financial instruments (cont'd)\n- (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement (cont'd)\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses (cont'd)\n\n## Equity investments at FVOCI\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value.  Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.  Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Non-derivative financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.  A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held for trading or it is designated as such on initial recognition.  Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss.  Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nOther financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.  They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (iii) Derecognition\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.\n\nTransferred assets are not derecognised when the Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred assets.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or when they expire.  The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.\n\n- On  derecognition  of  a  financial  liability,  the  difference  between  the  carrying  amount  extinguished  and  the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.",

No immediate gain or loss is recognised.  A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:\n\n- -the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and\n- -the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis - i.e. the basis immediately before the change.\n\nWhen changes were made to a financial asset or financial liability in addition to changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group first updates the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by interest rate benchmark reform.  After that, the Group applies the policies on accounting for modifications to the additional changes.\n\n## (iv) Offsetting\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (v) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and bank deposits.  For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, restricted cash is excluded whilst bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## (vi) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met.\n\nDerivatives are initially measured at fair value and any directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.  Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships.  At inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.  The Group also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.6 Financial instruments (cont'd)\n\n## (vi) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (cont'd)\n\n## Hedges directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform\n\nPhase 1 amendments: Prior to interest rate benchmark reform - when there is uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform\n\nFor the purpose of evaluating whether there is an economic relationship between the hedged item(s) and the hedging instrument(s), the Group assumes that the benchmark interest rate is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nFor a cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction, the Group assumes that the benchmark interest rate will not be altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform for the purpose of assessing whether the forecast transaction is highly probable and presents an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss.  In determining whether a previously designated forecast transaction in a discontinued cash flow hedge is still expected to occur, the Group assumes that the interest rate benchmark cash flows designated as a hedge will not be altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nThe Group will cease to apply the specific policy for assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument (i) to a hedged item or hedging instrument when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the contractual cash flows of the respective item or instrument or (ii) when the hedging relationship is discontinued.  For its highly probable assessment of the hedged item, the Group will no longer apply the specific policy when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform about the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmarkbased future cash flows of the hedged item is no longer present, or when the hedging relationship is discontinued.\n\nPhase 2 amendments: Replacement of benchmark interest rates - when there is no longer uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform\n\nWhen the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument changes as a result of interest rate benchmark reform and therefore there is no longer uncertainty arising about the cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument, the Group amends the hedge documentation of that hedging relationship to reflect the change(s) required by interest rate benchmark reform.  A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and\n- \u00b7 the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis - i.e. the basis immediately before the change.\n\nFor this purpose, the hedge designation is amended only to make one or more of the following changes:\n\n- \u00b7 designating an alternative benchmark rate as the hedged risk;\n- \u00b7 updating the description of hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged; or\n- \u00b7 updating the description of the hedging instrument.",

These amendments in the formal hedge documentation do not constitute the discontinuation of the hedging relationship or the designation of a new hedging relationship.\n\nIf changes are made in addition to those changes required by interest rate benchmark reform described above, then the Group first considers whether those additional changes result in the discontinuation of the hedge accounting relationship.  If the additional changes do not result in discontinuation of the hedge accounting relationship, then the Group amends the formal hedge documentation for changes required by interest rate benchmark reform as mentioned above.\n\nWhen the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged future cash flows had been based is changed as required by interest rate benchmark reform, for the purpose of determining whether the hedged future cash flows are expected to occur, the Group deems that the hedging reserve recognised in OCI for that hedging relationship is based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged future cash flows will be based.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.\n\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve.  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge.  Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe amount accumulated in the hedging reserve is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n- 3.6 Financial instruments (cont'd)\n- (vi) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (cont'd)\n- Hedges directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform (cont'd)\n\n## Cash flow hedges (cont'd)\n\nIf the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.  When hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in the hedging reserve remains in equity until it is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.\n\nIf the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in the hedging reserve are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives and non-derivative financial liabilities as hedges of foreign exchange risk on a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nWhen a derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial liability is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of, for a derivative, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument or, for a non-derivative, foreign exchange gains and losses is recognised in OCI and presented in the translation reserve within equity.  Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign exchange gains and losses on the non-derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss.  The amount recognised in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment on disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, respectively.\n\n## (vii) Share capital\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity.  Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.\n\n## Preference shares\n\nThe Group's non-redeemable convertible non-cumulative preference shares are classified as equity, because they bear discretionary dividends, do not contain any obligations to deliver cash or other financial assets and do not require settlement in a variable number of the Group's equity instruments.  Dividends thereon are recognised as distributions within equity.",

Cost includes acquisition costs, development expenditure, capitalised borrowing costs (applicable to construction of a development for which revenue is to be recognised at a point in time) and other costs directly attributable to the development activities.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.  The write-down to net realisable value is presented as allowance for foreseeable losses.\n\n## 3.8 Contract costs\n\nIncremental costs of obtaining a contract for the sale of a development property are capitalised as contract costs only if (a) these costs relate directly to a contract or an anticipated contract which the Group can specifically identify; (b) these costs generate or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future; and (c) these costs are expected to be recovered.  Otherwise, such costs are recognised as an expense immediately.\n\nCapitalised contract costs are subsequently amortised on a systematic basis as the Group recognises the related revenue on the contract.  An impairment loss is recognised in the profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of capitalised contract costs exceeds the expected remaining consideration less any directly related costs not yet recognised as expenses.\n\n## 3.9 Contract assets and liabilities\n\nContract assets primarily relate to the Group's rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date on construction of development properties.  Contract assets are transferred to trade receivables when the rights become unconditional.  This usually occurs when the Group invoices the customer.\n\nContract liabilities primarily relate to:\n\n- \u00b7 advance consideration received from customers; and\n- \u00b7 progress billings issued in excess of the Group's rights to the consideration.\n\n## 3.10  Consumable stocks\n\nConsumable stocks comprise principally food and beverage and other hotel related consumable supplies.  Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  Cost is determined based on the weighted average cost method and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the stocks, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.  Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and cost necessary to make the sale.\n\n## 3.11  Impairment\n\n## (i) Non-derivative financial assets and contract assets\n\nThe Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets measured at amortised cost;\n- \u00b7 debt investments measured at FVOCI;\n- \u00b7 contract assets (as defined in SFRS(I) 15); and\n- \u00b7 lease receivables.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.11  Impairment (cont'd)\n\n## (i) Non-derivative financial assets and contract assets (cont'd)\n\nLoss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 12-month ECL: these are ECL that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or for a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months); or\n- \u00b7 Lifetime ECL: these are ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument or contract asset.\n\n## Simplified approach\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach to provide for ECL for all trade receivables (including lease receivables) and contract assets.  The simplified approach requires the loss allowance to be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\n## General approach\n\nThe Group applies the general approach to provide for ECL on all other financial instruments.  Under the general approach, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL at initial recognition.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.  When credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.  This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based  on  the  Group's  historical  experience  and  informed  credit  assessment  and  includes  forward-looking information.\n\nIf  credit  risk  has  not  increased  significantly  since  initial  recognition  or  if  the  credit  quality  of  the  financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.\n\nThe maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\n\n## Measurement of ECLs\n\nECLs are probability-weighted estimates of credit losses.  Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive).  ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.",

A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\n\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n- \u00b7 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract such as a default;\n- \u00b7 the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or\n- \u00b7 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\n\n## Presentation of ECL in the statement of financial position\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost and contract assets are deducted from the gross carrying amount of these assets.\n\n## Write-off\n\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery.  This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off.  However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n\n## (ii) Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of an associate or joint venture is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount in accordance with the requirements for non-financial assets.  An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.  An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount and only to the extent that the recoverable amount increases.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.11  Impairment (cont'd)\n\n## (iii) Non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than development properties, contract costs, contract assets, consumable stocks and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  If any such indication exists, then the assets' recoverable amounts are estimated.  For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date, and as and when indicators of impairment are identified.  An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.  For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.  For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.  Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n\nThe Group's corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is allocated.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.  Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.\n\nAn  impairment  loss  in  respect  of  goodwill  is  not  reversed.    In  respect  of  other  assets,  impairment  losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.  An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nGoodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate or a joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately.  Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate or a joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate or a joint venture may be impaired.",

Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are remeasured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Thereafter, the assets, or disposal group, classified as held for sale are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.\n\nAny impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to financial assets and deferred tax assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.  Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the profit or loss.  Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and investment property once classified as held for sale are not depreciated.  In addition, equity accounting of associates and joint ventures ceases once classified as held for sale or distribution.\n\n## 3.13  Employee benefits\n\n## (i) Defined contribution plans\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.  Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n\n## (ii) Defined benefit plans\n\nA defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.  The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.  That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.  The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised immediately as an expense in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group recognises remeasurement gains or losses within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.\n\nThe Group determines the net interest expense/(income) on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability/(asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability/ (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.  Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.13  Employee benefits (cont'd)\n\n## (iii) Other long-term service benefits\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than defined contribution and defined benefit plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in current and prior periods.  That benefit is discounted to determine its present value.  The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.  Remeasurements are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\n\nA provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## (iv) Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.  A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## (v) Share-based payment transactions\n\nThe grant date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards.  The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.  For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.\n\nShare-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its equity instruments of the Group entities are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group.\n\nWhere the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met.  An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employees as measured at the date of modification.\n\nWhere an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.  This includes any award where nonvesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met.  However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.  All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.",

Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.  The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.\n\n## Levies\n\nA provision for levies is recognised when the condition that triggers the payment of the levy as specified in the relevant legislation is met.  If a levy obligation is subject to a minimum activity threshold so that the obligating event is reaching a minimum activity, then a provision is recognised when that minimum activity threshold is reached.\n\n## 3.15  Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial guarantees are financial instruments issued by the Group that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for the loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to meet payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.\n\nFinancial guarantees contracts are accounted for as insurance contracts.  A provision is recognised based on the Group's estimate of the ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the reporting date.  The provision is assessed by reviewing individual claims and tested for adequacy by comparing the amount recognised and the amount that would be required to settle the guarantee contract.\n\n## 3.16  Revenue recognition\n\n## (i) Development properties for sale\n\nThe Group develops and sells residential and mixed development projects to customers through fixed-price contracts.  Revenue is recognised when the control over a development property has been transferred to the customer.  At contract inception, the Group assesses whether the Group transfers control of the residential project over time or at a point in time by determining if (a) its performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group; and (b) the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\n\nWhere a development property has no alternative use for the Group due to contractual restriction, and the Group has enforceable rights to payment for performance completed to date arising from the contractual terms, revenue is recognised over time by reference to the Group's progress towards completing the construction of the development property.  The measure of progress is determined based on the stage of completion of construction certified by quantity surveyors.  Costs incurred that are not related to the contract or that do not contribute towards satisfying a performance obligation are excluded from the measure of progress and instead are expensed as incurred.\n\nIn respect of contracts where the Group does not have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue is recognised only when the completed property is delivered to the customer and the customer has accepted it in accordance with the sales contract.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.16  Revenue recognition (cont'd)\n\n## (i) Development properties for sale (cont'd)\n\nUnder certain payment schemes, the time when payments are made by the buyer and the transfer of control of the property to the buyer do not coincide and where the difference between the timing of receipt of the payments and the satisfaction of a performance obligation is 12 months or more, the Group adjusts the transaction price with its customer and recognises a financing component.  In adjusting for the financing component, the Group uses a discount rate that would reflect that of a separate financing transaction between the Group and its customer at contract inception.  A finance income or finance expense will be recognised depending on the arrangement.  The Group has elected to apply the practical expedient not to adjust the transaction price for the existence of significant financing component when the period between the transfer of control of goods or services to a customer and the payment date is 12 months or less.\n\nRevenue is measured at the transaction price agreed under the contract entered into with customers.  Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress towards completion are revised if circumstances change.  Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.\n\nThe customer is invoiced based on a payment schedule which is typically triggered upon achievement of specified construction milestones.  If the value of the goods transferred by the Group exceeds the payments, a contract asset is recognised.  If the payments exceed the value of the goods transferred, a contract liability is recognised. The accounting policy for contract assets and contract liabilities is set out in note 3.9.\n\n## (ii) Rental income\n\nRental income (net of any lease incentives) is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Contingent rentals, which include gross turnover rental, are recognised as income in the accounting period in which it is earned and the amount can be reliably measured.\n\n## (iii) Hotel income\n\nRevenue from hotel operations is recognised at the point when the accommodation and related services are rendered.\n\n## (iv) Management services, consultancy services and laundry services\n\nManagement and consultancy fees and laundry services are recognised at the point when such services are rendered.\n\n## (v) Dividends\n\nDividend income is recognised in profit or loss when the shareholder's right to receive payment is established.\n\n## 3.17  Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are initially recognised as deferred income at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant.  Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised, unless the conditions for receiving the grant are met after the related expenses have been recognised.  In this case, the grant is recognised when it becomes receivable.",

However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset.  If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\n\nBorrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.\n\n## 3.19  Tax\n\nTax expense comprises current and deferred tax.  Tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets .\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.  The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.  Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.19  Tax (cont'd)\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised for:\n\n- \u00b7 temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- \u00b7 taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nTemporary differences in relation to a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for a specific lease are regarded as a net package (the lease) for the purpose of recognising deferred tax.\n\nThe measurement of deferred taxes reflects the consequences that follow the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.  Future taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\n\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.\n\nIn determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due.  The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events.  New information may become available that causes the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.",

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.  Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, for the dilutive effect arising from the conversion of the non-redeemable convertible non-cumulative preference shares.\n\n## 3.21  Segment reporting\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, including revenue and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components.  All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors and Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.\n\nSegment results that are reported to the Group's Board of Directors and Group CEO include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.  Unallocated items comprise mainly tax assets and liabilities.\n\n## 3.22  New standards and amendments not adopted\n\nA number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2022 and earlier application is permitted. Except as disclosed in note 2.5, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these financial statements. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of the new standards and amendments to standards on its financial statements.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 4 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n\n|                                                                              | Note   | Freehold  land and  buildings $'000   | Leasehold  land and  buildings $'000   | Freehold and leasehold  properties under  development $'000   | Furniture,  fittings,   plant and  equipment  and  improvements $'000   | Renovation- in-progress $'000   | Right-of- use assets $'000   | Total $'000      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|\n| Group                                                                        |        |                                       |                                        |                                                               |                                                                         |                                 |                              |                  |\n| Cost                                                                         |        |                                       |                                        |                                                               |                                                                         |                                 |                              |                  |\n| At 1 January 2021                                                            |        | 4,089,858                             | 1,672,463                              | 299,211                                                       | 1,864,634                                                               | 28,648                          | 344,340                      | 8,299,154        |\n| Acquisition of subsidiaries                                                  | 40     | -

Where indicators of impairment were identified, the recoverable amounts were estimated based on internal or external valuations undertaken by the Group.  The cash generating units (CGU) are individual hotels.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the individual hotels, being the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value-in-use, were predominantly determined using the fair value less costs to sell approach and were estimated using the discounted cashflow method (2021: discounted cash flow and income capitalisation methods).  Under these methodologies, the fair value measurement reflects current market expectations about an efficient third party operator's future cash flows.  The discounted cash flows method involves estimating each hotel's future cash flows and discounting the cash flows with an internal rate of return to arrive at the market value, taking into consideration the assumptions in respect of revenue growth (principally factoring in room rate and occupancy growth) and major expense items for each hotel.  The future cash flows are based on assumptions about competitive growth rates for hotels in that area, as well as the internal business plan for the hotel in the relevant market.  These plans and forecasts include management's most recent view of trading prospects for the hotel in the relevant market. The income capitalisation method capitalises an income stream into a present value using revenue multipliers or single-year capitalisation rates.\n\nWhere appropriate, the Group sought guidance on the fair values of the hotels from independent external valuers with appropriate professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the properties being valued.  In relying on the valuation reports, the Group has exercised its judgement and is satisfied that the valuation method and estimates are reflective of current market conditions.  Certain valuation reports obtained from the external valuers have highlighted that a combination of global inflationary pressures, recent geopolitical events, and remaining effects of Covid-19 pandemic in some markets, has heightened the potential for greater volatility in property markets over the short to medium term. The importance of the valuation date must be stressed as property values may change over a relatively short period of time.\n\nThe fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.\n\nIn 2022, the Group recognised a net reversal of impairment loss of $28,113,000 on certain hotel properties, comprising reversal of impairment losses of $33,778,000 on four hotels in United States of America (US) and three hotels in Europe, net of impairment losses made of $5,665,000 in respect of one hotel in New Zealand and a club in Asia.  The impairment losses reversed during the year mainly arose from the improved trading performances of certain hotel properties, following the progressive recovery of the hospitality sector in the countries in which these hotels are located.  The impairment loss recognised on the club in Asia was a result of its weak financial performance.  The estimated total recoverable amounts of the properties on which impairment losses were reversed or impaired during the year were $615,980,000 as at 31 December 2022.\n\nIn 2021, the Group recognised a net reversal of impairment loss of $95,375,000 on its hotel properties, comprising reversal of impairment losses of $96,317,000 on five hotels in United States of America (US), two hotels in Europe, and four hotels in Asia, net of impairment losses made of $942,000 in respect of a club and a restaurant in Asia.  The impairment losses reversed during the year mainly arose from the improved trading performances of certain hotel properties, following the progressive recovery of the hospitality sector in the countries in which these hotels are located.  The estimated total recoverable amounts of the properties on which impairment losses were reversed or impaired during the year were $743,871,000 as at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.\n\nImpairment losses recognised or reversed were included in 'other operating expenses' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and the hotel operations segment.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 4 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONT'D)\n\nThe key assumptions used in estimating the recoverable amounts are set out below:\n\n|                          | US             | Europe         | Asia           | New Zealand    |\n|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Occupancy rate           |                |                |                |                |\n| 2022                     | 65.0% to 95.0% | 70.0% to 76.0% | N/A            | 62.6% to 69.1% |\n| 2021                     | 45.0% to 95.0% | 54.0% to 84.0% | 36.4% to 73.0% | N/A            |\n| Average room rate growth |                |                |                |                |\n| 2022                     | 2.0% to 10.0%  | 1.1% to 9.1%   | N/A            | 2.0% to 3.0%   |\n| 2021                     | 1.4% to 56.4%  | 1.1% to 12.2%  | 2.0% to 8.2%   | N/A            |\n| Discount rate            |                |                |                |                |\n| 2022                     | 8.3% to 10.5%  | 7.3% to 11.3%  | N/A            | 10.3%          |\n| 2021                     | 7.5% to 11.8%  | 6.6% to 8.3%   | 11.8% to 12.0% | N/A            |\n| Terminal rates           |                |                |                |                |\n| 2022                     | 6.0% to 8.5%   | 4.0% to 7.8%   | N/A            | 9.5%           |\n| 2021                     | 5.5% to 9.8%   | 4.0% to 6.3%   | 9.0% to 10.0%  | N/A            |\n| Capitalisation rates     |                |                |                |                |\n| 2021                     | N/A            | N/A            | 8.8%           | N/A            |\n\nThe cash flow forecasts under the discounted cash flow method cover a five to ten years period, and cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate ranging between 2.2% and 3.4% (2021: 1.5% and 3.1%), which is based upon the expected trading growth for each hotel and inflation in the country in which the hotel is located.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe Group's impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used.  An increase in occupancy rate and/or average room rate growth in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount.  An increase in discount rate, terminal rate or capitalisation rate in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount.",

Generally, each of the leases is fixed for a period of 1 to 16 years (2021: 1 to 29 years), and subsequent renewals are negotiated at prevailing market rates and terms.\n- (b) During  2022,  the  Group  transferred  a  portion  of  an  investment  property  to  development  properties  for redevelopment  as  residential  units  for  sale.  In  addition,  the  Group  transferred  a  development  property  to investment properties arising from inception of an operating lease for the property. The Group also disposed of certain investment properties arising from the deconsolidation of CDLHT following the distribution in specie of CDLHT units during the current financial year (note 40).\n- During 2021, the Group transferred two hotel properties located in Australia held by CDLHT to property, plant and equipment, when CDLHT became both the owner and operator of the properties.  In addition, the Group transferred an industrial warehouse to non-current assets held for sale (note 6).\n- (c) As at 31 December 2022, investment properties of the Group with a total carrying amount of $1,236,481,000 (2021: $1,453,630,000) were mortgaged to certain financial institutions to secure credit facilities (refer to notes 23 and 24 for more details of the facilities).\n- (d) The Group undertook its annual review of the carrying amounts of investment properties for indicators of impairment. Where indicators of impairment were identified, the recoverable amounts were estimated based on internal or external valuations undertaken.  The cash generating units (CGU) are individual properties.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the investment properties, being the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, were predominantly determined using the fair value less costs to sell approach, and were estimated using the income capitalisation, standardised land value adjustment and residual methods (2021: discounted cash flow and income capitalisation).\n\nBased  on  the  impairment  assessment  undertaken  in  2022,  the  Group  recognised  an  impairment  loss  of $35,728,000 on one commercial property in the United Kingdom (UK), one purpose-built student accommodation in UK and one commercial project in China. The aforesaid commercial project in China is undergoing phased construction. The impairment loss recognised during the year was mainly due to the increase in capitalisation rates arising from higher interest rates in UK and the subdued real estate market in China, along with higher than expected development costs incurred on the property in China.\n\nIn 2021, the Group recognised a net impairment loss of $2,064,000 on its investment properties, comprising reversal of impairment losses of $3,416,000 on one hotel in Maldives and one hotel in Italy, both of which are held by CDLHT, and impairment loss of $5,480,000 on one commercial property in the UK. The impairment losses reversed mainly arose from the improved trading performances, following the progressive recovery of the hospitality sector in the countries in which these hotels are located. The impairment loss recognised was due to the decrease in recoverable amount by the amount of stamp duty and land tax payable by the Group, which would not be payable had the Group proceeded with the initial public offering of a real estate investment trust (note 47).\n\nThe impairment loss reversed or recognised was recognised in 'other operating expenses' and the investment properties segment.",

An increase in occupancy rate, average room rate growth, price psm or gross development value in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount.  An increase in discount rate, terminal rate, capitalisation rate or estimated cost to completion in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 5 INVESTMENT PROPERTIES (CONT'D)\n\n## (e) Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair values for a majority of the Group's investment properties are determined by independent external valuers who have appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued.  The fair values of certain investment properties located in Singapore are based on in-house valuations conducted by a licensed valuer who is also an officer of the Company. The internal valuer has appropriate recognised professional qualifications and experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued.\n\nThe fair values of the investment properties were estimated using the discounted cash flow, income capitalisation, direct comparison, standardised land value adjustment and residual methods.  The discounted cash flow method involves the estimation and projection of an income stream over a period and discounting the income stream with an internal rate of return to arrive at the market value.  The income capitalisation method capitalises an income stream into a present value using revenue multipliers or single-year capitalisation rates.  The direct comparison method involves an analysis of comparable sales of similar properties and adjusting the transacted prices to those reflective of the investment properties of the Group.  The standardised land value adjustment method considers the price of standard land in the current situation of development and utilisation, under normal market conditions within legal maximum use term as at a special date, that is assessed and approved by the local government.  The residual method involves deducting the estimated cost to complete as of valuation date and other relevant costs from gross development value of the proposed development assuming satisfactory completion and accounting for developer's profit.\n\nThe fair value disclosure for the investment properties for the Group and the Company of  $10,899,043,000 (2021 (restated): $10,966,900,000) and $1,820,028,000 (2021: $1,662,892,000) respectively has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation techniques used.\n\n## 6 ASSETS HELD FOR SALE\n\n|                                                               | 2022 $'000   | 2021 $'000 Restated*   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| Assets held for sale                                          |              |                        |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                 | 14,417       | 334,190                |\n| Investment properties                                         | -            | 53,837                 |\n| Trade and other receivables                                   | -            | 68                     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                     | -            | 631                    |\n|                                                               | 14,417       | 388,726                |\n| Liabilities directly associated with the assets held for sale |              |                        |\n| Trade and other payables                                      | -            | 412                    |\n| Other liabilities                                             | -            | 425                    |\n| Provision for taxation                                        | -            | 257                    |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                      | -            | 107                    |\n|                                                               | -            | 1,201                  |\n\nAt 31 December 2022, assets held for sale relates to the proposed disposal by an indirect subsidiary of the Group, Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C), of Millennium Harvest House Boulder (which is in the hotel operations segment), to a third party for a sale consideration of $96.7 million.

Based on the assessment, the Company recognised a net impairment loss of $10,277,000 (2021: $17,270,000) on its investments in four (2021: three) wholly-owned subsidiaries, following a decline in their financial position.  The recoverable amounts of the subsidiaries were estimated taking into consideration the fair values of the underlying assets and the liabilities of the companies.  The fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs in the valuation techniques used.\n\nThe non-trade amounts owing by and to subsidiaries are unsecured.  In respect of interest-bearing amounts owing by and to subsidiaries, interest was charged at 1.00% to 4.98% (2021: 0.39% to 4.18%) per annum and at 1.00% to 3.00% (2021: 1.00% to 3.00%) per annum respectively, as at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe non-trade balances with subsidiaries that are presented as receivable or repayable within one year are receivable or repayable on demand. The non-trade amounts owing by subsidiaries receivable after one year are loans to subsidiaries for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.  These amounts are, in substance, a part of the Company's net investments in subsidiaries.\n\nInformation about the Company's exposure to credit risk on the amounts owing by subsidiaries is included in note 42.",

In respect of interest-bearing amounts owing by associates, interest of 6.00% (2021: 6.00%) per annum was charged by the Group.\n\nThe non-trade amount owing to an associate is unsecured and repayable on demand.\n\nIncluded in the Group's investments in associates are investments in three associates (2021: two associates) which are listed on the Mainboard of Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST). As at the reporting date, the aggregate carrying amount of these investments were $1,181.6 million (2021: $764.5 million) and the fair values based on the published price quotation (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) was $950.6 million (2021: $612.7 million). In respect of these associates, management had assessed the recoverable amounts of the investments and determined that as their net asset value based on the latest available audited financial statements of the associates are higher than the carrying amount as at the reporting date, no impairment loss for these investments is considered necessary.\n\nDuring 2021, the Group assessed the carrying amount of its investments in associates for indicators of impairment.  Based on the assessment, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $12,125,000 on its investment in certain associates as a result of their weak financial performance.  The recoverable amount was estimated taking into account the fair values of the underlying assets and the liabilities of the associates.  The fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as it is derived from unobservable inputs.\n\nThe movements in impairment losses in respect of investments in associates and amounts owing by associates are as follows:\n\n|                                          |         |        | Amounts owing by  associates Lifetime ECL - not  credit-impaired   | Amounts owing by  associates Lifetime ECL - not  credit-impaired   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                          | 2022    | 2021   | 2022                                                               | 2021                                                               |\n|                                          | $'000   | $'000  | $'000                                                              | $'000                                                              |\n| Group                                    |         |        |                                                                    |                                                                    |\n| At 1 January                             | 15,399  | 3,000  | -                                                                  | -                                                                  |\n| Impairment loss recognised               | -       | 12,125 | 339                                                                | -                                                                  |\n| Impairment loss utilised                 | (1,703) | -      | -                                                                  | -                                                                  |\n| Translation differences on consolidation | (1,041) | 274    | (19)                                                               | -                                                                  |\n| At 31 December                           | 12,655  | 15,399 | 320                                                                | -                                                                  |\n\nThe impairment loss recognised was included in 'Share of after-tax profit of associates' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Accounting for investment in CDLHT\n\nIn May 2022, the Company distributed 144,191,823 units in CDLHT ('CDLHT units') that it held to its ordinary shareholders, which resulted in CDLHT, which was a subsidiary in prior year, becoming an associate of the Group thereafter (notes 40, 44 and 45).  The Group's retained interest in CDLHT has been remeasured to fair value and accounted for as a business combination, which requires the purchase price to be allocated to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent liabilities (purchase price allocation or 'PPA'). A significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to CDLHT's underlying property portfolio comprising property, plant and equipment and investment properties, based on the valuation amounts in the valuation reports undertaken by an internal valuer with appropriate recognised professional qualifications and experience in the location and category of the properties being valued.",

Ltd. (Summervale) for Nouvel 18, a 156-unit luxury freehold residential development on Anderson Road, Singapore.  In October 2016, the Group established its third Profit Participation Securities (PPS) by entering into an investment agreement, and an asset management and marketing agreement with an unrelated party, Green 18 Pte. Ltd. (Green 18), to exit its entire interest in Summervale.  As part of the investment agreement, the Group subscribed for a note of $140 million issued by Summervale.  According to the asset management and marketing agreement, Summervale appointed Trentwell Management Pte. Ltd. (Trentwell), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, as the asset manager and marketing agent of Summervale to manage and lease out Nouvel 18, as well as to market and divest units in Nouvel 18 for a period of five years (with an option to extend to seven years).  The option for extension of the duration of the asset management and marketing agreement for a further 2-year period has been exercised with effect from 20 October 2021.  The note was fully redeemed during the current year.\n- (c) Unquoted debt investment at amortised cost with gross carrying amount of $309,488,000 (US$230 million) (2021: $311,512,000 (US$230 million)) relates to the Group's investment in a US$ bond issued by Sincere Property Group.  The bond bore interest at 10% (2021: 10%) per annum up till the effective date of commencement of Sincere Property's bankruptcy reorganisation on 14 October 2021.  The bond which has a maturity date on 27 June 2022, may be redeemed by the holder on or before 27 June 2021.  During 2021, the Group exercised its put option and issued a put notice to the issuer for full repayment.  As at 31 December 2022, the bond remained unpaid. As at 31 December 2022, the bond has been fully impaired. As at 31 December 2021, an impairment loss of $293,769,000 was recognised on the bond. The Group has no collateral in respect of this investment.\n\nThe movement in the allowance for impairment for debt investments at amortised cost during the year was as follows:\n\n|                                          | Lifetime ECL  credit-impaired   | Lifetime ECL  credit-impaired   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                          | 2022                            | 2021                            |\n|                                          | $'000                           | $'000                           |\n| Balance as at 1 January                  | 293,769                         | 288,000                         |\n| Impairment loss recognised               | 18,015                          | -                               |\n| Translation differences on consolidation | (2,296)                         | 5,769                           |\n| Balance as at 31 December                | 309,488                         | 293,769                         |\n\nThe impairment loss recognised was included on the face of the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\nThe Group undertook an impairment assessment of the investment in the bond.",

Discussions between the bankruptcy administrator, creditors of Sincere Property Group and potential investors are ongoing.  The Group has filed its claims against Sincere Property with the bankruptcy administrator.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group assessed that the investment in the bond continue to be credit-impaired. The Group assessed the lifetime ECL to be recognised, taking into consideration the latest developments of Sincere Property Group based on available information, prevailing market conditions and price trends of corporate bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nThe key parameter applied in estimating the ECL to be recognised include assuming a loss given default ('LGD') of 100% which was estimated based on the range of decline in trading prices of bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group. The Group also considered the increased uncertainty surrounding the complex bankruptcy reorganisation with the passage of time, which pose challenges to the recovery of the investment in the bond.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the Group recognised an additional impairment of $18 million on the investment in the bond during the year. As at 31 December 2022, the investment in the bond has been fully impaired.\n\nAs the bankruptcy reorganisation for Sincere Property Group is ongoing, its outcome is uncertain and evolving. Changes to circumstances and estimates may impact the ECL recognised on the investment in the bond. The ECL on the investment in the bond is also sensitive to the assumptions used. As the investment in bond has been fully impaired, any decrease in LGD in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount.\n\n## 2021\n\nHaving considered that Sincere Property had entered into bankruptcy reorganisation and its credit rating and domestic corporate bonds were downgraded by a local credit rating agency during 2021 (see note 42), the Group assessed that the investment in the bond continued to be credit-impaired.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group assessed the lifetime ECL to be recognised, taking into account the latest developments  of  Sincere  Property  Group  based  on  publicly  available  information  as  described  in  note  42, prevailing market conditions and price trends of corporate bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group, following regulatory tightening and systemic changes on financing imposed on China's real estate sector.\n\nThe key parameter applied in estimating the ECL to be recognised included assuming a LGD of approximately 90% which was based on the range of decline in trading prices of bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and faced similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 10 FINANCIAL ASSETS (CONT'D)\n\n## 2021 (cont'd)\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the Group assessed that no additional impairment was required on the investment in the bond. At 31 December 2021, the carrying value of the bond was $17.7 million (net of impairment loss). As the bankruptcy reorganisation for Sincere Property Group is ongoing, its outcome is uncertain and evolving. Changes to circumstances and estimates may impact the ECL recognised on the investment in the bond. The ECL on the investment in the bond is also sensitive to the assumptions used.  A decrease in LGD in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount.  An increase in LGD in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount.\n\n## (d) Equity investments designated at FVOCI\n\nThe Group designated the equity investments shown below as equity investments at FVOCI because these equity investments represent investments that the Group intends to hold for the long-term for strategic purposes.\n\n|                                                                         | Group             | Group                               | Company          | Company                             |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                                         | Fair value  $'000 | Dividend  income  recognised  $'000 | Fair value $'000 | Dividend  income  recognised  $'000 |\n| 2022                                                                    |                   |                                     |                  |                                     |\n| Unquoted investment in a                                                |                   |                                     |                  |                                     |\n| fellow subsidiary: - Hong Leong Holdings Limited                        | 407,903           | 2,295                               | 407,903          | 2,295                               |\n| Unquoted investment in a  non-related company:                          |                   |                                     |                  |                                     |\n| - Singapore-Suzhou Township  Development Pte.

The estimated selling prices are based on recent selling prices for the development project or comparable projects and prevailing property market conditions.  The estimated total construction costs are based on contracted amounts and, in respect of amounts not contracted for, management's estimates of the amounts to be incurred taking into consideration historical trends of the amounts incurred.  The allowance made for foreseeable losses is included in 'cost of sales'.\n\n- (ii) Development properties of the Group recognised as cost of sales, excluding allowance for foreseeable losses, amounted to $1,081,031,000 (2021: $961,314,000) for the year.\n- (iii) Development properties of the Group with carrying amounts of $565,080,000 (2021: $1,661,321,000) are mortgaged to financial institutions to secure credit facilities (refer to note 23).\n\n## 14 CONTRACT COSTS\n\nThe amount relates to commission fees paid to property agents for securing sale contracts for the Group's development properties.  During the year, $43,664,000 (2021: $75,218,000) of commission fees paid were capitalised as contract costs.\n\nCapitalised commission fees are amortised when the related revenue is recognised.  During the year, $51,316,000 (2021: $32,990,000) was amortised.  There is no impairment loss in relation to such costs capitalised.",

In the prior year, H-REIT had a credit rating of BB+ from Fitch Ratings. The Aggregate Leverage of H-REIT as at 31 December 2021 was 39.1% of H-REIT's Deposited Property.  This complied with the aggregate leverage limit as described above. Following the Company's distribution in specie of part of the CDLHT units that it held, to ordinary shareholders in May 2022 (notes 40, 44 and 45), CDLHT became an associate of the Group.\n\nThe Group has a subsidiary, CDL Real Estate Asset Managers Pte. Ltd. (CREAM), which is required to maintain at least $250,000 of base capital at all times pursuant to the Securities and Futures (Financial and Margin Requirements for Holders of Capital Markets Services Licences) Regulations (Rg13) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289).  The Monetary Authority of Singapore defines base capital as the sum of all paid-up capital, reserve funds, any unappropriated profit or loss in the latest audited accounts, and less any interim loss in the latest accounts of the company.  CREAM has complied with the capital requirements during the current and prior year.\n\nUnder the Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) Act, in order to qualify for a housing developer's licence, certain subsidiaries of the Group are required to maintain a minimum paid-up capital. These entities complied with the capital requirement during the current and prior year.\n\nExcept for the above, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.\n\n## 20 RESERVES\n\n|                                      | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                      | 2022 $'000 | 2021 $'000 | 2022 $'000 | 2021 $'000 |\n|                                      | Restated*  | Restated*  | Restated*  | Restated*  |\n| Capital reserve                      | 232,681    | 290,920    | 63,743     | 63,743     |\n| Fair value reserve                   | 73,456     | 997        | 49,966     | (30,358)   |\n| Hedging reserve                      | 17,355     | (1,532)    | 18,272     | -          |\n| Other reserves                       | 24,651     | 23,952     | -          | -          |\n| Share option reserve                 | 15,482     | 15,423     | -          | -          |\n| Foreign currency translation reserve | (334,364)  | (140,224)  | -          | -          |\n| Accumulated profits                  | 7,195,677  | 6,219,870  | 4,020,199  | 4,307,624  |\n|                                      | 7,224,938  | 6,409,406  | 4,152,180  | 4,341,009  |\n\n- * Refer to Note 47\n\nThe capital reserve comprises mainly:\n\n- (a) negative goodwill on the consolidation of subsidiaries which arose prior to 1 January 2017 under the previous accounting standards adopted;\n- (b) issue expenses; and\n- (c) reserves arising from the Group's acquisition of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries.\n\nThe fair value reserve comprises the cumulative net change in the fair value of equity instruments designated at FVOCI.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 20 RESERVES (CONT'D)\n\nThe hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net changes in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred (net of tax).\n\nOther reserves comprise mainly reserves set aside by certain subsidiaries in compliance with the relevant regulations in the People's Republic of China and share of other reserves of associates and joint ventures.\n\nThe share option reserve comprises the cumulative value of employee services received for the issue of share options of a subsidiary and a joint venture.\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve comprises mainly:\n\n- (a) foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currencies are different from the presentation currency of the Company;\n- (b) the gain or loss on financial instruments used to hedge the Group's net investment in foreign operations that are determined to be effective hedges; and\n- (c) exchange differences on monetary items which form part of the Group's net investment in foreign operations, provided certain conditions are met.\n\n## 21 EQUITY COMPENSATION BENEFITS\n\n## By a subsidiary\n\n## Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C)\n\nThe M&C Group used to operate a number of share option schemes, a majority of which were designed to link remuneration to the future performance of M&C Group.\n\nThere were no options granted by M&C Group since 2020 in line with the final cash offer made by the Company to acquire the remaining interest in M&C at \u00a36.85 per share (the 'Final Offer') in 2019 and any outstanding options are to close out per the final vesting dates.\n\n## (i) Annual Bonus Plan\n\nUnder the Annual Bonus Plan ('ABP'), deferred share awards were granted annually to selected employees of the M&C Group.

The most significant funds are described below:\n\n## United Kingdom (UK)\n\nThe Group makes contributions to a pension scheme for its UK employees, which was set up in 1993. The plan operates a  funded  defined  benefit  arrangement  together  with  a  defined  contribution  plan,  both  with  different  categories  of membership.  The defined benefit section of the plan was closed to new entrants in 2001 and at the same time, rights to a guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) under the defined contribution scheme also ceased.  The plan entitles a retired employee to receive an annual pension payment.\n\nThe contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.  The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 5 April 2020 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2022.  The contributions of the Group during the year were about 36.30% (2021: 11%) of pensionable salary.\n\nAs the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.  The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.\n\n## Taiwan\n\nThe Group makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan.  The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.  The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2022.  The contributions of the Group were no less than 6% (2021: 6%) of the employees' earnings.  The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and the rate of increase in salaries.\n\nThe defined benefit plans are administered by pension funds that are legally separated from the Group.  The boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants.\n\nThese defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.\n\nThe above plans are substantially funded by the Group's subsidiary.  The funding requirements are based on pension funds' actuarial measurement framework set out in the funding policies of the plans.",

The contributions required were determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2021. The assumptions which had the most significant effect on the results of the valuations were those relating to the discount rate and the rate of increase in salaries.\n\nThe assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions:\n\n|                           | 2022 UK   | 2022 Taiwan   | 2021 UK   | 2021 South Korea   | 2021 Taiwan   |\n|---------------------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|--------------------|---------------|\n| Inflation rate            | 3.3%      | -             | 3.5%      | -                  | -             |\n| Discount rate             | 4.9%      | 1.5%          | 1.7%      | 2.8%               | 0.5%          |\n| Rate of salary increase   | 3.8%      | 3.0%          | 4.0%      | -                  | 3.0%          |\n| Rate of pension increases | 3.1%      | -             | 3.3%      | -                  | -             |\n| Rate of revaluation       | 2.8%      | -             | 3.0%      | -                  | -             |\n\nThe methodology for computing the discount rate is the yield range method.\n\nThe assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.  The present values of the schemes' liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above.  The following table summarises how the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period would have increased/ (decreased) as a result of a change in one of the relevant actuarial assumptions by one percent, holding other assumptions consistent.\n\n|                         | Defined benefit obligation   | Defined benefit obligation   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                         | 1 percent increase $'000     | 1 percent decrease $'000     |\n| Group                   |                              |                              |\n| 2022                    |                              |                              |\n| Discount rate           | (9,329)                      | 11,781                       |\n| Rate of salary increase | 912                          | (683)                        |\n| 2021                    |                              |                              |\n| Discount rate           | (21,686)                     | 27,650                       |\n| Rate of salary increase | 1,389                        | (1,272)                      |\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 27 LEASE LIABILITIES\n\n|                   | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|-------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                   | 2022 $'000 | 2021 $'000 | 2022 $'000 | 2021 $'000 |\n| Lease liabilities | 697,439    | 265,327    | 32,522     | 15,922     |\n| Non-current       | 672,633    | 246,003    | 26,642     | 9,600      |\n| Current           | 24,806     | 19,324     | 5,880      | 6,322      |\n|                   | 697,439    | 265,327    | 32,522     | 15,922     |\n\nThe incremental borrowing rates of the Group's and the Company's lease liabilities range from 0.9% to 14.6% (2021: 0.9% to 14.6%) and 2.7% to 3.1% (2021: 2.2% to 2.8%) per annum respectively, as at 31 December 2022.\n\nInformation about the Group's and the Company's exposure to foreign currency and liquidity risk is included in note 42.\n\n## 28 OTHER LIABILITIES\n\n|                                                             | Group     | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                             | Note      | 2022 $'000 | 2021 $'000 | 2022 $'000 | 2021 $'000 |\n|                                                             | Restated* | Restated*  | Restated*  | Restated*  | Restated*  |\n| Deferred income                                             |           | 47,874     | 122,124    | -          | -          |\n| Rental deposits                                             |           | 52,928     | 53,609     | 9,564      | 8,041      |\n| Amounts owing to a subsidiary                               | 7         | -          | -          | 750,144    | -          |\n| Non-current retention sums payable                          |           | 15,560     | 26,625     | -          | -          |\n| Miscellaneous (principally deposits  received and payables) |           | 19,781     | 18,213     | -          | -          |\n|                                                             |           | 136,143    | 220,571    | 759,708    | 8,041      |\n\nIncluded in deferred income are the following:\n\n- (i) $7,030,000 (2021: $7,030,000) relating to the deferred gain on the sale of cash flows as disclosed in footnote (a) of note 45.\n- (ii) $37,970,000 (2021: $105,406,000) relating to the deferred gain arising from the sale of Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay previously owned by CDLHT, to a joint venture.  During the current financial year, $62.0 million deferred gain was realised and recognised as part of the gain on disposal of CDLHT under 'Other income' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\nIn addition, as at 31 December 2021, deferred income included $6,635,000 relating to the deferred gain arising from the Group's exit of its entire interest in Summervale, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group in October 2016. Although the Group lost control in Summervale, the Group assessed that it maintained some continuing involvement through its investment in secured fixed rate notes issued by Summervale (note 10).  Accordingly, a portion of the gain on disposal of Summervale by reference to the extent of the amount of continuing involvement retained in Summervale is deferred. During the current financial year, the note issued by Summervale was fully redeemed and the deferred income was recognised as a gain under 'Other income' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss (note 33).",

The Proposed Distribution was subject to and conditional upon, inter alia , the following:\n- \u00b7 the completion of the Restructuring Exercise (as defined in paragraph 4.1 of the announcement issued by the Company on 25 February 2022);\n- \u00b7 Approval of shareholders of the Proposed Distribution at the annual general meeting; and\n- \u00b7 All necessary waivers, consents and approvals from, inter alia , the SGX-ST and other third parties in connection with the Proposed Distribution being obtained.\n\nThe distribution in specie was completed on 26 May 2022.  The Company distributed 144,191,823 CDLHT units that it held to its ordinary shareholders at 0.159 CDLHT Unit per ordinary share through a distribution in specie . The distribution in specie , based on $1.27 per CDLHT Unit, amounted to $183,124,000.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 37 LEASES\n\n## Leases as lessee\n\nThe Group leases hotel properties and office facilities.  The leases of hotel properties and office facilities run for periods ranging from 1 to 116 years, with options to renew after lease expiry dates.  Some leases provide for additional rent payments that are based on changes in local price indices.  For certain leases, the Group is restricted from entering into any sub-lease arrangements.\n\nThe leases for hotel properties were entered into many years ago as combined leases of land and buildings.\n\nThe Group also leases IT equipment and motor vehicles under a number of leases.\n\n## Amounts recognised in profit or loss\n\n|                                                                                                    | 2022 $'000   | 2021 $'000   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Interest on lease liabilities                                                                      | 20,127       | 10,240       |\n| Income from sub-leasing right-of-use assets presented in 'revenue'                                 | 4,015        | 3,250        |\n| Expenses relating to short-term leases                                                             | 5,305        | 2,992        |\n| Expenses relating to variable leases payments                                                      | 23,976       | -            |\n| Expenses relating to leases of low-value assets, excluding short-term leases of   low-value assets | 181          | 138          |\n\n## Amounts recognised in statement of cash flows\n\n|                               | 2022 $'000   | 2021 $'000   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Payment of lease liabilities  | 26,032       | 21,087       |\n| Interest expense              | 20,127       | 10,240       |\n| Total cash outflow for leases | 46,159       | 31,327       |\n\n## Extension options\n\nSome property leases contain extension options up to 30 years (2021: 30 years) exercisable by the Group before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility.  The extension options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors.  The Group assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options.  The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.\n\nThe Group has estimated that the potential future lease payments, should it exercise the extension option, would result in an increase in lease liability of $32.5 million (2021: $43.6 million).\n\n## Leases as lessor\n\nThe Group leases out its investment properties consisting of its owned properties as well as leased properties (see note 5). All leases are classified as operating leases from a lessor perspective.",

As at 31 December 2022, the outstanding notional amount of the guarantees amounted to $8.5 million (2021: $21.3 million).\n\nThe Group has claims arising in the ordinary course of business which are being contested, the outcome of which are not presently determinable.

Ltd. ('Shenzhen Tusincere'), which holds a 65% equity interest in Shenzhen Longgang District Qidixiexin Science and Technology Development Park Co., Ltd. ('Shenzhen Longgang'), from Sincere Property Group, a then joint venture of the Group, and two third parties, for a consideration of approximately $174.3 million (RMB853.4 million), together with the assumption of proportionate existing shareholder loans of approximately $173 million (RMB847 million).  The acquisition provided the Group an opportunity to enhance its property portfolio in China.\n\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.\n\nFrom the date of acquisition to 31 December 2021, Shenzhen Tusincere contributed revenue of $222.8 million and profit before tax of $44.0 million to the Group's results. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2021, management estimated the Group's revenue for the period would have been $2,654.4 million, with no significant change to the Group's profit before tax.\n\n## Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n\nThe following table summarises the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.\n\n|                                  | Note   | Recognised  amounts $'000   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment    | 4      | 21,304                      |\n| Investment properties            | 5      | 341,753                     |\n| Development properties           |        | 948,309                     |\n| Trade and other receivables      |        | 17,356                      |\n| Contract costs                   |        | 1,003                       |\n| Cash at bank                     |        | 5,564                       |\n| Trade and other payables         |        | (145,525)                   |\n| Shareholder loans                |        | (297,972)                   |\n| Contract liabilities             |        | (166,443)                   |\n| Employee benefits                |        | (813)                       |\n| Lease liabilities                |        | (2,876)                     |\n| Provision for tax                |        | (59,567)                    |\n| Provisions                       | 29     | (4,108)                     |\n| Interest-bearing borrowings      |        | (194,016)                   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities         | 30     | (80,081)                    |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired |        | 383,888                     |",

CDLHT was deconsolidated on that date and became an associate of the Group.\n- (b) On 7 March 2022, the Group, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Singapura Developments (Private) Limited, disposed of its 100% equity interest in Bloomsville Investments Pte. Ltd. (Bloomsville) for a sale consideration (net of transaction costs) of $80.8 million.\n\nThe Group recognised a total gain on the above transactions of approximately $501.7 million.",

Management is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's risk management policies.  Management reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.\n\nThe Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.  The Group has a system of controls in place to maintain an acceptable balance between the cost of risks occurring and the cost of managing the risks.  Management continually monitors the Group's risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved.  Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. It is, and has been throughout the current and previous financial years, the Group's policy that no derivatives shall be undertaken for speculative purposes except for its use as hedging instruments where appropriate and cost efficient.\n\n## (i) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers, amounts owing by associates and joint ventures, other receivables and debt investments.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group had gross amounts owing by HCP Group of $382.7 million (2021: $395.1 million) (see below) and subscribed for a bond of $309.5 million (2021: $311.5 million) (note 10) issued by Sincere Property Group. As at 31 December 2022, the amounts owing by HCP Group and the investment in bond have been fully impaired. As at 31 December 2021, impairment losses of $331.2 million (note 16 and below) and $293.8 million (note 10) were recognised on the amounts owing by HCP Group and the bonds, respectively. In addition, the amounts owing by subsidiaries and joint ventures represent 92% (2021: 92%) of the Company's financial assets.\n\nExcept as disclosed, there is no significant concentration of credit risk for the Group and the Company.  The carrying amounts of financial assets and contract assets represent the Group's and the Company's maximum exposures to credit risk, before taking into account any collateral held.",

Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.  The Group does not require collateral in respect of these financial assets.\n\nThe Group limits its exposure to credit risk from trade receivables by collecting deposits as collateral, where possible. For trade receivables and contract assets relating to sale of development properties, if a purchaser defaults on payments, the Group may enforce payments via legal proceedings or if the purchaser is assessed to be insolvent, the Group may take possession of the units, retain a portion of the sales consideration, and resell the property.\n\nIn monitoring customer credit risk, the Group considers the trade history of the customers with the Group, aging profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties.\n\n## Exposure to credit risk\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables and contract assets at the reporting date by business segment is set out below:\n\n|                       | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                       | 2022 $'000 | 2021 $'000 | 2022 $'000 | 2021 $'000 |\n|                       | Restated*  | Restated*  | Restated*  | Restated*  |\n| Property development  | 1,887,697  | 1,813,907  | 5,796,323  | 5,146,585  |\n| Hotel operations      | 212,276    | 179,976    | 2,176,094  | 1,635,335  |\n| Investment properties | 130,205    | 138,570    | 1,436,920  | 1,734,717  |\n| Others                | 48,327     | 112,034    | 3,494,252  | 3,911,800  |\n|                       | 2,278,505  | 2,244,487  | 12,903,589 | 12,428,437 |\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 42 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT'D)\n\n## (i) Credit risk (cont'd)\n\n## Expected credit loss assessment on trade receivables\n\nThe Group uses an allowance matrix to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from individual customers, which comprise a very large number of small balances.\n\nLoss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over the past 3 years (2021: 3 years).  These rates are adjusted to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historic data has been collected, current conditions and the Group's view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.\n\nThe following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECLs for trade receivables and accrued receivables as at reporting date:\n\n|                            | Group                        | Group                            | Company                      | Company                          |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                            | Gross carrying  amount $'000 | Impairment  loss allowance $'000 | Gross carrying  amount $'000 | Impairment  loss allowance $'000 |\n| 2022                       |                              |                                  |                              |                                  |\n| Current (not past due)     | 183,109                      | 27,278                           | 2,789                        | -                                |\n| 1 - 30 days past due       | 43,263                       | 76                               | 8,576                        | 13                               |\n| 31 - 60 days past due      | 16,601                       | 281                              | 114                          | 3                                |\n| 61 - 90 days past due      | 16,008                       | 2,497                            | 11                           | 1                                |\n| More than 90 days past due | 33,388                       | 5,505                            | 193                          | 65                               |\n|                            | 292,369                      | 35,637                           | 11,683                       | 82                               |\n| 2021                       |                              |                                  |                              |                                  |\n| Current (not past due)     | 171,194                      | 15                               | 2,404                        | 11                               |\n| 1 - 30 days past due       | 32,540                       | 557                              | 628                          | 44                               |\n| 31 - 60 days past due      | 5,108                        | 95                               | 118                          | 10                               |\n| 61 - 90 days past due      | 3,448                        | 30                               | 21                           | 3                                |\n| More than 90 days past due | 49,026                       | 16,328                           | 528                          | 67                               |\n|                            | 261,316                      | 17,025                           | 3,699                        | 135                              |",

Discussions between the bankruptcy administrator, creditors of Sincere Property Group and potential investors are ongoing.  The Group has filed its claims against Sincere Property with the bankruptcy administrator.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group assessed that the amounts owing by HCP Group continue to be creditimpaired. The Group assessed the lifetime ECL to be recognised, taking into consideration the latest developments of Sincere Property Group based on available information, prevailing market conditions and price trends of corporate bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nThe key parameter applied in estimating the ECL to be recognised include assuming a loss given default ('LGD') of 100% which was estimated based on the range of decline in trading prices of bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group. The Group also considered the increased uncertainty surrounding the complex bankruptcy reorganisation with the passage of time, which pose challenges to the recovery of the amounts owing by HCP Group.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the Group recognised an additional impairment of $62.7 million on the amounts owing by HCP Group during the year. As at 31 December 2022, the amounts owing by HCP Group have been fully impaired.\n\nAs the bankruptcy reorganisation for Sincere Property Group is ongoing, its outcome is uncertain and evolving. Changes to circumstances and estimates may impact the ECL recognised on the amounts owing by HCP Group. The ECL on the amounts owing by HCP Group is also sensitive to the assumptions used. As the amounts owing by HCP Group have been fully impaired, any decrease in LGD in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount.\n\n## 2021\n\nDuring 2021, as part of the Group's disposal of its interest in HCP, the Group had entered into various agreements with the HCP Group whereby it was agreed that (i) an amount owing by the Group to HCP Group of $263.7 million would be set off against the amounts owing by HCP Group; and (ii) the collateral held by the Group in respect of the amounts owing by HCP Group, which related to shares in an investment holding company that held an equity interest in a property-owning entity which had been pledged by HCP Group to the Group, in respect of the amounts owing by HCP Group, would be transferred to the Group, as settlement of $54.1 million (RMB260.0 million) of the amounts owing by HCP Group. The above arrangements resulted in a utilisation of $8.2 million (RMB39.2 million) impairment loss previously recognised (note 9(d)).\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, after the offset arrangements, the Group had gross amounts owing by HCP Group of $395.1 million (classified under other receivables in note 16) and amounts owing to HCP Group of $50.3 million (note 31).",

In addition, a local credit rating agency downgraded Sincere Property's credit rating and its existing domestic corporate bonds as Sincere Property was unable to redeem its corporate bonds that matured in 2021.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group assessed that the amounts owing by HCP Group continue to be creditimpaired.  The Group assessed the lifetime ECL to be recognised, taking into account the latest developments of Sincere Property Group based on publicly available information as described above, prevailing market conditions and price trends of corporate bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group, following regulatory tightening and systemic changes on financing imposed on China's real estate sector.\n\nThe key parameter applied in estimating the ECL to be recognised include assuming a loss given default ('LGD') of up to 95% which was estimated based on the range of decline in trading prices of bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the Group estimated that no additional impairment is required on the amounts owing by HCP Group, other than an impairment loss of $6.1 million on the interest income recognised on the amounts owing by HCP Group during the year. At 31 December 2021, the carrying value of the amount owing by HCP Group was $63.9 million (net of impairment loss of $331.2 million) which was classified as other receivables (note 16).\n\nAs the bankruptcy reorganisation for Sincere Property is ongoing, its outcome is uncertain and evolving. Changes to circumstances and estimates may impact the ECL recognised on the amounts owing by HCP Group. The ECL on the amounts owing by HCP Group is also sensitive to the assumptions used. A decrease in the LGD in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount.  An increase in the LGD in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount.\n\n## Non-trade amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures\n\nThe Group and the Company held non-trade receivables from its associates and joint ventures which were lent to associates and joint ventures to meet their funding requirements. In addition, the Company held nontrade receivables from its subsidiaries which were lent to the subsidiaries to meet their funding requirements. Impairment on these balances has been measured on the 12-month and lifetime expected loss basis. Except as disclosed above, the Group uses an approach that is based on an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of the risk of default, including but not limited to, financial statements of the entities, and applying credit judgement.  The amount of allowance on the non-trade amounts due from associates was negligible. The amounts of the allowances on the non-trade amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are set out in notes 7, 8 and 9 respectively.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 42 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT'D)\n\n## (i) Credit risk (cont'd)\n\n## Debt investments\n\nThe Group limits its exposure to credit risk on investments held by investing only with counterparties that are of acceptable credit quality.\n\nThe exposure to credit risk for debt investments at the reporting date by geographic region was as follows:\n\n|           | Mandatorily   at FVTPL   | At amortised cost    | At amortised cost                      | At amortised cost      |\n|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|           | Carrying  amount $'000   | Gross   amount $'000 | Lifetime  ECL (credit  impaired) $'000 | Carrying  amount $'000 |\n| 2022      |                          |                      |                                        |                        |\n| China     | -                        | 309,488              | (309,488)                              | -                      |\n| Australia | 20,011                   | -                    | -                                      | -                      |\n|           | 20,011                   | 309,488              | (309,488)                              | -                      |\n| 2021      |                          |                      |                                        |                        |\n| China     | -                        | 311,512              | (293,769)                              | 17,743                 |\n| Singapore | 142,486                  | -                    | -                                      | -                      |\n| Australia | 32,923                   | -                    | -                                      | -                      |\n|           | 175,409                  | 311,512              | (293,769)                              | 17,743                 |\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are only entered into with bank and financial institution counterparties with sound credit ratings.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe cash and cash equivalents are held with bank and financial institution counterparties with sound credit ratings.\n\nImpairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures.  The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties.  The amount of the allowance on cash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 was negligible.\n\n## (ii) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.  The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nThe Group monitors its liquidity risk and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents and credit facilities deemed adequate by management to finance the Group's operations and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.",

The cash inflows/(outflows) disclosed represent the contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to derivative financial instruments held for risk management purposes and which are usually not closed out prior to contractual maturity.  The disclosure shows net cash flow amounts for derivatives that are net cash-settled and gross cash inflow and outflow amounts for derivatives that have simultaneous gross cash settlement e.g. forward exchange contracts.  Net-settled derivative financial assets are included in the maturity analyses as they are held to hedge the cash flow variability of the Group's floating rate loans.\n\nThe interest payments on variable interest rate loans and bonds and notes in the table above reflect market forward interest rates at the period end and these amounts may change as market interest rates changes.  It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts.",

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposure within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its interest-bearing financial assets and debt obligations.  The Group adopts a policy of managing its interest rate exposure by maintaining a debt portfolio with both fixed and floating interest rates.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost of variable rate borrowings is considered to outweigh the benefits of their flexibility, and the Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives.\n\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the reference interest rates, tenors, repricing dates and maturities and the notional or par amounts. If a hedging relationship is directly affected by uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform, then the Group applies Phase 1 amendments and assumes for this purpose that the benchmark interest rate is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nThe Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\nHedging relationships that are impacted by interest rate benchmark reform may experience ineffectiveness because of the uncertainty about when and how replacement may occur for the relevant hedged item and hedging instrument due to the interest rate benchmark reform transition.  For further details, see 'Managing interest rate benchmark reform and associated risks' below.\n\n## Managing interest rate benchmark reform and associated risks\n\n## Overview\n\nA fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as 'interest rate benchmark reform').  The Group had exposures to USD LIBOR and SGD SOR on its financial instruments that will be replaced or reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. These benchmark rates will lose representativeness or discontinue and be replaced with alternative interest rates benchmarks in US and Singapore with effect from 1 July 2023. In 2022, the Group has undertaken amendments to its financial instruments with contractual terms indexed to USD LIBOR or SGD SOR such that they incorporate the new benchmark rates. As at 31 December 2022, the Group's remaining IBOR exposure is indexed to USD LIBOR and SGD SOR.\n\nManagement monitors and manages the Group's transition to alternative rates.  Management evaluates the extent to which contracts reference IBOR cash flows, whether such contracts will need to be amended as a result of interest rate benchmark reform and how to manage communication about interest rate benchmark reform with counterparties.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 42 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT'D)\n\n## (iii) Market risk (cont'd)\n\n## Non-derivative financial liabilities\n\nThe Group's IBOR exposures to non-derivative financial liabilities as at 31 December 2022 were secured and unsecured borrowings indexed to USD LIBOR and SGD SOR.  The Group is in the process of communicating with counterparties to progressively transition non-derivative financial liabilities which are indexed to the affected interest rate benchmarks to alternative risk-free rates.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Group holds interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps for risk management purposes.  As at 31 December 2022, the Group has no unreformed interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps contracts.\n\n## Total amounts of unreformed contracts, including those with an appropriate fallback clause\n\nThe Group monitors the progress of transition from IBORs to new benchmark rates by reviewing the total amounts of contracts that have yet to transition to an alternative benchmark rate and the amounts of such contracts that include an appropriate fallback clause.  The Group considers that a contract is not yet transitioned to an alternative benchmark rate when interest under the contract is indexed to a benchmark rate that is still subject to interest rate benchmark reform, even if it includes a fallback clause that deals with the cessation of the existing IBOR (referred to as an 'unreformed contract').\n\nThe following table shows the total amounts of unreformed contracts and those with appropriate fallback language at 31 December 2022.  The amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities are shown at their carrying amounts and derivatives are shown at their nominal amounts.",

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant and does not take into account the effect of qualifying borrowing costs allowed for capitalisation.\n\n|                                           | Group       | Group       | Company           | Company           |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                           | 31 December | 31 December | 31 December  2022 | 31 December  2021 |\n|                                           | 2022        | 2021        |                   |                   |\n|                                           | $'000       | $'000       | $'000             | $'000             |\n| 100 bp increase                           |             |             |                   |                   |\n| (Reduction)/Increase in profit before tax | (48,872)    | (59,458)    | (19,778)          | (7,328)           |\n\n- A 100bp decrease in interest rates at the reporting date would have had an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of the Group's entities.  The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the United States Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Australian Dollar, Sterling Pound, Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Euro, Thai Baht and New Zealand Dollar.\n\nThe Group has a decentralised approach to the management of foreign currency risk.  The Group manages its foreign currency exposure by adopting a natural hedge policy of matching receipts and payments, and asset purchases and borrowings, in the currency of the relevant entity, where possible. Entities in the Group may have different approaches to the identification and management of this risk. Entities in the Group may borrow in currencies other than their functional currencies to fund investments that are denominated in their borrowing currencies.  In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group's policy is to ensure that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.  Where feasible, the Group may put in place certain financial derivative instruments including forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to minimise the Group's exposure to movements in exchange rates on firm commitments and specific transactions.\n\nThe Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\nIn these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are:\n\n- \u00b7 The effect of the counterparty and the Group's own credit risk on the fair value of the swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, which is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in exchange rates; and\n- \u00b7 Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions.",

The risk arises from the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsidiaries and the Company's functional currency, which causes the amount of the net investments to vary in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.  The hedged risk in the net investment hedges is the risk of a weakening of the United States Dollar, Euro, Renminbi, Japanese Yen and Sterling Pound against Singapore Dollar that will result in a reduction in the carrying amount of the Group's net investments in subsidiaries.  An economic relationship exists between the hedged net investment and hedging instrument due to the shared foreign currency risk exposure.",

When the hedging instrument is foreign currency-denominated debt, the Group assesses effectiveness by comparing past changes in the carrying amount of the debt that are attributable to a change in the spot rate with past changes in the investment in the foreign operation due to movement in spot rate (the offset method).  The Group's policy is to hedge the net investment only to the extent of the debt principal.  When the hedging instrument is a forward exchange contract or cross-currency swap, the Group establishes a hedge ratio where the notional on the forward foreign exchange contract and cross-currency swap matches the carrying amount of the designated net investment.  The Group ensures that the foreign currency in which the hedging instrument is denominated is the same as the functional currency of the net investment. This qualitative assessment is supplemented quantitatively using the hypothetical derivative method for the purposes of assessing hedge effectiveness.  The Group assesses effectiveness by comparing past changes in the fair value of the derivative with changes in the fair value of a hypothetical derivative.  The hypothetical derivative is constructed to have the same critical terms as the net investment designated as the hedged item and a fair value of zero at inception.

The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group's reportable segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Property development - develops and purchases properties for sale\n- \u00b7 Hotel operations - owns and manages hotels\n- \u00b7 Investment properties develops and purchases investment properties for lease\n\nOthers comprises mainly investment in shares, management and consultancy services, and provision of laundry services. None of these segments meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in 2022 and 2021.\n\nInformation regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below.  Performance is measured based on segment profit before tax, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\n\n## Information about reportable segments\n\n|                                   | Property  development $'000   | Hotel  operations $'000   | Investment properties $'000   | Total $'000   | Others $'000   | Total $'000   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|\n| 2022                              |                               |                           |                               |               |                |               |\n| Total revenue (including          |                               |                           |                               |               |                |               |\n| inter-segment revenue)            | 1,382,322                     | 1,394,936                 | 375,991                       | 3,153,249     | 221,788        | 3,375,037     |\n| Inter-segment revenue             | -                             | (14,272)                  | (34,828)                      | (49,100)      | (32,524)       | (81,624)      |\n| External revenue                  | 1,382,322                     | 1,380,664^                | 341,163                       | 3,104,149     | 189,264        | 3,293,413     |\n| Profit from operating  activities | 119,685                       | 1,406,099                 | 430,354                       | 1,956,138     | (76,409)       | 1,879,729     |\n| Share of after-tax profit/        |                               |                           |                               |               |                |               |\n| (loss) of associates and          |                               |                           |                               |               |                |               |\n| joint ventures                    | 121,132                       | (1,340)                   | 20,235                        | 140,027       | 30,137         | 170,164       |\n| Finance income                    | 19,636                        | 61,434                    | 2,869                         | 83,939        | 7,615          | 91,554        |\n| Finance costs                     | (99,154)                      | (82,972)                  | (69,908)                      | (252,034)     | (32,646)       | (284,680)     |\n| Net finance costs                 | (79,518)                      | (21,538)                  | (67,039)                      | (168,095)     | (25,031)       | (193,126)     |\n| Reportable segment                |                               |                           |                               |               |                |               |\n| profit/(loss) before tax          | 161,299                       | 1,383,221                 | 383,550                       | 1,928,070     | (71,303)       | 1,856,767     |\n| Depreciation and                  |                               |                           |                               |               |                |               |\n| amortisation                      | 3,551                         | 120,598                   | 125,218                       | 249,367       | 27,059         | 276,426       |",

Please refer to note (a) under note 45 of the financial statements.\n- (b) Phuket Square Co., Ltd and Krungthep Rimnam Limited are considered subsidiaries of the Group as the Group is exposed to variable returns from the companies and has the ability to affect those returns through the management's control over the relevant activities of the companies.\n- (c) CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT) is a stapled group comprising CDL Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust (H-REIT), a real estate investment trust, and CDL Hospitality Business Trust (HBT), a business trust. H-REIT has an investment strategy of investing directly or indirectly, in a diversified portfolio of income-producing real estate which is primarily used for hospitality, hospitality-related and other accommodation and/or lodging purposes, whether wholly or partially, and real-estate related assets in relation to the foregoing.\n- HBT is a business trust which currently acts as master lessee, asset owner and hotel operator.  HBT may also undertake certain hospitality, hospitalityrelated and other accommodation and/or lodging development projects, acquisition and investments which may not be suitable for H-REIT.\n\nPrior to 26 May 2022, although the Group owned less than half of the ownership interest and voting power in CDLHT, management had determined that the Group had control over CDLHT. The activities of H-REIT and HBT are managed by the Group's subsidiaries, M&C REIT Management Limited (the 'H-REIT Manager') and M&C Business Trust Management Limited (the 'HBT Trustee-Manager'), respectively.  The H-REIT Manager has decision-making authority over H-REIT, subject to oversight by the trustee of H-REIT.  The HBT Trustee-Manager has dual responsibility of safeguarding the interests of the HBT unitholders and decision-making authority over HBT. The Group's overall exposure to variable returns, both from H-REIT Manager's and HBT Trustee-Manager's remuneration from H-REIT and HBT, respectively, together with its interest in CDLHT, was significant and any decisions made by H-REIT Manager and HBT Trustee-Manager affect the Group's overall exposure.\n\nOn 26 May 2022, the Group distributed in specie part of the CDLHT units that it held, to the Company's ordinary shareholders (notes 36 and 40), thereby reducing its interest in CDLHT to 27% (note 45). The Group has assessed that the reduction in interest in CDLHT has resulted in the Group no longer having control of CDLHT. Accordingly, CDLHT was deconsolidated and accounted for as an associate thereafter.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 45 ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES\n\nThe following are the Group's significant investments in associates and joint ventures:\n\n|     |                                                                | Principal activity                                                  | Principal place  of business/  Country of  incorporation   | Ownership interest                                  | Ownership interest   |\n|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n|     |                                                                |                                                                     |                                                            | 2022 %                                              | 2021 %               |\n|     | Associates of the Company                                      |                                                                     |                                                            |                                                     |                      |\n| (1) | Cityview Place Holdings Pte.

Ltd. (Cityview), the Group has determined that it does not have control over Cityview upon the sale of cash flows in Cityview in 2014 as described below.  The Group has significant influence in Cityview through Sunbright Holdings Limited (Sunbright).  Accordingly, Cityview is classified as an associate of the Group.\n- On 15 December 2014, Baynes Investment Pte. Ltd. (Baynes), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, sold the Dividends (as defined in the sale and\n- i. Sale and purchase agreement purchase agreement) in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cityview, to Sunbright.\n- ii. Profit participation securities\n- On 22 December 2014, the Group through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Astoria Holdings Limited (Astoria), subscribed for 37.5% interest in a capital instrument called profit participation securities (PPS) issued by Sunbright.  The PPS has a tenor of 5 years and will expire upon final payment of the cash flows arising from the Dividends.  The PPS carries a fixed payout amount (the Fixed Payout) at the rate of 5% per annum, which is payable on a semi-annual basis or, at the election of the PPS holders, payable upfront in one lump sum on the date of issue of the PPS.\n- Astoria, together with other investors (the Third Party Investors), (collectively, the PPS Holders), elected to receive the Fixed Payout upfront and the total Fixed Payout of $187.5 million was offset against the consideration payable by the PPS holders for the subscription of the PPS.\n\nThe Group will receive from Sunbright the cash flows purchased from Baynes (after satisfying certain senior ranking liabilities, including capital\n\ncontributions from the Third Party Investors) in accordance with a pre-agreed order of priority as set out under the terms of the PPS.\n\nIn addition, shares of Baynes with an investment amount of $1,502,000 (2021: $1,502,000) was pledged to Sunbright.\n\n- iii. Investment Committees On 22 December 2014, the Group entered into an Investors' Agreement with the Third Party Investors and Sunbright. Under the Investors' Agreement, the management of the affairs of Sunbright and its subsidiaries are delegated to the Investment Committees where the Group has the right to appoint 5 out of 12 members.  Taken as a whole, the Group does not have power over the relevant activities of Cityview. The Group has determined that it has significant influence over Sunbright because of its representation on the Investment Committees.  Accordingly, Sunbright is considered an associate of the Group. In April 2019, the Group, through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Astoria, acquired the remaining PPS units in the non-residential component of Sunbright, which holds W Hotel and Quayside Isle (Non-Residential Component).  Following the acquisition, the Group has power over the relevant activities of the Non-Residential Component, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group.\n- (b) Although the Group holds more than 50% ownership interest in the investee, pursuant to a contractual agreement between the Group and its joint venture partner, joint control is exercised by both parties over the relevant activities of the investee. Accordingly, the investee is accounted for as a joint venture of the Group.\n- (c) Although the Group holds less than 50% voting interest in the IREIT Global Group Pte. Ltd. (the 'IREIT Manager'), pursuant to a contractual agreement between the Group and its joint venture partner in the IREIT Manager, joint control is exercised by both parties over the relevant activities of the IREIT Manager.  Accordingly, the IREIT Manager is accounted for as a joint venture of the Group.\n\nThe Group does not consider the above associates and joint ventures to be individually material to the Group under the context of SFRS(I) 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities .\n\nIslands\n\n50\n\n50",

The acquisition was funded through internal cash resources and credit facilities.\n\nOn 22 March 2023, the Group, through its subsidiaries of M&C Group, entered into a property sale agreement and business asset sale agreement with a third party to acquire a hotel in Brisbane, Australia, together with its existing business assets for a combined consideration of approximately $159.2 million (A$177.7 million). The completion of the acquisition, which is subject to fulfilment of several condition precedents as stipulated in the agreements, is expected in the second half of 2023. The acquisition will be funded through internal cash resources and credit faciliities.\n\n## 47 COMPARATIVE INFORMATION\n\nIn June 2021, the Group applied for an initial public offering (IPO) of a real estate investment trust (REIT) that would own commercial assets located in the UK and planned to dispose of the subsidiaries which hold two commercial properties in the UK, namely Aldgate House and 125 Old Broad Street (which are in the investment properties segment), to the proposed REIT. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries were reclassified to assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with the assets held for sale, in 2021.\n\nDuring 2022, the Group considered the unprecedented interest rates hike has severely impacted the IPO of REITs in Singapore with several planned IPO and secondary fund-raising exercises of REITs being withdrawn. Amidst this challenging market, the Group decided not to proceed with the planned REIT IPO. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries ceased to be classified as held for sale, and the Group reclassified the assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with the assets to the Group's respective assets and liabilities.  Arising from the reclassification, the Group recognised a depreciation expense of $7,464,000 on the two investment properties and recognised an impairment loss of $5,480,000 on one of the commercial properties for the year ended 31 December 2021. The impairment loss was determined based on the recoverable amount of the commercial property which was estimated using the fair value less cost to sell approach and applying the income capitalisation method.  Under this methodology, the fair value measurement reflects current market expectations about an efficient third party operator's future cash flows. The income capitalisation method capitalises an income stream into a present value using revenue multipliers or single-year capitalisation rates. The key assumption used in estimating the recoverable amount of the impaired investment property was the capitalisation rate of 5.0%. The impairment loss arose as the recoverable amount was reduced by the amount of stamp duty and land tax payable by the Group, which would not be payable had the Group proceeded with the sale.\n\nThe fair value disclosure of two investment properties above as at 31 December 2021 of $1,021,363,000 is categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation techniques used.\n\nIn accordance with SFRS(I) 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations , the comparative figures have been restated to account for the effects of these reclassifications within the Group's statement of financial position and adjustments within the Group's consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 47 COMPARATIVE INFORMATION (CONT'D)\n\n## Summary of quantitative impact\n\nThe  following  tables  summarise  the  material  impacts  on  the  Group's  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n|                                                               | Group                        | Group             | Group             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                               | As previously reported $'000 | Adjustments $'000 | As restated $'000 |\n| Statement of financial position                               |                              |                   |                   |\n| 31 December 2021                                              |                              |                   |                   |\n| Investment properties                                         | 3,997,169                    | 985,677           | 4,982,846         |\n| Trade and other receivables                                   | 1,851,903                    | 41,064            | 1,892,967         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                     | 2,083,165                    | 17,535            | 2,100,700         |\n| Assets held for sale                                          | 1,445,759                    | (1,057,033)       | 388,726           |\n| Others                                                        | 14,515,030                   | -
