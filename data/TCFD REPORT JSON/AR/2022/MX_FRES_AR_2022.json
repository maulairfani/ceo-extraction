        "page_content": "In common with organisations across the world, this was a challenging year for Fresnillo that saw us battle against a number of factors that were to a large extent beyond our immediate control, including high volatility in metals prices and inflationary pressures, among others. While some of these challenges were global in nature, others were more specifically related to the mining sector in Mexico.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Fresnillo plc's operational performance was in line with our expectations. As our Chief Executive reports in his statement, we have made steady progress during the year. Thanks to the support and engagement of all our stakeholders, we are a resilient and responsible business, and we are committed to delivering returns to shareholders while also laying foundations for future prosperity.\n\n## Reaching our targets\n\nSilver production was broadly stable on the previous year while gold was down, both in line with our guidance.\n\nWe achieved US$2,597.2 million in adjusted revenue during the year. This represented a decrease of 8.8%, primarily due to the decrease in the volume of gold produced and lower prices for silver. Gross profit decreased year-on-year by 42.8% to US$536.0 million, primarily driven by the decrease in the volume of gold sold, lower silver prices, the adverse effect of cost inflation, and the increased consumption of operating materials, maintenance and contractors, which significantly impacted cost of sales. Cash and other liquid funds decreased from US$1,235.3 million to US$969.1 million as the use of funds, primarily the investment in capital expenditure and dividend payments, was higher than the cash generated by the mines. Please see pages 52-61 for further details on our financial performance.\n\nWe recognise that we live in uncertain times and will always approach each challenge with an open mind, tailoring our response to meet the circumstances we encounter - always with optimal outcomes for our stakeholders at the forefront of our minds. However, in one key aspect of our business we remain steadfastly constant: we will never forsake long-term prosperity for short-term gain. Our strategy is well established, and our dividend policy remains unchanged. We aim to pay out 33-50% of profit after tax each year, while making certain adjustments to exclude non-cash effects in the income statement. Dividends are paid in the approximate ratio of one-third as an interim dividend and two-thirds as a final dividend. Before declaring a dividend, the Board carries out a detailed analysis of the profitability of the business, underlying earnings, capital requirements and cash flow. Our goal is to\n\nmaintain enough flexibility to be able to react to movements in precious metals prices and seize attractive business opportunities.\n\nFor 2022, we declared an interim dividend of 3.40 US cents per share, with a final dividend of 13.30 US cents per share, bringing the total for the year to 16.70 US cents per share.\n\n## Navigating global challenges\u2026\n\nIn terms of the macro challenges that faced so many businesses during 2022, we continued to be impacted by Covid-19 with a fourth and then a fifth wave reaching Mexico. Although absenteeism understandably rose for a period, the impact on our operations was limited. Guided by our Purpose - to contribute to the wellbeing of people through the sustainable mining of silver and gold - we continued to protect the health and safety of our teams. We worked with the authorities to implement strict protocols to help prevent the spread of the virus and facilitated vaccinations for our people and their communities. These measures are now permanent features of our operations. At the year end, the vast majority of our workforce had been fully vaccinated with two doses and almost half had received their booster.\n\nCovid-19 and commercial tensions between the US and China meant that we also faced supply chain issues during the year, and these affected the timely delivery of equipment and spare parts. In addition, we saw inflation begin to impact the business, with increases in operating materials, contractor costs and other inputs, especially in the second half of the year.\n\n## \u2026as well as those closer to home\n\nTurning to the mining industry in Mexico, a number of specific challenges have placed additional stresses on our Group in recent times.\n\nAdjusted revenue\n\n## US$ 2,597.2 m\n\nGross profit\n\n## US$ 536.0 m\n\nwhich our management teams have been implementing have borne fruit, and all our mines are now either fully staffed or very close to it.\n\nSecondly, we experienced significant delays in completing the tie-ins to the national power grid for both our new mine at Juanicipio and the new Pyrites Plant at the Fresnillo mine. Both these development projects were expected to be operational early in 2022, bringing valuable income and jobs to local communities. However, additional requirements and cautionary measures from the authorities meant that Juanicipio was not able to commence operations until the first quarter in 2023, with the start up of operations at the Pyrites Plant now expected to follow in the second quarter of the year.\n\nWith similar results, we have also continued to be impacted by delays to permitting processes, which have increased in both complexity and timescale. Our exploration teams work hard to identify potentially profitable mines that are therefore able, in turn, to bring prosperity to local communities, including many in poor and remote regions, and unforeseen delays in obtaining permits can have a negative knock-on effect.\n\nFirstly, the new labour legislation - which restricts our ability to subcontract labour - continued to disrupt our activities, although not to the same extent as in the prior year. This legislation created great pressure on our workforce, which had historically comprised a high percentage of contractor personnel, and meant that we had to adjust our business model and recruit more people into our in-house workforce, especially difficult in a hot labour market. The recruitment initiatives",

However, we have been frustrated in some of our attempts to play our part in mitigating climate change. Our goal is for wind power to provide 75% of our electricity by 2030, but our ability to reach that target requires the support of Mexico's energy policy. Furthermore, although we have now completed our investment in the facilities to enable our Herradura haulage fleet to run on dual fuel (diesel and LNG) engines, which will further cut our carbon emissions, approval from the authorities to use certain infrastructure was delayed but has now been approved.\n\nWhat these issues demonstrate is that a closer and more proactive working relationship with the Government in Mexico and its various departments - and their equivalents in Peru and Chile - would bring great benefits to all parties involved. I know that we are all striving to achieve the same things for our country: strong growth, economic stability, high quality jobs and support for local communities. During the coming months we will redouble our efforts to engage with governments and other authorities in a spirit of trust and mutual respect in order to help identify a smooth path ahead that achieves all our diverse objectives.\n\n## Board activities\n\nThe Board met regularly throughout the year and discussed a range of matters, including the ongoing impacts of the labour reform, Covid-19, inflation and supply chain issues. A significant degree of Board focus was directed towards the delays in commissioning experienced at Juanicipio. This new mine will be an important asset for Fresnillo in the years to come and it was very pleasing to see the efforts of the entire Fresnillo team eventually rewarded when the tie-in to the grid was finally approved in December 2022.\n\nThe Board also conducted strategy discussions on the direction of the Company as well as on both the Diversity Programme and the Sustainability Strategy. As we report in more detail on page 77, in 2022 the Group successfully increased the participation of women in the workforce, in line with our Purpose and our values. We regard the increasing participation and inclusion of women as the first step in our journey to making diversity a competitive advantage. The 'Women for Women Mentoring Programme' is now in place, and we are actively developing leadership and support networks. One of the programme's key outcomes will be the appointment of more women to superintendent positions across our operations.\n\nOnce again, our Purpose will be the corporate and ethical compass that directs all our actions.'",

Please see pages 85-101 for more details. Although it was disappointing that Fresnillo was excluded from the FTSE4Good Index in 2022, we remain totally committed to decreasing carbon emissions and setting science-based targets in the future, subject to Mexican energy policy. The steps we are taking require heavy investment and time to yield results - but we are confident that we are heading in the right direction and will look to return to the FTSE4Good Index as soon as that is possible.\n\nFollowing last year's Board Evaluation Review, the Board introduced an additional working session which specifically focused on the Company's Risk Framework - including assessment processes, appetite and tolerance - as well as the long-term Strategic Plan covering the years to 2037.\n\nFor further details of the Board's activities, please see my introduction to the Governance Report on pages 158-159.\n\n## Board changes\n\nThere were no changes to the Board this year, with all of the Directors being re-elected at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Outlook\n\nOnce again, our Purpose will be the corporate and ethical compass that directs all our actions and ensures that we contribute to the wellbeing of all our stakeholders - shareholders and our people as well as local communities, the environment and society at large.\n\nWhile challenges will remain and global macro issues such as probable economic recession will continue to play a major role in our financial performance and bring with them a degree of uncertainty, I am confident that we will maintain the steady progress of the last 12 months. We have managed the fallout from the labour reform well and, although nothing is certain, Covid-19 appears finally to be in retreat across the world. Our new mine at Juanicipio is set to make an important contribution to silver production in the months and years ahead and we expect a number of other exciting projects to progress through our pipeline and become productive operations.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to place on record our gratitude to all those who have helped shape what has ultimately been a year of progress - our management teams, our workforce and their communities, and the many suppliers and partners who work so hard to support us. By continuing to work together, we will be able to look ahead to future growth and prosperity, investing in Mexico, Per\u00fa and Chile and their people to deliver on the huge potential that Fresnillo and these countries offer.\n\n## Alejandro Baill\u00e8res\n\nChairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

During the year, we held our first CRIL forum and continued to develop the ethical decision-making competencies of our people. We tracked progress through a survey that identified where we are performing well and, just as important, where we can do better.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, please see Doing business ethically and responsibly on pages 68-72.\n\n## Community relations\n\nWe engage meaningfully with our communities and support the issues that matter to them. As well as creating value through employment, procurement, talent development and taxes, during 2022 we continued to invest in education, health, water and capacity building in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, we provided Covid-19 vaccination campaigns and also helped communities prepare for a safe return to school.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, please see Partnering with our communities on pages 110-119.\n\n## Climate change\n\nWe strive to curb our impacts and hold ourselves accountable for our environmental footprint. While progress towards our goal of supplying 75% of our electricity from renewable sources slowed due to government policies, we continued to advance key schemes such as ventilation on demand in our mines, dual fuel (diesel/LNG) engines in our haulage fleet, and our regional climate modelling project.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, please see Climate change on pages 85-101.\n\nSince 2019, from renewable sources averaged\n\nelectricity supplied c.47 %\n\n## Water stewardship\n\nMining can consume vast amounts of water, often in regions where water is scarce. Our stewardship strategy is based on four pillars: efficiency and reuse; pollution prevention; watershed and community engagement; and transparency and accountability. In 2022, we approved a project that will lead to us only using treated wastewater at our operations in the Fresnillo District - reducing our freshwater usage and cutting costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, please see Water stewardship on pages 106-107.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We continued to extend the 'I Care, We Care' programme during the year, verifying safety practices at five mines and establishing a dedicated committee to oversee uniform implementation across our operations. Although we were saddened to experience one fatality, we saw our overall performance improve and are 100% committed to further improvements in the coming years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, please see Safety on pages 79-82.\n\n## Comprehensive healthcare\n\nIn 2022, we launched a new strategy that is bringing together our programmes to ensure a more holistic approach that embraces emotional and intellectual support, as well as physical health. While we continued to ensure emergency preparedness, promote healthy habits, and the early detection and management of health risks, we also focused on psychological care and nutritional support, among other initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, please see Comprehensive healthcare on pages 83-84.\n\n## Training and development\n\nWe aim to attract and retain top talent by providing long-term career growth opportunities, training and mentorship programmes. During the year, we continued to deliver technical training on day-to-day mining operations, together with managerial programmes focusing on technical and administrative competencies, including components of soft skills and leadership. We also advanced our programme to prevent harassment, bribery and fraud.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, please see Training and development on page 75.\n\n## Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)\n\nWe want Fresnillo to be an inclusive workplace where all employees feel respected and have equal access to opportunities. The last 12 months saw us achieve the target of our workforce comprising 12% women, and also increased female participation in managerial roles. Among other initiatives, we published a new Labour Equity and Non-Discrimination Policy and established a committee to determine and oversee our DEI strategy.\n\nFor more information, please see Diversity, equity and inclusion on pages 77-78.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more in Sustainability at the core of our Purpose on pages 64-119.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Improved operational execution and a new pumping station helped us to regain access to several areas of the mine during the year, driving an 11.1% increase in ore processed. At the nearby Saucito mine, the installation of new geomechanical monitoring equipment and improved planning enabled us to access higher ore grade areas and achieve a 9.8% increase in silver ore grades.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, please see Operations on pages 36-39.\n\n## Enabling start-up of production at Juanicipio\n\nWith an anticipated average annual production of 11.7 moz of silver and 43.5 koz of gold over the life of the mine, Juanicipio is now taking its place as a key asset in our portfolio. Following a thorough process and collaboration with the electricity regulators, the flotation plant was successfully tied-in to the national grid towards the end of 2022.

        "page_content": "The Fresnillo Purpose was pivotal in our response to the challenges we faced during the year. Our relentless focus on the wellbeing of people touches every aspect of how we operate, from protecting the health and safety of the teams working in our mines, to how we minimise our impact on the environment, engage with stakeholders and negotiate with communities for access to land for exploration activities.\n\nIn particular, our Purpose guided all our efforts to address the impact of the recent labour reform and the Covid-19 pandemic. Our approach towards our people sits at the heart of what makes Fresnillo a responsible business and an employer of choice - and we worked hard to give our teams the help and support they and their communities needed.\n\nIn 2022, this support again included the provision of vaccinations and healthcare, educational opportunities and jobs, as well as comprehensive induction programmes and attractive benefits packages to help employees make the transition from being contractors to being part of our unionised workforce, in line with new requirements necessitated by the labour reform.\n\n## Production highlights and price review\n\nSilver production was broadly comparable to last year, while gold production reduced. Both of these results were as expected and in line with our guidance.\n\nTotal silver production was stable at 53.7 moz (53.1 moz in 2021), with increased contribution from Juanicipio and continued improvement in volumes processed at Fresnillo partially offset by the lower ore throughput and expected grade variability at San Juli\u00e1n Disseminated Ore Body (DOB).\n\nAs anticipated, gold production decreased by 15.3% to 635.9 koz. This was primarily due to a decrease in the recovery rate and lower ore grade at Herradura, the expected decrease in production at Noche Buena as the mine approaches the end of its life, and a lower volume of ore processed and ore grade at Saucito and Ci\u00e9nega.\n\nAttributable by-product lead production decreased 6.4% to 52,950 tonnes primarily due to a decrease in volume of ore processed and lower ore grade at Saucito and decreased ore grade at San Juli\u00e1n (DOB). Attributable by-product zinc production remained broadly stable at 99,153 tonnes.\n\nYou can find more details on production at each of our mines on pages 36-51.\n\nThe gradual reduction in precious metals prices that characterised the second half of 2021 was briefly reversed in the first quarter of the year, as geopolitical tensions in Russia and Ukraine temporarily drove up prices. However, with central banks continuing to increase interest rates to control inflation and the US dollar becoming stronger, precious metals prices again embarked on a downward trend for most of the rest of the year, as investors sought returns elsewhere. Over the course of 2022, the average realised silver price was US$21.7 per ounce, a decrease of 12.76%, while the gold price remained flat at US$1,799.3 per ounce. The average price for zinc increased by 15.9%, whereas that for lead decreased by 3.7%.\n\nBarring more uncertainty impacting confidence, I believe precious metals prices have now established a realistic floor and the coming months are likely to see prices react positively. Please see pages 22-23 for more details on prices and how they have been influenced by market dynamics.\n\n## Consistent and resilient strategy\n\nSince our IPO in 2008, Fresnillo has remained true to the same strategy. Based on four strategic pillars and now proven across more than a decade, this strategy has steered our Company through good times as well as more challenging conditions. Below, I report on how we have performed against each of the pillars.\n\n## Maximising the potential of existing operations\n\nThe availability of a trained, experienced workforce continued to challenge our production ambitions during 2022, although our efforts to mitigate its impact have proved increasingly successful.\n\nFollowing the new labour reform introduced by the Mexican Government in 2021, which restricted our ability to use contractors, we have worked hard to recruit, train and retain employees in our in-house workforce. We have achieved almost all of the goals we identified at the start of the year and all our operations now benefit from a stable workforce. By the year end, we had completed the staffing process in the Fresnillo District, San Juli\u00e1n and Ci\u00e9nega. Overall, our mines are now being worked by close to a full complement of unionised teams.\n\nThe restrictions on outsourcing also continued to reduce the availability of equipment, some of which had historically been provided by contractors. In response, we rapidly invested in significant amounts of new equipment, but unfortunately some of these orders have been affected by global supply chain bottlenecks and the subsequent delays in deliveries have impacted production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Did you know?\n\n## Supporting the switch to clean energy\n\nWith its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, silver is a vital component in both solar photovoltaics and electric vehicles - two of the key clean energy technologies that are helping the human race mitigate climate change. Solar manufacturing already accounts for 20% of the world's silver consumption, while the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to hybrids, battery electric vehicles and, eventually, autonomous vehicles, will drive an ever-increasing demand for silver.\n\nUltimately, and despite the short-term challenges it has brought, the switch from relying on contractors and their equipment to working with our own people and resources will be positive. It will give us greater stability and control over our operations and help us to build a more aligned culture and resilient business.\n\nAlthough we will always be vigilant and carefully monitor any outbreaks, no matter how minor, the Covid-19 pandemic appears to be increasingly under control. We experienced a fourth and then a fifth wave during 2022, but supported by our Purpose we were able to keep absenteeism and illness to a minimum and production at our mines was largely unaffected. We continue to follow strict protocols, as advised by the authorities, and have encouraged and supported vaccination of our workforce and communities, collaborating with health authorities to make vaccines available in the remote locations where we operate. Close to 81% of our workforce have been fully vaccinated with two doses, and 41% have received the booster. We will continue to implement testing campaigns across our operations, development and exploration projects, and corporate offices.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAlongside our work to manage Covid-19 and the fallout from the labour reform, our investments in infrastructure have also helped us to maximise the potential of our existing operations. For example, we are set to enjoy the benefits of the deepened San Carlos shaft at our Fresnillo mine. When complete, the shaft will provide easier and faster access to more than half of the mine's reserves reducing haulage times and costs, and resulting in lower emissions due to fewer trucks working in the mine. The new pumping station commissioned at the beginning of the year at Fresnillo enabled us to increase pumping capacity and ensured access to development and production areas.\n\n## Delivering growth through development projects\n\nEverybody associated with Fresnillo was delighted to see our new mine at Juanicipio finally tied-in to the national power grid in December 2022. Although the mine was completed on target in late 2021, we experienced delays due to additional testing requirements by the Centro Nacional de Control de Energ\u00eda (CENACE). Safety is of course always our top priority, and while the delays were unexpected, we fully support the prudent approach taken by the electricity regulator.\n\nCommissioning began immediately after the tie-in and Juanicipio will make a material contribution to our performance from 2023 onwards. We expect silver and gold production to reach annual averages of 11.7 moz and 43.5 koz respectively. During 2022, ore from Juanicipio continued to be processed through the Fresnillo and Saucito flotation plants.\n\nWe also experienced delays in the tie-in to the grid at Phase II of the Pyrites Plant at Fresnillo. As we prioritised the process at Juanicipio, the timetable for the tie-in of the Pyrites Plant was extended by a\n\nfew weeks. We currently expect operations to commence in the second quarter of 2023 and anticipate that the plant will produce an average of 3.5 moz of silver and 14 koz of gold per year, including production from Saucito.\n\nThe potential project to install vibrating screens to improve milling capacity at the Fresnillo mine remains under consideration. The new flotation circuit is already improving the recovery of lead and zinc from the lower levels at Fresnillo, and we will re-evaluate the merits of the vibrating screens once production at the mine reaches at least 8,000 tonnes per day.\n\n## Extending the growth pipeline\n\nAs the successful development of Juanicipio demonstrates, our exploration teams have a track record of strengthening our asset portfolio across the price cycles of precious metals. While the exploration budget for 2022 was reduced marginally from the previous year in response to compressed margins and the labour reform challenges, we nevertheless continued to make good progress on advanced and priority earlystage projects in Mexico, Peru and Chile. In total, we drilled 955,798 metres across the portfolio with our teams of geologists carrying out an intensive field-based programme at several promising prospective sites.\n\nAt Rodeo, we continued negotiations to acquire the right to access land, and we hope to conclude these by mid-year. We successfully negotiated rights for 2.8 million cubic metres of water and are now developing a scoping study. Located in the state of Durango, this gold-silver project has inferred resources amounting to 1.3 moz of gold and 13.8 moz of silver as well as potential for further growth.\n\nThe gold project at Orisyvo continued advancing and several activities are progressing even faster than at Rodeo, with some development works expected to start in 2023. We concluded negotiations regarding land access for the construction of the tailings dam, water dam and industrial area in 2022, and will initially fund developments via risk capex as the pre-feasibility and feasibility stages continue. We carried out a 2,049-metre drilling programme during the year and are currently preparing the geotechnical model. We also continued exploration activities at the silver-gold Guanajuato project, drilling a total of over 66,000 metres with encouraging results.\n\nIn Peru, we are looking forward to drilling commencing at the Pilarica silver and the Supaypacha gold-copper projects, following delays caused by challenges with land access, and we anticipate posting resources at Capricornio in Chile during 2023.\n\nSilver resources decreased 5.0% to 2,203.9 moz primarily due to mining depletion, higher costs and cut-off grades and a more conservative approach to resource estimation in Fresnillo, Saucito and Ci\u00e9nega, balanced in part by positive exploration results at the Guanajuato exploration project; gold resources remained stable at 39.1 moz. Silver reserves decreased 5.6% to 396.1 moz mainly from mining depletion and higher costs and cut-off grades at Fresnillo and Saucito, and depletion at San Juli\u00e1n (DOB), partly offset by increased reserves from exploration at San Juli\u00e1n veins. Gold reserves increased 4.4% to 8.2 moz mostly as a result of resource model improvements at Herradura, balanced in part by mining depletion at Noche Buena.",

This ambition is supported by the comprehensive 'I Care, We Care' programme that focuses on leadership, accountability, safety culture, high potential incident management, engineering systems and lessons learnt. In 2022 we focused our efforts on implementing critical controls and visible leadership practices across our mining operations.\n\nOur core safety KPIs saw a slight reduction in incidents, continuing our long-term trend. The Total Recordable Frequency Rate improved from 10.4 injuries per one million hours worked to 10.3, with the Lost Time Injury Rate falling from 5.8 to 5.4. However, none of this success can overshadow the sadness and regret that we experienced at the loss of a colleague's life early in 2022, which was a sober reminder of the work ahead. We must never relax or become complacent as we pursue zero harm.\n\nDuring the last 12 months, we continued to implement best practice governance and engineering to manage our Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs). Our aim is to ensure that our standards match global best practice, and we are now moving from implementing short-term solutions that meet immediate needs to long-term answers that match the life of our mines and will protect the future safety of local communities. As this approach embraces the building of new and larger TSFs where appropriate, we recognise the requirement for higher capex although this will stabilise over time.\n\nReviews of our facilities by the Independent Tailings Review Panel have continued, with virtual and in-person site visits providing recommendations that guide our implementation plans. We are developing our Emergency and Response Plans and maturing our Tailings Management System, which includes a dashboard to monitor key indicators for every level of involvement and responsibility. Among the year's key achievements, the TSF at Juanicipio became\n\nour first facility to fully meet Canadian Dam Association (CDA), Mining Association of Canada (MAC), International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD) and International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) principles from the earliest days of its development, design and construction.\n\nWe continue to mature our capabilities to disclose climate-related financial information, joining the TCFD Consortium in Mexico during the year in order to share best practices and participating in the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) Lab Net-zero Disclosures research project. We launched a Climate Modelling project with the University of Arizona to generate future climate projections under different scenarios, and this will support the development of our adaptation strategy.\n\nHowever, it was disappointing that two of our key climate change mitigation initiatives failed to make the progress we had expected. The project to install dual fuel engines that run on both Liquid Natural Gas and diesel was completed as planned but start-up was delayed as we awaited official permits from the Government, which have since been received. Furthermore, our long-term goal for 75% of our electricity consumption to be provided by wind power by 2030 may be impacted by the Government's energy reforms. We are working with the authorities to gain clarity around this issue, which we believe can make important contributions to Mexico's drive to combat climate change.\n\nOur commitment to our Purpose underlines the importance of deeply integrating responsible business practices into our business model while understanding the factors that affect stakeholders at all critical decision-making levels. It was disappointing to be omitted from the FTSE4Good Index after being included in it for four successive years. However, we acknowledge that we need to move faster and go further in setting targets to reduce emissions at a time when expectations around this topic are increasing. We are redoubling our efforts to identify and assess decarbonisation pathways, whether through new technologies or energy efficiencies.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nGlobal macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that all businesses faced during 2022 are likely to continue impacting our prospects. Despite the best efforts of our partners, the commercial tensions between the US and China and postCovid issues will constrict supply chains and lead to delivery delays for mining equipment and spare parts. If major economies enter or remain in recession, then we expect to see a negative impact on demand. Meanwhile, although a slowdown in rising interest rates may lift prices for precious metals, inflationary pressures will continue affecting our costs.\n\nChallenges that are more native to Mexico such as delays in permits and the granting of concessions as well as political issues including energy reform - will also impact the business, and here I echo the thoughts of our Chairman. We will work with regional and national government departments, and with all relevant local authorities, to ease any bureaucratic delays that may prevent us making further good progress. Our Purpose is to support the wellbeing of people - and that includes bringing prosperity and valuable jobs to local communities, as well as paying our taxes to support the ambitions of the Government.\n\nOur business is rich with potential. We have stabilised operations at our existing mines and look forward to the Juanicipio mine increasing our total production in 2023 and beyond. At the same time, we expect to increase resources at several projects that are moving along our pipeline. Indeed, we anticipate some of these projects to make their way into our operational portfolio in the next two to three years.\n\nFinally, I wish to thank the Board and our people for their continued support during 2022. I believe we have worked together well and made good progress in what have at times been challenging circumstances. While some of those challenges will continue, we are committed to working through them and to fulfil the potential of our portfolio and pipeline. Our prospects are bright.\n\n## Octavio Alv\u00eddrez\n\nChief Executive Officer",

Key trends shaping our industry include:\n\n## Price volatility\n\nTop-line performance is driven by precious metals prices, which reflect supply and demand dynamics that arise from the industry's production capacity and market sentiment. Market sentiment has become significantly less predictable recently in response to geopolitical tensions, tightening central bank monetary policy and macroeconomic variables.\n\n## Energy transition\n\nMetals are essential components in many clean energy technologies and the transition to a net-zero economy will be metal intensive. Demand for these materials is forecast to increase rapidly and the mining industry will need to increase production to maintain adequate supply.\n\n## Gold\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gold as a safe haven\n\n## Opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 Increased market volatility and uncertainty due to ongoing geopolitical tensions.\n- \u00b7 Central banks' holdings and purchases.\n- \u00b7 Portfolio diversifier and risk hedge.\n- \u00b7 Increased demand from growing social economic development in emerging markets.\n\n## Threats\n\n- \u00b7 Competition from other assets that provide income (interest, dividends).\n- \u00b7 Emerging alternatives perceived as solid investments.\n- \u00b7 Storage and insurance costs.\n\n## Cost inflation\n\nThe rise in consumer demand and supply chain constraints due to the pandemic, along with increasing energy and food costs following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, have caused inflation to rise to levels not seen in decades in many countries. This in turn has driven up labour costs, energy prices and the cost of equipment for the mining industry.\n\n## Labour shortages\n\nThe mining sector has been facing a tight labour market, competing with other industries to attract and retain talent. This is particularly true for the skilled workforce and employees with technological backgrounds that are required to drive automation and evolution within the industry, given the nearshoring trends in Mexico.\n\n## Industrial applications\n\n## Opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 Increased demand for consumer electronics globally.\n- \u00b7 Emerging applications in printed circuit boards in the automotive, aerospace and high-speed computing sectors.\n- \u00b7 Need for high-end wireless chips in the long term.\n\n## Threats\n\n- \u00b7 Worsening global economic conditions could affect disposable incomes, limiting demand for electronics.\n- \u00b7 Trade restrictions and supply chain issues may impact production of electronics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Government regulation\n\nProgress in tackling climate change has been hampered by the rise of other challenges such as the pandemic and economic concerns, forcing governments to implement policies, prioritise actions and fund plans to address these emerging issues. However, governments are expected to lead the transition towards a more sustainable future in the coming years by balancing economic, environmental and social interests, coordinating efforts across different sectors to tackle the climate change challenge and to fund or incentivise innovation.\n\n## Advancements in technology\n\nImproving efficiency and reducing the reliance on human input are key areas of focus for the mining sector. Through technological advancements there are opportunities to optimise operations by automising processes, improving mine planning and updating industrial manufacturing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Did you know?\n\n## Enabling new innovations\n\nGold is much more than the basis of beautiful jewellery or a safe haven for uncertain economic times - it offers a unique set of properties that make it the perfect choice for a wide range of innovative applications. In addition to its use in electronics, the malleability, reflectivity and versatility of gold mean that it is an important component in everything from radiant heat shields and spacesuits to the gold-glazed windows of landmark buildings such as the Royal Bank Plaza in Toronto.",

The programmes were suspended at year end due to social turmoil in the country; our community relations programme continued at our exploration sites.\n\n## Priorities for 2023\n\n- \u00b7 Invest a further US$175 million during the year, with a continued focus on our Fresnillo and San Juli\u00e1n operations, as well as on the Orisyvo, Guanajuato, and Tajitos advanced projects.\n- \u00b7 Continue our exploration and development activities to upgrade mineral resources into ore reserves at all our operating mines.\n- \u00b7 Further develop and strengthen the mineral resource modelling and ore reserve engineering capability building activities initiated in 2020, with the aim of providing a stronger technical value foundation and reporting proven reserves for all operating assets.\n- \u00b7 Continue the exploration programme at Juanicipio to fully delineate the deeper areas of the Valdeca\u00f1as vein and advance the evaluation of nearby veins; start drilling in new potential areas.\n- \u00b7 Complete the required studies to deliver an updated pre-feasibility study by year end at Orisyvo, strengthen the engagement plan with the relevant government and community stakeholders; development works are expected to start in 2023.\n- \u00b7 Complete the delineation of the main Tajitos ore bodies and conduct additional metallurgical testwork; update the project's Preliminary Economic Assessment. Start drilling at several targets in the district that remain underexplored.\n\n- \u00b7 Accelerate exploration drilling at the most promising areas of the Guanajuato district and evaluate feasible mining and processing scenarios; update the project's preliminary economic assessment.\n- \u00b7 Continue drilling and conduct detailed metallurgical investigations at Candame\u00f1a and San Juan.\n- \u00b7 Continue discussions with the local communities at Rodeo. Implement an intensive infill, step-out, condemnation and geotechnical drilling programme, alongside detailed metallurgical testwork, once agreements are reached.\n- \u00b7 Accelerate the pace of drilling at Capricornio in Chile. Monitor the social and political environment in Peru while maintaining our strong community relations plan at the project sites; resume drilling at Santo Domingo and Pilarica once conditions improve.\n\nOur firm and unchanging commitment to exploration sets us apart from many of our peers and provides a solid platform for our future success.\n\nWhere many major mining companies seek to grow through acquisition, we believe that the most effective and most sustainable route to growth is based on creating our own pipeline of reserves and resources - and that demands a long-term commitment to exploration. By continuing to invest in exploration across all precious metals price cycles and regardless of the peaks and troughs of economies, we aim to keep our pipeline well-stocked with a steady flow of opportunities and, specifically, to replace reserves mined each year.",

They have been responsible for our most significant breakthroughs, such as those at San Juli\u00e1n and Saucito, and are ideally qualified to identify and develop new opportunities. One of the most important roles of our teams is to engage with local communities and seek their participation at an early stage of a project. Not only does this help safeguard our licence to operate, it also gives us the opportunity to meet and consult with local people, thereby ensuring that we are able to tailor any subsequent community support programmes to meet their specific needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details on community engagement See pages 110-119.\n\nOur focus remains on Latin America, and in particular on maximising the geological potential in and around our current operations. At the same time, we are continuing to look to locate and consolidate new districts in Mexico, Chile and Peru where we have identified favourable gold-silver potential.\n\nAll our exploration projects are measured against a set of strict criteria to ensure they meet our operational and revenue objectives. For example, we will only proceed with a standalone project if it offers a minimum potential of 150 moz of silver or 2 moz of gold. We also consider a range of additional factors before commencing activities, such as ore grades, metallurgical recoveries, extraction costs, environmental impact, and\n\nsustainability and community investment, as well as the available infrastructure. Only those projects that score well against these requirements receive the green light.\n\n## 2022 performance\n\n## Mineral resources and ore reserves\n\nEstimations of our mineral resources and ore reserves are developed by our corporate technical staff in line with industry standards, and audited every year by independent expert firms prior to public statement under the JORC Code reporting standards. 2022 mineral resources and ore reserve estimates were based on price assumptions of US$1,450/oz gold and US$18.5/oz silver, with open pit mineral resources estimated at US$1,600/oz gold.\n\nGold in mineral resources remained stable at 39.1 moz; silver in mineral resources decreased 5.0% to 2,203.9 moz primarily due to mining depletion, higher costs and cut-off grades and a more conservative approach to resource estimation in Fresnillo, Saucito and Ci\u00e9nega, balanced in part by positive exploration results at the Guanajuato exploration project.\n\nGold in ore reserves increased 4.4% to 8.2 moz mostly as a result of resource model improvements at Herradura, balanced in part by mining depletion at Noche Buena.\n\nSilver in ore reserves decreased 5.6% to 396.1 moz mainly from mining depletion and higher costs and cut-off grades at Fresnillo and Saucito, and\n\ndepletion at San Juli\u00e1n disseminated, partly offset by increased ore reserves from exploration at San Juli\u00e1n veins.\n\nIn 2020, we initiated a major technical development effort to upgrade our mineral resource modelling and ore reserve engineering functions, both of which again made significant progress in 2022. With a dedicated team of 26 specialists, geotechnical, ventilation and economical modelling continued to progress, as did the underground and open pit ore reserve engineering and reconciliation processes. Juanicipio reported measured mineral resource and proven ore reserve for the first time in 2022, adding to proven reserves reported again for the open pit operating mines.\n\nThe corporate technical team will continue developing all disciplines in 2023, with special focus on underground geotechnical modelling and mining reconciliation as well as further process upgrades and integration.\n\nIn 2022, our drilling programmes increased by 14.4% compared to 2021, with a total of 955,798 metres drilled. 89% of drilling activities were carried out at, or close to, our existing operations, in line with our continued focus on brownfield exploration which maximises the possibility of good returns. The following section provides details about our exploration pipeline, highlighting progress made in 2022 as well as outlining our plan for the year ahead. We drilled 106,404 metres in greenfield targets where we are consolidating districts.",

        "page_content": "## Exploration at our existing mines\n\nExcellent exploration potential exists around our operating mines, where numerous drill targets have been identified using geological, geochemical, geophysical and remote sensing data, which is analysed and interpreted by our expert team. Exploring these targets represents a good opportunity to add value to our current operations by increasing our resource and reserve base. In line with this approach, 89% of the 955,798 metres drilled in 2022 were devoted to brownfield targets, including 661,811 metres drilled by the mine operation teams, and 185,534 metres completed by the Exploration Division.\n\nThe objectives of the drilling campaigns at our mines are threefold: (i) replenish and augment our mineral reserves, converting inferred resources into the indicated category with infill drilling; (ii) increase the total and inferred resources by drilling at extensions of known mineralisation and also by testing new targets; and (iii) continue to ensure the quality of the reserves blocks scheduled to be mined in the short term, with selected additional drilling carried out wherever deemed necessary due to grade variations. We work hard to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business and to drive growth by replenishing depleted reserves and maintaining a robust growth pipeline.\n\n## Fresnillo district\n\nWhile Fresnillo is one of the most important silver districts in the world, our exploration activities show that it remains under-explored. We are addressing this opportunity through an integrated approach based on detailed mapping, geophysics and geochemistry. We are following up three high-priority exploration targets located within the area of influence of the processing facilities, with positive results.\n\nAcross the district, the mines and exploration teams drilled 306,055 metres during the year. 60% of the drilling by the mine teams was infill drilling, both within reserves and inferred resources, and 40% to vein extensions. Good silver grades were obtained from several veins at the western section of the Saucito mine and in the central-east zone of the Fresnillo operation. 36,446 metres were drilled in high priority targets within reach of the existing mineral processing facilities, showing local economic grade intercepts that will be followed up in 2023.\n\n## Herradura District\n\nWe drilled a total of 113,292 metres in the Herradura District in 2022, with activities focused within the final Centauro pit to identify additional mineralised sections and to better define reserve blocks, and to evaluate potentially mineable sectors of the Noche Buena mine open pits. Beyond the pit limits, drilling was intensified in the high-grade gold veins, where mineable thickness and good grade continuity was successfully confirmed.\n\nThe 31,307 metres of infill drilling in the Centauro pit led to an improved model of the gold distribution in both the reserves and resources used for mine\n\nplanning. 52,310 metres of drilling focused on defining high-grade veins and related disseminated mineralisation below the current final pit model which were incorporated into the Centauro Profundo ore bodies.\n\nAt the Noche Buena mine, which is nearing exhaustion, 29,944 metres of drilling confirmed additional shallow resources and reserves which were added to the final mine plans, as drilling continues to investigate in detail the peripheral reaches of the deposit.\n\n## Ci\u00e9nega district\n\n87,503 metres of core drilling were completed at Ci\u00e9nega during 2022, with a continued focus on the north-eastern part of the District, including Santa Alicia, Rosario Transversal, AFT and the Jessica Transversal, as well as areas in the central zone of the mine. Drill results have led to new resources and reserves being added from the readily accessible Jessica Transversal shallow vein and the discovery of extensions of the Rosario Transversal, Carolina and Veta Nueva veins, with the latter displaying stockwork mineralisation with economic grades of over tens of metres in width. Drilling also focused on the El Arco-Casas del bajo target; results so far have proven the continuity of the veins with moderate gold and silver grades.\n\n## San Juli\u00e1n district\n\nAn intensive drilling programme amounting to 271,700 metres was implemented by the mine and district exploration teams. 2022 saw successful exploration in the vein system, with several blind, new veins discovered in the northern and southeastern sections of the district; some of these veins have been included in the indicated resource category, indicating the possibility of them becoming new reserves in the short term.\n\nIn 2022 the exploration team continued the intensive search for sulphide ores, following up on drill targets previously defined. Some silverbearing sulphide mineralisation, both in vein and disseminated styles, has been detected in the central and southeastern areas of the district. Although additional resources of sulphide ore bodies have not yet been estimated, our drilling programmes are continuing to focus on the definition of new ore bodies.\n\nThe continuous mapping and geochemical sampling programmes in the district were focused in the Ceniza and Buenavista areas, where claim consolidation was achieved through the acquisition of several mining properties. Drill targets were defined and are scheduled for drilling in 2H 2023 after the completion of social and environmental permits. Mapping and sampling continue in the northwestern and southeastern portions of the district where hydrothermal alteration zones accompanied by quartz veining have been discovered. Additional work will be completed to advance those to the drill-ready stage.\n\n## Juanicipio - (56% Fresnillo plc, 44% MAG Silver)\n\n42,197 metres of core drilling were completed during 2022 over the main NW-trending\n\nValdeca\u00f1as and subsidiary veins, carried out by both the Exploration Division and the mine teams. The programme was designed to define the vein character at depth; results proved that the main Valdeca\u00f1as vein continues with significant widths but silver grades decrease. However, the vein remains economic due to the increase of lead and zinc sulphides. Mineralisation occurring in sets of oblique and subparallel veins to the main structural trend were also drill tested and some ore shoots remain open. Mine exploration was focused on infill drilling on reserves and some additional geotechnical work.\n\n## Development projects, preliminary economic assessments and feasibility studies\n\nWe do not currently have any active development projects with Juanicipio now categorised as an operational mine. We look for projects that have shown good potential for supporting our growth ambitions to bring forward into this category. For projects in the relatively early stages we may conduct preliminary economic assessments (PEAs), which comprise an economic analysis of the potential viability of mineral resources. For more advanced projects, we undertake extensive de-risking activities to refine models, explore the extent of mineralisation and provide comprehensive support to a project as it moves into and through the development stage - a key moment in the journey towards becoming an operational mine.\n\n## Advanced exploration projects Orisyvo\n\n2,049 metres of core drilling were completed for geotechnical purposes along with additional detailed geotechnical mapping of the underground workings; results are being summarised to provide a detailed characterisation of the host and surrounding rocks of the deposit. These studies, coupled with the updated metallurgical investigations completed on the oxide and sulphide ores and other engineering data, are being accumulated to deliver a reserve base for the mining scenarios under consideration. Additional metallurgical studies (bio-oxidation and Albion processes) are currently in progress aiming at further improving gold recovery in the sulphide zones.\n\nA number of studies required to take the Orisyvo project into the pre-feasibility stage were either completed or are in progress. These include alternative mine design, processing facilities and tailings storage, as well as detailed environmental, social and infrastructure studies, coupled with additional land acquisition and a strengthened community and local government engagement plan.",

        "page_content": "## Review of operations - exploration continued\n\n## Guanajuato\n\nGuanajuato is a historic, world-class gold and silver mineral system, which displays numerous attractive exploration targets that have the potential to increase its already large preciousmetals endowment. The drill programme was intensified in 2022, with 66,591 metres of core drilling completed over priority vein zones. The programme also included 5,848 metres drilled underground from the Peregrina and Veta Madre historical mine workings.\n\nA significant increase in both indicated and inferred gold and silver resources was achieved at several veins in the district. The application of our upper-level epithermal model over large hydrothermal alteration zones coupled with a clear understanding of its structural and stratigraphic setting has allowed our team to continue to discover mineralisation under barren cover. These efforts will continue in 2023 and the following years. Resources increased both in veins and in stockwork ore bodies amenable to massive, low-cost, underground mining methods. Alternatives to metallurgical processing are under consideration. A Preliminary Economic Analysis of several district zones is currently being updated using the new resource estimation and engineering data provided by the Project Development team and is scheduled for completion in 1Q 2023.\n\n## Rodeo\n\nThe Rodeo District contains a sizeable gold resource and a number of exploration targets in the neighbouring areas. The mineralised zone is amenable to open-pit mining and gold recovery using heap-leach technologies. We have strengthened a region-wide community relations programme and advanced negotiations with private landowners. Metallurgical, hydrological,\n\ninfrastructure, environmental and social studies are underway. However, further exploration and development works remained on standby during 2022 pending land access agreements being reached with the local Ejidos.\n\n## Tajitos\n\nTajitos is an open-pit, heap-leach, disseminated gold project displaying fully oxidised ore bodies up to 200 metres in depth. Significant progress has been achieved with the successful completion of third parties' claim consolidation and land purchase from private owners. A drill programme was designed to fully evaluate the known ore bodies up to the indicated resource category level. Social and environmental studies were completed and drilling resumed in 4Q 2022. 20,747 metres of core and reverse circulation drilling have been carried out so far; the programme is scheduled for completion in 1H 2023 and will be followed by a preliminary economic assessment. Additional metallurgical studies are being carried both in the laboratory and at the pilot leach pad scales over the oxide Tajitos ores. Exploration drill programmes will continue in 2Q 2023 over the several drill targets occurring in the district that remain under-explored and display good possibilities of increasing the size of the Tajitos resource base.\n\n## Prospects\n\n## Mexico\n\nDrilling resumed in 2022 at the early-stage San Juan and Candame\u00f1a projects, which already have a significant resource base and the exploration potential to become Fresnillo-sized mineral deposits. Candame\u00f1a exposes a large high-sulphidation epithermal system with gold values both in oxide and sulphide zones; several exploration targets have been delineated using surface geochemical and airborne hyperspectral\n\nand geophysical tools. Land access agreements and environmental permits were obtained and followed by 6,146 metres of core drilling in 2H 2022. The results delivered interesting gold values and the drill programme will continue in 2023.\n\nAt San Juan, a sizeable, gold and silver-bearing vein system, 7,370 metres of drilling tested near surface mineralisation and the along strike and depth extensions of known veins with good results. Additional targets were developed by detailed geochemistry sampling and lithological, structural and alteration mapping. Drilling continues, and detailed metallurgical testing will be carried out in 2023, both at Candame\u00f1a and San Juan.\n\nThe first round of drilling started at several good potential prospects in our brownfields and greenfields portfolio. Where warranted, some drilling will continue in 2023. The easing of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2H 2022 allowed us to resume regional prospecting programmes, and regional exploration targets previously delineated in the main gold and silver belts of Mexico are now being followed-up.\n\n## Peru\n\nField work supported by a strengthened community engagement programme continued in Peru during most of the year. All the necessary social and government permits were obtained for the Pilarica and Santo Domingo projects, allowing us to resume drilling at the former and conduct our first drilling campaign at the latter. A total of 3,736 metres were drilled at these locations. Unfortunately, social and political disruptions in Peru at the end of 2022 led to a stoppage in our drilling programmes, and both of these projects, together with Supaypacha, remain in standby until the situation returns to normal.

        "page_content": "relations teams continue to monitor the security conditions and remain in contact with the local people where it is safe to do so. Good progress was obtained at several high potential prospects across the country, with some advancing to the drill target definition stage. Additional claims covering good potential targets were secured over the year; field work will resume when safe work conditions return to our areas of interest.\n\n## Chile\n\nThe Capricornio project, located in the Antofagasta region, displays a significant quartz vein system with interesting preciousmetals values at the surface. Geophysical and geochemical surveys were completed over the extensive caliche-covered valley north of the project; as a result, additional drill targets were\n\ndelineated to support the exploration potential of the project. In 2022, our core drilling amounted to 9,935 metres including the stepping out from previous intercepts, the testing of unexplored veins and targets under cover. The results we obtained warranted further work, and core drilling remains in progress. The Condoriaco project near La Serena was dropped after an additional 7,838 metres of drilling led to disappointing results.\n\nField mapping and sampling campaigns advanced at several precious metals-bearing belts in Chile. Results indicate good exploration potential at some of these, including targets in claims under the 100% ownership of Fresnillo. Geological and permitting activities are underway to advance these to the drill ready stage.\n\n## Early stage exploration\n\nWe routinely carry out activities at all six exploration offices to accumulate regional geological, geophysical, structural and geochemical data and analyse them in a GIS environment. Areas identified with good potential are followed-up by gathering remote sensing hydrothermal alteration data commissioned from international high quality service providers. The information gained is integrated into the database to refine our understanding of the targeted ore deposit systems. Furthermore, our regional prospecting teams in Mexico, Peru and Chile carry out the field work required to validate the exploration targets and eventually incorporate them into our prospect pipeline.\n\n| Project           | Location            | 2022 Drilling (metres)   | Mineral Resources (attributable)                                                     | Status                          |\n|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Guanajuato        |                     |                          | 2022:  2,202 koz Au and 152 moz Ag                                                   |                                 |\n|                   | Guanajuato          | 66,591                   | Change vs. 2021:  509 koz Au;

        "page_content": "## Key developments in the year\n\nSilver production increased by 13.5% vs. 2021, driven by the higher volume of ore processed as operating restrictions that affected ore throughput in 2021 were addressed, including: i) the labour reform in Mexico, which resulted in staff vacancies and affected equipment availability; and ii) a short circuit of a main power line, which limited the water pumping capacity thereby affecting access to some mining areas and slowing down haulage level operations.\n\nThe average development rate in the year decreased slightly to 2,929 metres per month (2021: 3,050 metres per month). We expect to maintain a development rate of c. 3,000 metres per month for the foreseeable future. An assessment will be conducted in 2023 to confirm the optimal rate based on reserves and production.\n\nFollowing a trial at a production area, activities to relocate the tunnel boring machine (TBM) to develop the haulage level to the west were carried out. However, works progressed at a slower pace than anticipated as a result of a geological fault and ground fall, thus limiting the TBM's contribution to development rates during the year. The relocation is expected to be concluded in 1H 2023, and to gradually start contributing to development rates in 2H 2023.\n\nProductivity, calculated as tonnes of ore milled per person, increased over 2021 driven by the higher volumes processed partly offset by the increase in the number of specialised contractors and limited productivity from new unionised employees during the training phase.\n\nThe processes introduced in previous years to improve our knowledge and understanding of the vein system and to control dilution are now integrated into our day-to-day operations at the mine. Together with our ongoing investment in new technology, these processes will continue to enhance our mine planning and operations in the coming years.\n\nThe works to deepen the San Carlos shaft were concluded during the year. However, a number of modifications to the shaft infrastructure to improve its functionality once in operation were approved and implemented, thus delaying its commissioning to 2Q 2023. This project is expected to support a reduction in haulage costs.\n\n## Pyrites plant at Fresnillo\n\nThe tie in of the Pyrites plant to the national electricity grid was postponed by a few months due to our prioritisation of the process at Juanicipio (see pages 50-51). We now expect to complete the tie in by the end of 1Q 2023, with commissioning and ramp up following immediately afterwards.\n\n## Financial performance 4\n\n| Financial highlights                    |   2022 |   2021 | % change   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Revenue (US$m)                          |  418.5 |  415.9 | 0.6        |\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)                 |  475.8 |  459.5 | 3.5        |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)        |  225.2 |  187.7 | 20.0       |\n| Depreciation (US$m)                     |   88.1 |   83.5 | 5.5        |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                   |  197   |  224.6 | (12.3)     |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)              |  106.6 |  108.3 | (1.6)      |\n| Exploration (US$m)                      |   20.8 |    9.3 | 123.7      |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                    |   91.5 |   84.7 | 8.0        |\n| Cash cost (US$/oz silver)               |    5.7 |    5.4 | 4.7        |\n| Margin (US$/oz) 5                       |   16   |   19.4 | (17.5)     |\n| Margin (expressed as % of silver price) |   73.7 |   78.1 |            |\n| All-in sustaining cost (US$)            |   16.3 |   16.3 | 0.0        |\n\nAdjusted revenue, excluding inter-segment sales, increased by 3.5% to US$475.8 million, principally due to the increase in volumes of silver, lead and zinc sold, partly offset by the lower silver price.\n\nCost per tonne increased 8.0% to US$91.5 in 2022, primarily driven by cost inflation and an increase in maintenance costs, mitigated by the higher volume of ore milled.\n\n4\n\nFinancial figures for Fresnillo exclude ore sales from Juanicipio.\n\n5\n\n- Margin defined as average realised price less cash cost per ounce.\n\nCash cost per silver ounce increased to US$5.7 (2021: US$5.4) mainly due to the increase in cost per tonne and the higher treatment and refining charges, partially offset by lower mining rights and higher lead and zinc by-product credits. Margin per ounce decreased 17.5% to US$16.0. Expressed as a percentage of the silver price, it decreased to 73.7% (2021: 78.1%).\n\nAll-in sustaining cost remained stable at US$16.3, explained by the increase in cash cost.\n\nThis US$155.0 million facility and the Pyrites plant (phase I) at Saucito are together expected to produce an average of 3.5 moz silver and 13 koz gold per year, once both are operating at full capacity.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver reserves decreased 7.9% due to mining depletion and higher costs and cut-offs, while silver resources decreased 11.3%.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nTotal capex spend in 2022 was US$106.6 million, which included sustaining capex, mine development, the deepening of the San Carlos shaft and the tailings management programme.\n\n## 2023 outlook\n\nFor 2023, the silver ore grade is expected to be in the range of 185-205 g/t, with the gold ore grade around 0.50-0.70 g/t.\n\nThe majority of our investment in the year ahead will focus on mine development and sustaining capex, including the acquisition of additional mine equipment required for operation by personnel recently hired and trained following the labour reform.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- % figures represent margin between cash cost and silver price.",

        "page_content": "## Key developments in the year\n\nSilver production decreased by 3.7% vs. 2021 due to the lower volume of ore processed mainly driven by changes to the short-term planning process and, to a lesser extent, the residual impact of the labour reform, which delayed preparation of the mine due to the lower productivity from internalised personnel and decreased equipment availability. However, these factors were partially mitigated by a higher ore grade resulting from improved short-term planning and regained access to higher grade zones.\n\nAnnual gold production decreased 16.9% due to a lower volume of ore processed and a lower ore grade.\n\nAs expected, the ore grade and volumes of ore processed varied throughout the year, driven by the need for timely development of the mine in order to improve fulfillment of the mine plan.\n\nA third-party review of the short-term planning cycle was completed in 1H 2022, concluding that the optimal run rate of the beneficiation plant should be 7,000 tpd.\n\nRecruitment and training campaigns were intensified, with the shortage of personnel reducing gradually by the end of the year. Notwithstanding, longer learning curves for new\n\nemployees continued to impact performance at the mine and development rates.\n\nProductivity decreased compared to 2021 as access to some areas continued to be restricted in 1H 2022 due to the ongoing seismicity, further impacted by an increased headcount as although new unionised employees were hired, they contributed lower productivity during the training phase.\n\nThe Pyrites plant at Saucito produced 529 koz of silver and 2.0 koz of gold during the year, lower year-on-year due to a decrease in volumes processed at Saucito and the lower tailings processed at the Pyrites plant.\n\nThe project to deepen the Jarillas shaft from 630 metres to 1,000 metres advanced an additional 40 metres, with further progress made in horizontal development and supporting infrastructure. The timeline of this project remains unchanged with completion expected by 2025.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver in ore reserves decreased 7.2% due to depletion and higher costs and cut-offs, partly balanced by exploration results. Similarly, silver resources decreased by 15.2% as a result of mining depletion, higher costs and cut-off grade as well as a more conservative approach to resource estimation.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                    |   2022 | 2021   | % change   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Revenue (US$m)                          |  442.7 | 544.4  | (18.7)     |\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)                 |  485.9 | 594.5  | (18.3)     |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)        |  247.6 | 218.6  | 13.3       |\n| Depreciation (US$m)                     |   95   | 110.2  | (13.8)     |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                   |  197.8 | 321.3  | (38.4)     |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)              |  118   | 101.2  | 16.6       |\n| Exploration (US$m)                      |   30.2 | 18.7   | 61.5       |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                    |  119.5 | 89.8   | 33.0       |\n| Cash cost ($/oz silver)                 |    4.5 | (0.8)  | N/A        |\n| Margin ($/oz)                           |   17.2 | 25.7   | (33.1)     |\n| Margin (expressed as % of silver price) |   79.3 | 103.2  |            |\n| All in sustaining cost (US$)            |   16.8 | 9.5    | 76.8       |\n\nAdjusted revenue at Saucito decreased 18.3% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the decrease in silver, gold, lead and zinc volumes sold and the lower silver price.\n\nCost per tonne increased 33.0% to US$119.5, mainly driven by an increase in the use of infrastructure contractors and maintenance, cost inflation and a decrease in the volume of ore milled.\n\nCash cost per silver ounce increased to US$4.5 per ounce (2021: -US$0.8 per silver ounce) mainly\n\nas a result of a higher cost per tonne and lower gold, lead and zinc by-product credits per silver ounce. This was mitigated by a higher silver ore grade and lower mining rights. Margin per ounce decreased to US$17.2 in 2022 (2021: US$25.7). Expressed as a percentage of the silver price, it decreased from 103.2% to 79.3%.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost increased 76.8% to US$16.8 per ounce due to the increase in cash cost and higher capitalised mine development per ounce.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures in 2022 totalled US$118.0 million, mainly allocated to sustaining capex, including additional mining equipment to maintain operations following internalisation of certain contractors in 2021, in-mine development, safety and environment, tailings dam and the project to deepen the Jarillas shaft.\n\n## 2023 outlook\n\nWe expect volumes of ore processed to increase to c. 7,000 tpd in 2023 as we increase productivity following intensive training of personnel this year.\n\nThe silver ore grade is expected to average between 190-210 g/t while the gold ore grade is expected to average between 1.2-1.4 g/t.\n\nWe will continue to prioritise training and working with new personnel to increase productivity at the mine. Furthermore, we will focus on cost reduction initiatives such as optimising the anchoring and shotcreting, depending on the rock quality of the area, and decreasing maintenance and pumping costs.\n\nAn assessment to define the optimal level of development will be conducted during the year.\n\nCapex will primarily be allocated to required mine development, sustaining capex, safety and environment and the deepening of the Jarillas shaft.\n\n|   2022 |   558 |\n|--------|-------|\n|   2021 |   721 |\n|   2020 |   858 |\n|   2019 |   749 |\n|   2018 |   849 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- % figures represent margin between cash cost and silver price.",

In 2022, it contributed 26.5% to total silver production and generated 16.1% of total adjusted revenue.\n\nOwnership:\n\n100% Fresnillo plc\n\nIn operation since: 2016 (Veins)/2017 (Disseminated Ore Body)\n\nFacilities: Underground mine, flotation plant and a dynamic leaching plant\n\nWorkforce: 668 employees, 1,262 contractors\n\nLocation: Chihuahua/Durango border\n\nMine life (years): 4.8 Veins (2021: 4.4), 2.8 Disseminated Ore Body (2021: 3.1)\n\n## Key developments in the year\n\nSilver production at San Juli\u00e1n veins increased 9.8% year-on-year. This was mainly due to the higher ore grade driven by the operational decision to adjust the mine plan to prioritise extraction from wider veins of the mine with higher silver content but lower gold ore grade, thus decreasing gold production by 16.3%.\n\nSilver and gold production decreased at San Juli\u00e1n Disseminated Ore Body year-on-year, mainly due to the expected lower ore grades in 2022 following the higher than anticipated ore grade in 2021 as a result of: i) the positive variation with the geological model in the central area of the ore body; and ii) access to higher ore grade areas following the mine resequencing in 2019.\n\nProductivity increased due to the decrease in contractors, which more than offset the increase in unionised personnel on volumes of ore throughput.\n\nConstruction of the third phase of the tailings dam commenced in mid-2022 following a comprehensive review of design and construction methodology. Progress is according to plan.\n\nThe pilot project to recover ore panels under paste fill continued, albeit at a slower pace than planned as priority was given to completing the staffing of the mine and the purchase of equipment. This project will continue in 2023, with additional diamond drilling and geotechnical studies to confirm feasibility. Once these activities are completed, mining works will commence with a roadheader.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver in ore reserves at San Juli\u00e1n veins increased 9.9% year-on-year mainly as a result of the ongoing exploration programme in the southern areas of the district. Likewise, silver in mineral resources increased year-on-year despite increased costs and cut-off grade. Gold in ore reserves and mineral resources remained at similar levels to 2021.\n\nSilver and gold in ore reserves at San Juli\u00e1n Disseminated Ore Body decreased due to mining depletion partly offset by exploration results, and lower costs and cut-off grade. However, silver and gold in mineral resources increased as a result of the exploration programme, together with lower costs and cut-off grade.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapex spend in 2022 was US$64.5 million, mainly allocated to mining works and sustaining capex.",

Margin per ounce decreased to US$14.7 (2021: US$23.0), while margin expressed as a percentage of the silver price decreased from 92.6% in 2021 to 67.5% in 2022.\n\nAll in sustaining cost increased to US$21.8 per ounce due to the increase in cash cost and higher sustaining capex per ounce.\n\nBudgeted capex for 2023 will be allocated to mining works, sustaining capex, safety and environment and the construction of a tailings dam to ensure operational continuity.'\n\n## San Juli\u00e1n (DOB)\n\nCost per tonne increased 14.2% to US$44.8, mainly driven by cost inflation and increased use of maintenance.\n\nCash cost increased to US$6.9 per ounce of silver driven by a lower silver ore grade, the increase in cost per tonne and higher treatment and refining charges, mitigated by higher zinc and lead by-product credits per silver ounce and lower mining rights. Margin per ounce decreased to US$14.8 (2021: US$20.0), while margin expressed as a percentage of the silver price decreased from 80.5% in 2021 to 68.2% in 2022.\n\nThe 38.6% increase in all in sustaining cost was mainly driven by the increase in cash cost and a higher sustaining capex.",

This was due to a higher proportion of ore from the main Ci\u00e9nega mine being processed, as opposed to processing ore from a satellite operation in the surrounding area with a higher average ore grade.\n\nProductivity decreased as volumes processed continued to be impacted by the effects of the labour reform and the increased workforce rotation, which meant that additional workers had to be recruited and trained.\n\nConstruction of the second stage of the third tailings dam continued as planned and is expected to be concluded in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- % figures represent margin between cash cost and gold price.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver and gold in ore reserves decreased 8.7% and 10.9% respectively year-on-year as a result of mining depletion, exploration results and higher costs and cut-offs. Likewise, silver and gold resources decreased 10.8% and 14.3% year-onyear respectively.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapex in 2022 totalled US$47.0 million and was allocated primarily to mine development, sustaining capex and safety and environment, including the construction of the tailings dam.\n\n## 2023 outlook\n\nIn 2023, the average gold ore grade is expected to be between 1.0-1.1 g/t, with the silver ore grade expected to average 150-160 g/t.\n\nBudgeted capex for 2023 will continue to be primarily focused on mining works and sustaining capex.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                  | 2022    | 2021    | % change   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n| Revenue (US$m)                        | 169.5   | 215.6   | (21.4)     |\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)               | 180.3   | 227.8   | (20.9)     |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)      | 129.6   | 110.4   | 17.4       |\n| Depreciation (US$m)                   | 50.9    | 62.9    | (19.1)     |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                 | 39.6    | 106.5   | (62.8)     |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)            | 47.0    | 45.4    | 3.5        |\n| Exploration (US$m)                    | 9.6     | 8.2     | 17.1       |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                  | 116.3   | 86.1    | 35.1       |\n| Cash cost ($/oz gold)                 | 518.5   | (523.1) | N/A        |\n| Margin ($/oz)                         | 1,280.8 | 2,318.1 | (44.7)     |\n| Margin (expressed as % of gold price) | 71.2    | 129.1   |            |\n| All in sustaining cost (US$)          | 2,011.1 | 656.1   | >100       |\n\nAdjusted revenue decreased 20.9% over 2021, mainly due to lower volumes of gold, silver, lead and zinc sold, and lower silver and lead prices. Ci\u00e9nega is the Group's most polymetallic mine, a fact demonstrated by the 64.8% contribution from silver, lead and zinc in 2022 (2021: 64.4%).\n\nCost per tonne increased 35.1% to US$116.3, driven by an increase in the use of infrastructure contractors and maintenance, cost inflation and a lower volume of ore milled.\n\nThe increase in cash cost per gold ounce from -US$523.1 in 2021 to US$518.5 in 2022 was primarily due to a higher cost per tonne, lower gold ore grade and higher treatment and refining charges. This was mitigated by higher silver, zinc and lead by-product credits per gold ounce and lower mining rights and profit sharing. Margin per ounce decreased to US$1,280.8 in 2022 (2021: US$2,318.1). Expressed as a percentage of the gold price, the margin decreased to 71.2% (2021: 129.1%).\n\nThe US$1,355.0 per ounce increase in all-in sustaining cost was primarily driven by the higher cash cost and a higher sustaining capex per ounce of gold.",

This was partly mitigated by the increase in volume of ore processed as a result of the positive variations with the geological model and the availability of the lower layers of the new leaching pad 14B for deposits.\n\nProductivity decreased compared to 2021 driven by the increased number of personnel hauling a decreased volume of material over greater distances.\n\nDuring the year, we increased the scope of the Carbon in Column project to improve efficiency and this required additional engineering and work during the year, including the installation of an electricity supply line. We expect to commission the project and ramp up the plant in mid-2023, increasing gold recovery from the old leaching pads.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nGold in ore reserves and mineral resources increased 10.7% and 2.6% respectively, due to resource model improvements partly offset by mining depletion, higher cost assumptions and exploration drilling results.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures in 2022 totalled US$105.3 million, which was focused on mining works and sustaining capex.\n\n## 2023 outlook\n\nGold ore grades in 2023 are expected to be in the range of 0.65-0.75 g/t.\n\nCapex for 2023 will continue to focus primarily on capitalised prestripping, sustaining capex, construction of the 15th leaching pad and the implementation of the activated carbon process to increase gold recovery. Other investments scheduled for 2023 also include a technical evaluation of autonomous haulage equipment.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                  | 2022    | 2021    | % change   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n| Revenue (US$m)                        | 634.0   | 769.9   | (17.7)     |\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)               | 634.9   | 770.8   | (17.6)     |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)      | 437.4   | 440.8   | (0.8)      |\n| Depreciation (US$m)                   | 81.5    | 81.2    | 0.4        |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                 | 127.9   | 285.3   | (55.2)     |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)            | 105.3   | 54.4    | 134.0      |\n| Exploration (US$m)                    | 19.2    | 19.0    | 1.1        |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                  | 19.7    | 21.7    | (9.2)      |\n| Cost per tonne hauled (US$)           | 4.7     | 3.5     | 34.3       |\n| Cash cost ($/oz gold)                 | 1,155.5 | 900.4   | 28.3       |\n| Margin ($/oz)                         | 643.8   | 894.6   | (28.0)     |\n| Margin (expressed as % of gold price) | 35.8    | 49.8    |            |\n| All in sustaining cost (US$)          | 1,527.4 | 1,100.2 | 38.8       |\n\nAdjusted revenue decreased year-on-year due to the lower volumes of gold sold.\n\nCost per tonne of ore deposited decreased -9.2% primarily as a result of a decrease in stripping charged to cost.

        "page_content": "## Key developments in the year\n\nConstruction of the Juanicipio plant was completed in 4Q 2021. However, permits to connect to the national grid were not granted as anticipated due to the additional tests required by the state-owned electric company and the energy regulator. These precautionary measures to ensure uninterrupted service to the surrounding area extended the process, with the final tie-in of the plant being completed by year end.\n\nDespite the delay in the commissioning and start-up of the flotation plant to 2023, mineralised material from development and initial production stopes continued to be processed at the Fresnillo and Saucito beneficiation plants during the year, with 646,148 tonnes processed. Attributable production reached 5.2 moz of silver and 12.5 koz of gold, confirming Juanicipio's position as a major influence in our silver operations.\n\nDevelopment of the mine continued to advance, reaching 57.9 km by the end of the year.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver in ore reserves decreased 3.4% year-onyear reflecting higher costs. Gold in reserves and resources, and silver resources remained stable vs. 2021.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapex in 2022 totalled US$149.6 million and was allocated primarily to mine development, purchase of equipment, construction of ventilation shafts and land acquisition.\n\n## 2023 outlook\n\nThe ramp up of production is expected to progress smoothly, with the objective of achieving nameplate capacity by 3Q 2023. Once at full capacity, the average silver ore grade is expected to be around 400 g/t, with the gold ore grade expected to average 1.0 g/t.\n\nBudgeted capex for 2023 will continue to be primarily focused on mining works and sustaining capex.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights             |   2022 | 2021   | % change   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Revenue (US$m)                   |  236.7 | -      | N/A        |\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)          |  259   | -      | N/A        |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m) |  100.7 | -      | N/A        |\n| Depreciation (US$m)              |   22.1 | -      | N/A        |\n| Segment profit (US$m)            |  154.5 | -      | N/A        |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)       |  149.6 | -      | N/A        |\n| Exploration (US$m)               |    7.8 | -      | N/A        |\n\nThe flotation plant at Juanicipio was not in operation in 2022, thus there are no indicative/\n\nrepresentative cost indicators (cost per tonne, cash cost and all in sustaining cost).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This Financial Review is intended to convey the main factors affecting performance and to provide a detailed analysis of the financial results in order to enhance understanding of the Group's Financial Statements. All comparisons refer to 2022 figures compared to 2021, unless otherwise noted. The financial information and year-onyear variations are presented in US dollars, except where indicated. The full financial statements and their accompanying notes can be found on pages 226-274.\n\nThe following report presents how we have managed our financial resources.\n\n## Commentary on financial performance\n\nIn 2022, the Group's financial performance reflected the operational challenges faced at the mines, alongside the inflationary pressures across the cost base.\n\nIn particular, Adjusted revenue 1 decreased 8.8% over 2021 primarily due to the decrease in volumes of gold sold and the lower silver price, while revenue decreased 10.0% year-on-year to US$2,433.0 million due to the lower adjusted revenue combined with higher treatment and refining charges.\n\nAdjusted production costs 2 increased 15.2% over 2021, primarily driven by 8.4% cost inflation, the additional costs from the start-up of operations at Juanicipio and the increase in the use of infrastructure contractors, higher personnel costs following the internalisation process, increased maintenance and an increase in consumption of operating materials and diesel due to longer haulage distances at some of our mines.\n\nAs a result, gross profit and EBITDA 3 decreased to US$536.0 million and US$751.1 million, a 42.8% and 37.7% decrease over 2021 respectively.\n\nWe maintained our strong financial position, with US$969.1 million in cash and other liquid funds 1 as of 31 December 2022 notwithstanding paying dividends of US$202.0 million in accordance with our policy, investing US$592.1 million in capex and spending US$165.8 million on exploration expenses.\n\n## Income statement\n\n|                                                                                            | 2022 US$ million   | 2021 US$ million   | Amount change  US$ million   | Change %   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue 1                                                                         | 2,597.2            | 2,847.9            | (250.7)                      | (8.8)      |\n| Total revenue                                                                              | 2,433.0            | 2,703.1            | (270.1)                      | (10.0)     |\n| Cost of sales                                                                              | (1,897.0)          | (1,766.2)          | (130.8)                      | 7.4        |\n| Gross profit                                                                               | 536.0              | 936.9              | (400.9)                      | (42.8)     |\n| Exploration expenses                                                                       | 165.8              | 130.3              | 35.5                         | 27.2       |\n| Operating profit                                                                           | 283.6              | 666.7              | (383.1)                      | (57.5)     |\n| EBITDA 3                                                                                   | 751.1              | 1,206.3            | (455.2)                      | (37.7)     |\n| Income tax expense including special mining rights                                         | (59.7)             | 173.1              | (232.8)                      | N/A        |\n| Profit for the period                                                                      | 308.3              | 438.5              | (130.2)                      | (29.7)     |\n| Profit for the period, excluding post-tax Silverstream effects                             | 295.1              | 438.8              | (143.7)                      | (32.7)     |\n| Basic and diluted earnings per share (US$/share)  4                                        | 0.369              | 0.572              | (0.203)                      | (35.5)     |\n| Basic and diluted earnings per share, excluding post-tax Silverstream effects  (US$/share) | 0.351              | 0.572              | (0.221)                      | (38.6)     |\n\nThe Group's financial results are largely determined by the performance of our operations. However, other factors, such as a number of macroeconomic variables, lie beyond our control and affect financial results. These include:\n\n## Metals prices\n\nThe average realised silver price decreased 12.6% from US$24.9 per ounce in 2021 to US$21.7 per ounce in 2022, while the average realised gold price remained flat year-on-year at US$1,799.3 per ounce in 2022 (up 0.2%). The average realised lead by-product price decreased 3.8% to US$0.96 per pound, while the zinc by-product price increased 9.5% over the previous year to US$1.52 per pound.\n\n## MX$/US$ exchange rate\n\nThe Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate at 31 December 2022 was $19.36 per US dollar, compared to the exchange rate at 31 December 2021 of $20.58 per US dollar. The 5.9% spot revaluation had a favourable effect on taxes and mining rights.",

        "page_content": "The average spot Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate remained relatively unchanged at $20.13 per US dollar in 2022 ($20.28 per US dollar in 2021), thus having an immaterial effect on the Group's costs denominated in Mexican pesos (approximately 45% of total costs) when converted to US dollars.\n\n## Cost inflation\n\nIn 2022, cost inflation was 8.4%. The main components of our cost inflation basket are listed below:\n\n## Labour\n\nUnionised workers received on average a 6.8% increase in wages in Mexican pesos, while non-unionised employees received on average a 5.5% increase in wages in Mexican pesos; when converted to US dollars, this resulted in a weighted average labour inflation of 7.9%.\n\n## Energy\n\n## Electricity\n\nThe weighted average cost of electricity in US dollars increased 5.9% from US$8.74 cents per kW in 2021 to US$9.26 cents per kW in 2022, due to the higher average generating cost of the Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the national utility.\n\n## Diesel\n\nThe weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars increased 4.0% to 91.4 US cents per litre in 2022, compared to 87.9 US cents per litre in 2021. This was primarily due to the increase in global oil prices and the gradual lifting of the Mexican Government's fuel tax relief that subsidised the cost of diesel and gasoline in Mexico.\n\n## Operating materials\n\n|                                             |   Year-on-year  change in unit  price % |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Sodium cyanide                              |                                    48.9 |\n| Explosives                                  |                                    39.6 |\n| Other reagents                              |                                    20.8 |\n| Steel balls for milling                     |                                    16.9 |\n| Lubricants                                  |                                    16.1 |\n| Steel for drilling                          |                                    13.2 |\n| Tyres                                       |                                     2.2 |\n| Weighted average of all operating materials |                                    19.8 |\n\nUnit prices of our key operating materials increased significantly in US dollar terms reflecting global inflationary pressures and supply disruptions resulting from the zero-Covid policy in China and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. As a result, the weighted average unit prices of all operating materials increased year-on-year by 19.8%.\n\n## Contractors\n\nAgreements are signed individually with each contractor company and include specific terms and conditions that cover not only labour, but also operating materials, equipment and maintenance, amongst others. Contractor costs are mainly denominated in Mexican pesos and are an important component of our total production costs. In 2022, increases per unit (i.e. per metre developed/per tonne hauled) granted to contractors whose agreements were due for review during the period, resulted in a weighted average increase of approximately 4.9% in US dollars, after considering the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs. US dollar.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nUnit prices of spare parts for maintenance increased by 3.4% on average in US dollar terms.\n\n## Other costs\n\nOther cost components include freight which increased by an estimated 13.6% in US dollars, while insurance costs increased by 8.8% in US dollars mainly due to higher market premiums. The remaining cost inflation components experienced average deflation of 12.0% in US dollars over 2021.\n\nThe effects of the above external factors, combined with the Group's internal variables, are further described below through the main line items of the income statement.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Consolidated revenue\n\n|                                | 2022 US$ million   | 2021 US$ million   | Amount US$ million   | Change %   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue 5             | 2,597.2            | 2,847.9            | (250.7)              | (8.8)      |\n| Metals prices hedging          | (3.8)              | (1.4)              | (2.4)                | 179.0      |\n| Treatment and refining charges | (160.5)            | (143.5)            | (17.0)               | 11.8       |\n| Total revenue                  | 2,433.0            | 2,703.1            | (270.1)              | (10.0)     |\n\n- 5 Adjusted revenue is revenue as disclosed in the income statement adjusted to exclude treatment and refining charges and metals prices hedging.",

As a result, total revenue decreased to US$2,433.0 million, a 10.0% decrease against 2021.\n\n## Adjusted revenue 1 by metal\n\n|                        | 2022        | 2022   | 2021        | 2021   |                             |                            |                              |        |\n|------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|--------|\n|                        | US$ million | %      | US$ million | %      | Volume variance US$ million | Price variance US$ million | Total net change US$ million | %      |\n| Gold                   | 1,114.2     | 42.9   | 1,305.2     | 45.8   | (194.0)                     | 2.9                        | (191.1)                      | (14.6) |\n| Silver                 | 1,089.2     | 41.9   | 1,163.9     | 40.9   | 77.8                        | (152.5)                    | (74.7)                       | (6.4)  |\n| Lead                   | 106.6       | 4.1    | 117.4       | 4.1    | (6.5)                       | (4.4)                      | (10.8)                       | (9.2)  |\n| Zinc                   | 287.2       | 11.1   | 261.3       | 9.2    | 1.0                         | 24.9                       | 25.9                         | 9.9    |\n| Total adjusted revenue | 2,597.2     | 100.0  | 2,847.9     | 100.0  | (121.7)                     | (129.0)                    | (250.7)                      | (8.8)  |\n\nThe decrease in volumes of gold sold were primarily due to the lower recovery rate and decrease in ore grade at Herradura and lower volumes of ore processed and ore grades at Noche Buena, Saucito and Ci\u00e9nega. This adverse effect was mitigated by the higher volumes of silver sold driven by the increase in silver production from Juanicipio and the higher ore throughput at Fresnillo (for further detail, see Review of operations). The total sale volume effect (lower gold and lead mitigated by higher silver and zinc volumes sold), resulted in an adverse impact on adjusted revenues of US$121.7 million, representing 48.5% of the total variation. The remaining 51.5% of the decrease in adjusted revenues was primarily explained by the lower silver price, mitigated by the higher price of zinc.\n\nChanges in the contribution by metal were the result of the relative changes in metals prices and volumes produced. The contribution of gold to total adjusted revenues decreased from 45.8% in 2021 to 42.9% in 2022, while that for silver increased from 40.9% in 2021 to 41.9% in 2022.\n\n## Adjusted revenue by mine\n\nDespite the 17.6% decrease in Adjusted revenues at Herradura, it continued to be the greatest contributor to the Group's Adjusted revenue, representing 24.4% (2021: 27.1%). Saucito's contribution reduced to 18.7% in 2022 (2021: 21.0%) primarily driven by the decrease in volumes of all metals sold and the lower silver price. Fresnillo remained the third most important contributor to Adjusted revenue, with its share increasing to 18.3% (2021: 16.1%). San Juli\u00e1n's contribution to the Group's Adjusted revenue decreased to 16.0% in 2022 (2021: 18.8%) primarily due to the lower volumes of silver and gold sold. Ci\u00e9nega's contribution to the Group's Adjusted revenue decreased to 6.9% (2021: 8.0%) as a result of the lower volumes of all metals sold. Noche Buena's contribution to Adjusted revenue decreased slightly to 5.5% in 2022 (6.0% in 2021).\n\nThe contribution by metal and by mine to Adjusted revenues is expected to change further in the future, as new projects are incorporated into the Group's operations and as precious metals prices fluctuate.\n\n|                    | 2022          | 2022   | 2021          | 2021   |\n|--------------------|---------------|--------|---------------|--------|\n|                    | (US$ million) | %      | (US$ million) | %      |\n| Herradura          | 634.9         | 24.4   | 770.8         | 27.1   |\n| Saucito            | 485.9         | 18.7   | 597.7         | 21.0   |\n| Fresnillo          | 475.8         | 18.3   | 459.5         | 16.1   |\n| Juanicipio         | 259.0         | 10.0   | 85.2          | 3.0    |\n| San Juli\u00e1n (DOB)   | 242.5         | 9.3    | 344.5         | 12.1   |\n| Ci\u00e9nega            | 180.3         | 6.9    | 227.8         | 8.0    |\n| San Juli\u00e1n (Veins) | 175.1         | 6.7    | 192.5         | 6.7    |\n| Noche Buena        | 143.8         | 5.5    | 169.9         | 6.0    |\n| Total              | 2,597.2       | 100    | 2,847.9       | 100    |",

The increase in treatment charges per tonne of lead and zinc, combined with the relatively stable volumes of lead and zinc concentrates shipped from our mines to Met-Mex, resulted in an 11.8% increase in treatment and refining charges set out in the income statement in absolute terms when compared to 2021.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\n| Concept                                                                           | 2022 US$ million   | 2021 US$ million   | Amount US$ million   | Change %   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted production costs 4                                                       | 1,445.8            | 1,255.1            | 190.7                | 15.2       |\n| Depreciation                                                                      | 500.6              | 528.2              | (27.6)               | (5.2)      |\n| Profit sharing                                                                    | 9.6                | 15.6               | (5.9)                | (38.2)     |\n| Hedging                                                                           | 0.0                | (3.8)              | 3.8                  | (100.0)    |\n| Change in work in progress                                                        | (61.6)             | (29.6)             | (32.0)               | 107.8      |\n| Unproductive costs including inventory reversal and unabsorbed production costs 5 | 2.6                | 0.8                | 1.8                  | >100       |\n| Cost of sales                                                                     | 1,897.0            | 1,766.2            | 130.8                | 7.4        |\n\nCost of sales increased 7.4% to US$1,897.0 million in 2022. The US$130.8 million increase is due to a combination of the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 An increase in Adjusted production costs (+US$190.7 million). This was primarily due to: i) cost inflation in US dollars 6 (US$101.2 million); ii) costs from the start-up of operations at Juanicipio (US$85.7 million); iii) increase in the use of infrastructure contractors, maintenance (electric and mechanical), operating materials and diesel (US$79.4 million); iv) higher volume of ore processed at Fresnillo and San Juli\u00e1n DOB (US$21.7 million); and v) others (US$3.7 million). These adverse effects were mitigated by lower stripping to cost at Herradura (-US$53.5 million); and a decrease in volume of ore processed at Saucito, Ci\u00e9nega, San Juli\u00e1n (Veins) (-US$47.5 million).\n- \u00b7 The variation in Mexican peso/US dollar hedging (+US$3.8 million). As part of our programme to manage our exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with costs incurred in Mexican pesos, we entered into a combination of put and call options structured at zero cost (collars) in 2021. These derivatives finally expired in March 2021 and they generated a positive result of US$3.8 million during the first quarter of 2021. As of 31 December 2022, there was no further outstanding position.\n- \u00b7 The variation in unproductive costs, which had an unfavourable effect of (+US$1.8 million). In 2022, US$2.6 million was registered as unproductive costs related to fixed production cost incurred in activities at the Juanicipio flotation plant; in 2021 US$18.0 million was registered in relation to fixed costs (labour cost and depreciation) incurred in Minera San Juli\u00e1n due to a shortfall in electricity.\n\nThese negative effects were mitigated by:\n\n- \u00b7 Depreciation (-US$27.6 million). This is mainly due to lower depreciation at San Juli\u00e1n and Ci\u00e9nega due to a lower depletion factor and at Noche Buena as it approaches the end of its mine life and the majority of the assets have been fully depreciated.\n- \u00b7 The variation in the change in work in progress had a favourable effect of US$32.0 million vs. 2021. This resulted mainly from the increase in inventories of ore at Juanicipio and gold content on the leaching pads at Herradura whereas in 2021 the positive effect was in relation to the reassessment of recoverable gold inventories at the leaching pads in 2021 together with the increase in the cost per ounce in the last quarter of the year at Herradura.\n- \u00b7 Profit sharing (-US$5.9 million) mainly due to lower profits.\n- 3 Treatment and refining charges include the cost of treatment and refining as well as the margin charged by the refiner.\n- 4 Adjusted production costs are calculated as cost of sales less depreciation, profit sharing, hedging, change in inventories and unproductive costs. The Company considers this a useful additional measure to help understand underlying factors driving production costs in terms of the different stages involved in the mining and plant processes, including efficiencies and inefficiencies as the case may be and other factors outside the Company's control such as cost inflation or changes in accounting criteria.\n- 5 Unproductive costs primarily include unabsorbed production costs such as fixed production cost (labour cost and depreciation) incurred in Minera San Juli\u00e1n due to a shortfall in electricity and fixed costs incurred in Minera Penmont during the temporary suspension of mining activities at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, and other costs related to the subsequent ramp-up of operations and the underutilisation of production capacity once mining activity was resumed. Unproductive costs are recognised within cost of sales but excluded from adjusted production costs.\n- 6 Cost inflation would have been 7.9% excluding the effect of the Mexican peso revaluation (0.8%).",

Juanicipio became the second largest contributor, reflecting the increased volumes of development material and ore processed at the Fresnillo and Saucito mines. Fresnillo became the third largest contributor to consolidated gross profit, increasing its percentage share from 14.9% in 2021 to 19.6% in 2022, while the lower production and higher costs at Saucito decreased its participation from 22.7% in 2021 to 18.4% in 2022. Similarly, the lower gross profit generated at San Juli\u00e1n decreased its share of the Group's total gross profit to 11.3% in 2022. The decrease in production volumes, together with the cost pressures, affected profitability at Ci\u00e9nega and Noche Buena. Notwithstanding, both mines generated an EBITDA of US$19.2 million and US$34.5 million respectively, and cash flow from operating activities of US$25.4 million and US$40.8 million.\n\n## Contribution by mine to consolidated gross profit, excluding hedging gains and losses\n\n|                                      | 2022        | 2022   | 2021        | 2021   | Change      | Change   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|\n|                                      | US$ million | %      | US$ million | %      | US$ million | %        |\n| Herradura                            | 147.1       | 27.5   | 281.1       | 30.6   | (134.0)     | (47.7)   |\n| Juanicipio                           | 132.8       | 24.8   | 53.5        | 5.8    | 79.3        | 148.2    |\n| Fresnillo                            | 104.8       | 19.6   | 136.7       | 14.9   | (31.9)      | (23.3)   |\n| Saucito                              | 98.5        | 18.4   | 208.7       | 22.7   | (110.2)     | (52.8)   |\n| San Juli\u00e1n                           | 60.3        | 11.3   | 173.1       | 18.8   | (112.8)     | (65.2)   |\n| Noche Buena                          | 3.3         | 0.6    | 23.5        | 2.6    | (20.2)      | (86.0)   |\n| Ci\u00e9nega                              | (11.3)      | (2.1)  | 42.5        | 4.6    | (53.8)      | (126.6)  |\n| Total for operating mines            | 535.5       | 100    | 919.1       | 100    | (383.6)     | (41.7)   |\n| Metal hedging and other subsidiaries | 0.5         |        | 17.8        |        | (17.3)      | (97.2)   |\n| Total Fresnillo plc                  | 536.0       |        | 936.9       |        | (400.9)     | (42.8)   |\n\n## Administrative and corporate expenses\n\nAdministrative and corporate expenses decreased 9.1% from US$103.5 million in 2021 to US$94.1 million in 2022, due to the decrease in fees paid to advisors (legal, labour, tax and technical).\n\n## Exploration expenses\n\n| Business unit/project (US$ million)   |   Exploration  expenses 2022 |   Exploration  expenses 2021 | Capitalised  expenses 2022   | Capitalised  expenses 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Ci\u00e9nega                               |                          7.2 |                          6.4 | -                            | -                            |\n| Fresnillo                             |                         12.3 |                          6.1 | -                            | -                            |\n| Herradura                             |                          4.8 |                          6.1 | -                            | -                            |\n| Saucito                               |                         12   |                         15   | -                            | -                            |\n| Noche Buena                           |                          1.4 |                          1   | -                            | -                            |\n| San Juli\u00e1n                            |                         24.6 |                         22.6 | -                            | -                            |\n| Orisyvo                               |                          4   |                          5.2 | -                            | 0.1                          |\n| Centauro Deep                         |                          0.5 |                          0.2 | -                            | -                            |\n| Guanajuato                            |                         11.6 |                          8.1 | 1.0                          | 1.0                          |\n| Juanicipio                            |                         11.7 |                          0   | -                            | 8.1                          |\n| Valles (Herradura)                    |                          5.8 |                          5.1 | -                            | -                            |\n| Others                                |                         69.9 |                         54.5 | 0.8                          | 0.6                          |\n| Total                                 |                        165.8 |                        130.3 | 1.8                          | 9.8                          |",

        "page_content": "As expected, exploration expenses increased by 27.2% from US$130.3 million in 2021 to US$165.8 million in 2022, in line with our strategy to focus exploration on specific targets, mainly at the Fresnillo and San Juli\u00e1n districts. The year-on-year increase of US$35.5 million was due to our intensified exploration activities aimed at increasing the resource base, converting resources into reserves and improving the confidence of the grade distribution in reserves. An additional US$1.8 million was capitalised, mainly relating to exploration expenses at the Guanajuato project. As a result, risk capital invested in exploration totalled US$167.6 million in 2022, compared to US$140.1 million in 2021 (of which US$9.8 million was capitalised). This represents a year-on-year increase of 19.6%.\n\n## EBITDA\n\n|                                                     | 2022 US$ million   | 2021 US$ million   | Amount US$ million   | Change %   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Profit from continuing operations before income tax | 248.6              | 611.5              | (363.0)              | (59.4)     |\n| - Finance income                                    | (26.5)             | (8.9)              | (17.6)               | >100       |\n| + Finance costs                                     | 81.6               | 61.8               | 19.8                 | 32.0       |\n| - Revaluation effects of Silverstream contract      | (18.8)             | 0.4                | (19.2)               | N/A        |\n| - Foreign exchange loss, net                        | (1.4)              | 1.9                | (3.3)                | N/A        |\n| - Other operating income                            | (71.9)             | (11.9)             | (60.0)               | >100       |\n| + Other operating expense                           | 38.8               | 23.3               | 15.5                 | 66.5       |\n| + Depreciation                                      | 500.6              | 528.2              | (27.6)               | (5.2)      |\n| EBITDA                                              | 751.1              | 1,206.3            | (455.2)              | (37.7)     |\n| EBITDA margin                                       | 30.9               | 44.6               | -                    | -          |\n\nEBITDA is a gauge of the Group's financial performance and a key indicator to measure debt capacity. It is calculated as profit for the year from continuing operations before income tax, less finance income, plus finance costs, less foreign exchange gain/(loss), less the net Silverstream effects and other operating income plus other operating expenses and depreciation. In 2022, EBITDA decreased 37.7% to US$751.1 million primarily driven by the lower gross profit and higher exploration expenses. As a result, EBITDA margin expressed as a percentage of revenue decreased, from 44.6% in 2021 to 30.9% in 2022.\n\n## Other operating income and expense\n\nIn 2022, a net gain of US$33.1 million was recognised in the income statement mainly as a result of the recognition of the layback agreement granting Orla the right to expand the Camino Rojo pit onto Fresnillo's mining concession.\n\n## Silverstream effects\n\nThe Silverstream contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value. The net Silverstream effect recorded in the 2022 income statement was a gain of US$18.8 million (US$40.0 million amortisation profit and US$21.2 million revaluation loss), which compared positively to the net loss of US$0.4 million registered in 2021. The negative revaluation was mainly driven by the increase in the SOFR reference rate and the lower forward silver price curve, partly mitigated by an increase in the production plan following an update to the Sabinas silver reserves and a higher inflation forecast.\n\nSince the IPO, cumulative cash received has been US$769.7 million vs. US$350 million initially paid in 2007. The Group expects that further unrealised gains or losses related to the valuation of the Silverstream will be taken to the income statement in accordance with silver price cyclicality or changes in the variables considered in valuing this contract. Further information related to the Silverstream contract is provided in the balance sheet section in notes 14 and 30 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Net finance costs\n\nNet finance costs of US$55.2 million compared favourably to the US$52.9 million recorded in 2021. The US$2.3 million increase was primarily due to the voluntary amendments applied from 2014 to 2021 to the income tax and mining rights' treatment of the stripping costs and the deduction of exploration expenses. In addition, the 2022 net finance costs mainly reflected: i) interest paid on the outstanding US$317.9 million from the US$800 million of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2023, and ii) interest paid on the US$850 million principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050. Detailed information is provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. A portion of the interest from the Senior Notes is capitalised, hence not included in finance costs. During the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group capitalised US$8.5 million of borrowing costs (2021: US$8.4 million).\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nA foreign exchange gain of US$1.4 million was recorded in 2022, which compared favourably to the US$1.9 million loss in 2021.\n\nThe Group also enters into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with the purchase of equipment denominated in Euro (EUR). As of 31 December 2022, the total EUR outstanding net forward position was EUR 12.72 million with maturity dates through December 2023. Volumes that expired during the second half of 2022 were EUR 20.47 million with a weighted average strike of 1.0758 USD/EUR, which have generated a marginal result in the period of -US$2.4 million.\n\n## Taxation\n\nTax income for the period was US$67.4 million, which compared favourably to the US$156.5 million tax expense in 2021. The effective tax rate, excluding the special mining rights, was -27.1%, which was below the 30% statutory tax rate. The reasons for the unusual positive effective tax rate was the significant permanent differences between the tax and the accounting treatment related mainly to: i) the effect of the 5.9% revaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate in 2022 versus the 2.0% devaluation in 2021 on the tax value of assets and liabilities (-US$72.9 million); ii) the inflation rate (Mexican Consumer Price Index), which impacted the inflationary uplift of the tax base for assets and liabilities (-US$62.7 million); and ii) the benefit from the lower border zone tax which applied to Herradura and Noche Buena operations (-US$17.5 million) vs. the US$74.6 million which resulted from applying the 30% statutory tax rate.",

        "page_content": "## Financial review continued\n\nThe reason for the lower effective tax rate in 2021 was the significant permanent differences between the tax and the accounting treatment related mainly to: i) the inflation rate which impacted the inflationary uplift of the tax base for assets and liabilities (-US$49.4 million); ii) the border zone tax benefit which benefited the Herradura and Noche Buena operations (-US$10.1 million); and iii) special mining rights taxable for corporate income tax (-US$5.0 million). These factors were partially offset by: i) the devaluation of the Mexican peso which had an important impact on the tax value of assets and liabilities (US$32.1 million); and ii) deferred tax assets not recognised (US$6.5 million).\n\nMining rights in 2022 were US$7.7 million compared to US$16.6 million charged in 2021. The effective tax rate, including mining rights, was -24.0% in 2022.\n\n## Profit for the period\n\nProfit for the period decreased from US$438.5 million in 2021 to US$308.3 million in 2022, a 29.7% decrease year-on-year as a result of the factors described above.\n\nExcluding the effects of the Silverstream contract, profit for the year decreased from US$438.8 million to US$295.1 million, a 32.7% decrease.\n\nProfit due to non-controlling interests was US$36.4 million reflecting the profit generated at Juanicipio, where MAG Silver owns 44% of the outstanding shares. Accordingly, profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group was US$271.9 million.\n\n## Cash flow\n\nA summary of the key items from the cash flow statement is set out below:\n\n|                                                                                      | 2022 US$ million   | 2021 US$ million   | Amount US$ million   | Change %   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Cash generated by operations before changes in working capital                       | 743.1              | 1,208.3            | (465.2)              | (38.5)     |\n| (Increase)/decrease in working capital                                               | (66.1)             | 58.0               | (124.1)              | N/A        |\n| Taxes and employee profit sharing paid                                               | (174.7)            | (371.1)            | 196.4                | 52.9       |\n| Net cash from operating activities                                                   | 502.2              | 895.1              | (393.0)              | (43.9)     |\n| Silverstream contract                                                                | 33.4               | 49.0               | (15.6)               | (31.9)     |\n| Capital contributions and loans by minority shareholders                             | 18.3               | 73.6               | (55.4)               | (75.2)     |\n| Proceeds from the layback agreement                                                  | 15.0               | 25.0               | (10.0)               | (40.0)     |\n| Purchase of property, plant and equipment                                            | (592.1)            | (592.1)            | 0.0                  | 0.0        |\n| Dividends paid to shareholders of the Company                                        | (202.0)            | (245.6)            | 43.6                 | 17.8       |\n| Financial expenses and foreign exchange effects                                      | (36.5)             | (39.9)             | 3.4                  | 8.5        |\n| Net (decrease)/increase in cash during the period after foreign exchange differences | (266.2)            | 164.9              | (431.1)              | N/A        |\n| Cash and other liquid funds at 31 December 1                                         | 969.1              | 1,235.3            | (266.2)              | (21.6)     |\n\nCash generated by operations before changes in working capital decreased by 38.5% to US$743.1 million, mainly as a result of the lower profits generated in the year. Working capital increased US$66.1 million, mainly due to: i) an increase in ore inventories of US$99.6 million; and ii) a US$14.1 million increase in prepayments mainly to contractors. This was partly offset by: i) a US$51.8 million increase in accounts payable (mainly suppliers); and ii) a US$7.2 million decrease in accounts receivable.\n\nTaxes and employee profit sharing paid decreased 52.9% over 2021 to US$174.7 million mainly due to: i) a decrease in provisional tax payments resulting from the lower profit factor determined to calculate the estimated taxable income and lower revenue; and ii) lower final income tax paid in 2022, net of provisional taxes paid, corresponding to the 2021 tax fiscal year.\n\nAs a result of the above factors, net cash from operating activities decreased 43.9% from US$895.1 million in 2021 to US$502.2 million in 2022.\n\nThe Group received other sources of cash, including: i) the proceeds of the Silverstream contract of US$33.4 million; ii) the capital contribution and note payable by minority shareholders in subsidiaries of US$18.3 million; and iii) proceeds from the layback agreement granting Orla the right to expand the Camino Rojo oxide pit onto Fresnillo's mineral concession of US$15.0 million (See note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).",

The 2022 payment included the 2021 final dividend of 24.0 cents per share paid in May 2022, totalling US$176.9 million, and the 2022 interim dividend paid in September of US$25.1 million.\n- iii) Financial expenses and foreign exchange effects of US$36.5 million, an increase of 8.5% vs. 2021, mainly as a result of the interests paid in relation to the voluntary amendment to the income tax and mining rights' treatment of the stripping costs and the deduction of exploration expenses. In addition, financial expenses in 2022 and 2021 included: i) interest paid on the outstanding US$317.9 million from the US$800 million 5.500% Senior Notes due 2023; and ii) interest paid on the 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050.\n\nThe sources and uses of funds described above resulted in a decrease in net cash of US$266.2 million (net decrease in cash and other liquid assets), which combined with the US$1,235.3 million balance at the beginning of the year resulted in cash and other liquid assets of US$969.1 million at the end of December 2022.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nFresnillo plc continued to maintain a solid financial position during the period with cash and other liquid funds 1 of US$969.1 million as of 31 December 2022, despite decreasing 21.6% versus 31 December 2021. Taking into account the cash and other liquid funds of US$969.1 million and the US$1,167.8 million outstanding Senior Notes, Fresnillo plc's net debt was US$198.7 million as of 31 December 2022. This compares to the net cash position of US$67.5 million as of 31 December 2021. Considering these variations, the balance sheet at 31 December 2022 remains strong, with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.26x 2 .\n\nInventories increased 20.4% to US$587.4 million mainly due to the increase of inventories of gold content to be processed at the dynamic leaching plants at Herradura, the build up of inventory at Juanicipio, and increased inventories of operating materials and spare parts.\n\nTrade and other receivables increased 0.8% to US$404.5 million as a result of an increase in receivables to Met-Mex and other receivables arising from the layback agreement with Orla; partly offset by a decrease in value added tax receivables.\n\nThe change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US$529.5 million at the end of 2021 to US$511.5 million as of 31 December 2022 reflects proceeds of US$36.8 million corresponding to 2022 (US$28.5 million in cash and US$8.3 million in accounts receivables) and the Silverstream effect in the income statement of US$18.8 million.\n\nThe net book value of property, plant and equipment was US$2,862.6 million at 31 December 2022, representing a 2.3% increase over 31 December 2021. The US$63.5 million increase was mainly due to capitalised development works, construction of leaching pads and the purchase of in-mine equipment.\n\nThe Group's total equity was US$3,916.9 million as of 31 December 2021, a 3.0% increase over 31 December 2021. This was mainly explained by the increase in retained earnings, reflecting the 2022 profit.\n\n## Dividends\n\nBased on the Group's 2022 performance, the Directors have recommended a final dividend of 13.3 US cents per Ordinary Share, which will be paid on 26 May 2023 to shareholders on the register on 28 April 2023. The dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling unless shareholders elect to be paid in US dollars. This is in addition to the interim dividend of 3.4 US cents per share amounting to US$25.1 million. This final dividend is lower than the previous year due to the decrease in profits in 2022, and remains in line with the Group's dividend policy (see page 7).\n\nAs disclosed in previous reports, the corporate income tax reform introduced in Mexico in 2014 created a withholding tax obligation of 10% relating to the payment of dividends, including to foreign nationals. However, foreign shareholders may be able to recover such tax depending on their tax residence and the existence of double taxation agreements.\n\n- 1 Cash and other liquid funds are disclosed in note 31(c) to the consolidated financial statements.\n- 2 Net debt is calculated as debt at 31 December 2022 less Cash and other liquid funds at 31 December 2022 divided by the EBITDA generated in the last 12 months.",

Our ethical and responsible way of doing business spans the full mining value chain, supported by a strong governance structure. On behalf of the Board, the Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations (HSECR) Committee actively engages with management to provide oversight on the effectiveness of the Company's strategies and practices on environmental, social and governance (ESG) related issues. As Chairman of the HSECR Committee, I am pleased to present the principal activities that the Committee undertook during the year.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic continued to present a significant challenge to our organisation and required us to continually adapt and evolve our daily practices. During the year, senior management and the HSECR Committee evaluated prevention protocols and engagement strategies. We will continue to be cautious in order to safeguard the wellbeing of our workforce and neighbouring communities. Thanks to the Company's efforts, I am pleased to report that there were no Covid-19 related deaths in 2022 within our workforce.\n\nDespite our sustained efforts to improve our safety performance by eliminating fatalities and also decreasing the frequency of injuries - where we have made progress - I deeply regret having to report that one of our colleagues was involved in a fatal accident in early 2022; our most sincere condolences go to his family. This incident is unacceptable and serves as a stark reminder that we have yet to secure the complete safety of our workforce. To address this, we have pledged to set and work towards reduction targets in our Fatality Rate and Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) with the objective of achieving the benchmark ranges set by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). In addition to regularly scrutinising each mine's safety performance, the Committee evaluated the creation of the new 'I Care, We Care' Operational Committee, which ensures the effective implementation of critical risks, incident management and execution of lessons learnt regarding near-misses across all mining units. We will continue to hold ourselves accountable for - and be transparent about - our safety performance, with a particular focus on prevention in those areas of greatest risk.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The Committee has also closely monitored management's efforts to ensure the safe operation of tailings storage facilities (TSFs), tracking progress in technical practices and corporate governance, as well as independent expert panel reviews, among other measures and significant investments. In addition, the Committee has overseen the implementation of best practices for TSFs, such as the deployment of a Potential Failure Mode Analysis (PFMA) pilot at Saucito and two simulation drills to test our Emergency Response Plans (ERPs) at Saucito and Penmont, in order to assess controls, train personnel and improve emergency response times. Finally, we have designed strategic KPIs in order to evaluate the storage capacity with respect to the life of the mine, stability and operational continuity.\n\nThe TSF at Juanicipio is our first tailings deposit that has been designed and built from the very start under the international standards of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC). Furthermore, the San Carlos (Fresnillo) deposit is the first one that was initially built under local standards but which during 2022 was updated to the MAC standards. Both TSFs now benefit from the expertise of an internationally recognised Engineer of Record, as part of the Company's overall ongoing efforts to enhance the TSF governance structure at all its sites. The Company prioritises the integrity of its TSFs and we will leverage these learnings to implement improvements across all our sites.\n\nAdditionally, we took an important step towards improving the management and efficiency of our water systems and strategies by allocating responsibility for these matters to the TSF management group, and we expect this to lead to significant synergies.\n\nThe closure plan for the Noche Buena mining unit was initiated in 2021, with a defined 20-year post-closure period. The Company is committed to restoring the land, eliminating all operationrelated infrastructure as per the phased closure requirements. During 2022, management conducted thorough evaluations of technical and environmental factors. We will actively seek to involve stakeholders in the closure process in order to establish a shared vision and make all relevant information publicly available.\n\nThe Company has been working closely with Mexican authorities to ensure the successful logistics of vaccination efforts, not only for our workforce but also for the neighbouring communities in San Juli\u00e1n, Ci\u00e9nega and Penmont. We believe that these partnerships are key to significantly increasing vaccination coverage in these areas, thereby protecting the health and wellbeing of our workforce and communities. Furthermore, the Company supported the safe return to school in the regions where we operate with preventive measures, awareness campaigns and donations of masks and hygiene supplies. We have also fully reinstated the Community Health Week across our units and advanced exploration projects with the support of the\n\nNational Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) Foundation and by partnering with different local and federal authorities and civil society organisations. In addition, we partnered with United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation's (UNESCO) Office for Climate Education, Zacatecas' Education and Science Ministries and INNOVEC in order to enhance education efforts on climate change. We are committed to investing in the education of our communities, and we believe this partnership will have a positive impact.\n\nIt was disappointing to learn that, together with other companies, Fresnillo has been dropped from the FTSE4Good index for not meeting the FTSE4Good minimum Climate Change Score requirement. However, this should not obscure the fact that on average over the past four years, approximately 47% of our electricity needs have come from renewable sources and we are also substituting diesel for liquified natural gas (LNG) at some of our operations. Furthermore, we are also implementing energy efficiency measures such as 'on demand' ventilation systems, haulage route optimisation and harmonic filters. These actions have contributed to reducing our carbon footprint and we are committed to further reductions. However, this decision by FTSE4Good underlines the need for our climate change strategy and communications to develop further, and we are absolutely committed to doing so and to returning to the index in the near future.\n\nTo this end, the HSECR Committee oversaw two projects during the year that will contribute to the overall maturity of the Company's response to climate change: the regional climate models project, which will define climate variables across our operations to improve business planning; and the development of a climate-risk management system. The Committee also reviewed the results and recommendations of two Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report benchmarks with the support of independent consultants. We believe that these actions will enable better assessment and management of reporting gaps and areas for improvement, as we work towards full compliance with the TCFD's 11 recommendations.\n\nWe remain dedicated to thoroughly evaluating and promoting the Company's HSECR strategy and overall HSECR performance. We also recognise that sustainability is an ongoing journey and we will continue to focus on improving our ethical and sustainable practices throughout our operations.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n## Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez\n\nChairman, Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations Committee\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe role and duties of the HSECR Committee are set out in its terms of reference, a copy of which can be found on the Company's website at www.fresnilloplc.com\n\n## HSECR Committee Membership\n\n- \u00b7 Mr Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez (Chairman), Dame Judith Macgregor, Mr Fernando Ruiz and Mrs Georgina Kessel.\n- \u00b7 Key contributors: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, CEO Engineering Services (Pe\u00f1oles Baluarte), Safety and Environment Assistant VP, Head of Legal, Health Corporate Manager, Sustainability and Community Relations Assistant VP (Pe\u00f1oles Baluarte) and Health, Safety and Environment Assistant VP (Pe\u00f1oles Baluarte).\n\n## HSECR Committee Activity\n\nDuring the year, the Committee met in accordance with its terms of reference.\n\nWe continue to pursue our goals for the consumption of renewable energy, through the optimisation of our current energy portfolio allocation; however, the current energy sector regulatory environment in Mexico has generated delays in administrative processes, thereby slowing progress towards our short-term targets. The Company is committed to developing a pragmatic, clear and reasonable decarbonisation roadmap that balances economic realities, current technological limitations and regulatory uncertainty. By transparently communicating the progress of our strategy, we are confident that we will earn and maintain stakeholders' trust in our direction and efforts to address climate change.",

This underlines the importance of integrating responsible business practices deeply into our business model and considering factors that affect stakeholders at every critical decisionmaking level. The year saw many examples of our Purpose 'to contribute to the wellbeing of people through the sustainable mining of silver and gold' in action. For example, following a steady decrease in the frequency of injuries across our operations over the last five years, we have recently pledged to eliminate fatalities and reduce our TRIFR next year by 5%. In addition, the evolution of our wellbeing programmes and DEI strategies demonstrate that we not only prioritise the safety of our workforce, but also that we foster an environment in which they can strive for personal and professional satisfaction. Secondly, our track record of excellence in the safety and governance of TSFs and our partnerships and social investment initiatives, prove that we are a responsible neighbour and that we care for our stakeholders. In addition, increasing the share of renewables in our portfolio and pledging to substitute freshwater for wastewater in our processes in the Fresnillo District show our commitment to reducing the impact of our operations on the environment. Furthermore, external awards and recognitions regarding our transparency and ethical way of doing business, such as the WDI Award nomination, indicate the open way in which we conduct our operations.\n\n## Social-Compatibility Strategy\n\nDuring the year, we launched a strategy coordinated both internally and with our parent company, Industrias Pe\u00f1oles - to generate trust in society while guaranteeing the permanence of our business. This strategy centres around improving our ESG performance in line with national and international standards, anticipating stakeholders' and broader society's demands, and consolidating our approach to ESG. This new governance\n\nstructure comprises an Executive Committee, a Technical Committee, and ESG Networks and working groups. The working groups address our most relevant material issues: Climate Change, Water, Human Rights, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Health and Security, Biodiversity, Tailings Storage Facilities, Mine Closure and Value Chain. We will continue to report progress in future years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We expect not only our workforce, but also all related third parties, to consistently embody and adhere to them. To further promote ethical decision-making and align our behaviour with our overall strategy, in 2013 we began a journey to embed ethics into our organisational culture, implementing a framework known as 'Step-Up' culture: in the first phase (2013-2016), our objective was the reduction of behavioural risk - the gap between intended, expressed and actual behaviours. The second phase (2016-present) has focused on raising awareness and developing the ethical decisionmaking competencies of our people.\n\nI've just recently joined the Company and the CRIL Forum helped me a lot to understand the vision and relevance of the values that govern our Company more thoroughly.

This survey aimed to determine how our values are being upheld and to identify behaviours that are not aligned with those demanded by our Code of Conduct. From the 20 evaluated items, we identified both the three higher and the three lower performers, with the latter requiring focused efforts for improvement.\n\nAdditionally, we deploy the Ethics Quotient survey, developed by Ethisphere \u2122 , to regularly assess and monitor our ethics culture, as well as track our progress towards maintaining and improving these standards. Based on the Culture Quotient, we plan to measure improvements in ethical culture in 2023. This will allow us to benchmark ourselves against both our peers and our past performance (2016 and 2020), focusing our improvement efforts on the perceived integrity environment.\n\nThe year also saw us hold the first CRIL Forum, a three-day online event with the aim of promoting our ethics and compliance culture and the internalisation of our Code of Conduct's expected behaviours and institutional values. Compliance topics were discussed at round tables, panels, and in interviews with experts. The format was designed to address relevant issues in an interactive way that encouraged open and candid\n\ndiscussions, which our people could access through a virtual platform to express their opinions and concerns. The topic 'Operating with integrity' was discussed in a novel format, with deputy directors from different areas drawing on their own experiences to present the values that make up our integrity culture, explain how day-to-day activities contribute to integrity, and explore the risks arising from unethical behaviours as well as how to address them.\n\nFurthermore, our affiliation with the Centre for Leadership Ethics of the University of Arizona enables us to support programmes such as the International Collegiate Ethics Case Competition, which challenges future leaders to consider ethical decision-making. This competition is participated in by universities across the United States, Mexico, Canada and Europe. Additionally, we are also members of the Business Ethics Leadership Alliance (BELA) and were among the founders of its Mexican Chapter.\n\n## Training and capacity building\n\nOur compliance communications strategy engages our entire workforce through various channels, such as emails, posters, videos, computer screensavers and a dedicated internal portal for ethics and compliance topics in order to ensure that key aspects of our Code of Conduct and internal policies are effectively communicated and understood. Our workforce also undergoes mandatory online training to set expectations for desired behaviours. In addition, we use periodic compulsory courses to strengthen our workforce's knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 The Code of Conduct course has two elements: Firstly, we provide an onboarding course which covers key compliance policies, such as donations, political contributions, promotional expenses, government relations and the use of the whistleblowing line, with new personnel required to complete an evaluation and an endorsement of the Code. Secondly, every year all our workforce is subject to a compulsory exercise that underlines the Code's main subjects and tests workers' knowledge through an evaluation; it also requires them to declare potential\n\n## Results of performance in the 2022 integrity environment survey\n\n## Where we perform well\n\n- \u00b7 There is a written Code of Conduct that includes detailed guidance on acceptable behaviour in the Company.\n- \u00b7 There is a clear understanding of what bribery and corruption are, the possible situations where they could materialise and the means of reporting them.\n- \u00b7 There is a clear understanding of what a conflict of interest is, the possible situations where it may materialise and how to declare it.\n\nconflicts of interest and endorse their commitment to integrity.\n\n- \u00b7 The Labour and Sexual Harassment course is intended to educate our non-unionised workers on the basic concepts of where and when harassment may occur, our zero-tolerance stance and what mechanism they can use to report any situations that they may experience or witness.\n- \u00b7 The Bribery and Fraud Prevention course was updated during the first half and is compulsory for all our non-unionised workers. It aims to educate them on what constitutes bribery and fraud, the applicable laws, the Company's systems and procedures for preventing these actions, and how to report any concerns or suspicions. In order to demonstrate successful completion of the training, workers must pass an assessment with a minimum grade.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe CRIL Forum guided me to better understand conflicts of interest and the importance of reporting them, as well as how unethical acts can harm us as an organisation and as individuals.'\n\nFlor de Mar\u00eda Guzm\u00e1n Muro\n\n## Where we can do better\n\n- \u00b7 The Company's culture is open in dealing with ethics and integrity issues and avoids retaliation for raising concerns or reporting unethical behaviours.\n- \u00b7 Our whistleblowing line 'L\u00ednea Correcta' is a reliable and confidential mechanism for reporting unethical conduct.\n- \u00b7 Our workforce understands the Company's Purpose and contributes to its achievement.",

The Harassment Prevention Programme supports a positive work environment by providing online training that enables all new non-unionised personnel to identify, prevent and report any potential cases of labour and sexual harassment. Additionally, we have continued conducting face-to-face awareness workshops which have helped establish trust in the reporting mechanism. We experienced a welcome decrease in the number of sexual harassment reports in 2022, following a spike in such cases in 2021.\n\nThese workshops promote a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere for sharing ideas and experiences, and equip participants with skills to address harassment through hands-on activities and group dynamics. Attendees typically respond positively and are able to challenge and re-\n\n## Cases 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexamine previously accepted norms, such as male chauvinism or gender violence, and gain new perspectives and strategies for addressing these issues. These workshops are delivered by our internal teams in two different formats, with a total of 1,453 employees and contractors (both new and existing) receiving training during the period, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Six-hour on-site training sessions for employees, focusing on their leadership role to drive a culture of zero tolerance towards harassment; and\n- \u00b7 Four-hour on-site training sessions for unionised employees and contractors to raise awareness of how to avoid risks and discourage harassment behaviours.\n\nAs part of the programme, a competition was held among our business units to improve understanding of labour and sexual harassment.

The line is operated by Ethics Global, an external third-party provider, which ensures the anonymity of whistle-blowers when filing a report. The whistleblowing mechanism is available to employees, contractors and other stakeholders such as suppliers and members of surrounding communities. The reports received through the whistleblowing line are reviewed quarterly by the Honour Commission and monitored by the Audit Committee. Twice a year, the Board of Directors also receives such reports at its meetings. As expected, the inappropriate behaviour at work and sexual harassment cases have also decreased as a consequence of the Harassment Prevention Programme deployment and continued awareness sessions delivered to our people.\n\n## What's next\n\n- \u00b7 Continue our efforts to eliminate all forms of workplace violence, raising awareness to prevent labour and sexual harassment, and strengthening confidence in our whistleblowing mechanism.\n- \u00b7 Continue to provide onboarding training for all personnel in harassment and fraud prevention, with particular focus on designing specific training for areas and personnel with greater probability of facing bribery risk.\n- \u00b7 Perform an ethical culture evaluation to benchmark our progress against our previous performance and our peers.\n- Whistleblowing - Number of reports\n\nWhistleblowing - Number of cases\n\n- Tone from the top - Number of reports related to managers\n- Discipline - Number of disciplinary actions\n- Discipline - Number of control reinforcement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are dedicated to ensuring that these practices are not present in any aspect of our business or supply chain. As part of our Purpose to contribute to the wellbeing of people through the sustainable mining of silver and gold, we prioritise the promotion of best practices and the identification and mitigation of any negative impacts on human rights.\n\nWe take our responsibility seriously and strive to work collaboratively with all stakeholders to raise awareness and prevent modern slavery in all its forms. In 2022, we continued to implement our Code of Conduct for third parties, which clearly states that all partners must commit to safeguard their employees' human and labour rights, treating everyone with respect in a way that preserves their dignity and does not discriminate or violate their basic human rights and freedoms.\n\nMexico recently enacted legislation to regulate the subcontracting of workers to ensure compliance with labour and social security obligations. The reform only allows subcontracting when specialised services are not related to the contractor's core business and requires that they are duly registered as suppliers of specialised services with the Mexican Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. Our Executive Committee implemented a strategy to hire contractor personnel and reinforced controls to ensure compliance with tax and labour obligations. Prior to the reform, the Company had already implemented a third-party code of conduct and conducted audits to ensure contractors met social security obligations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, please refer to our website for the latest available report www.fresnilloplc. com/corporate-responsibility/modern-slavery/\n\nDue diligence assessments of third parties' ethical profile\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bribery and corruption prevention\n\nThe ethical behaviour of our people is key to achieving the Company's purpose.

All personnel must strictly comply with the applicable laws related to bribery and corruption to which Fresnillo plc is subject, including the UK Bribery Act 2010, the Mexican General Law of Administrative Accountability, the Mexican Federal Criminal Code, and the federal and state secondary laws applicable to the private sector in relation to anticorruption. Disciplinary measures for persons who engage directly or indirectly through a third party in bribery and corruption include, in addition to any measures following legal action, up to the termination of their employment contract if part of our workforce, and up to the termination of our business relationship in case of a third party.\n\nOur policy is to:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintain a zero-tolerance stance regarding any form of corruption and bribery.\n- \u00b7 Report suspected bribery and corruption through our institutional whistleblowing mechanism ('Linea Correcta').\n- \u00b7 Investigate all bribery and corruption reports.\n- \u00b7 Avoid doing business with third parties where concerns have been raised regarding bribery or corruption, or suspicions raised that the third party may engage in such activities on our behalf, following our analysis and due diligence evaluation process.\n- \u00b7 Record transactions accurately and transparently in accounting books and accounts.",

We aim to build healthy relationships with these parties while also managing potential risks of bribery, corruption, money laundering, fraud and human rights violations.\n\nBefore doing business with a third party, we conduct a due diligence of their ethical profile. The depth of this review is proportionate to the identified risks and according to the type, core business and characteristics of each party. We continually monitor compliance and may amend arrangements with third parties as needed. If the risks associated with a third party cannot be mitigated, the business relationship will be suspended. We have been conducting due diligence on third parties since 2013, improving our review and investigation capabilities, and recommending mitigation measures such as training, clarifying adverse media, enhancing contract clauses and internal authorisation, and enhancing audit rights, based on encountered risks, with an average of 430 assessments per year. In 2021, we experienced an unusual increase in due diligence as a consequence of the Mexican Labour Reform.\n\n## Government payment transparency\n\nMining can drive economic and social progress when done responsibly. However, corruption and inadequate governance can undermine the benefits that society should receive from mining revenue. At Fresnillo plc, we believe that transparency in government payments fosters trust and strengthens society.\n\nAs required by the UK Reports on Payments to Governments Regulation 2014, its amendment in December 2015 and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), since 2016 we have reported an overview of payments to governments made by our Company and its subsidiaries during the previous reporting year.\n\nThe payments disclosed are those arising from activities involving the exploration, prospecting, discovery, development and extraction of minerals (extractive activities), based on materiality established by such regulations (where a payment or a series or related payments have exceeded \u00a386,000).\n\nThe type of payments that were disclosed for the 2022 fiscal year are:\n\n- \u00b7 Taxes. There are taxes paid by Fresnillo on its income, including special mining rights. In accordance with the UK Regulations payments made in relation to consumption, sales or employee taxes were excluded.\n- \u00b7 Royalties.\n- \u00b7 Licence fees, rental fees, entry fees and other considerations for licences or concessions. These are fees paid as consideration for acquiring a licence for gaining access to an area where extractive activities are performed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, please refer to our website for the latest available Report on payments to governments.\n\n## Transparency and accountability\n\nTransparency and accountability for social and environmental impact are crucial in establishing trust. By disclosing important non-financial information, we enable our investors to make better investment decisions. Mitigating negative impact is crucial to ensuring our business model is socially responsible. We therefore conduct regular perception studies in the communities where we operate, monitor media, hold regular meetings with stakeholders, and operate grievance mechanisms to engage people who might be adversely affected by our activities.\n\nWe disclose our environmental, social and governance (ESG) information using the appropriate channels, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).\n- \u00b7 Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA).\n- \u00b7 Ethisphere BELA.\n- \u00b7 Meetings and traditional media to inform local stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Modern Slavery Report.\n- \u00b7 Website.\n- \u00b7 Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI).\n\n## What's next\n\n- \u00b7 Implement an automated tool to standardise and optimise the due diligence process, including documentation.\n- \u00b7 Continue our participation in CDP, CSA, WDI and Ethisphere BELA transparency and accountability initiatives.\n- \u00b7 Work together with contractors to identify how we can build capabilities to preserve a sustainable value chain.\n\nPayments to local governments (US$)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPayments to federal government (US$)\n\n<!-- image -->",

We respect labour rights and regulations and engage in constructive dialogue with union representatives. Our workforce comprises unionised employees, non-unionised employees and contractors. Over the years, we have managed to steadily increase the percentage of women in our total workforce, closing the gap on the country average (16.3%); in some of our units, we even surpass this figure (specifically Saucito, Herradura, Juanicipio and Corporate).

To stay attuned to their needs, we engage in regular discussions with our Designated Non-Executive Director (see page 126 - Workforce engagement report). We also conduct biennial workforce engagement surveys to assess organisational climate. These exercises allow us to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions to inform our strategy for future policies and initiatives that will allow us to improve employee satisfaction and drive our organisational success.\n\nWe also understand the importance of creating a modern workplace environment that promotes satisfaction, productivity and the retention of our workforce. To achieve this, we have implemented various initiatives to enhance the wellbeing of our employees. We have upgraded our industrial facilities with sports infrastructure, such as gyms, pools and basketball courts, and increased health, nutrition and cultural programmes. Furthermore, our flexible working arrangements cater to the needs of different operating units. For remote locations with limited family infrastructure, we have established fly-in-fly-out arrangements as well as schedules with varying workdays and days-off for increased flexibility, while for the corporate offices, we have maintained hybrid working after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## Training and development\n\nWe strive to attract, retain and nurture top talent to secure a solid pipeline to underpin future business success. We value long-term career growth and invest in training and mentorship programmes to help employees reach their full potential. Our focus on professional development serves as the cornerstone of our retention strategy, helping our people grow and develop.\n\n## Engaging our people\n\nWe conduct biennial engagement surveys employing the Basher methodology, consisting of 60 items across seven topics to assess employee and contractor satisfaction. The survey includes a double evaluation scale, combining responses to the questions with the relevance they hold for each individual. Results are analysed by various cohorts, with discussions taking place between leadership teams and relevant departments. Lowest scoring topics and items are identified and added to either an ongoing or new improvement plan.\n\n## Topics:\n\n## Cohorts analysed:\n\n- \u00b7 Our working practices.\n- \u00b7 Process/department.\n- \u00b7 Industrial safety.\n- \u00b7 Organisational roles.\n- \u00b7 Code of conduct and compliance.\n- \u00b7 Age groups.\n- \u00b7 Management and leadership.\n- \u00b7 Seniority.\n- \u00b7 Work environment.\n- \u00b7 Gender.\n- \u00b7 Trust.\n- \u00b7 Key personnel.\n- \u00b7 Teamwork.\n\nWe use a cohort-based system to recruit both short-term and long-term interns. Our partnerships with leading Mexican educational institutions allow us to tap into a diverse pool of young talent studying mining and metals-related degrees. Our flagship programme, 'Engineers in Training', provides 12 months of technical, administrative, and social skill development for undergraduate students in fields such as mining, geology, metallurgy and various engineering disciplines. Each student is paired with an operations team coach who provides guidance and conducts performance evaluations. Highperforming interns are then offered permanent positions, ensuring a steady talent pipeline for our growth strategy. This programme not only engages students at an early stage in their college education but also encourages more women to enter the mining industry.\n\n## Training hours\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAverage non-HSECR training hours\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAverage HSECR training hours\n\n## Diversity in talent attraction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWomen\n\nLong-term internships and Engineers in Training.\n\nWe have continued implementing our individual performance appraisal process for all our personnel and reinforcing formal feedback. Our performance assessment mechanism enables us to pinpoint specific training requirements. It also helps us to identify promising candidates for our institutional development programmes at different levels of the organisation. These programmes not only provide valuable knowledge transfer and expertise, but also serve as a means to inspire and engage participants.\n\n- \u00b7 The technical skills development programmes focus on Rock Mechanics, Ventilation, Safety, Environment, Planning and Metallurgy, as well as initiatives to foster a safety culture ('I Care, We Care'), identify critical risks and strengthen job positions.\n- \u00b7 Meanwhile, our institutional development programmes prioritise leadership development to allow area managers and supervisors to acquire immediate tools that help them to manage their work teams effectively and achieve a change in attitudes and behaviours. Programmes for middle managers are focused on leadership skills and on refining technical competences on mining, planning, mineral processing, leadership and managerial soft skills. Programmes for executives are focused on improving competences in finance, accounting, human resources, corporate social responsibility and leadership. These are: Leadership Plus, Leaders with Vision, Leaders in Training, BAL Managerial Diploma and Capital Project Diploma, organised by the prestigious Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico (ITAM).",

We believe that maintaining fair and respectful relationships with unions is essential to building trust and mutual accountability. Our approach prioritises employees' rights to freedom of expression, free association and collective bargaining. We engage with unions through regular dialogue, leadership development programmes, wellbeing activities - such as sports or cultural events - and continuous improvement projects to strengthen our partnership.\n\nThe CEO and Head of HR regularly engage with union senior leadership, while our business units maintain close relationships with local union committees and their delegates. This allows for collaboration on capacity building for newly elected committees. In 2022, we did not encounter any labour disputes leading to work stoppages or industrial action.\n\nAnnual Safety Symposiums, in collaboration with unions and regulators, serve as a platform for exchanging best practices and promoting meaningful discussions on the industry's challenges and opportunities. Additionally, we partner with unions to conduct the 'LEAL' survey on work behaviours and wellbeing, using the insights gained to improve our workforce engagement strategy.\n\n## Comprehensive wellbeing\n\nAs part of the Cultural Evolution we began in 2021, we have identified six routes to Comprehensive Wellbeing, which aims to achieve our maximum potential both as individuals and collectively: Intellectual, Emotional, Physical, Transcendental, Cultural and Professional.

We recognise that equity and inclusion drive improvements in talent attraction, retention and development, as well as boost innovation and creativity. Guided by the principle of equality, we strive to create a workplace where everyone has equal access to opportunities and is treated with respect. Our focus on openness, belonging and respect creates a supportive environment that allows each individual to make a meaningful impact.\n\nWe are committed to advancing diversity and inclusivity, starting with increasing the representation and participation of women. Two key objectives support this mission, as we believe that embracing diversity is a competitive advantage:\n\n- 1. Enhance the contribution of women to the success of the Company.\n- 2.  Have a positive impact on female employees.\n\nIn 2020 we pledged to increase the overall representation of women in our workforce from 10% to 12% by 2025 and to challenge the glass ceiling at the operating manager and superintendent level, raising the percentage of women in these roles from 2% to 8% by 2025. In 2022, we reached our first target and increased the latter by 1.58%, with a 2.58% gap remaining for the coming years.

In addition, in 2021 we designed our Women's Leadership programme with the support of KPMG. In 2022 we focused on implementing the recommendations arising from both diagnostics according to a DEI master plan, focused on six priority initiatives that cover nine Ranking PAR and 27 Women Matter recommendations. These are:\n\n- \u00b7 Cultural Transformation: dissemination of the DEI initiative, promoting a culture of zero tolerance towards harassment and creating a network for women.\n- \u00b7 Leadership and Government: creating mentorship programmes and ascribing to UN's Women Empowering Principles (WEP).\n- \u00b7 Processes: creating inclusive talent attraction processes.\n\nWe have also published a new Labour Equity and Non-Discrimination (LEND) Policy, based on the Mexican voluntary norm NMX-R025-SCFI-2015 which recognises organisations that favour their workforce's integral development and implement practices on labour equity and non-discrimination - and established a LEND Committee that will determine and oversee the pillars of our DEI strategy.\n\nDuring the year, we maintained our participation in the Women in Mining (WIM) chapters, saw the representation of women on our Board remain at 33%, and launched the first generation of our Women for Women Mentoring programme. We have publicly disclosed our workforce-related information to the Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI) since 2020 and in 2022 were honoured to be nominated for the WDI Award as well as getting a special mention in the Most Transparent category, acknowledging our commitment to complete and transparent disclosure.\n\n## What's next\n\n- \u00b7 Deploy DEI sensitisation training for Senior Management.\n- \u00b7 Implement a DEI module in onboarding virtual trainings.\n- \u00b7 Continue rolling-out our DEI strategy.\n- \u00b7 Further analyse reporting frameworks to improve how we report on our strategy to increase the participation of women and the positive impacts achieved to date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Empowering women\n\nIn 2022, we introduced the Women for Women Mentorship programme with the aim of fostering female leadership and building a supportive and empathetic network. The programme involves mentors being paired with mentees, and providing guidance and support to cultivate their talents and help them achieve their goals. The programme spans eight months, with the first four months dedicated to training and the remaining four months dedicated to the mentorship itself. New cohorts will be introduced every six months to continuously support and empower female talent within our organisation, with regular improvement of the programme targeted for each cycle.\n\n'The support network I've built with other women in this industry and the guidance I've received from them has not only helped me grow but has been a major strength in my career. During this experience I have had the privilege of meeting very talented, hardworking and beautiful-hearted women and I am very proud to be a mentor with the goal of supporting and guiding them to reach their full potential.'\n\n## Veronica Ruiz\n\nEngineering and Planning Superintendent\n\n'This programme represents a significant effort by our Company and a great opportunity to build a network of support, trust, empathy, learning and a safe space for sharing experiences.

Based on salary scales, we have policies in place to close the gender pay gap. In 2022, the gender pay gap for non-unionised, non-executive employees was -3.59% compared to -2.28% in 2021. This apparent setback is mainly driven by an increase in the gap at the Senior Engineer level and an increased weighting in underground operations due to the reclassification of Juanicipio from project to operating unit.

The safety management system is supported by our preventive culture, risk management focus and moral commitment to the wellbeing of our workers, as outlined in our Sustainability Policy.\n\nPrevention is an essential element of our safety culture, supported by our 'I Care, We Care' philosophy, which covers all value chain activities from exploration to operations and addresses all inherent risks; it is based on five strategic lines of action: leadership, accountability, systems, behaviours and learning environment. Our goal is to operate without fatal accidents, reduce incapacitating accidents and damage to facilities, in an ethical and safe work environment, with visible leadership, participation at all organisational levels and continuous learning. 'I Care, We Care' was first implemented in 2017, and has been steadily improved over the years.\n\nThe five strategic pillars of 'I Care, We Care' aim to establish critical and performance controls in every operation, and for all personnel to become responsible for standards verification to identify any gaps. This ensures that workers are empowered by the necessary tools and training, and that a virtuous cycle of improvement activities and initiatives is continuously implemented to reduce risks. Its technical focus is to establish an integral risk management strategy, prioritising critical risks (risks that could cause fatalities or serious harm to people) while also ensuring that all risks are addressed. It also enables us to continuously innovate and improve safety practices, risk management and emergency readiness.\n\n'Building a culture of care requires teamwork in a trusting environment, understanding individual and collective responsibilities, igniting passion in our work, exhibiting strong leadership and fostering camaraderie.'\n\n## The 'I Care, We Care' cycle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 'I Care, We Care' strategic pillars\n\n- 1.

For routine activities, employees and business partners use general tools to evaluate risk and establish controls. For non-routine activities, we have the Safe Work Analysis mechanism, permits and authorisations for high-risk work.\n- \u00b7 Our approach for critical risks begins with the Work Risk Assessment Critical (WRAC), prepared by the leadership team of each operating unit. This is followed by a bow-tie analysis to identify and review the controls with the goal of avoiding or mitigating the risk, carried out with risk owners, critical control owners and risk experts. This analysis leads to critical control verification tools: a checklist before initiation of critical risk associated activity; performance standards; the establishment of parameters and quality criteria to guarantee critical controls; and a portfolio of critical risks derived from critical risk identification and evaluation.\n\n## Leadership in the field\n\nAt Fresnillo, safety is upheld through Values Driven Leadership. Our approach is to transform leaders, advisers and supervisors so their actions are based on values and leading by example. Leadership practices are implemented systematically to control and verify critical risks and critical controls, and workshops are held to develop technical and human skills to communicate the importance of safety. Our practices aim to empower people to take responsibility to stop unsafe activities resulting from the failure of critical controls, through four key stages:\n\n- 1. Planning and communication,\n- 2.  Checks, inspections and audits,\n- 3. Generation, review and improvement of action plans, and\n- 4.  Recognition and accountability.\n\n## Participation\n\nAt all levels of the organisation, our employees have various roles and responsibilities to support our safety strategy and actively participate in hazard identification, risk assessment and controlestablishment processes. We utilise various forms of collaboration and participation, such as committees, health and safety commissions, and emergency teams, to carry out safety-focused activities such as training and risk management projects to enhance our safety culture.\n\nSpecialists are assigned to all operations and projects to train, guide and advise our workforce on\n\nsafety management. We also maintain emergency teams trained in mine rescue, firefighting, first aid, hazardous materials handling and evacuation. Our Health and Safety Committees, or business partner committees, carry out regular inspections to identify hazards and unsafe practices, make suggestions for preventive measures and conduct accident investigations.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe Executive team is committed to safeguarding our people and eliminating serious accidents. To this end, our 2026 vision is to achieve zero fatalities, decrease our TRIFR to ICMM standards - first in some, then in all units - and make our operations safer through automation. Our short-term objectives are to enhance risk management, communication of results and cross-learning from incidents. In addition, we aim to foster a safety culture through leadership practices, forums with the union, and training. Our medium- to long-term objectives include consolidating the 'I Care, We Care' philosophy, advancing risk management across different scenarios and stakeholders, improving competencies and training of personnel according to their responsibilities. Furthermore, our target is to minimise exposure to risks, protect assets and use advanced technology to enable proactive decision-making - such as critical control automation, software to ensure proper scaling and safety analytics, among others.",

The goal of preventive reporting is twofold: to promote a proactive approach to management; and to encourage worker involvement in an early warning system, monitor safety of operational areas and lead to opportune decision-making. In 2022, despite having an 82% increase in near-miss reporting and reducing the injury frequency from high potential accidents, we regret to report that we had a fatal accident. For this unfortunate event, we performed the incident management process, which covers reporting, accident investigation, establishment of root causes, implementation of corrective actions and dissemination of lessons learnt. We acknowledge the need to continue maturing our safety culture, improving leadership and accountability to reach the goal of zero fatalities.\n\nAll accidents are investigated to prevent recurrence through immediate action, focusing on operations and activities, prioritising risk and critical controls, and generating cross-cutting and standardised learning.\n\n## Reduce TRIFR and Fatality rate to ICMM range:\n\n- \u00b7 Consolidate risk management.\n- \u00b7 Improve risk management across scenarios and stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Improve personnel competencies and training.\n- \u00b7 Implement projects to improve safety.\n\n## Fatal injuries and fatal injury frequency rates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFatalities: Number of fatal injuries to employees and contractors.\n\nFatality frequency rate: Number of fatal injuries to employees and contractors for every 1,000,000 hours of hours worked.\n\n## Injury frequency rate for every 1,000,000 hours\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rates (TRIFR)\n- Lost Time Injury Frequency Rates (LTIFR)\n\nRecordable Injuries: Lost-Time Cases + Restricted Work Cases + Medical Treatment per 1,000,000 hours worked.\n\nLost Time Injuries: Number of Lost-Time Injuries per 1,000,000 hours worked.\n\n## Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) for every 1,000,000 hours\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRecordable Injuries: Lost-time cases + restricted work cases + medical treatment per 1,000,000 hours worked.\n\n## Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for every 1,000,000 hours\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLost Time Injuries: Number of Lost-Time injuries per 1,000,000 hours worked.\n\n## Certifications\n\n| Juanicipio                          | San Juli\u00e1n   | Fresnillo   | Saucito   | Ci\u00e9nega Herradura   | Noche Buena   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|\n| OHSAS 18001/ISO 45000               |              |             |           |                     |               |\n| Sets out criteria for international |              |             |           |                     |               |\n| best practice in occupational       |              |             |           |                     |               |\n| health and safety management.       |              |             |           |                     |               |\n|                                     | -            |             |           |                     |               |\n| -                                   |              | Certified   | Certified | - Certified         | Certified     |",

To achieve this, we have taken a comprehensive approach that encompasses all aspects of workplace health. The focus to succeed must be multidisciplinary, supported by different health sector and organisational development specialists, to continuously improve our processes and guarantee that we preserve the physical, mental and social health of our workforce. Our strategy includes emergency preparedness, promotion of healthy habits, early detection and management of health risks, which helps us to prevent both occupational and chronic diseases. We also determine the necessary operating procedures, equipment, training and controls to mitigate these risks.\n\nBefore joining our workforce, everyone undergoes a health check that includes physical and psychosocial evaluations. Regular check-ups are also conducted to screen for occupational diseases, and employees are advised on preventive care measures. We identify and monitor the level of exposure to physical and chemical risks such as noise, dust, vibration, heavy metal contamination, extreme temperatures, and others. Biological monitoring is also carried out to prevent sanitary risks, and behavioural change workshops are held to promote personal wellbeing and prevent accidents and workplace stress. We also evaluate and improve the ergonomics of our work environment to prevent musculoskeletal disorders and manage our own rehabilitation facilities to accelerate recovery from workplace injuries.\n\nIn recent years, the health departments of each business unit have expanded beyond occupational health programmes, establishing a more comprehensive perspective and promoting other aspects of health such as psychological care, nutritional support, promotion of wellbeing through sports and recreation, deployment of different technologies, thematic campaigns and inclusive employment. This renewed approach is aligned with our 'I Care, We Care' philosophy and consists of five main courses of action:\n\n## Five comprehensive health courses of action\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring 2022, our key activities included:\n\n- \u00b7 Penmont's inclusion rally: two-day workshops and conferences in partnership with the TELETON Sonora Foundation and the local National System for Integral Family Development (DIF) to raise awareness and create a more inclusive society and workplace environment.\n- \u00b7 Living in balance: survey to assess our workforce's physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. The resulting diagnosis will lay the foundations for an organisational plan to address the most pressing issues to improve workers' quality of life.\n- \u00b7 Health campaigns: health promotion campaigns were carried out at business units, such as Breast Cancer awareness campaign and the Night Race Against Breast Cancer; the Prostate Cancer Campaign targeting vulnerable populations and the 'A Hero Within You' blood donation campaign.\n- \u00b7 Thematic challenges: the 'to-be-fit' challenge and '7 days without sugar' campaigns were rolled out for unionised and non-unionised workers seeking to increase their awareness and improve personal habits.\n- \u00b7 Promotion of sport activities: inauguration of the first all-employee softball league in the Fresnillo District.\n\n## Certifications\n\n|                                                                                                                                           | Juanicipio                                                                                                                                | San Juli\u00e1n                                                                                                                                | Fresnillo                                                                                                                                 | Saucito                                                                                                                                   | Ci\u00e9nega                                                                                                                                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Healthy Company                                                                                                                           | Healthy Company                                                                                                                           | Healthy Company                                                                                                                           | Healthy Company                                                                                                                           | Healthy Company                                                                                                                           | Healthy Company                                                                                                                           |\n|                                                                                                                                           | Certified                                                                                                                                 | -

To maintain our social licence to operate, it is vital that we prioritise resource optimisation, minimise negative impacts and openly communicate our environmental footprint.\n\nClean technologies play an important role in improving environmental performance and reinforcing the social acceptability of the mining industry. We support the Colorado Cleantech Challenge, an innovation showcase that connects mining companies with clean technology solution providers, with the mutually beneficial goal of meeting our industry's environmental challenges. In addition, our CEO, Octavio Alv\u00eddrez, is a member of the Lowell Institute for Mineral Resources of the\n\nUniversity of Arizona. This leading research institute has the depth of expertise necessary to tackle the challenges that are critically important to modern mining. We are also part of the World Environment Centre (WEC), a think tank that advances sustainable development through the business practices of member companies and in partnership with governments, non-governmental organisations and other stakeholders.\n\nBefore developing any mining project, we conduct environmental impact assessments (EIAs), which identify potential impacts and the actions required to manage them. EIAs address many issues, such as surface and groundwater resources, water quality, air quality, soils, biodiversity (including threatened or endangered species), landscape, and socio-economic conditions. The insights gained from EIAs form the foundation for our environmental management plans and systems such as ISO 14001.\n\n## Certifications and awards\n\nPenmont\n\n| Certification/award                                                                  | Exploration   | Juanicipio   | San Juli\u00e1n   | Fresnillo   | Saucito    | Ci\u00e9nega   | Herradura   | Noche Buena   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|\n| ISO 14001                                                                            | Certified     | -            | -            | Certified   | Certified  | -         | Certified   | Certified     |\n| Framework and criteria for an effective  environmental management system             |               |              |              |             |            |           |             |               |\n| Clean industry                                                                       | -             | In process   | In process   | In process  | In process | -         | Certified   | -             |\n| Certificate granted by the Mexican Environmental                                     |               | Level 2      | Level 1      | Level 2     | Level 2    |           | Level 2     |               |\n| Authority to promote environmental audits,  compliance with regulations and adoption |               |              |              |             |            |           |             |               |\n| of best practices                                                                    |               |              |              |             |            |           |             |               |\n| Level 2 - Advanced                                                                   |               |              |              |             |            |           |             |               |\n| International Cyanide Management Code                                                | -             | -            | -            | -           | -          | -         | Certified   | In process    |\n| Sets criteria for the global gold mining industry  on cyanide management practices   |               |              |              |             |            |           |             |               |",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability at the core of our Purpose continued\n\n## Climate change\n\nScientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change is unequivocal. Changes in average temperature, rainfall and other conditions are shifting from climate normals. As the climate continues to change, the potential impacts on ecosystems, economies and on society at large are expected to increase over time.\n\nTo prevent the negative effects of climate change and achieve the goals set by the Paris Agreement, the world needs global cooperation. Our Company's climate change strategy is driven by our purpose to 'Contribute to the wellbeing of people, through the sustainable mining of silver and gold'. We aim to reduce our GHG emissions (SDG13) by incorporating clean energy sources (SDG7), and improving energy efficiency. Our business recognises the significance of a robust climate strategy for its success. In 2021, we identified and evaluated climate-related risks and opportunities (CROs) and integrated them into our enterprise risk management (ERM) and energy strategy. Our approach to climate change has evolved beyond sustainability to include the integration of physical and transitional risks in decision-making. We are committed to maturing our approach to the integration of physical and transitional risks into our planning and decision-making processes. Our stakeholders expect us to act and report transparently.\n\n## TCFD compliance statement\n\nWe have provided climate-related financial disclosures for the year ended 31 December 2022 according to the UK's Listing Rule 9.8.6R(8) of information to be included in annual report and accounts, having taken into consideration the Listing Rule Guidance 9.8.6BG and LR 9.8.6DG for all sectors and non-financial sectors, as well as the\n\nRecommendations of the Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures (TFCD) and its guidance on Metrics, Targets and Transition Plans (2021). Our report complies with the TCFD reporting recommendations, except for the following where our disclosure is partial. We will continue working towards improving our climate strategy and climate reporting in the upcoming years.\n\n## Strategy\n\n- \u00b7 Recommended Disclosure B: Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy and financial planning.\n- \u00b7 Recommended Disclosure C: Describe the resilience of the organisation's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario.\n\n## Reasons for partial compliance\n\nLack of climate projections at the geographic scales required for engineering purposes.\n\n## Next steps for compliance\n\nA comprehensive integration of climate change considerations into financial planning relies on capital budgeting of mitigation and adaptation measures. The mitigation strategy, based on increasing the supply of renewable electricity, is already integrated into our strategic plan. We expect to mature our approach to internal carbon pricing. We are developing a roadmap to integrate adaptation measures into our financial planning; it relies on the use of regional climate modelling to provide our engineering teams with actionable climate outputs to identify vulnerabilities, design adaptation measures, plan for their implementation and allocate financial resources. This is a long and challenging journey and we will report annually on our progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\n- \u00b7 Recommended Disclosure C: Describe the targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.\n\n## Reasons for partial compliance\n\nThe connections between climate change and other relevant ESG risks are at an early stage of development.\n\n## Next steps for compliance\n\nWe are monitoring progress towards our goal of achieving 75% of the supply of electricity from renewable sources by 2030, together with the relevant transition risks. We are currently experiencing regulatory uncertainty regarding the legal framework for renewables in Mexico which has introduced further uncertainties to our analysis of a science-based target aligned with the Paris Agreement. We expect to mature our approach in order to more explicitly incorporate physical risks into our health, safety, environment and community relations KPIs and targets.\n\nWe are committed to continue understanding how to integrate climate change into our engineering and financial decisions, as well as to work towards full compliance of industry specific and crosssector climate indicators.\n\nWe have prepared this section based on all the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nThe table opposite shows our overall progress in implementing TCFD reporting:\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Chairman of the Committee, Mr Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez, has extensive expertise in Mexican public policy and a solid academic background in macroeconomics. Ms Georgina Kessel has significant experience on matters relating to energy and climate change, having served as Minister of Energy from 2006 to 2011. Dame Judith Macgregor has wide-ranging diplomatic experience and contributes valuable international perspectives on climate change. Mr Fernando Ruiz brings his considerable experience on Mexican taxation to the Committee, as well as a valuable perspective on the landscape of carbon pricing legislation.\n\nDuring 2020, the HSECR Committee was briefed on the basic principles of science-based targets, which has been useful in discussing targetsetting and evaluating decarbonisation pathways. In 2021, the Committee was trained on the recommendations of TCFD with a special focus on the approach to identify, evaluate and prioritise the CROs. Capacity building also covered the physical risks of climate change, notably on the use of climate models and the challenges to assess the physical impact at geographic scale meaningful to mining operations. Finally, during 2022, the Committee was exposed to a global perspective on TCFD reporting, benchmarks and gap analysis from independent advisers.\n\n## Executive team\n\n- \u00b7 CEO.\n- \u00b7 CFO.\n- \u00b7 COO.\n- \u00b7 VP Exploration.\n\n## Management oversight on climate change\n\nOur CEO, COO, Environmental and Safety VP, ESG Compliance Manager and Baluarte's Sustainability Assistant VP and CEO of Engineering Services report quarterly to the HSECR Committee on the Company performance. They provide insights on trends in reporting and stakeholder expectations and inform the Committee about the Company's exposure to climate-related risks, as well as technologies or initiatives that could be capitalised for decarbonisation opportunities.\n\nThe strategic vision of our CEO is key to making the connection between business strategy and climate-related risks and opportunities. The CEO's words and actions have an enormous impact, and his personal leadership is essential for setting and communicating goals and holding the organisation to account. Our COO has responsibilities related to the energy efficiency of current operations and our objectives regarding future performance. Our COO plays a key role in setting annual energy efficiency targets and holding mine managers accountable. Baluarte's CEO of Engineering Services plays a key role in the technology strategy for mineral processing and design and operation of mine infrastructure such as tailings storage facilities (TSFs) and water reservoirs. Our CFO and COO collaborate to identify energy efficiency opportunities, and the former also oversees compliance with climate-change regulatory obligations. The Sustainability Assistant VP supports the Executive Committee in assessing the carbon footprint of the Strategic Plan, measuring the quarterly performance and\n\n## Steering team\n\n- \u00b7 Finance.\n- \u00b7 Exploration.\n- \u00b7 Projects.\n- \u00b7 Operations.\n- \u00b7 Safety and Environment.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability.\n\n## Building capacities: climate change sensibilisation\n\nRecognising that climate change education is an ongoing journey, we have implemented various sensibilisation and training sessions aimed at different members of our organisation, based on their roles and responsibilities. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Briefings to the HSECR Committee on the basic principles of science-based targets.\n- \u00b7 Briefings to the Executive team on progress made on climate-related risks and opportunities identification, prioritisation and valuation.\n\n- \u00b7 Climate Change Steering team periodic meetings to reinforce awareness, discuss challenges and build a shared understanding to foster actionable strategies.\n- \u00b7 Climate Change Expert team scoping workshop on the principles of climate-related risks and opportunities identification, to set a Companywide comprehensive view on the matter.\n- \u00b7 Climate Change Finance team periodic meetings to study an approach to carbon pricing.\n- \u00b7 Dissemination sessions on TCFD recommendations for operational personnel in business units.\n\nanalysing scenarios to identify impacts, risks and opportunities. During the period, the Executive team was briefed on progress made on climaterelated risks and opportunities identification, prioritisation and valuation.\n\nIn a key development of 2021, the Company updated its forecast of energy demand for the Strategic Plan. Additionally, during 2021, a steering group was formed for the period by representatives of the Finance, Exploration, Projects, Operations, Industrial Safety and Environment, and Sustainability teams to engage in conversations about how climate change may affect our operations; this group designated representatives from different areas to form an Expert team from administrative and operational areas across the Company to participate in a scoping workshop to leverage existing progress on TCFD and climate risk management practices. The team discussed the Fresnillo business model - its value creation mechanisms, operational control, influence across the value chain and the risks and opportunities of growth and innovation plans its current processes, criteria and thresholds to identify risks and opportunities, and explored additional exposure sources and consequences of climate change, setting the foundations for a comprehensive view on the matter that provided the raw material for the Climate Risks and Opportunities assessment. During 2022, the Finance team continued to discuss carbon pricing mechanisms and to study different implementation approaches.\n\n## Expert team\n\n- \u00b7 Exploration.\n- \u00b7 Mining.\n- \u00b7 Mineral Processing.\n- \u00b7 TSF Management and Infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Safety.\n- \u00b7 Environment.\n- \u00b7 Health.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Finance.\n- \u00b7 Energy.\n- \u00b7 Legal.\n- \u00b7 Technology.\n- \u00b7 Communities.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability.\n- \u00b7 Procurement.",

Among investors, there is a trend towards favouring companies with resilient climate strategies and higher expectations of stakeholders and society at large regarding climate action. Minerals and metals are expected to contribute significantly to the transition to a net-zero economy, but mining operations will increasingly be expected to reduce their carbon footprint and comply with more stringent regulations to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy has reached technological maturity and economic competitiveness, while facing worrying regulatory challenges in Mexico. Technologies to reduce the carbon footprint of mineral haulage and mineral processing are in their emergence phase but industry alliances represent opportunities to expand their development.\n\nWe focus on mitigating our impact on climate change by reducing our GHG emissions with renewable electricity, fuel substitution in our truck fleet and energy efficiency solutions, such as intelligent ventilation systems, harmonic filters to reduce peak demand and the optimisation of truck haulage distances. We are developing our adaptation approach, working with climate modellers and environmental economists to better understand physical and transition risks. We collaborate with our peers in Mexico to constructively engage government and regulators. We have also joined other companies to launch Mexico's TCFD Consortium.\n\nIn 2021, we conducted a comprehensive review of our business model to identify the risks and opportunities through the lifecycle of mining. For this purpose we researched the approach used by peers in the industry, as well as the sector-specific and cross-industry guidance from TCFD. Following a rigorous approach, we consolidated our CROs, identifying their root cause and value drivers. We redefined our scenarios to have a consistent\n\nsource of parameters to evaluate and prioritise CROs. The strategic review of our CROs has informed our risk management approach and provided valuable insights to mature our climate strategy in the coming years.\n\n## Impacts on and by the business\n\nThe impacts on our business arise from physical and transition risks. The change in climate patterns represents physical risks to our people, communities, mining infrastructure and value chain. The government regulations, changes in markets and social expectations represent transition risks to a low carbon economy. The impacts by our business are associated with the greenhouse gas emissions relating to our production of silver, gold, zinc and lead. Supplying metals has a positive impact on low carbon technologies such as solar panels.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nChronic risks result from long-term shifts in the climate pattern. The reduction in annual precipitation in Mexico is expected to increase water stress in the river basins where we operate. Water stress requires adaptation strategies based on water efficiency, technological innovations in mineral processing, and nature-based solutions for replenishment and collaboration, among others. Acute physical risks are related to shifts in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as rainfall, droughts and heat waves. Adaptation strategies rely on preventive measures to protect our people and resilient infrastructure. Physical risks are not only associated with our operations but may influence our upstream activities such as procurement and downstream activities like smelting and refining. Physical risks also have indirect effects. Water stress may intensify the competition to access water resources and extreme events such as floods and droughts may have negative impacts on the livelihood of our communities. Indirect impacts demand enhanced collaboration with our stakeholders in the river basins where our operations are located.\n\n## Transition risks and opportunities\n\nSociety's responses to the transition to a low-carbon economy include more stringent regulations to reduce emissions, a transformation of the global energy system, changes in behaviour and consumption choices, and emerging technologies. Policies include but are not limited to carbon taxes and tariffs, cap and trade systems, renewable energy portfolios and incentives for new technologies. Climate action is also motivated by the rising expectations of society and investment trends towards companies with resilient carbon strategies. A resilient energy strategy with a disciplined approach to technology adoption is necessary to reduce our carbon footprint and exposure to regulations. Metals and minerals are essential to the technologies required for this transition, and this opens up market opportunities.\n\n## Identifying risks and opportunities\n\nA robust climate strategy relies on a sound understanding of the CROs of our business model considering the lifecycle of mining and our value chain. To ensure a comprehensive identification of CROs, we formed a Steering team that identified key people representing every aspect of the business who could form an Expert team. The Steering and Expert teams were trained on the principles of climate change and CRO identification. To further understand CROs, we conducted in depth interviews with representatives from our Risk Management, Financial Planning, Infrastructure, Energy and Sustainability teams. Additionally, we introduced an external perspective based on an industry-oriented benchmark of significant peers and industry climate change guidance documents.\n\nThe outcome was a comprehensive CROs register with detailed information on each identified risk including its TCFD category, external root cause, value chain impact and value driver affected. Out of an exploratory list of over 100 CROs, a longlist of 55 individual CROs was retained for evaluation and prioritisation.\n\n## CRO longlist by TCFD category and value chain stage\n\n<!-- image -->",

This process begins with risk management and relies on the use of scenarios. These scenarios help us to gain a sound understanding of the potential business impacts of an uncertain future with environmental, social, geopolitical, policy, market, investment and technology implications. Our scenarios are therefore used to generate insights, identify mitigation measures and set courses of action. Our scenarios should not be interpreted as forecasts.\n\nWe opted to use a climate scenario - focused on plausible representations of future climate conditions - and a socio-economic scenario which was focused on plausible development pathways for society and the economy. For the former, we used the main Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), which are trajectories over time of greenhouse gases, aerosols and chemically active concentrations and emissions, as well as land use/cover. For the latter, we used the Shared\n\n## Scenarios and their key parameters\n\nScenarios\n\nParameters\n\n|     |                     |                        | Complementary                           | Global GHG        | Average global temperature  increase by 2050   | Average global temperature  increase by 2100   |\n|-----|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| No. | Name                | IPCC climate  scenario | socio-economic pathway                  | emissions in 2050 |                                                |                                                |\n| 1   | Business as Usual   | RCP 4.5                | SSP 2 (middle of the road  development) | 56,000 Mt CO 2 e  | 2.0 +/- 0.3\u00b0C                                  | 2.4 +/- 0.5\u00b0C                                  |\n| 2   | Paris aligned (2\u00b0C) | RCP 2.6                | SSP 1 (sustainable  development)        | 25,000 Mt CO 2 e  | 1.6 +/- 0.3\u00b0C                                  | 1.6 +/- 0.4\u00b0C                                  |\n| 3   | Worst case          | CP 8.5                 | SSP 5 (fossil-fuelled  development)     | 103,000 Mt CO 2 e | 2.6 +/- 0.4\u00b0C                                  | 4.3 +/- 0.7\u00b0C                                  |\n\nOur scenarios were complemented with additional parameters for rainfall, droughts, carbon and energy prices, fossil fuel subsidies, share of renewables and water scarcity among others. These parameters were gathered from reputable sources that include the IPCC Working Group I Interactive Atlas, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis' (IIASA) Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP), the World Development Indicators from the World Bank, the World Economic Forum (WEF), the World Resources Institute (WRI), KNMI climate change Atlas, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Mexico Energy Outlook 2016, the National Institute of Geography and Statistics (INEGI), National system of Water Information (SINA), among others. The gathering of parameters to assess CROs is challenging due to gaps in data availability at the country, regional, sectorial or company level. Scenario parameters should be used with caution and considering their viability or suitability limitations.\n\n## Risk identification, assessment and management\n\n## CRO evaluation method\n\nCross-cutting criteria were assigned to each CRO to enable effective comparisons. The CROs identified were then assessed through an evidence-based approach concerning materiality and certainty, drawing on climate scenarios and the Company's financial data. Each identified CRO in the longlist - consisting of 55 CROs in total - was assigned a specific parameter that could be used\n\nto indicate how factors beyond Fresnillo's control could change under different scenarios as a result of climate change. Then, each parameter was subsequently assessed for likelihood, velocity and financial materiality. By combining parameter data and the financial materiality assessment, it was possible to identify which risks were most certain and most material. Each CRO has been identified analysing its root cause and its business specific impact as shown in the diagram.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSocio-economic Pathways (SSP), which are alternative socio-economic futures over the course of the century. Both these scenarios typically designed for research and policy purposes - are complementary, and have been adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide an integral framework of climate impact and policy analysis.\n\n- \u00b7 Our first scenario is Business as Usual , an intermediate scenario where CO 2 emissions start to decrease until 2045 and reach roughly half of the levels of 2050 by 2100, more likely than not resulting in a global temperature rise between 2\u00b0 and 3\u00b0C. Additionally, the world follows a path in which social, economic and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns; environmental systems experience degradation, global growth is moderate and income inequality persists, as does vulnerability to societal and environmental changes.\n- \u00b7 The second scenario is the decarbonisation pathway in line with Paris Agreements , which sets a rapid decarbonisation pathway that\n\nlimits peak warming to below 2\u00b0C compared to pre-industrial times with a likelihood above 66%, achieving a net-zero global economy in the second half of the century, although to accomplish this, carbon removal will be necessary. Additionally, the world moves towards a more sustainable path that respects perceived environmental boundaries and where economic growth shifts towards a broader emphasis on human wellbeing; inequality is reduced, and consumption oriented toward low material growth and lower resource intensity.\n\n- \u00b7 The last scenario is Worst Case , where existing climate and energy policies are unsuccessful, resulting in a significant increase in global GHG emissions without constraint, intensifying physical risks. Additionally, competitive markets produce rapid technological progress and development, but coupled with abundant fossil fuel exploitation, and resource- and energyintensive lifestyles.

        "page_content": "a) Velocity: to assess how fast external pressures are changing, indicating the timeframe in which the exposure to each CRO is expected to become significantly different from today. For all risks and opportunities, we then calculated the timeframe at which the relevant scenario projection increases above a set hurdle (+40%) or decreases below a set hurdle (-20%), thus enabling us to categorise each external factor into time horizons of significant change based on the first year in which these hurdles are breached. A score was then assigned based on the time frame in which it takes place. These time frames were defined on a narrower scale than our operational strategy (up to two years), viability period (five years) and strategic planning (up to 30 years) time frames to better assess the urgency of the climate change action measures required. We will work on aligning the time frames in future years.\n\n| Level   | Time horizon   | Period             |\n|---------|----------------|--------------------|\n|         | Short-term     | High Up to 3 years |\n| Medium  | Medium-term    | From 3 to 10 years |\n| Low     | Long-term      | Over 10 years      |\n\nb) Likelihood: to indicate the probability of a CRO taking place, considering outcomes across all scenarios assessed. Each relevant scenario parameter's direction of evolution was also assessed (i.e. whether under each scenario, a parameter is projected to increase, decrease, or no change). Comparative thresholds were also included to consider the projected change when comparing different climate scenarios. For transition risks and opportunities, projections based on current commitments and trends were compared to the accelerated transition aligned to a 2-degree, Paris Agreement-aligned scenario. For physical risks and opportunities, this projection based on current commitments and trends was compared to a scenario with failure of climate mitigation actions and correspondingly high emissions. The measured rate of change between relevant scenarios was evaluated and scored according to the table below.\n\nc) Financial materiality: to estimate the annual financial impact of each identified CRO. The analysis focused on determining the relationship between the scenario parameter assigned to each CRO and the impacted value driver from the CRO. In some instances, the relationship between the scenario parameter and impacted value driver was directly correlated. To understand and compare the relevant materiality of these financial impacts, thresholds shown in the table below were developed based on our financial materiality threshold and broken down into smaller categories.\n\n## Financial thresholds\n\n| (US$ million)   | Level   |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| $ 0 - 7.9       | Low     |\n| $ 8.0 - 16.4    | Medium  |\n| > $ 16.5        | High    |\n\n## Implications to 2050\n\nIn our Business as Usual and Worst-Case scenarios, we will be subject to severe impacts from physical risks, manifested mainly through water availability and extreme weather events demanding adaptation measures that are financially material. Transition risks, especially those regarding carbon pricing, will be more uncertain as these scenarios imply failed international coordination on policies to curb carbon emissions. Conversely, on a Paris-aligned scenario, physical risks will be contained, though not eliminated, and the transition risks certain and material resulting from policies, investment trends and social expectations to transition to a net-zero economy.

During the last five years, on average we supplied half of our electricity from renewable sources. From 2015 to 2022 we sourced 2.6 TWh of wind energy, representing 1.14 million tonnes of CO 2 e of avoided emissions with respect to the carbon intensity of the Mexican Power Utility (CFE).\n\nWe implement energy efficiency initiatives in our mining operations and processing plant to reduce the use of fuels and electricity respectively. New technologies for intelligent ventilation in underground mines reduce the carbon footprint and provide enhanced protection for our people. We have introduced a new strategy to evaluate and adopt emerging tailings technologies considering their impacts on increased safety and reduced climate and water footprint. To evaluate our resilience to transitional risks, we assess the flexibility of our energy strategy to provide decarbonisation opportunities in the 2021-2030 period. We have considered the energy requirements of our Strategic Plan which includes our mining operations and projects.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The technology strategy should currently focus on mature technologies but with a disciplined approach to work with partners on emerging technologies. Nature-based solutions may play a role as pilot opportunities to offset carbon emissions, increase water replenishment and community relations. Currently, government policy is delaying the increase in the supply from renewable sources.\n- \u00b7 2030-2050: most of the electricity supply is renewable. Electrification coupled with renewable supply plays a key role in underground operations. Hydrogen trucks for open pit operations become an alternative to reduce the reliance on diesel and natural gas. Advanced upstream and downstream technologies are available to reduce the carbon and footprint of mineral processing. Naturebased solutions play a relevant role as an offset mechanism. Carbon capture starts playing a key role in the second half of the period to offset hard-to-abate emissions.\n\n## Adaptation\n\n## Engagement with stakeholders\n\nThe design of adaptation measures to protect our people and communities relies on modelling the long-term shifts in climate, such as annual precipitation or temperature, and the variability of extreme events such as floods, droughts and heatwaves. Global circulation models (GCMs) are used to understand the changes in climate under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios. Aqueduct, a tool developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI), is useful to model water stress under different climate change scenarios. These models are valuable in understanding global and regional trends. Most of the physical climate parameters of our scenarios come from reputable sources using global models.\n\nWhile GCMs are useful to identify and prioritise CROs, their spatial resolution is too coarse and hence not suitable to support engineering decision-making at the mine site level. We have collaborated with the scientific community to identify climate modelling approaches suitable to inform engineering decision-making based on regional climate models using statistical and selective dynamic downscaling for comparative purposes. The use of estimates from regional models will be a significant contribution in our journey to mature our approach to integrate the physical risks of climate change in our planning and operating decisions.\n\nThrough the Silver Institute, we participate in an industry-wide initiative on silver and the low-carbon economy. The objective is to produce more carbon footprint information for industry stakeholders, showcase carbon abatement best practices and further study silver's lifecycle and its role as a climate-smart metal. In addition, we collaborate with our peers in the Colorado Mining Cleantech Challenge to promote innovative solutions for energy efficiency and other environmental challenges. During 2021, we joined the Mexico TCFD Consortium - following the success of the Japanese model - created to share lessons learnt and assist companies that are starting to adopt these recommendations to shorten their learning curve, build capacities and improve the country's engagement levels.\n\nOur engagement initiatives also extend to companies and organisations in other industries. For example, we take part in the World Environment Center (WEC), which enables us to learn best practices on climate change strategy from leading international companies. In Mexico, we are part of CESPEDES (Mexican Chapter of the WBCSD) which shares best practices and engages with governments and society at large.\n\nWe have been a registered supporter of the TCFD since 2020 and we disclose our performance in the CDP and GEI Mexico, a voluntary disclosure programme with the Mexican regulators. We discuss our climate change strategy in interviews with investors.\n\n## Decarbonisation pathways",

The project was aligned with Fresnillo's previous TCFD scenarios, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. We used a methodology based on regional climate models as well as a stochastic climate generator to model both an appropriate spatial scale as well as extreme weather events.\n\nTo determine the climate parameters for the modelling exercises, we carried out desk research and consultation with engineers of record at tailings dams. The effectiveness of regional models based on statistical versus dynamic reduction was compared using regional models based on statistical downscaling to model the climate in the Sonora and Sierra regions. The models were evaluated retrospectively by modelling the past climate and comparing the results with meteorological observations. Although some parameters such\n\n## Risk management\n\nOur risk management system is based on risk identification, assessment, prioritisation, mitigation and monitoring processes, which are continually evaluated, improved and enhanced in line with best practice. Considerations regarding climate change are fully integrated within our ERM system.\n\nThe pervasive and complex nature of climate change means that it can act as an amplifier of other risks such as environmental incidents, access to water, health and safety of our people, government regulations, and social licence to operate. Our approach to evaluating and prioritising CROs addresses this challenge.\n\nIn the past, climate change was considered to be solely a sustainability issue. The all-encompassing business implications of climate change led in 2020 to its inclusion as one of the emerging risks, as part of provision 28 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. In 2021, climate change was fully integrated in the annual risk appraisal and in 2022, we began the design of a climate change risk management system.\n\nas accumulated precipitation, average temperatures and extreme temperatures showed acceptable results, extreme precipitation - which is fundamental for the design of engineering works - did not do so. This confirmed the need for models based on dynamic reduction.\n\nTo establish geographical delineation , fine polygons near sites and coarse polygons in basins were explored. Basins were used as a reference due to a lack of consensus on the polygons of influence of operations. However, catchment boundaries created challenges in using representative data from meteorological stations; further study is still needed to determine the best way to establish the geographical delimitation.\n\nTo generate the baseline , we identified meteorological stations based on different criteria of region of influence and a method to assign weights to the observations. We determined that data from in-house weather stations should also be included as a source of information to increase veracity of available data.\n\nFor the Sonora region, a dynamically reduced regional climate model was tested by comparing cumulative precipitation and seasonal maximum temperatures with historical observations and\n\n## CRO analysis and insights\n\nTransition risks - decarbonisation targets, carbon pricing, stringent regulations and investment trends - are the most likely to materialise under all scenarios followed by physical risks such as water availability, higher temperatures and extreme events. Likewise, transition risks are expected to arise faster than physical risks, reflecting the expectation that climate action will prevent the worst consequences of climate change. Carbon pricing, extreme weather events and energy prices are the most material risks. On the opportunity side, the most imminent and material outcomes were an increased demand for silver from the solar PV industry followed by adaptation technologies. Finally, we gained insight into interactions, differentiating likelihood and velocity from financial impact to understand how fast we may be subject to a family of risks, as compared to the material impact they may have on our business. This allows us to pay more attention to those subjects where both scores are higher before considering others and streamlining our response in a timely fashion with strategic and financial planning in years to come, as we mature our climate change mitigation and adaptation\n\napplied to the period 2020-2039 using the low and high emission scenario. The model results with historical data showed consistency, and future projections allowed an appreciation of changes with respect to the baseline precipitation and temperatures.\n\nThe baseline weather stations also enable training of the stochastic climate generator algorithm to generate time series of likely precipitation and temperatures. The weather generator is essential for modelling extreme events for engineering design purposes.\n\nThis work in progress was presented at the American Meteorological Association conference in early 2023. Work will continue on calibrating the climate generator fed by statistically and dynamically reduced regional models, including a third model approach, 'convection permitting', which has appeal for extreme event modelling. The next phase of the project will be to incorporate these insights and projections across all of our business planning. The findings of this project will allow us to improve the resilience of our business, providing us with foresight to pre-emptively adapt our critical infrastructure and enable informed decision making across our business units.\n\nstrategies. So far, climate change has had no impact on the Company's financial planning. A summary of our findings by time frame, value driver and financial materiality is provided on the following page.\n\nHowever, a challenge we faced during this process was the lack of data availability, particularly for physical risks. Materiality was therefore inferred qualitatively through desktop research, referencing reputable sources, which limited the incorporation of some CROs into the calibration and final ranking of this exercise. Understanding this challenge and the difficulty of circumventing it due to the nature of climate modelling is why we launched the climate modelling project with the University of Arizona in late 2021, described previously. Additionally, we understand that we need to work on building capacities across our teams to properly evaluate vulnerabilities and possible adaptation pathways. This is why we also launched a new initiative to design a climate risk management system during 2022, described in the next section.",

Further work needs to be carried out to account for actual impact on stand-alone items, such as energy efficiency measures.\n\n| Physical risks TCFD category   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Management approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Acute risk                     | Changes in frequency and magnitude  of extreme events such as rainfall,  droughts and heatwaves affecting  our operations and neighbouring  communities.

We initially ran desk research to create a risk catalogue, identifying which of these risks required monitoring and which required management. We then paired them to ideal controls which may be preventive, detective or corrective and identified their owners. The next stage will be to standardise and mature assessed controls with their risk owners across our units, determine a baseline for each and estimate deployment costs.",

Additionally, our operations and projects are located in regions with high or extremely high water stress. Thus, energy consumption, GHG emissions, water consumption and withdrawal, and their respective intensities per ton of mineral processed, are monitored rigorously to mitigate risks and to identify resource efficiency opportunities that may contribute to business continuity and cost-efficiency. These metrics are also fundamental for the assessment of CROs (for more information on water metrics and performance, see the Water Stewardship section).\n\n## Climate-related metrics\n\nGlobal GHG emissions for the period 1 January 202 to 31 December 2022\n\n|                                                                                              | GHG emissions (tonnes of CO e)   | GHG emissions (tonnes of CO e)   | GHG emissions (tonnes of CO e)   | GHG emissions (tonnes of CO e)   | Energy (MWhe)    | Energy (MWhe)   | Energy (MWhe)   | Energy (MWhe)    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|\n|                                                                                              | Reporting   year                 | Previous   year                  | Change                           | Comparison  year                 | Reporting   year | Previous   year | Change          | Comparison  year |\n|                                                                                              | 2022                             | 2021                             | 2022-2021                        | 2012                             | 2022             | 2021            | 2022-2021       | 2012             |\n| Scope 1 + Scope 2                                                                            | 961,105                          | 896,397                          | 7.2%                             | 704,366                          | 3,126,124        | 3,154,937       | -0.9%           | 1,806,063        |\n| Scope 1 (direct emissions):  combustion of fuel  (mobile and stationary sources)             | 538,826                          | 546,355                          | -1.4%                            | 375,121                          | 2,025,732        | 2,054,238       | -1.4%           | 1,385,448        |\n| Diesel total                                                                                 | 494,504                          | 501,697                          | -1.4%                            | 366,784                          | 1,825,679        | 1,852,287       | -1.4%           | 1,729,591        |\n| Diesel (Company-owned)                                                                       | 329,656                          | 328,199                          | 0.4%                             | 228,085                          | 1,217,035        | 1,211,766       | 0.4%            | 841,216          |\n| Diesel (contractors)                                                                         | 164,849                          | 173,499                          | -5.0%                            | 138,700                          | 608,644          | 640,522         | -5.0%           | 511,550          |\n| Gasoline total                                                                               | 7,045                            | 6,925                            | 1.7%                             | 3,686                            | 27,133           | 26,672          | 1.7%            |                  |\n| Gasoline (Company-owned)                                                                     | 3,935                            | 3,783                            | 4.0%                             | 3,686                            |                  |                 |                 | 12,234           |\n| Gasoline (contractors)                                                                       | 3,110                            | 3,142                            |                                  |                                  | 15,154           | 14,570          | 4.0%            | 12,234           |\n| Natural gas total                                                                            |                                  |                                  | -1.0%                            | 0                                | 11,979           | 12,102          | -1.0%           | 0                |\n|                                                                                              | 32,898                           | 34,188                           | -3.8%                            | 0                                | 153,659          | 159,685         | -3.8%           | 0                |\n| Natural gas (Company-owned) Natural gas (contractors)                                        | 32,898 0                         | 34,188 0                         | -3.8% -

Updates to Scope 1 and 2 data are twofold: the former due to rectifications of fuel inventories derived from the external audits for the National Emissions Registry (RENE) - but not material as they amount to an increase of less than 1.5% of GHG emissions - and the latter due to the Mexican National Grid emission factor for the period - usually published on a later date than this Annual Report.\n\nScope 1: All direct GHG emissions.\n\n- Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from consumption of purchased electricity.\n- * The emissions and energy consumed in the United Kingdom and offshore area are insignificant.",

During the last five years, wind energy has represented approximately 50% of our electricity supply, and we expect this to remain above 50% once we have finalised some modifications in our corresponding transmission permission agreements. We monitor progress towards our goal of achieving 75% renewables in our energy mix by 2030. However, we are currently experiencing regulatory uncertainty regarding the legal framework, as Mexican government policy is delaying the increase in the supply from renewable sources. If we had been able to pursue the planned decarbonisation pathway of our electric power consumption, our contribution to GHG emissions reduction would have surpassed Mexico's National Determined Contribution equivalent, showing an overall reduction of almost 70%, as compared to the national determined contribution (NDC) of 30%.\n\n## Scope 3 emissions\n\nWe have taken our first steps towards assessing Scope 3 emissions, which belong to our partners in the value chain and are outside our operating boundary.

We have steadily increased our consumption of renewables in recent years, despite regulatory uncertainties which have caused delays to new renewable supply sources coming online. Given our current portfolio, we have decided to modify some of our transmission permission agreements to optimise our mix of available supply sources. Nevertheless, waiting periods for these modifications have also increased, meaning that we have been unable to move directly from current wind-Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to our Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) available wind-sources. This has led to us having to consume electricity from the Mexican power utility, Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE). The result was a temporary reduction in renewable consumption during 2022 that will be offset in 2023, during which we expect to return to renewables consumption in our energy portfolio similar to that of 2019, albeit having increased our overall energy consumption by 28% since then.",

Recent tailings accidents in the industry have served as a reminder of the complex nature of these structures. We are working towards our goal of zero harm to people and the environment, implementing the best practices in engineering and governance of TSFs. The Company has made significant progress in maturing governance and adopting best practices, despite the challenges presented by Covid-19. There were no tailingsrelated failures at our operations in 2022.\n\n## What tailings are and how they are produced\n\nTailings are a by-product of mineral processing. The ore is reduced in sized by crushing and milling to obtain sand and silt-sized particles. The milled rock is then mixed with water and moved as a slurry for further processing to separate the valuable minerals from the milled rock. The remaining slurry of milled rock is known as tailings. Tailings are transported and stored in engineered structures known as Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs) or combined with cement to be reused as paste backfilling in underground workings.\n\n## Governance of TSF\n\n## Site management\n\n- \u00b7 Mine Manger.\n- \u00b7 Regional Tailings Manager.\n- \u00b7 Engineer of Record (EoR).\n\n## Tailings Management and Stewardship team\n\n- \u00b7 Accountable Executive (AE).\n- \u00b7 Corporate Tailings Specialist.\n- \u00b7 Corporate Tailings Manager.\n\n## Governance\n\nOur governance framework establishes the roles, responsibilities and accountability of the groups involved in the design, construction, operation, maintenance and surveillance of TSFs. In 2021, this framework was implemented in all our operations. The key components of our framework are:\n\n- \u00b7 Site management - Mine managers are the risk owners responsible for operating TSFs in accordance with our guidelines. The Regional Tailings Manager and a qualified Engineer of Record provide the technical expertise to ensure the facility is managed safely and complies with the appropriate governance and best practice. We are developing the implementation of a formal change management process to address changes in risk owners.\n- \u00b7 Tailings Management and Stewardship team - This group of subject matter experts develops and administers the corporate governance and appropriate controls, including the implementation of verifications and external reviews. Baluarte's CEO of Engineering Services leads the team with the support of the Assistant VP of Infrastructure, corporate tailings specialists and managers.\n- \u00b7 External reviews - Our governance framework is supported by independent experts, inspectors, reviewers and auditors to confirm compliance with our governance and engineering best practice requirements. Our third-party review process includes an Independent Tailings Review Panel (ITRP), Dam Safety Inspections (DSIs) and Dam Safety Reviews (DSRs).\n\n## External reviews\n\n## Group-level oversight\n\n- \u00b7 Independent Tailings Review Panel (ITRP).\n- \u00b7 Dam Safety Inspections (DSI).\n- \u00b7 Dam Safety Reviews (DSR).\n- \u00b7 TSF Review Executive Committee.\n- \u00b7 Group-level oversight - Oversight of the overall governance and operations is provided by the TSF Review Executive Committee. The Committee, comprising Senior Executives, relies on independent expert advice and assessment for the continuous review of operation, governance, inspection, review and audit reports. Fresnillo plc CEO is the Accountable Executive (AE) for operations and Baluarte Technical Services CEO is the AE for Governances matters.\n\nThe Board's Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations (HSECR) Committee is informed of compliance status, as well as any relevant issues or risks and recommended appropriate actions. The Independent Tailing Review Panel meets the Company every two months and annually conducts four virtual and two field visits. Findings are presented to senior management for follow-up. Focus is now moving from initial implementation to the documentation and institutionalisation of our governance framework in our Tailings Policy, which we expect to approve in 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nMaintaining the high standards of safety and environmental protection of TSFs is an ongoing process that requires continuous evaluation through the lifecycle of each facility. Design, construction, surveillance, maintenance and external reviews follow the best practice guides of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), the Canadian Dam Association (CDA), the International Commission of Large Dams (ICOLD) and the International Council of Mining and Metals (ICMM).\n\n## Design and construction\n\nWe design our new tailings dams in accordance with international best practices (i.e. ICMM. ICOLD, CDA and MAC) with the support of qualified engineering firms. We have formalised our approach to site options studies, construction methods and technology selection. At an early stage of a project, we identify opportunities for paste backfilling and filtered tailings.\n\nWe have conducted an extensive campaign of geotechnical investigation to update the geotechnical models of our TSFs. We implement quality assurance and controls for the construction or expansion (lifts) in the operating phase. The design and construction of TSFs are also managed by the Tailings Management organisation using dedicated internal and external resources.\n\n## Operation\n\nMine managers operate the facility in accordance with our guidelines through a combination of shared services from the Tailings Management and Stewardship team, and internal resources organised to report directly to him/her, independently of other operating roles. Mine managers are supported by a qualified Regional Tailings Manager and a qualified Engineer of Record (EoR). Master Services Agreements have been signed with several recognised consultancies and, through them, named EoRs.\n\n## Surveillance and maintenance\n\nRoutine surveillance is conducted by trained operators and expert technical staff from the Tailings Management and Stewardship team. Condition and critical control monitoring have been enhanced by the installation of improved instrumentation and monitoring equipment. With the support of our consultants, we are currently formalising and implementing the Operation, Maintenance and Surveillance (OMS) Manuals following the guidelines of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC). Our routine surveillance practices have improved as an outcome of the OMS initiative. We have increased the use of InSar Satellite monitoring and improved telemetry and data analytics to facilitate near real-time management of critical controls, improved condition reporting and response times.\n\n## External reviews\n\nThe Independent Tailings Review Panel (ITRP) comprises subject matter specialists of international renown who meet several times per year to conduct an independent review of the design, operation and integrity of our TSFs.\n\nWe conduct Dam Safety Inspections (DSIs) and Dam Safety Reviews (DSRs) to evaluate our compliance with international best practices and applicable regulatory requirements. Our Tailings Management and Stewardship team appoints qualified consultants to conduct formal safety inspections and periodic reviews of TSFs.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur strategy for responsible tailings management aims to adopt the best practices of engineering and management principles of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), the Canadian Dam Association (CDA), the International Commission of Large Dams (ICOLD) and the International Council of Mining and Metals (ICMM). We are maturing our implementation of Tailings Management Systems, a centre of excellence that provides shared\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nservices, formal planning and resourcing, training and a disciplined approach to investment in tailings technologies.\n\nWe recognise the importance and relevance of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) and have followed its development and progress. As a company we support this standard and we will review and assess the impact and challenges of its implementation. We feel confident that the compliance with these international guidelines is a strong baseline that will lead the GISTM compliance.\n\n## Tailings management system\n\nOur focus is now moving from initial implementation of our governance framework to the formal documentation and implementation of our enhanced Operation, OMS Manuals and Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRPs). A training workshop was held to prepare the documents following the Tailings guide of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC).\n\n## Tailings Management and Stewardship team\n\nThis group comprises subject matter experts and implements the governance framework and controls and provides shared services. In our journey to become a centre of excellence, we have presented papers at international tailings forums.\n\n## Planning and resourcing\n\nWe conduct a formal process to budget: i) construction of current facilities; ii) siting, design and construction of new facilities; iii) improvement in instrumentation and monitoring; and iv) technical services.\n\n## Training\n\nWe organised tailings management training and technical workshops throughout the year. In addition, our experts from the Tailings Management organisation participated at national and international conferences.\n\n## New technologies\n\nOur approach to new technologies takes into consideration the strategic priority and the maturity of technologies:\n\n- \u00b7 1st Horizon: Surveillance, Monitoring and Alerting Technology (i.e. inSar, drones, data analytics, etc.).\n- \u00b7 2nd Horizon: Downstream Processing Technology (i.e. paste tailings and filtered tailings).\n- \u00b7 3rd Horizon: Upstream Processing Technology (i.e. selective processing, water and energy reduction, etc.).\n\nIn addition, we evaluate the contribution that new technologies can make to: i) safety improvements; ii) the efficiency of our operations; and iii) the reduction of our environmental footprint and risks.",

Working with Ausenco and FL Smidth, we commenced an evaluation of the feasibility of improving tailings deposition by using a colossal filter.\n\n## Waste rock\n\nMining operations remove waste rock to access the ore. Most mining waste is transported and deposited in waste piles for permanent storage, though some waste rock is used in underground cut and fill operations. Most of the Company's mineral waste is generated by the open pit operations at Penmont and deposited in waste rock piles.\n\n## Heaps\n\nPart of the disseminated ore deposits of Penmont are processed using heap leaching. Channels surrounding the heaps and contingency ponds are hydraulically designed to handle flood flows caused by extreme rainfall events. We proactively monitor conditions both up and downstream to detect changes in water quality. Once extraction of ore from the mine is complete, the piles are rinsed and allowed to drain down to protect the environment.\n\n## Metrics\n\n|                                                                |            | Unit   | 2022        | 2021        | 2020        | 2019        | 2018        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Mine waste                                                     | Waste rock | Tonne  | 119,424,384 | 131,603,499 | 119,233,877 | 141,717,898 | 164,490,105 |\n| Processing waste from flotation  - concentration               | Tailings   | Tonne  | 8,166,918   | 7,985,885   | 8,969,146   | 9,370,672   | 8,795,869   |\n| Metallurgical waste from heap and  dynamic leaching facilities | Tailings   | Tonne  | 5,993,498   | 6,224,972   | 5,909,107   | 6,137,482   | 3,560,486   |\n| Metallurgical waste from heap and  dynamic leaching facilities | Heaps      | Tonne  | 29,345,382  | 28,641,642  | 20,570,573  | 34,422,898  | 39,912,814  |\n\n## Non-mineral waste\n\nWe seek to optimise the use of resources, eliminating physical waste and maximising process efficiency.\n\nWe prioritise materials management and follow strict protocols for handling different types of non-hazardous waste. Waste that requires special handling by regulation (special handling waste), including organic waste, is collected in operational areas and taken to the warehouse for segregation by operators. Once classified, it is sent for reprocessing by accredited companies. Urban solid waste is compacted and sent to sanitary landfills or authorised landfills. Hazardous waste is stored, identified, and arranged before being sent to final confinement by authorised companies. Finally, spent lubricating oil is sent for reprocessing for reuse.\n\n## Waste disposal\n\n| Total waste            | Unit Tonne   | 2022 13,205   |\n|------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Hazardous waste        | Tonne        | 1,957         |\n| Non-hazardous waste    | Tonne        | 11,248        |\n| Municipal solid waste  | Tonne        | 2,307         |\n| Special handling waste | Tonne        | 8,941         |\n\nNote: New indicator so historic figures not available.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Soil can also be polluted by air-blown dust from TSFs. Our management system has procedures in place to prevent soil contamination.\n\n## Acid mine drainage\n\nOur goal is to prevent and responsibly manage acid mine drainage (AMD), thereby protecting the environment and the health of local communities.\n\nAMD is a major environmental challenge for the mining industry. Uncontrolled AMD represents a risk to surface and groundwater resources during mine operation as well as a legacy issue after closure. We analyse minerals and conduct geochemical tests to identify the AMD potential of ore mineral and waste rock. In our operations with AMD risk, notably the San Ram\u00f3n satellite mine, we implement site-specific management strategies such as capping waste rock piles with a dry cover (to reduce the ingress of oxygen and water) and collecting and treating acid water.\n\n## Cyanide management\n\nOur goal is to protect human health and the environment by responsibly managing sodium cyanide solutions and waste (tailings and spent heaps).\n\nEnvironmental protection and safety are critical for cyanide leaching systems. We comply with international best practices as promoted by the International Cyanide Management Institute (ICMI) and the Mexican standard NOM-155 SEMARNAT-2007, which establish environmental requirements for gold and silver leaching systems (production, transportation, storage, usage and facilities decommissioning). As part of our commitment to safe cyanide management, we engage with local authorities and collaborate with fire departments and hospitals to build emergency response capabilities. We also provide comprehensive training to our personnel and make operational and environmental information available to our stakeholders, ensuring both open dialogue and trust, which strengthen our social licence.\n\n## We design and operate our gold producing mines in compliance with the International Cyanide Management Institute (ICMI):\n\n- \u00b7 Purchase sodium cyanide from certified manufacturers.\n- \u00b7 Protect the environment and communities during transport to our facilities.\n- \u00b7 Protect our people and the environment during handling and storage.\n- \u00b7 Follow working practices that prevent impacts on health or ecosystems.\n- \u00b7 Optimise mineral processing to minimise the residual cyanide in tailings.\n- \u00b7 Manage and monitor seepage to prevent impacts on groundwater.\n- \u00b7 Decommission facilities responsibly to prevent legacy issues.\n- \u00b7 Provide our people with emergency response training, and on how to engage authorities and communities.\n- \u00b7 Provide training and organise drills for operational and emergency response personnel regarding cyanide management.\n- \u00b7 Engage with communities and authorities to ensure the transparency of our processes, potential hazards and controls.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVisit us online to learn more about our responsible cyanide management practices at www.fresnilloplc.com/ corporate-responsibility/environment/ cyanide-management-code\n\nOur operations at Herradura and Noche Buena are certified by the Cyanide Code, which accounts for each of their Merrill-Crowe processes and the dynamic leaching plants - the latter certifying its carbon column process in 2022. San Juli\u00e1n has been a signatory since 2021, and expects to become certified in the near future.

Please check the climate change scenarios at: https://www.wri.org/aqueduct\n\n## Performance\n\nDuring this period, we improved our water intensity and consumption performance. We did not detect any negative downstream impacts on ecosystems or water bodies due to our groundwater intake or water discharges. During the previous period, water consumption was driven by the construction of leaching pads at Herradura and a review in our water accounting practices, specifically in Herradura and Saucito; additionally the brackish water used for dust suppression at Herradura is also now included in our water accounting.\n\nIn the Fresnillo District, a new project was approved which will enable us to exclusively use treated wastewater in our operations, thereby reducing our water usage and costs, and also make mine water available for authorities to recharge the region's groundwater.\n\n## Water management in megalitres*\n\n| Category                | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total water  withdrawn  | 32,110 | 30,707 | 21,138 | 20,941 | 22,185 |\n| Total water  deviations | 17,207 | 13,954 | 7,522  | 7,721  | 8,848  |\n| Total water  consumed   | 14,904 | 16,753 | 13,616 | 13,220 | 13,337 |\n\n1 megalitre = 1,000 m 3",

In 2009, we first began using municipal wastewater for our industrial processes and currently have 18 facilities in operation - with two new treatment and two new purification projects set to come online in 2023. Through these actions, on average and on an annual basis we have\n\nmanaged to repurpose over 90% of our mine dewatering to recharge groundwater in compliance with NOM-001-SEMARNAT-1996. We also recently approved a project to replace mine water in our exploration and exploitation activities and in our mineral processing, which will lead to the exclusive use of treated wastewater from the Fresnillo municipality. Our goal is to completely avoid using freshwater from mine dewatering and to instead discharge it to a federal water source - according to regulation - for authorities to determine its final use such as recharging the groundwater in the region or irrigation activities in the community.\n\n## Current installed capacity of water treatment infrastructure\n\n| Type                  |   Current  capacity  (l/s) |   2023 new  capacity  (l/s) |   Total  capacity  (l/s) |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Wastewater  treatment |                        312 |                           4 |                      316 |\n| Purification          |                         23 |                          16 |                       39 |\n| Potabilisation        |                         56 |                           0 |                       56 |\n\nOur water treatment facilities are available for visit and we offer educational tours; on an annual basis we welcome an average of 3,500 students from our school district, helping them to understand our environmental culture and in particular the importance of water stewardship.\n\n## Water consumption\n\n## (megalitres)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water intensity (m 3 /tonne of mineral processed)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water input (megalitres)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reuse efficiency\n\n<!-- image -->",

We also support the NGO Naturalia as part of our WildCorp commitment.\n\n## Forest Nurseries\n\n| Mining unit   |   Started operations | Species of interest                                                                                                 | Production capacity   (seedlings/year)   |\n|---------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Fresnillo     |                 2010 | Fraxinus excelsior, Washingtonia robusta, Phoenix canariensis, Pinus pinea, Ligustros.                              | 60,000                                   |\n| Saucito       |                 2009 | Pinus pinea, Pinus greggii, Fraxinus, Quercus, Schinus molle, Phoenix canariensis.                                  | 30,000                                   |\n| Ci\u00e9nega       |                 2003 | Pinus duraguensis, Pinus engelmannii, Pinus arizonica, Picea chihuahuana, Pinus pseudotsuga, Pinus  abies.          | 100,000                                  |\n| Penmont       |                 2022 | Olneya tesota, Cercidium microphyllum, Prosopis juliflora, Acacia greggii, Acacia constricta, Bursera  microphylla. | 150,000                                  |\n| San Juli\u00e1n    |                 2022 | Pinus Duraguensis, Pinus arizonica, Pinus pseudotsuga.                                                              | 120,000                                  |\n\n## Remediation activities in 2022\n\n| Unit        | Description                                                                  |   Area (ha) | Seedlings   |   Species |\n|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Ci\u00e9nega     | Remediation of operations.                                                   |       60.5  | 100,000     |         4 |\n| San Juli\u00e1n  | Progressive remediation of mine closure, operations and community campaigns. |       52    | 60,000      |         3 |\n| Saucito     | Remediation of operations.                                                   |        1.8  | 700         |         5 |\n| Noche Buena | Remediation of operations.                                                   |       14.5  | 520         |         4 |\n| Juanicipio  | Community campaigns.                                                         |        0.64 | 140         |         3 |\n\n## What's next\n\n- \u00b7 Progressively implement critical environmental risk management methodology guided by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) in our mining units.\n- \u00b7 Analyse alternatives for carbon offsetting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition to physical risks, the closure vision also considers the potential social impacts of closure and involves early stakeholder engagement. The social transition may include initiatives such as workforce training, local procurement, infrastructure transfer and ongoing monitoring.\n\nThe closure vision for Noche Buena is to restore the land to its original pre-mining use, specifically for livestock and wildlife purposes. This means removing most access roads, power corridors, water supply and other infrastructure, while\n\nretaining certain facilities until post-closure care responsibilities have been fulfilled. All waste management facilities, processing areas, and other structures will be closed to ensure the safety of livestock and wildlife.\n\nThe closure principles and objectives will include a combination of restoration and long-term maintenance. A 20-year post-closure period has been defined. Demolition waste and debris will be removed off-site, while some facilities, such as the leach yard, may require ongoing care. Penmont and Fresnillo plc will work closely with external stakeholders to ensure their vision for a postmining community is reflected in the closure plan and includes regular consultation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

During this third year of the pandemic, we again addressed the challenge through joint business and community efforts, aligning our partnerships and social investment strategy to raise awareness and support the most vulnerable sectors. We also collaborated with authorities in vaccination campaigns, significantly increasing vaccination rates in local communities. Additionally, we helped communities prepare for a safe return to school by providing sanitary items such as masks, and made donations to repair school infrastructure that had deteriorated during the period.\n\n## Engaging communities effectively in the lifecycle of mining\n\nOur community strategy, which embraces all phases of the mining lifecycle, aims to build mutual understanding between our operations and local communities, ensuring that we engage, develop and grow together.\n\n- \u00b7 Exploration: our exploration teams are the first to establish contact with a local community. We identify the relevant stakeholders and focus our engagement efforts on obtaining temporary access to\n\nexplore land. We develop early local employment and procurement opportunities related to our exploration activities. Social investment is channelled through donations.\n\n- \u00b7 Project development: our stakeholder relationships deepen in this phase of the cycle, as we build trust through activities including local hiring, and contracts for project-related activities. Social investment takes the form of programmes to support capacity building as well as donations. For our advanced feasibility and development projects, we conduct social baseline and impact assessments, manage impacts responsibly and identify development opportunities.\n- \u00b7 Operation: we regularly engage with the community via formal and informal meetings in order to manage expectations and detect risks and opportunities. Local employment and procurement are related to operation and support activities. We carry out comprehensive social studies to evaluate our social performance and reputation, as well as community concerns and development opportunities.\n- \u00b7 Closure: we prepare for closure through social studies and community engagement to identify impacts, mitigation measures and opportunities.",

Stakeholders expect responsible management of negative impacts, as well as contributions to community development. Reputation and trust may be affected by negative perceptions of the mining industry, and opposition to mining projects can be reduced through responsible and timely management of these expectations.\n\nWe have procedures in place to detect potential risks, including negative perception of the company's performance, failure to address community concerns, reduction in public spending, increased expectations and scrutiny, ineffective engagement and communication, and competition for natural resources, among others.\n\nOur risk management process involves all areas of the organisation, using a structured approach. Risks are prioritised based on potential impact, and preventive and mitigation actions are\n\nmonitored in follow-up sessions. Collaboration committees are formed for each risk, assigning responsibilities to specialists for resolution within a framework of accountability. The process continues until the conditions leading to the risk are addressed and resolved, and the risk is fully eliminated.\n\nOur community engagement strategy is based on addressing stakeholder concerns and expectations throughout the mining life cycle. This includes formal and informal meetings, social and perception studies, a complaints and grievance mechanism, monitoring public opinion, collaborating with peers, and promoting best practices in social and environmental responsibility. We:\n\n- \u00b7 Design our projects to avoid impacts and when not possible mitigate these impacts and address community concerns responsibly.\n- \u00b7 Monitor and address the social impacts and

For example, an increase in grievances could in fact mean that the communication channels, the degree of two-way trust or the openness of the Company towards communities' concerns have improved over time, and vice-versa. Instead, we track progress in our consistent understanding of communities' needs and demands, to learn lessons across our operations, improve performance and ensure that the incident is not repeated. The real value of the grievance mechanism lies in the development of longlasting relationships based on mutual trust, and a procedure that allows us to address concerns fairly and successfully.\n\nconcerns and resolve disputes. To properly address stakeholder concerns, we have Community Relations (CR) teams in all operating units and current projects.

We partner with the communities where we operate to engage the authorities and aim to encourage them to fund infrastructure projects that benefit mining communities.\n\nThe Fresnillo plc contribution to the Fund for Sustainable Development of Mining States and Municipalities was US$48.66 million in 2022.\n\n|   2022 US$ million |   2021 US$ million |\n|--------------------|--------------------|\n|              48.66 |               64.1 |\n\n## Local employment and procurement\n\nLocal employment is a key driver of social acceptability and community development. We promote local employment from the early days of the exploration phase onwards. In the\n\ndevelopment and operational phases, for example, we offer employment opportunities directly or through our mining contractors. Our local and regional labour as a percentage of the total workforce is 67.25%. Our Centre for Technical Studies (CETEF) and Pe\u00f1oles Centre for Technical Studies in Laguna del Rey (CETLAR) train mining, instrumentation and maintenance technicians to meet our specific needs. Candidates are chosen from the communities surrounding our operations, thus securing talent and engaging the community in the long term. We participate in the mining clusters of Zacatecas, Sonora and Chihuahua. These clusters contribute to the development of regional suppliers, strengthening their participation in the value chain of mining companies.\n\nDuring the year, our local employment reduced significantly against the previous year, due to the impact of the Mexican Labour Reform. Although our total workforce grew by almost 8% and our total local workforce by almost 3%, with the employment of local unionised and non-unionised personnel both increasing, a significant decrease in local workers employed via contractors led to the overall reduction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Payments to suppliers (contractors)   | 81.5%   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|\n| Payments to Federal Government        | 11.6%   |\n| Wages and benefits to workers         | 6.6%    |\n| Payments to local governments         | 0.3%    |\n\n## Economic value distributed by state\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Sonora      | 23.8%   |\n|-------------|---------|\n| Mexico City | 23.4%   |\n| Zacatecas   | 18.4%   |\n| Chihuahua   | 11.0%   |\n| Durango     | 9.2%    |\n| Coahuila    | 6.0%    |\n| Guanajuato  | 5.1%    |\n| Other       | 3.2%    |\n\nEconomic Value Distributed is considered to be a social performance measure.\n\nTotal economic impact\n\n## US$ 2,228.69 m\n\n## Local employment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2022 | 67.25%   |\n|--------|----------|\n|   2021 | 70.98%   |\n|   2020 | 72.29%   |\n|   2019 | 68.41%   |\n|   2018 | 68.27%   |",

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on education in Mexico. In 2020, our response was to migrate our education programmes to digital platforms. In 2021, we partnered with our communities to support the safe return to schools, reaching full capacity in 2022.\n\n## Key activities:\n\n- \u00b7 We continued our STEM education activities, and we followed-up our 'How to protect yourself and others from Covid-19?' training module with a new set of short videos. Produced with the assistance of Innovec and Director David Revilla, these films educate school students on issues including the science behind the prevention of Covid-19, awareness of Covid-19, caring for others and managing our emotions.\n- \u00b7 We launched our School and Family Gardens project in the Fresnillo District, in collaboration with the Brigade for Rural Education No.46 and the Department of Agricultural Development of the Municipality of Fresnillo. The project aims to foster environmental care and teach healthy eating habits (see 'Helping local communities help themselves' case study).\n- \u00b7 We donated books in alliance with Larousse for the third year in row through the 'Happy Tale' and 'Cuent\u00f3polis' campaigns. Additionally, we held storytelling events with the 'Junk Troop' performing stories on 'The trash monster' about caring for the environment, under the campaign 'Together but not mixed up'. Additionally, books were distributed at the Festival Cultural y\n- Lectura Picando Letras, in commemoration of World Book and Copyright Day.\n- \u00b7 We delivered programmes on reading, writing, mathematics and science, in order to help reduce the educational lag created by Covid-19 among Penmont communities.\n- \u00b7 Given the current conflict and violence in some regions, the 'Tools for Peace Building' programme was implemented by Ensamble Alejandr\u00eda, aimed at supporting human rights, non-discrimination and peace.\n- \u00b7 We promoted the School of the Sea programme with the support of the Intercultural Centre for the Study of the Desert and Oceans (CEDO), a community initiative that promotes fishing and conservation of the marine ecosystem. In addition, we completed initial modules of the Women of the Sea programme in coordination with our partner Proempleo in the communities of Campod\u00f3nico and Desemboque in Penmont.\n- \u00b7 We worked on initiatives to benefit school communities in partnership with the Secretary of Education and Culture of the State of Sonora and other mining companies of the Sonora Mining Cluster. Together, we developed several programmes as well as designing the Dual Model that is expected to be implemented in institutions such as UTHermosillo, UNISIERRA and CONALEP.\n- \u00b7 All students with scholarships at LaSalle University returned to school. We consolidated a new alliance with the Northeast LaSalle University that will provide scholarships for FIRST Robotics graduates. We were also pleased to see Sonora's first generation graduate from the Excellence Programme (see case study).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting the fight against climate change\n\nWe are working to improve how Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education can help students in the Fresnillo District understand and respond to climate change.\n\nThrough a partnership between Fresnillo plc, UNESCO's Office for Climate Education, Zacatecas' Education and Science Ministries, Zacatecas mining cluster (Clusmin) and INNOVEC, the new programme will provide 20 hours of face-to-face training to 800 teachers, benefiting an estimated total of 24,000 students from grades 5 and 6, and junior high school. As part of our commitment to the Quality Education and Climate Action Sustainable Development Goals, we are meeting half of the cost of the programme directly supporting a total of 400 teachers and around 12,000 students.\n\n- \u00b7 Our First Robotics teams enrolled in the 2022-2023 competition. We are also sponsoring a new team from the Mineral de la Luz community in the Guanajuato District, bringing our total sponsorships to five.\n- \u00b7 The traditional Christmas concert, given by the internationally renowned flautist Elena Dur\u00e1n in San Juli\u00e1n, was held as part of the Flutes without Borders programme.\n\n## First generation of Excellence Programme graduates\n\nThe first generation of students from our neighbouring communities have recently graduated from the Fresnillo plc-Universidad La Salle Laguna's Excellence Scholarship Programme. These four young professionals Lidia, Nayeli, Imanol, and Pedro - originally from the Yerbitas and El Sabinal communities neighbouring the San Juli\u00e1n and Fresnillo units, have earned degrees in the fields of Finance, Mechatronics, Civil Engineering, and Languages and are a success story for their communities.\n\nThis successful partnership between Fresnillo and La Salle University is designed to support students from vulnerable sectors to pursue higher education, and to develop their talent and skills by nurturing teamwork, leadership, solidarity and project management.\n\nOriginally created with the goal of disseminating STEM education through the sponsorship of the FIRST Robotics team competition, the programme provides 100% scholarships for academic, living, and other expenses, to support the most talented students from public schools in the San Juli\u00e1n, Fresnillo, Penmont, Ci\u00e9nega communities and, also recently, in Las Torres.",

Our programme includes distributing materials for building greenhouses, providing high-quality seeds and offering expert advice on cultivating vegetables. We also equip people with materials for building chicken coops and feeders, along with the chickens themselves and advice about disease prevention.\n\nOur overarching goal is to foster sustainable models where the community, authorities, and Fresnillo work together for the collective good. In the short term, our objective is to improve nutrition and empower the community to produce their own food, including eggs, meat, squash, radish, coriander, cucumber, lettuce, onion and chard, right from their homes and schools.\n\nDuring the last 12 months, we pursued 30 new backyard poultry projects for families in the communities of Presa de Linares and Col. El Obligado by supplying 40 chickens as well as the equipment they need to thrive. At Juanicipio, we continued to support school gardens in four communities with the active participation of families, students and teachers, rolled out two new ones and supported three new family gardens, while in Saucito and Fresnillo we initiated school gardens in three communities in each location.\n\n' We are grateful for this project that allows us to learn how to harvest vegetables such as squash, coriander, peas and cucumbers alongside our schooling.

        "page_content": "## Respecting human rights\n\nOur due diligence approach is based on social assessments in the communities where we operate and develop projects. These assessments enable us to identify the social, environmental, labour and human rights risks and impacts of our activities. The findings are used to continually improve our stakeholder engagement strategy and social management plans. We also implement an additional process at our concessions to support the early identification of the presence of indigenous peoples and inform our subsequent engagement approach.\n\nWe do not tolerate any form of threats or mechanisms to intimidate or obtain corporate benefits. We do not condone attacks on anyone, including those who may oppose our activities.\n\n## Interactions with private security\n\nBased on our risk assessment, we decided that our private security forces would be unarmed to avoid:\n\n- \u00b7 clashes with criminal groups that could put the lives of workers or communities in danger; and\n- \u00b7 violent confrontations with artisanal miners accessing our facilities illegally.\n\nWe expect our private security contractors to conduct themselves ethically, based on honest, respectful, transparent, equitable and fair relations, in strict accordance with the law and guidelines in relation to human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. Private security providers are required to implement a background screening process based on the national criminal database.\n\nThe deterrent function of our private security forces is supported by technology and by collaboration with security authorities at the municipal, state and federal level.\n\n## Interactions with public security\n\nAt present the Herradura mine is the only facility protected by the Federal Mining Police. In 2020, Mexico's Federal Protection Service (Secretariat for Citizen Safety and Protection) formed a new police force specialising in mining operations' security. The Mining Police force is the result of collaboration between the Secretariat for Citizen Safety and Protection, the Secretariat of Economy and Mexico's Mining Chamber. The Mining Police have been trained on the protection of mining facilities and Human Rights. Our Herradura mine is the first mining operation in Mexico to benefit from the deployment of the Mining Police, which was accompanied by a public commitment from Senior Government Security Officials, our CEO and the President of the Mexican Mining Chamber. All\n\nmembers of the Mining Police undertake a 15-hour Human Rights training course which includes the following learning objectives: identification of the core concepts of human rights and police action; and how to protect, respect, promote and guarantee human rights in their work activities and also in their daily lives.\n\nCriminal background checks of all Fresnillo plc employees are conducted during the hiring process with enhanced confidence controls for members of our own Security Department.\n\n## Indigenous peoples\n\nFostering meaningful engagement with indigenous peoples, respecting their right to free, prior and informed consent.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that every interaction with indigenous peoples respects their values, culture and traditions. We recognise that consultation is a fundamental right of indigenous communities and a mechanism to build trust. Good faith, transparency and accountability are the key values that guide our consultative approach.\n\nConsultation allows us to understand their perspectives on our projects and address their concerns. Before the consultation phase, we assess the potential impacts and benefits of our projects and develop the capacities of the communities to fully exercise their right to consultation. During consultation, we consider their preferred method of engagement, present information in a culturally appropriate manner and reach agreements on shared benefits. In 2018, our commitment to constructive dialogue and inclusive participation was fundamental to obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of the Raramuri indigenous peoples to build and operate a water reservoir for our San Juli\u00e1n mine. In 2021, we engaged the indigenous peoples' committee to collaborate on roads and collective water monitoring. We have since provided guidance to Indigenous Consultations in Mexico based on our experience at San Juli\u00e1n, the Mexican regulatory framework and international best practices. We are also strengthening our relationships with the indigenous peoples of Orisyvo and San Juli\u00e1n. We:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify indigenous communities, proactively conducting due diligence of our exploration concessions.\n- \u00b7 Engage respectfully in a culturally appropriate manner that recognises their culture, values and aspirations.\n- \u00b7 Implement best practices regarding the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples.\n\n## Land acquisitions and resettlements\n\nOur goal is to manage resettlement responsibly, respecting local laws and following international best practices.\n\nDeveloping a mining project involves land acquisition and, in some cases, the resettlement of households. We recognise that these are complex and life-changing issues for communities. When poorly planned and managed, land acquisition and resettlement can adversely impact the livelihoods and social structure of communities, damage our relationships or even cause conflict. We recognise that the right to an adequate standard of living after land acquisition and resettlement projects is a basic human right. We:\n\n- \u00b7 Avoid resettlements whenever possible, by exploring alternative options.\n- \u00b7 If resettlements are unavoidable, work together with affected households, communities and governments to minimise adverse impacts, restoring or improving livelihoods and living conditions.\n- \u00b7 Further develop our competencies and internal processes to manage resettlements, including social baseline and asset surveys, an entitlement and compensation framework, negotiation, livelihood restoration programmes and ongoing monitoring and evaluation.\n\n## Performance\n\nNo community resettlements occurred at our operations or development projects during 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Workforce engagement\n\nOur workforce is the driving force behind our business success. The Board recognises that in order to attract and retain talent we must aim to enable truly human and fulfilling relationships that prioritise wellbeing and workforce satisfaction, which in turn enhance productivity. Moreover, to unlock the full potential of our workforce, we must promote inclusion, create a culture of engagement, and foster a respectful and healthy environment that promotes creativity, innovation and collaboration.\n\nOur workforce can express their views through a range of channels and direct engagement sessions. This arrangement enables the Board to understand the views of the workforce regarding their day-today experiences and provides an additional mechanism to raise concerns. For this purpose, Mr Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez has been designated as the Non-Executive Director to engage with the workforce and convey their views in the Boardroom.\n\nDue to Covid-19 restrictions, in 2021 the Company was forced to reevaluate its strategy for workforce engagement. In 2022, Mr Fern\u00e1ndez again led two virtual engagement sessions, enabling him to gain firsthand knowledge of the views of our workforce; these sessions brought together representatives from all areas of the Company, including unionised and non-unionised personnel, with a proper balance of demography, responsibilities and location. The first session addressed integral wellbeing, health, safety and Covid-19 measures, while the second was completely open, allowing the workforce to raise their own topics of interest.\n\nThe frank and transparent nature of these engagement sessions yielded valuable insights, such as a sense of pride in working for the Company, appreciation of investment in training and professional development, recognition of good job benefits in comparison to our competitors, and a recognition of improvement in corporate communication. Areas of concern included security surrounding our operations, safety incidents and turnover rates, simplification of administrative processes, salary and wages in the context of inflation, and appeal mechanisms for performance appraisals.\n\nFeedback from these workforce engagement sessions was discussed at the July and October 2022 Board meetings. The insights garnered from these sessions have proved to be immensely valuable in shaping the Boardroom discourse and decision-making process. Additionally, this feedback was also instrumental in informing management programmes and practices. The specific concerns highlighted by the workforce were shared with Company top management by Mr Fern\u00e1ndez, and steps have been taken to ensure that they are addressed in an appropriate and timely manner. Management is working to ensure that these concerns are resolved effectively and efficiently in order to improve the overall work environment and employee satisfaction. The feedback will also be used to inform future policies and initiatives to continuously improve the organisation.\n\nIn the expectation that we will gradually return to a new normality after the Covid-19 pandemic, consideration will be given both by Mr Fern\u00e1ndez and top management as to the possibility of holding certain workforce engagement sessions in a mixed virtual and physical format and/or with the physical presence of all participants.\n\nMr Fern\u00e1ndez also held two face-to-face meetings with the union leader during the year, in order to fully understand the union's views. The main insight gained from these meetings was that the Company could empower the workforce by encouraging greater responsibility and accountability, which would enable supervisors to evolve their role from comptrollers to advisors.\n\nThis Board-level engagement serves as a clear indication of our commitment to understanding our workforce and acts as an additional avenue for employees to voice any concerns. By actively seeking feedback, we can gain a deeper understanding of the issues that matter most and take appropriate actions to address them, demonstrating our commitment to fostering an open and transparent work environment that prioritises employee wellbeing and satisfaction. Furthermore, this process allows us to identify potential areas of improvement and implement changes that can benefit both our workforce and the Company as a whole, and that help us create a more positive and productive work environment. We look forward to working hand-in-hand with an engaged workforce that demonstrates a high level of commitment and dedication to our shared goals. Together, we will build a more sustainable and successful future.",

        "page_content": "## Managing our risks and opportunities\n\nWe operate in a complex global environment, where opportunities come with corresponding risks. Taking and managing risk responsibly is essential to running our business safely, effectively and in a way that creates value for all our stakeholders. Risk management is one of our management teams core responsibilities and is central to our decision-making process.\n\nThe global post-pandemic aftershock, geopolitical instability, digital transformation and climate change have catapulted risk management to centre stage. Many of us have learned new and vital lessons about effective risk management over the last year, so that preparing for disruption is one of our highest priorities.\n\n## Our approach\n\nEffective risk management enables us to manage both the threats and the opportunities associated with our strategy and operations. Our risk management process helps us to manage material risks that have the potential to impact our business objectives. While risk management is a key accountability and performance criterion for our leaders, all employees have responsibility for identifying and managing risks. Our risk management framework reflects the importance of risk awareness across Fresnillo plc. It enables us to identify, assess, prioritise and manage risks to deliver the value creation objectives defined in our business model.\n\nTimely risk monitoring is at the core of our management practices, helping to deliver on our strategy and our commitments to stakeholders, including colleagues, communities and the planet. We are focused on conducting our business responsibly, safely and legally, while making risk-informed decisions when responding to opportunities or threats that present themselves. With the leadership of the Board and the Executive Committee and guided by our risk appetite on a risk-by-risk basis, we understand, prioritise and manage our risks. Our risk management framework, which we further enhanced during the year, enables us to undertake this exercise with structure and rigour.\n\nOur Board oversees our principal risks and associated management responses, while the Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls. Our risk management system comprises six core elements (see page 130) - one of which is our risk management framework, which sets out clear roles and responsibilities, standards and procedures. We also have three lines of defence to verify that risks are being effectively managed in line with our policy, standards and procedures, including across core business processes such as finance, health and safety, social performance, environment and major hazards.\n\nThe post-pandemic impact of Covid-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war pose unprecedented challenges for everybody, worldwide. We have implemented risk techniques and processes to identify new risks associated with these events, while also analysing their impact on all our risks. The changes to working practices that we have introduced in response to Covid-19 have created opportunities to accelerate digital transformation and enhance safety and productivity.\n\n## Risk management system\n\nOur risk management system is based on risk identification, assessment, prioritisation, mitigation and monitoring processes, which are continually evaluated, improved and enhanced in line with best practice.\n\nA complete view of our risk universe starts with the analysis of our business, the external environment in which we operate, the regulatory landscape and our internal operations. This includes the impacts on and of our strategy, initiatives, governance and processes. In addition to our established risk management activities, our executives - including operations and project managers, the controllership group, Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Community Relations (HSECR) team and exploration managers - regularly engage in strengthening the effectiveness of our current controls. These actions support the executives and the Board in each of their responsibilities.\n\nThe Company's risk profile has been developed based on the most significant risks in our business profiles. All of our principal risks were reviewed at least twice during the year, including through Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), which were developed to help embed the risk appetite framework in the business and enhance the monitoring and mitigation of risks.\n\nThe global Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical instability and climate change posed new challenges for the risk department and the Executive Committee. Due to the uncertainty around these topics, all strategic decisions by the Company were analysed using risk scenarios modelling their potential impacts. In addition, we continue to use five key processes to better manage our risks: (i) a monthly procedure for evaluating and mitigating principal risks; (ii) a process to identify and analyse the impact of the pandemic and geopolitical instability in all the Company's risks, including projects, with a main focus on the health and safety of employees and identification of new risks; (iii) dashboards for each business unit to monitor mitigation actions and risk level; (iv) impact and probability scenarios which were conducted for risks related to the supply chain of critical inputs for operations, cost increases and projects; and (v) collaboration with government, the mining sector, health experts and communities to ensure that we followed best practice.\n\nIt is important to recognise that the Board, the Audit Committee, the HSECRC Committee and the Executive Committee periodically use working sessions to review the evolution of principal and emerging risks, as well as the appetite for each risk. At these working sessions, the views and suggestions of Board members are heard, and adjustments are made according to the factors influencing each risk. In addition, the HSECRC Committee now meets before every Board meeting to review the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control systems, with particular attention paid to safety, climate, tailings dams and environmental risks.",

        "page_content": "## Managing our risks and opportunities continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nThe 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code covers emerging risks and requires the Board to carry out a robust assessment of the Company's emerging risks, disclose procedures to identify them and also explain how these are being managed.\n\nThis requirement has been adopted and embedded within our risk management reporting process and, in parallel with the day-to-day management of risk, within each business unit and project. The risk control and assessment processes in mines, exploration offices and projects have been adapted to pay attention to emerging risks. At each location, Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Community Relations risk-responsible staff monitor local information and analyses related to these emerging risks. This monitoring process involves building scenarios for three, five and ten years for each emerging risk and quarterly performance indicators that assess probability and impact.\n\nFresnillo plc defines an emerging risk as a new manifestation of risk that cannot yet be fully assessed, a risk that is known to some degree but is not likely to materialise or have an impact for several years or a risk that the Company is not aware of but that could, due to emerging macro trends in the mid- or long-term future, have significant implications for the achievement of our strategic plan. Furthermore, we consider emerging risks in the context of longer-term impact and shorter-term risk velocity. We have therefore defined emerging risks as those risks\n\ncaptured on a risk register that: (i) are likely to be of significant scale beyond a five-year timeframe; or (ii) have the velocity to significantly increase in severity within the five-year period.\n\nAs the pandemic is now becoming more endemic with varying pathways to recovery across different countries, the longer-term impact of how we adapt to this new normal is still uncertain. This includes the productivity of a hybrid workforce environment, the impacts of tighter labour markets, and supply chain disruptions. The recent disruptions caused by the post-pandemic demand surge and the inability of supply chains to keep up, have highlighted the complexity and vulnerability of the global supply chain infrastructure.\n\nSupply chain disruptions can also be caused by a number of principal risk events - as described in our principal risks and uncertainties section such as natural disasters and geopolitical tensions. Inflationary pressures may also affect the competitiveness of suppliers, leading to supplier market contraction further impacting supply chain resilience. Severe supply chain disruptions have the potential to impact not only inbound and outbound flows of our feedstock, services and products, but also the delivery of our sustaining and growth projects.\n\nIn the longer term, as the world transitions to a low-carbon future and consumer demand for sustainable goods flows through the value chain, the supply-demand dynamics of commodities are expected to shift. This will lead to increasing\n\ndemand for sources and solutions with low CO 2 emissions, and a lower social and environmental footprint, in addition to a growing demand for transparent, sustainable and circular value chains.\n\nTo strengthen our emerging risks management framework, during 2022 we carried out activities to: (i) identify new emerging risks in light of Covid-19, geopolitical instability and climate change; (ii) re-assess the emerging risks identified in 2021; (iii) deploy effective monitoring mechanisms; (iv) carry out horizon scanning to consider disruptive scenarios; and (v) implement mitigating control actions and enhance our risk awareness culture. This process involved workshops, surveys and meetings with the Board, Executive Committee, business unit leaders, support and corporate areas, as well as suppliers, contractors and customers. We also consulted third-party information from global risk reports, academic publications, risk consulting experts and industry benchmarks.\n\nOur risk management standards promote communication of up-to-date information on the Company and industry risks, trends and emerging risks. This year's emerging risk assessment determined the two most exposed emerging risks to be: 'Water stress and drought' and 'Transition to a low-carbon future' and identified three new emerging risks: 'Geopolitical instability', 'Replacement on depletion of ore reserves' and 'Future of the workforce'.",

We conducted the same risk analysis on our advanced projects, detailing the specific risks faced by each project based on its unique characteristics and conditions.\n\nOverview of the 2022 risk assessment exercise:\n\n## Analysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusiness workshops\n\n(Director and manager level).\n\n## Analysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8\n\n## risk analysis methodologies used:\n\nISO 31000, ISO 22301, Markov, Bow-Tie, FMEA Model, Monte Carlo, RACI Matrix, Cause and consequence analysis.\n\n## Trend comparison and review\n\n## Added value\n\n25\n\n## gold and silver mines\n\n(15 in Mexico and ten elsewhere in the world) were consulted regarding their risks.\n\n## Added value\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncolleagues were trained\n\nin advanced risk topics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninterviews with risk owners\n\n(managers and leaders at units).\n\n## Survey risk identified and assessed\n\n360\n\n## colleagues\n\nin operations, exploration, projects, corporate and support areas of Pe\u00f1oles, including Internal Audit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8\n\n## consulting firms' risk reports\n\n(including Marsh, Zurich, EY, PWC, KPMG and Deloitte) were reviewed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## colleagues were trained\n\nin climate change risks and TCFD framework.\n\nWe maintain a risk register through a robust assessment of the potential principal risks that could affect the Company's performance. This register is used to ensure that principal risks are identified in a thorough and systematic way and that agreed definitions of risk are used.\n\nWe are aware that not all risks can be completely eliminated and that exposure to some risks is necessary in the pursuit of our corporate objectives. Mining is, by its nature, a long-term business and as part of the principal risks update and evaluation process we identify new or emerging risks which could impact the Company's sustainability in the long run, even if there is limited information available at the time of the evaluation.\n\n25\n\nworkshops delivered\n\nto the SSMARC team.\n\n## Trend comparison and review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## international institutions\n\nspecialising in risks were consulted.\n\n6\n\nrisk experts\n\nwere interviewed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## specific topics\n\nwere included in the risk analysis: geopolitical instability, fraud and compliance, climate change and TCFD risks.\n\n300\n\ncolleagues were trained\n\nin basic risk topics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n## new topics\n\nwere included in the risk analysis: security, water scarcity and management, physical resilience to natural disasters and extreme weather.\n\nDue to the effects caused by the global postpandemic impacts of Covid-19, the Russia-Ukraine war, climate change, the effects of global inflation and the security and environmental situations near our operations, it was necessary to reassess the principal risks and reorder their materiality, likelihood and impact, as well as reassess related mitigation actions. During the first half of 2022, the risk team focused its efforts on identifying and assessing emerging risks, business continuity risks, safety risks and climate change risks against TCFD criteria. In the second half, we conducted assessments of fraud, compliance, human resources, security and internal control risks, and Board members also took part in a working session to review principal and emerging risks as well as risk appetite.\n\n20\n\ncritical processes\n\nmapped and reviewed for impact and likelihood.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrisks scenarios\n\nwere built by mining industry risk specialists.",

        "page_content": "As a result of the annual risk assessment for the year 2022, the following main results were determined:\n\n- \u00b7 Due to the importance of these risks to the Company, and in order to better analyse and have more detail on the speed of the risks in terms of probability, it is necessary to separate two principal risks: 'Impact of metal prices and global macroeconomic developments' and 'Tailings and environmental incidents.'\n- \u00b7 In relation to the risk 'Global macroeconomic developments' , this is mainly due to the increased risk of continued global and Mexican inflation in 2023, possible economic recessions, disruption of supply of critical inputs (steel, diesel, cyanide, cement, spare parts, equipment, etc.) and increased operating costs. It is essential to analyse this risk in detail.\n- \u00b7 With regard to 'Tailings dams' , this is the result of the hard work carried out by Baluarte Minero and Fresnillo plc's operations to increase safety and comply with the highest international TSF standards. In order to comply with these standards, it is necessary to periodically assess the risks of TSFs.\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe risk of\n\n'Potential actions by the\n\n- government' , is assessed as the main risk for the Company, exacerbated by recent decisions of the current government, such as: (a) the restriction on the granting of new mining concessions; (b) the increase in audits and tax requirements; (c) the labour reform that prohibits outsourcing, leading to complications in relationships with contractors; (d) delays and complications in obtaining permits, licences and authorisations; (e) the implementation of policies that support the emission of carbon into the atmosphere and reduce the development of renewable energies; (f) energy law reform that would reduce electricity supply options for end-users and allocate valuable resources to maintain obsolete and costly generation technologies, with significant environmental and social impacts; and (g) the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA or TMEC) with its new labour provisions.\n- \u00b7 The 'Security' risk, arising from the accelerated increase in organised crime in the vicinity of the mining units, particularly in Fresnillo, Saucito, Juanicipio and Penmont (with the highest perception of insecurity in the country); the increase in high-impact crimes (homicide, kidnapping and extortion) in the regions where we operate, especially in Zacatecas, Guanajuato and Sonora; and the sale and consumption of drugs inside the mines. Threats of theft of dore, minerals, concentrates and assets from mines and projects have also increased.\n- \u00b7 The 'Human Resources' risk has increased severely, due to the resignation of talent in key positions at the mines and the lack of candidates to fill important positions within the operating process.\n- \u00b7 The 'Cybersecurity' risk has increased mainly due to the increase in remote home office activities, and a sophisticated adversary able to exploit stolen credentials and identities to amplify ransomware and 'big game hunting' attacks.\n- \u00b7 During the months of September and October, the 'Fraud' risk assessment was carried out, identifying risks and areas of opportunity in the following processes: 1. Payroll (employees and unionised), 2. Award of contracts for supplies and services, 3. Administration of contracts for supplies and services, 4. Theft of finished products during transportation, 5. Theft of unit assets (wiring, spare parts, consumables, etc.) and 6. Attack on the technological repositories of critical company information. In all cases, internal controls and timely follow-up and preventive actions have been increased. Early detection actions were also reinforced. The internal audit area considered these results in its annual programme 2023.\n- \u00b7 During 2022 we worked together with the ESG Department to analyse and assess the ' Climate Change' risk, and the critical risks and oportunities that make up the 'Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures' (TCFD), assessing the potential impacts and creating risk materialisation scenarios, which are related to the financial viability statement.\n- Regarding physical risks we consider: 'Changes in frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as rainfall, droughts and heatwaves affecting our operations and neighbouring communities' and 'Increase in average temperatures, reduction in annual precipitation and associated water stress'. Regarding transitional risks we consider: 'Emerging regulations such as local or transborder carbon taxes, cap and trade systems or increasing requirements from current emissions regulations', 'Changes in the regulatory framework of renewables' and 'Increase in energy prices.'\n- \u00b7 This year, Fresnillo plc's 'individual risks' increased from 120 to 130 risks, as a result of the analysis of water scarcity and management, fraud, climate change and cybersecurity risks.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nWe define risk appetite as ' the nature and extent of risk Fresnillo plc is willing to accept in relation to the pursuit of its objectives '. We look at risk appetite from the context of severity of the consequences should the risk materialise, any relevant internal or external factors influencing the risk, and the status of management actions to mitigate or control the risk. A scale is used to help determine the limit of appetite for each risk, recognising that risk appetite will change over time. If a risk exceeds appetite, it will threaten the achievement of objectives and may require a change to strategy.\n\nRisks that are approaching the limit of the Group's risk appetite may require management actions to be accelerated or enhanced to ensure the risks remain within appetite levels. For catastrophic and operational risks, our risk appetite for exceptions or deficiencies in the status of our controls that have safety implications is very low. Our internal audit programme evaluates these controls with technical experts at operations and the results of that audit work will determine the risk appetite evaluation, along with the management response to any issues identified.",

This could include: new stricter environmental regulations or guidelines, environmental taxes, new forms of labour and union contracting, longer and more complicated permitting and licensing processes, more complex and time-consuming arrangements for accessing explosives, more complex or onerous tax compliance obligations for us and our contractors, as well as more frequent reviews by tax, environmental and social security authorities.\n\nThe current federal government has expressed a negative sentiment towards the mining industry and particularly open-pit mining, which is why it has decided not to grant any more mining concessions during the current government term that ends in 2024, and is likely to review in detail the status of the concessions that have already been granted, seeking to remove those that are not being exploited or worked. On the other hand, it promotes the right of indigenous and AfroMexican communities to be consulted prior to the granting of mining concessions, which could potentially affect the granting of new concessions in Mexico.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\n- \u00b7 Change of head of the Mexican Economy Minister, who is the federal government's authority on mining matters. Tatiana Clouthier left the post and was succeeded by Raquel Buenrostro. This change is perceived as negative for the mining industry, as Buenrostro has expressed her dissatisfaction with mining companies for not paying taxes and polluting.\n- \u00b7 The federal government reported that it would review the granting of concessions to mining companies and that no more concessions would be granted during this six-year term (which ends in 2024). It is therefore possible that it will withdraw unexploited gold and silver concessions.\n- \u00b7 Labour reform that prohibits subcontracting, which mainly generates complications in relationships with contractors.\n- \u00b7 New taxes and discrepancies in the criteria used in audits carried out by the tax authority.\n\nIn May 2022, a reform to the Mining Law was approved to reserve the exploration, exploitation, benefit and use of lithium to the State. The aim is for this mineral to be used for the benefit of national development; although gold and silver are not mentioned specifically, other minerals declared as 'strategic by the state' are mentioned, and at some point, precious metals could be considered under this heading. This would directly and seriously affect the concessions currently exploited by the Company.\n\nAnother risk for 2023 is the possible presentation of a comprehensive reform initiative to the Mining Law via the Senate, in which sensitive matters affecting the mining sector will be discussed, such as transparency of information, consultation with indigenous peoples and communities, modification of the concession regime in terms of its validity and grounds for cancellation, among others.\n\nThe federal government, by investing in a new petrochemical refinery in 'Dos Bocas', Tabasco, and buying an oil refinery in 'Deer Park', Texas, indicates that its energy policy promotes fuel oil and coal, which discourages the generation of energy based on clean sources. This complicates attention to and compliance with international climate change goals and standards.\n\n- \u00b7 Increased frequency of audits by tax authorities with a special focus on the mining industry.\n- \u00b7 The federal government promotes investment in coal instead of renewable or clean energy. This has made it more difficult to operate with clean energy.\n- \u00b7 The federal government's implementation of policies that support the use of coal will result in more greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere and reduce the development of renewable energy.\n- \u00b7 The United States and Canada requested dispute settlement consultations with Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement (T-MEC or USMCA) over Mexico's energy policies that they consider discriminatory and say harm international companies and cross-border supplies.\n\nWe paid special attention to the following aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 Government actions that negatively impact the mining industry.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory changes to mining rights and adverse tax changes.\n- \u00b7 Changes in tax regulations.\n- \u00b7 Increased frequency of reviews by tax authorities with special attention to the mining industry.\n- \u00b7 Inability to obtain necessary water concessions due to government control or private interests.\n- \u00b7 Failures/delays in obtaining necessary environmental permits.\n- \u00b7 Disputes arising from the US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA or TMEC).\n- \u00b7 Since 2020, the so-called Mining Fund, whose main objective was to distribute resources to communities neighbouring the mines, according to the royalties paid by companies under the Federal Law of Rights, has been closed. Since then, although companies continue to pay these royalties, they do not necessarily translate into investments for the communities neighbouring the mines.\n- \u00b7 In addition, the perception of corruption in Mexico remains high. The country's score in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2022 remained relatively unchanged, despite a higher ranking. As a result, delays in obtaining permits for certain operations and/or projects remain a risk.",

Globally, economies almost came to a complete halt for more than five months during 2020 and some months of 2021. During 2022, we saw significant increases in critical inputs and\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\n- \u00b7 The unnerving combination of war, inflation, energy scarcity, and climate change wasn't what anyone expected as life was just beginning to move forward from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n- \u00b7 Inflation has become a major concern for the global economy, two years into the pandemic. Price rises are reaching record highs in Europe and the United States and may be countered by monetary policy. In Latin America, central banks have been acting quickly and forcefully since last year, raising interest rates.\n- \u00b7 The impact of post-pandemic Covid-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war on supply chains has been global, prolonged, and resulted in a series of major shocks to companies' logistical systems.\n- \u00b7 Disruptions in the value chain of critical inputs for our operations such as spare parts (primarily delivered by land transport from the US and maritime transport from China and Europe).\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. In order to maintain our security of supply, contingency plans are in place to address any short-term disruptions to strategic resources. We negotiate early with suppliers of key inputs to ensure continuity.

We expect this to continue through 2023.\n\nThis situation could create an adverse impact on our operations, costs, sales and earnings, and potentially on the economic viability of projects. In macroeconomic terms we have the following results:\n\n- \u00b7 The Mexican peso performed strongly during 2022 and is one of the strongest emerging currencies. On average during 2022 it traded at 20 pesos per US dollar. At the end of the year the dollar exchange rate was 19.5 pesos.\n- \u00b7 General inflation in Mexico was 7.8% in Mexican peso terms for 2022. Company-specific inflation was 8.4% in dollar terms.\n- \u00b7 Economic growth for Mexico during 2022 was 4.3%.\n- \u00b7 Disruptions also include reduced availability of maintenance teams/contractors to resolve issues, as well as travel restrictions leading to officials not being able to travel and inspect projects, resulting in delays.\n- \u00b7 Increased operating costs due to higher prices for critical inputs such as steel, cyanide, copper, diesel, haulage equipment, oxygen and truck tyres.\n- \u00b7 Analysts surveyed by Banco de Mexico estimate that Mexico's GDP growth will decelerate from 3.0% to 0.9% from 2022 to 2023.\n- \u00b7 In terms of inflation, we experienced an increase in two of our main energy inputs compared to the previous year, with diesel (US percentage per litre) increasing by 4.0% and kWh (US percentage per kWh) by 5.9%.\n- 3. We maintain a rigorous, risk-based supplier management framework to ensure that we engage solely with reputable product and service providers and keep in place the necessary controls to ensure the traceability of all supplies (including avoiding any conduct related to modern slavery).\n- 4.  To achieve cost competitiveness, we endeavour to buy the highest possible proportion of our key inputs, such as fuel and tyres, on as variable a price basis as possible and to link costs to underlying commodity indices where this option exists.\n\nFor more detail see Sustainability at the core of our purpose on pages 64-119.",

Through these actions we aim to increase employee retention, as well as the number of women, people with disabilities and employees with international experience in the workplace.\n- 2.  Our employee performance management system is designed to attract and retain key employees by creating suitable reward and remuneration structures and providing personal development opportunities. We have a talent management system to identify and develop internal candidates for key management positions, as well as identify suitable external candidates where appropriate.\n- 3. We aim for continuous improvement, driven by opportunities for training, development and personal growth; in short, we focus on fair recruitment, fair pay and benefits and gender equality. In the trusted staff structure, 19.87% are women as are 28.81% of new joiners, while 21.40% of the female population were promoted during the year.\n- 4. Recruitment: we have evaluated our recruitment requirements for key positions, and our goal is to meet them through internal training and promotion, as well as by recruitment through:\n- - Our close relationships with universities that offer earth science programmes. We have programmes dedicated to identifying potential performance-based candidates who can be hired as trainees and/or employees at graduation. During the year, we hosted 16 students from different Earth Science professions at our mining units to support their training, and 104 engineers took part in our training programme.\n- - CETLAR (Centre for Technical Studies of Pe\u00f1oles), which trains mechanical and electrical technicians. The seven graduates of 2022 were hired as full-time employees.\n\n- 5. Retention: our goal is to be the employer of choice, and we recognise that to be a profitable and sustainable company, we need to generate value for our employees and their families. We do this by providing a healthy, safe, productive and team-oriented work environment that not only encourages our people to reach their potential, but also supports process improvements.\n\nManagement and leadership skills development programmes were conducted during 2022 with 30 superintendents, 129 advisors and 69 facilitators.\n\nIn order to keep our staff updated and trained, 88% of employees and 99% of unionised staff have received training this year. In 2022, 232 employees participated in institutional development programmes, which means that 45% of staff with more than two years of service have participated at least once. Of this 45%, 10.4% are women. 702 courses and studies were conducted through external training, benefiting 520 employees. 77.3% of our leaders have participated in institutional development programmes focused on leadership.\n\n- 6. Performance: the virtual internship programme continued this year in conjunction with Pe\u00f1oles, with courses in mining, geology, metallurgy and topography.

We fully recognise the importance of the confidentiality, continuity, integrity and security of our data and systems.\n\nAs a mining company, we can be under threat of cyber attacks from a broad set of groups, from 'hacktivists' and hostile regimes to organised criminals. Their objectives range from taking advantage of mining's role in regional and global supply chains, to impacting national economies.\n\nSome threat actors also focus on finding unprotected, misconfigured and unpatched systems and exploit them, due to the industry's heavy reliance on technology and automated systems that support operations.\n\nThe following are the top eight cybersecurity and privacy risks that have been identified through environment monitoring and workshops with business units, operations, and IT. These risks comprise Pe\u00f1oles/Fresnillo overall cybersecurity and privacy risk profile:\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\n- \u00b7 Cyber risks have increased significantly in recent years owing in part to the Covid-19 pandemic and the proliferation of new digital technologies, the increasing degree of connectivity and a material increase in the monetisation of cybercrime.\n- \u00b7 Theft of information through social engineering and 'phishing' campaigns (fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information or data, such as usernames or passwords, by appearing to be a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication).\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. Our information security management model is designed with defensive structural controls to prevent and mitigate the effects of computer risks. It employs a set of rules and procedures, including a Disaster Recovery Plan, to restore critical IT functions in the event of an attack.\n- 2.  Our systems are continuously monitored by cybersecurity experts at a Security Operations Centre (SOC). Incident response plans are in place and tested periodically to ensure we can respond quickly and effectively.\n- 3. Our systems are regularly audited to identify any potential threats to the operations and additional systems have been put in place to protect our assets and data.\n- 4.  We have implemented a training and awareness programme, which is designed to increase awareness of cyber risk and ensure that employees take the appropriate actions.\n- 5. We have invested in global IT security platforms and Managed Security Services Providers (MSSPs) in order to proactively monitor and manage our cyber risks.

We also monitor the environment for relevant alerts and act proactively to assess our readiness, reinforcing our capabilities as needed.\n- 9. A governance model, continuous risk monitoring, information security policies, awareness-raising campaigns and training form the basis for our IT/OT operational guarantee.\n- 10.  Our plan for 2023 is to focus our efforts on incorporating key indicators around cyber risk reduction in the cybersecurity dashboard, implementing and maturing controls in line with the threat landscape and emphasising the importance of individual responsibility to each employee, in order for them to stay vigilant and alert to cyber threats.\n- \u00b7 Corruption of data - Critical data where any unauthorised modification can have adverse impacts.\n- \u00b7 Unauthorised access - Cybersecurity and privacy incidents due to incorrect access permissions or system abuse, exploitation or misuse.\n- \u00b7 Breach and data theft - Disclosure of critical and sensitive company data by an internal or external source.\n- \u00b7 Business disruption - Disrupting key applications or systems for a period of time.\n- \u00b7 Lack of cybersecurity ownership - Failure to assign responsibility for implementing and adopting cybersecurity practices on a daily basis.\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance - Cybersecurity and privacy incidents resulting in non-compliance with applicable regulations, including privacy.\n- \u00b7 Health and safety incidents - Breach of availability, integrity or confidentiality of data which impacts health and safety.\n- \u00b7 Halt or loss of operations - Cybersecurity and privacy incidents which result in loss of operating licence or closure of operations.\n- \u00b7 An increased reliance on cloud systems and infrastructure can make IT defences less robust and may bypass security controls.\n- \u00b7 Access to hacking tools and training is readily available and heavily automated. Without proper punishment for perpetrators globally, attackers can easily launch sophisticated attacks with little risk.\n- \u00b7 There is a global lack of regulation regarding cybersecurity and e-crime that could deter criminals.\n- conduct routine third-party penetration tests to independently confirm the security of our IT systems and we seek to enhance the monitoring of our operational technology platforms.\n- 6. Since 2020, a fully staffed cybersecurity office has been in place to improve our cybersecurity position. Its main objective is to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and align them with our business mission and strategy, as well as monitor the supporting processes. Aligned to best practices and standards, its approach is based on two key frameworks:\n- - The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST CSF) Cybersecurity Framework that describes how companies can assess and improve their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks.\n- - Information Control Objectives and Technologies to Others (COBIT), which was created by ISACA, the international professional association for IT management and governance, to provide an implementable set of IT-related controls, processes and facilitators.",

However, this carries certain risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Economic viability: the impact of the cost of capital to develop and maintain the mine; future metals prices; and operating costs throughout the mine's life cycle.\n- \u00b7 Access to land: a significant failure or delay in land acquisition has a very high impact on our projects.\n- \u00b7 Uncertainties associated with the development and operation of new mines and expansion projects: includes fluctuations in the degree of ore and recovery; unforeseen complexities in the mining process; poor quality of the ore; unexpected presence of groundwater or lack of water; lack of community support; and inability or difficulty in obtaining and maintaining the required building and operating permits.\n- \u00b7 Delivery risk: projects can exceed the budget in terms of cost and time; they cannot be built according to the required specifications or there may be a delay during construction; and major mining teams cannot be delivered on time.\n\nOther important risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Failure to effectively manage our development projects could result in delays to the start of production and cost overruns.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\n- \u00b7 Uncontrolled increases in the costs of critical inputs directly affect the progress of projects and affect the planning of each project.\n- \u00b7 In some regions there are no specialised contractors or contractors with the technology to develop the projects.\n- \u00b7 Contractor productivity may be lower than anticipated, causing delays in the programme.\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. Our investment assessment process determines how best to manage available capital using technical, financial and qualitative criteria.\n- -Technical: we evaluate and confirm the resource estimate; conduct metallurgical research of mineral bodies to optimise the recovery of economic elements; calculate and determine the investment required for the overall infrastructure (including roads, energy, water, general services, housing) and the infrastructure required for the mine and plant.\n- -Financial: we analyse the risk in relation to the return on the proposed capital investments; set the expected internal rates of return (IRR) per project as thresholds for approving the allocation of capital based on the current value of expected cash flows of invested capital; and perform stochastic and probabilistic analyses.\n\n- \u00b7 Projects that cannot be delivered on time, on budget and according to planned specifications.\n- \u00b7 Geotechnical conditions of the ore body/poor rock quality.\n- \u00b7 High costs making it difficult to justify the project.\n- \u00b7 Delay in the development of the project due to lack or delay of critical equipment, supplies and spare parts.\n- \u00b7 Disruptions in the supply chain for construction materials and equipment.\n\nThe following risks relate specifically to prospective projects in Chile and Peru:\n\n- \u00b7 Government instability, especially in Peru.\n- \u00b7 Potential actions by the government (political, legal and regulatory).\n- \u00b7 Security.\n- \u00b7 Licence to operate (community relations)\n- \u00b7 Access to water (national regulation and geographic complications).\n- \u00b7 Environmental compliance.\n- \u00b7 Competition for land (threat from green power generation companies, for example thermosolar).\n- \u00b7 Informal mining.\n- \u00b7 Industrial safety compliance (National Geological and Mining Service SERNAGEOMIN).\n- \u00b7 Increased mining taxes and fees.\n- \u00b7 Increase in the number of high impact crimes (homicide, kidnapping, extortion) in the regions of the projects.\n- \u00b7 We have identified the following threats to project development:\n- - Insufficient resources for project execution.\n- - Changes in operational priorities that can affect projects.\n- -Qualitative: we consider the alignment of investment with our Strategic Plan and business model; identify synergies with other investments and operating assets; and consider the implications for safety and the environment, the safety of facilities, people, resources and community relations.\n- 2.  The management of our projects is based on the PMBOK standard of the Institute of Project Management (PMI). It allows us to closely monitor project controls to ensure the delivery of approved projects on time, within budget and in accordance with defined specifications.\n- 3. The executive management team and the Board of Directors are regularly updated on progress.

However, this could be mitigated by carefully negotiating concessions with mining geological interest already granted.\n- \u00b7 It is becoming increasingly difficult to negotiate land prices, with landowners demanding more money and benefits for access to land.\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. Successful access to land plays a key role in managing our mining rights, focusing on areas of strategic interest or value.\n- 2.  At the end of 2022, we had 270,268 hectares in the process of being granted and 1,415,960 hectares of mining concessions granted. In total, we had 1,686,228 hectares in the control of Fresnillo plc. This represents an increase of 8,307 hectares compared to 2021.\n- 3. Other initiatives include:\n- - Meticulous analysis of exploration objectives and construction project designs to minimise land requirements.\n- - Judicious use of lease or occupation contracts with purchase options, in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n- - Early participation of our community relations teams during the negotiation and acquisition of socially challenging objectives.\n- - Strategic use of our social investment projects to build trust.\n\n## Key risk indicators\n\n- \u00b7 Percentage of land required for advanced exploration projects that are under occupation or agreements other than total ownership (generally and per project).\n- \u00b7 Total US dollars and percentage of project budget spent on HSECR activities, including community relations (on exploration projects and sites).\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nMedium\n\n## Behaviour\n\nDecreasing\n\n## Risk rating (relative position)\n\n2022: Medium (8) 2021: High (4)\n\n- \u00b7 Conflicts regarding land boundaries, and the subsequent resolution process.\n- \u00b7 Succession problems among landowners resulting in a lack of clarity about the legal right to own and sell land.\n- \u00b7 Risk of litigation, such as increased activism by agrarian communities and/or judicial authorities.\n- \u00b7 Presence of indigenous communities in proximity to lands of interest, where prior and informed consultation and consent of such communities are required.\n- \u00b7 Operations in 'Soledad & Dipolos' remain suspended, as the problem with the ejido 'El Baj\u00edo' remains unresolved.\n- \u00b7 Social insecurity prevailing in the regions where our mining interests are located may not allow the necessary work to be carried out to demonstrate the minimum investments required by law, leading to the possible cancellation of the concession.\n- - Close collaboration with our land negotiation teams, which include specialists hired directly by Fresnillo and also provided by Pe\u00f1oles as part of the service agreement.\n- 4.  As part of an ongoing review of the legal status of our land rights, we identify certain areas of opportunity and continue to implement measures to manage this risk on a case-bycase basis. Such measures include, wherever possible, negotiations with agricultural communities for the direct purchase of land.\n- 5. We use mechanisms provided for in agricultural law and also use other legal mechanisms under mining legislation that provide greater protection for land occupation. These activities are part of our ongoing drive to reduce risk exposure to surface land.",

These expectations go beyond the responsible management of negative impacts to include continuous engagement and contribution to stakeholder development.\n\nFailure to adequately address these expectations increases the risk of opposition to mining projects and operations. Negative sentiment towards mining or specifically towards Fresnillo plc could have an impact on our reputation and acceptability in the regions where we have a presence.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\n- \u00b7 Higher expectations and scrutiny of social and environmental performance.\n- \u00b7 Rising expectations on shared benefits regarding land agreements.\n- \u00b7 Perceived competition on access to natural resources, notably water.\n- \u00b7 Significant reduction in government spending on community infrastructure, development programmes and services.\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\nEfficient risk management allows us to detect threats such as social opportunities, associated with our operation. This process helps us identify, assess, plan for, communicate and manage significant risks that could potentially impact our social license.\n\nThe risk identification mechanism includes social studies, complaints and claims process, deployment of social programmes, as well as meetings with key stakeholders and media monitoring.\n\nFor this, we implement a process of evaluation of detected risks, which we work on through specialised workshops, risk management and action plans for each one, and through committees that prevent their materialisation.\n\nThe social risks that are classified as High Risk are escalated for administration by RED teams, which identify the areas and personnel that have the decision-making level to offer concrete and timely solutions.\n\nLikewise, constant and direct contact is maintained with the leaders of each business unit, including discussion of the risks that they are able to help mitigate.\n\nGovernance of our complaints process improves every year. Complaints are received, evaluated and managed, involving those directly responsible, while keeping complainants informed about the status of each case, until satisfactory closure is achieved.\n\nWe have implemented an internet-based process to capture concerns from the community, including the facility for cases to remain anonymous, thus encouraging and facilitating people to raise concerns, and to do so without fear of recrimination.\n\nWe monitor the following risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Negative perception of the Company's social and environmental performance.\n- \u00b7 Failure to identify and address legitimate concerns and expectations of the community and of society at large.\n- \u00b7 Insufficient or ineffective engagement and communication.\n- \u00b7 Failure to contribute purposefully to community development.\n- \u00b7 Anti-mining activism fuelling opposition to mining.\n- \u00b7 Insecurity and access to water are the issues of greatest concern to people and community leaders in the regions where we have a presence.\n- \u00b7 The environmental impact of a mine is also an issue that can concern communities close to our operations.\n- 1. Covid-19 Response: collaboration with Health Authorities to support the logistics of vaccination centres in the regions where we operate. Campaigns to raise awareness of preventive measures such as the use of masks. Rapid testing support for remote communities. Collaboration with parents and school authorities on the safe return to classes.\n- 2.  Community engagement: our strategy, which embraces all phases of the mining lifecycle, is based on purposeful engagement to address concerns and expectations. Key activities include:\n- - Organising formal and informal meetings to enable stakeholder identification and engagement planning.\n- - Carrying out social baseline studies that include human rights and due diligence regarding indigenous peoples, and perception studies that support our Social Management plans and help us manage impacts, risks and opportunities.\n- - Operating a grievance mechanism to address stakeholder concerns.\n- - Monitoring public opinion within local and international media.\n- - Collaborating with peers to adopt best practices in social performance.\n- - Communicating our best practices regarding social and environmental responsibility.\n- 3. Environmental performance: optimising our use of resources, curbing any negative impact of our activities and being transparent and accountable regarding our environmental footprint are crucial elements of sustainable mining and help us to be positively perceived by communities and regulators.\n\n## Key risk indicators\n\n- \u00b7 Number of local actions by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or other local social groups against mining, by region.\n- \u00b7 Number of actions by NGOs or other local social groups against mining in the Americas.\n- \u00b7 Number of media mentions related to demonstrations against the mining industry.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nLow\n\n## Behaviour\n\nDecreasing\n\n## Risk rating (relative position)\n\n2022: Medium (9)\n\n2021: High (5)\n\n- 4.  Health and Safety performance: our goal is to instil a safety culture focused on 'caring for our people', based on shared values across the organisation, driven by senior management and focused on high potential incidents. Our approach to health aims to pre-emptively identify and manage the risks to which our workforce is exposed.\n- 5. Sharing the benefits of mining: in addition to effective stakeholder engagement, sharing the benefits of mining also plays an important role in supporting our social acceptability. Employment, procurement, talent development and the payment of our fair share of taxes contribute to regional development. Our Social Investment portfolio focuses on Education, Water, Health & Sports and Capacity Building to support our communities, in collaboration with non-governmental organisations (NGOs). For our education focus, we work with ENSAMBLE ALEJAND\u00cdA, INNOVEC and First Robotics; for Water, with Captar AC Y FORMAC; and for Health with the National University Foundation y FutbolMas; para Desarrollo de Capacidades, con Proempleo y CEDO.\n- 6.

This has led to a complex, rarefied work environment at the Fresnillo mine, with violent clashes between the union and a group of workers seeking to register a new independent union.\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. We maintain good relations with our employees and unions, founded on trust, regular dialogue and good working conditions. We are committed to safety, nondiscrimination, diversity and inclusion, and compliance with Mexico's strict labour regulations.\n- 2.  There are long-term labour agreements (usually three years) in place with all the unions at our operations, helping to ensure labour stability.\n- 3. We seek to identify and address labour issues that may arise throughout the period covered by the labour agreements and to anticipate any potential issues in good time. Employees of our contractor companies are an important part of our workforce and under Mexican law fulfil the same duties and are subject to the same responsibilities as our own employees. We treat contractors as strategic associates and build long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with them.\n- 4.  We maintain constructive relationships with our employees and their unions through regular communication and consultation. Union representatives are regularly involved in discussions about the future of the workforce.\n- 5.

        "page_content": "## 2022 Long-term viability statement\n\nBased on their assessment of prospects and viability, the Directors confirm that they have the expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next five years. Our focus is on the Group's existing business and the ability of the current portfolio to generate sufficient cash to meet the Group's outgoings, including the dividend.\n\nIn accordance with provision 31 section 4 of the UK Corporate Governance Code and taking into account the Group's current position and its principal risks for a period longer than the 12 months required by the going concern statement, management prepared a viability analysis which was assessed by the Board for approval.\n\nMining is a long-term business and timescales can run into decades. The Group maintains life-ofmine plans covering the full remaining mine life for each mining operation.\n\nAs discussed above, we closely monitor and assess the impact of key principal and emerging risks on our long-term prospects and, where possible, proactively build response plans into our investment decisions.\n\nOur long-term planning reflects our business model of running our business in ways that are safer, smarter and more sustainable. To ensure we remain resilient in the long term, our business model is continuously stress tested against the key uncertainties within the emerging risks, with recommended actions to mitigate potential downside.\n\nThe Directors reviewed the viability period and confirmed the suitability of a five-year period to December 2027. This period aligns with the mining industry's typical planning cycle and with the Company's five-year forecast period normally used to evaluate liquidity and contingency plans. It allows us to model capital expenditure and development programmes planned during the timeframe and reflects cash flows generated by the projects currently under development. Due to the long business cycles in our industry, the Directors considered that a shorter time period would be insufficient.\n\nReporting on the Company's viability requires the Directors to consider those principal risks that could impair the solvency and liquidity of the Company. In order to determine those risks, the Directors robustly assessed the Group-wide principal risks and operation-specific risks by undertaking consultations with executive management, mine managers and other personnel across our operations. These consultations also enabled the Directors to identify low probability, high loss scenarios - 'singular events' - with the potential magnitude to severely impact the solvency and/or liquidity of Fresnillo.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing the Group's viability, the Directors identified that of our principal risks, the following are the most important:\n\n- \u00b7 'Potential actions by the government', which could include a delay in obtaining permits and/ or new regulations leading to restrictions on the granting of new mining concessions.\n- \u00b7 'Security', especially the theft of explosives in the most insecure region.\n- \u00b7 'Global macroeconomic developments', specifically inflation of costs of critical inputs to the operation.\n- \u00b7 'Impact of metals prices', notably volatility in the prices of gold and silver over a period of time.\n- \u00b7 'Access to land', especially due to disputes with the owners of the land where we have operations.\n- \u00b7 'Safety', particularly in scenarios that consider fatalities.\n- \u00b7 'Tailing and environmental incidents', especially the failure or rupture of a tailings dam.\n\nThis year, we also considered the effects of climate change on the viability scenarios, particularly the impact of heavy rains and incorporated climate-related factors in Scenarios 2, 3, 4 and 7. Nevertheless, our conclusion was that the most important scenarios are not at this stage materially impacted.\n\nHaving determined that none of the individual risks would in isolation compromise the Group's viability, the Directors went on to group principal risks into the following severe but plausible scenarios, in each case determining the risk proximity (how soon the risk could occur) and velocity (the speed with which the impact of a risk could be felt):\n\nScenario 1: Impact of metals prices and global macroeconomic developments. Our model assumes that prices for gold and silver in 2023 fall to US$1,492 per ounce and US$16.9 per ounce respectively. We further assume that precious metals prices remain at a low level for the following four years of the viability period, varying between US$1,942-1,676 per gold ounce and US$23.4-21.9 per silver ounce.\n\n## Scenario 2: Bench collapse at an open pit mine.\n\nA landslide occurs covering the lower pit of one of our mines. Due to the unexpected nature of the event, fatalities occur. Production is gradually ramped back up and re-established to full capacity. (Singular event)\n\n## Scenario 3: Tailings deposit breach at a mine. A\n\ntailings deposit collapses and tailings are released into the surrounding area, causing environmental damage. A fund is created by the Company to be used to remediate and compensate for any damage caused. The investigation into the causes of the event is drawn out and further time is required before all environmental permits are reinstated. As a result, the mine remains closed throughout the viability assessment period. (Principal risk)\n\nScenario 4: Flooding at a mine. An unforeseen fault containing water is cut into, leading to water entering the mine in excess of pumping capacity, thereby halting production of one of the mine's main areas. The ramp-up to pre-event production levels commences once management determines that it is safe to do so. (Singular event)\n\n## Scenario 5: Action by the Government at a mine.\n\nExplosives are stolen on site causing the authorities to suspend the mine's explosives permit. Production is halted while an investigation into the matter is completed. Once permits have been restored, production ramps back up to pre-event levels. (Principal risk)\n\n## Conflicts\n\nScenario 6: Access to land at a mine. with local communities arise and result in the Company having to cease operations until negotiations can be finalised and the land can be re-occupied. (Principal risk)\n\nScenario 7: Total power failure at a mine. There is an unexpected power outage at a mine caused by a severe winter storm, which freezes gas and diesel pipelines and supply facilities. (Singular event)\n\nTo create an impartial projection for a future low metals prices environment, the Directors used an average of the three lowest forecasts for each year of the assessment, based on consensus estimates published by institutional financial analysts. This environment was deemed to be the most significant risk, and pervasive across the Company. (Principal risk)",

However, multiple control measures are in place to prevent and mitigate any such occurrences. Should any of these scenarios take place, various options are available to the Company in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to continue in operation, including the deferral of capital and/or exploration expenditure. When quantifying the expected financial impact and remediation time required for each of these risks, management performed benchmarking against the Group's own experience and against publicly available information on relevant, comparable incidents in the mining industry.\n\nAll scenarios were first evaluated using metals prices based on average analyst consensus. As no mitigations were necessary, it was decided that there was no threat to the viability of the Company. To create a more stringent test and further challenge the resilience of the Group, all scenarios were then overlaid with scenario one, (low metals prices) and then re-evaluated.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out above in the Strategic Review on pages 2-157.

In addition, note 31 to the financial statements includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\nIn making their assessment of the Group's ability to manage its future cash requirements, the Directors have considered the Company and Group budgets and the cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2024 (being the going concern assessment period). The Directors have also considered the cash position as of 31 December 2022 (US$969.1 million) and the restructuring of debt during the period, as described in the financial review. In addition, they reviewed a more conservative cash flow scenario with reduced silver and gold\n\nWhen these scenarios were re-modelled, none led to an extremely low or negative cash balance because the strong cash and other liquid funds balance at the end of 2022 US$969.1 million positions Fresnillo plc in a healthy financial situation. In addition, metals prices contribute to the preservation of a positive cash balance position through the scenarios assessed. The lowest cash balance level was identified in scenario number two, in combination with the low metals prices scenario. However, with mitigation actions this scenario would maintain a positive cash balance throughout the viability period, with a minimum level of US$115 million during the third year (2025).\n\nRisk management and internal control systems are in place throughout the Group. The internal control systems enable the Directors to monitor key variables that have the ability to impact the liquidity and solvency of the Group.

This resulted in our current cash and cash equivalents balances reducing over time but maintaining sufficient liquidity throughout the period.\n\nThe Directors have further calculated prices (US$18.5 and US$1,574 for silver and gold respectively), which should they prevail to the end of 2024 would result in cash balances decreasing to minimal levels by the end of 2024, without applying mitigations.\n\nShould metals prices remain below the stressed prices above for an extended period, management have identified specific elements of capital and exploration expenditures which could be deferred without adversely affecting production profiles throughout the period. Finally management could amend the mining plans to concentrate on production with a higher margin in order to accelerate cash generation without affecting the integrity of the mine plans.\n\nOur risk mitigation and control measures include a Crisis Committee, while the Board would also be briefed and convened as necessary, in order to respond to events as they develop. At each level of our organisation, we have appointed dedicated personnel responsible for media management and engaging with authorities and other stakeholders, depending on the magnitude of the crisis.\n\nBased on the results of this robust analysis and having considered the established controls for the risks and the available mitigating actions, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five-year period of their detailed assessment. This longer-term assessment process supports the Directors' statements on both viability, as set out above, and going concern.\n\nPreviously, the Directors reviewed scenarios that incorporated an estimated potential impact of government-imposed stoppages due to Covid-19 restrictions. The Directors reassessed the situation in the current year, considering in particular the facts that mining was declared an essential activity by the Federal Government and there have been no further stoppages at any of our mines. Furthermore, as previously reported, we have implemented additional health and safety measures at each of our mines coupled with extensive targeted and random testing. The Directors concluded that the risk of government-imposed stoppages was low and therefore disclosure of a specific Covid scenario is no longer relevant.\n\nAfter reviewing all of the above considerations, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that management have sufficient flexibility in adverse circumstances to maintain adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.",

Taking a holistic and stakeholder-oriented approach to decision making, particularly when it comes to principal decisions that have significant long-term implications and consequences, allows us to build trust and foster a sense of shared purpose, make better decisions that benefit all parties involved and contribute to the overall health and wellbeing of our organisation. We believe that by purposefully engaging our stakeholders, we are able to balance their interests, needs and concerns, thereby promoting the continuity, profitability and sustainability of our Company.\n\nOur Section 172 Statement identifies our stakeholders, explains how we consider them in our principal decision-making processes, and reports on how these are connected to our business model and overall strategy. Rapidly evolving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are the subject of increasing interest from society and investors, as well as the focus of international regulatory trends, and this is therefore an important area of focus and prioritisation for the Board of Directors.\n\nOur materiality assessment (page 65) identifies the ESG factors that are significant to our stakeholders and material to our operations. Our 'Building Trust - relationship with key stakeholders' section (pages 120-125) introduces our stakeholders, why they are important and the engagement strategies we deploy to build and maintain strong relationships. Our 'Managing our Risks and Opportunities' section (pages 127-152) evaluates the risks associated with these relationships and the strategies we use to mitigate them.\n\n## Our stakeholders\n\nWe have identified our relevant stakeholders by considering their influence on the success of our business model and strategy, including:\n\n- \u00b7 how they are relevant to our business model and strategy;\n- \u00b7 their interests, needs and concerns;\n- \u00b7 how engagement is being conducted;\n- \u00b7 how management and governance activities are implemented;\n- \u00b7 the actions and outcomes from engagement;\n- \u00b7 the metrics used to monitor relationships; and\n- \u00b7 what risks could affect our relationships with them.\n\n## Our principal decisions\n\nWe consider 'principal decisions' to be those decisions linked with our strategy, or resulting from major regulatory changes, that have significant implications for our stakeholders and the Company's future. We have developed a pro forma template identifying the relevant stakeholder considerations for inclusion in the papers which accompany Board discussions whenever principal decisions are considered.\n\nDuring 2022, several of the Board's principal decisions with relevant implications for our stakeholders and the Company's future are evident in the approval of the Company's Business Plan and Budget.\n\nWe provide the following information on our principal decisions:\n\n- \u00b7 Context of the decisions.\n- \u00b7 Decision-making process.\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder considerations.\n- \u00b7 Impact on communities and the environment.\n- \u00b7 Strategic actions supported by the Board.\n- \u00b7 Impact of these actions in the long term.\n- \u00b7 Outcomes of the decisions.\n\nThe Company, its Board of Directors and management are fully committed to effectively engaging with all key stakeholders. Further information about the Board's approach to engagement with stakeholders is also set out in the 'Board Leadership and Purpose' section of the Governance Report on pages 170-172.\n\nApproved by the Board of Directors on 6 March 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Dear shareholder\n\nAs Chairman of Fresnillo plc, I am well aware of the expectations placed upon my colleagues on the Board and me to maintain high standards of corporate governance as a responsible premium-listed Company on the London Stock Exchange. We recognise the importance of good corporate governance both for our Company and for the shareholders who invest in us. I am, therefore, pleased to introduce this Governance section of our Annual Report and take the opportunity to highlight some of the areas of progress during the year.\n\nMy position as Chairman of the Company's majority shareholder should also be regarded as a sign of strong governance due to the full alignment of the majority shareholder's interests with other shareholders, considering that all related parties' transactions are approved by only our independent Directors.\n\nOngoing Covid-19 restrictions have made travel difficult for many Board members during the year and we have continued to hold all of our meetings virtually. We hope and anticipate that the situation will change in 2023. By contrast, after two years of restrictions on shareholder meetings, it was a pleasure to be able to hold our Annual General Meeting (AGM) in person in London in May. The Board is recommending the re-appointment of Charlie Jacobs and B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera as independent Non-executive Directors at the 2023 AGM, despite the fact that they will have been on the Board for more than nine years at the time of the 2023 AGM. The Nominations Committee has considered this issue in depth and feels that they both continue to demonstrate independence, and that the general restriction on travel has not enabled the Committee to fully consider an appropriate succession plan in time to bring forward replacements for the shareholders to consider at the 2023 meeting. The Committee will focus on this task during 2023, identifying suitable nominees and proposing them by the 2024 AGM.\n\nAt our AGM in 2022, we asked shareholders to renew our Directors' Remuneration Policy for another three years and were pleased that over 97% of the shares that voted at the AGM did so in favour of the revised Policy. The Remuneration Committee is recommending some minor changes to the Policy at the 2023 AGM, which: (i) will allow the Board to increase Non-executive Directors' fees in line with a benchmark range of fees for similar companies, without recourse to shareholders; and (ii) will give the Remuneration Committee discretion to apply upward adjustments to the annual bonus in the case of outstanding personal performance which results in a significant benefit to the Company during the relevant year. Further details of these changes are on page 206 and I hope that shareholders feel able to support them.\n\nIn our 2021 Annual Report, we set out details of the Company's responses to climate change through our Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting. The Board, along with the Audit and HSECR Committees, has continued to develop its arrangements for the oversight of climate-related risks and mitigation programmes. Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) themes have been a prominent aspect of our Board meetings during the year. In April, the Board reviewed the Group's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) strategy and, in July, the Board reviewed in detail several aspects of the Company's sustainability strategy. We see these as important elements of our licence to operate and consider it is appropriate that they are properly considered by the Board.\n\nIn July, we introduced a new meeting into our Board calendar to provide Directors with a chance to discuss risk and long-term strategy more extensively with our Executive Team. This meeting took the form of a working meeting and was instigated in response to suggestions made during our last Board effectiveness review. At this meeting, the Company's risk framework was discussed as well as how risks are identified, managed, and controlled. In addition, key controls put in place to mitigate risks previously identified were discussed. Lastly, the planned developments in UK regulatory matters relating to corporate governance and FRC Guidance on audit were also considered.\n\nIn September and October, we undertook our annual Board effectiveness review which was again run by Lintstock using questionnaires. The findings of the Board evaluation were reviewed by the Board at its meeting in October 2022. The key outcome of our annual Board effectiveness review was that the Board and committees continue to perform very well in absolute and relative terms compared to a sample of UK companies. As ever there are some aspects of the Board's processes that we are thinking further about, and details of the steps being taken as a result of this exercise are shown on pages 176 and 177.\n\nI would like to conclude this letter by thanking my Board colleagues for their continued support and valuable contributions to the work of the Board and its committees during 2022. We continue to face many challenges, but I believe that we have the right governance structures in place at Fresnillo to be able to assess and respond to those challenges effectively.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nMr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res Chairman of the Board\n\n6 March 2023\n\nThe key outcome of our annual Board effectiveness review was that the Board and committees continue to perform very well.'",

        "page_content": "## Fresnillo's approach to Governance\n\n## The Board's leadership role\n\nWhile Fresnillo's approach to governance reflects many of the usual characteristics of a FTSE 100 company, it is also influenced by four key factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Geography: It predominantly operates within Mexico.\n- \u00b7 Ownership: It benefits from the common umbrella and shared resources with other companies within the BAL Group of companies.\n- \u00b7 Board: Its fully Non-executive Board of Directors is supported by the Executive Team.\n- \u00b7 Investors: Its listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.\n\n## The leadership role of the Fresnillo plc Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a result of these contextual factors, the leadership provided to Fresnillo plc by the Board is essentially strategic and supervisory in nature.\n\nThe leadership and management of the Company's day-to-day operations is the responsibility of the Executive Committee (comprising the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Exploration and the Chief Operating Officer). The Non-independent Non-executive members of the Board (Pe\u00f1oles-appointed Directors) maintain regular contact with the Executive Committee to challenge and/or support as appropriate.\n\nThis structure creates two levels of oversight for the Senior Management Team, initially from the non-independent Non-executive Directors, and then from the Board as a whole, including the independent Non-executive Directors. Reports summarising the discussions which take place between the Non-independent Non-executive Directors and the senior management team are regularly provided to the independent Non-executive Directors to assist them in understanding the dialogue which takes place before formal Board proposals are submitted for their review.\n\nThe Board sets the corporate values underpinning the culture by which the Group will continue to operate. The Board also supervises the management of the Group's activities, including the implementation of both the Group's long-term plans and commercial strategy. It also provides the governance framework within which the Executive Committee operates. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval which includes major expenditure, investments, key policies and systems of internal control and risk management. Certain specific responsibilities are delegated to the Board committees, being the Audit, Nominations, Health Safety Environment and Community Relations (HSECR and Remuneration Committees, each chaired by a Board member, and each of which operate within clearly defined terms of reference and report regularly to the Board.",

The Board was updated on these measures by the Chief Executive Officer at the Board meetings held during this year, as well as by updates from members of the Executive Committee at Audit Committee and HSECR Committee meetings. The Board's usual programme of formal meetings remained unchanged during 2022 but all meetings were conducted via video conference.\n\n## New developments in the Board's approach to governance in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate change and TCFD\n\nThe HSECR Committee evaluates climate related performance, risks and opportunities.\n\nThe Audit Committee considers the requirements of the TCFD and the Company's related disclosures.\n\nResponsibility relating to the energy efficiency of the Company's operations, objectives for future performance and target setting.\n\nQuarterly reports are provided by the CEO, COO and Head of Sustainability to the HSECR Committee.\n\n## Risk management process\n\nThe Board oversees our principal risks and associated management responses.\n\nThe Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls.\n\nThe Board, the Audit Committee and the Executive Committee use working sessions to review the evolution of principal and emerging risks, as well as the appetite for each risk.\n\n## Identifies strategic risks.\n\nAssesses level of risk related to achieving strategic objectives.\n\nOversees execution and implementation of controls into strategic and operating plans.\n\nFurther information about the Company's risk management process can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 127 to 152.\n\nDuring the year the Board focused on the following matters:\n\n| Health, safety and  wellbeing   | \u00b7 \u00b7   | Safety performance and 'I Care, We Care' programme updates.

B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera was appointed to the Committee on 14 May 2014; Alejandro Baill\u00e8res and Charles Jacobs were appointed to the Committee on 29 April 2021. During the year, B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera and Charles Jacobs were both independent Non-executive Directors and therefore the majority of the members of the Nominations Committee were independent in compliance with the requirements of the Code.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information about the work of the Nominations Committee during 2022 can be found in the Nominations Committee report on pages 178 and 179.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe membership of the Committee is made up of Non-executive Directors who are able to bring the following perspectives to the working of the Remuneration Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 An understanding of shareholder expectations; and\n- \u00b7 An understanding of the general approaches to remuneration within the Mexican market.\n\nThe Code states that the Remuneration Committee should be made up of independent Non-executive Directors. The members of the Remuneration Committee are Alberto Tiburcio, Alejandro Baill\u00e8res and Guadalupe de la Vega. Guadalupe de la Vega was appointed as a member of the Committee on 1 March 2021 and Alberto Tiburcio and Alejandro Baill\u00e8res were appointed as members of the Committee on 29 April 2021. Alejandro Baill\u00e8res was Non-independent at the time of his appointment to the Board (and therefore the membership makeup of the Remuneration Committee during the year does not comply with Provision 32 of the Code). At the time of the appointment of Alejandro Baill\u00e8res to the Remuneration Committee in April 2021, the Board determined that his experience and knowledge of both the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committee's deliberations, justifies his membership of the Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information about the work of the Remuneration Committee during 2022\n\ncan be found in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 193 to 210.\n\n## HSECR Committee\n\nThe members of the HSECR Committee are Arturo Fernandez, Judith Macgregor, Georgina Kessel and Fernando Ruiz.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA full report of the work of the HSECR Committee during 2022, can be found in the\n\nHSECR Committee report on pages 62 and 63.\n\n## Terms of reference\n\nThe terms of reference of all of the Board Committees were reviewed during the year. The terms of reference of the Nominations and Remuneration Committees were last updated in early 2020 (to take account of the requirements of the new Code). The terms of reference of the HSECR Committee were last updated in October 2020. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee were updated in early 2023 (to consider the Company's obligations under the Task-Force for TCFD on greenhouse gas reporting and other related topics). No further changes were made to any of the Committee terms of reference during the previous 12 months.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCopies of all of the Committee terms of reference are available on the Company's website (http://www.fresnilloplc.com/who-we-are/corporate-governance/terms-of-reference/).",

The following statement is therefore made in respect of the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 December 2022 other than as set out below, the Company has complied with the provisions of the Code, save in respect of:\n\n- \u00b7 Code Provision 9 provides that 'the chair should be independent on appointment'. Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res, who was appointed as Chairman on 29 April 2021, was appointed to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement (see page 172); thus, at the time of his appointment, he was not independent. Having served as Deputy Chairman for more than three years and having received guidance from Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res, the previous Chairman, for many years, the Board considers that Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res possesses significant knowledge and experience of the Company to carry out the role of the Chairman. The Board considers that the continued oversight of the Company's strategic and operational integrity through its membership of the Pe\u00f1oles Group enhances the quality of its corporate governance rather than detracts from it (as explained further on pages 170 to 172. As a consequence, the Board values and endorses Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res' chairmanship of the Company. The size, composition and balance of skills on the Board, including the independence and diversity of the Board and the existence of a Senior Independent Director; and the adequacy of the succession plans were assessed as part of the Board effectiveness review during the year and were considered to be highly satisfactory.\n- \u00b7 Code Provision 32 , which provides that the Board should establish a Remuneration Committee of at least three independent Non-executive Directors. The Chairman of the Company, Alejandro Baill\u00e8res, who was not independent at the time of his appointment, is a member of the Remuneration Committee. The Board believes that Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res' experience and knowledge of both the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committee's deliberations, justifies his membership of the Remuneration Committee. Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res is not involved in matters concerning his own remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Code Provision 36 , which provides that remuneration schemes should promote long-term holdings by Executive Directors that support alignment with long-term shareholder interests. The Company's approach to executive remuneration is explained in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 193 to 210. The Company does not use share-based forms of remuneration because historically it has not been a common form of remuneration in Mexico. The annual bonus scheme sets targets which are aligned to the long-term strategic objectives so that these priorities are embedded within the day-to-day activities of the Company's business.\n\nInformation about compliance with the Code's Provisions may be found in the following sections of this Report:\n\n## #1 Board leadership\n\nand purpose:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPages 170 to 172\n\nPages 173 and 174\n\nPages 175 to 179\n\nPages 193 to 210\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Composition, succession and evaluation:\n\nincluding the Nominations Committee Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#2\n\nDivision of responsibilities:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe following sections of this report also explain how the principles of the Code were applied and provide cross-references to other sections of the report and/or the Company's website (www.fresnilloplc.com) where more detailed descriptions are available.\n\nThe following documents are available on the Company's website:\n\n- \u00b7 Schedule of Matters reserved for the Board.\n- \u00b7 Statement of Responsibilities of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Senior Independent Director.\n- \u00b7 Terms of Reference: Audit Committee, HSECR Committee, Nominations Committee and Remuneration Committee.\n- \u00b7 Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#5\n\n## Remuneration:\n\nthe Directors' Remuneration Report",

        "page_content": "## Board leadership and purpose\n\n## Reporting on the application of the principle: Board leadership and purpose\n\n## Principle A:\n\nA successful company is led by an effective and entrepreneurial board, whose role is to promote the long-term sustainable success of the company, generating value for shareholders and contributing to wider society.\n\nThe biographies of the Board members, detailed on pages 164 to 167, outline the wide range of experience available to the Company. The Board members continue to ensure that the business model and strategy, described on pages 20 to 21 and agreed by the Board, is delivered for the benefit of the Company's stakeholders. The S172 Statement on page 155 examines how those different categories of stakeholders are considered.\n\n## Principle B:\n\nThe board should establish the company's purpose, values and strategy, and satisfy itself that these and its culture are aligned. All directors must act with integrity, lead by example and promote the desired culture.\n\nThe Board has considered the Group's business model and strategy as outlined on pages 20 and 21; an explanation of the code of conduct which prescribes the Directors' role is given on page 170.\n\n## Principle C:\n\nThe board should ensure that the necessary resources are in place for the company to meet its objectives and measure performance against them. The board should also establish a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enable risk to be assessed and managed.\n\nApplication of principle C, to identify the resources needed to operate the business successfully, is delegated to the executive management whose experience is described on page 168, although the Board monitors this against key performance indicators. Page 190 details the internal control structure in place and pages 127 to 129 describe in detail the risk management structure. During the year the Board held a working meeting with executive management to satisfy itself over the robustness of the Group risk management processes.\n\n## Generation and preservation of company value\n\nFresnillo's Business Model and Strategy is set out on pages 20 and 21 of the Strategic Report and describes the basis upon which the Company generates and preserves value over the long term.\n\nThe Executive Committee members report on the implementation of strategy at each Board meeting, with particular reference to performance against the published strategic targets.\n\n## Purpose\n\nOur Purpose is to contribute to the wellbeing of people, through the sustainable mining of silver and gold. The Purpose statement was approved by the Board in October 2019. During 2022, the Company has continued to contribute to the wellbeing of people including employees, local communities, customers and the end-users of our products by maintaining levels of production and investing in local health care, employment and education programmes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on Company's Purpose is set out on pages 17 to 19.\n\n## The Board and culture\n\nThe Corporate Code of Conduct was last reviewed and approved by the Board in October 2022. The Code of Conduct sets down its cultural expectations for the activities of all Directors, executives, employees and related third parties (including contractors, suppliers and the community) in the conduct of the Company's business. It also helps to ensure a foundation of values and sets standards for behaviour that encourage an environment of ethics and responsibility for the benefit of the Company's stakeholders.\n\n## Principle D:\n\nIn order for the company to meet its responsibilities to shareholders and stakeholders, the board should ensure effective engagement with, and encourage participation from, these parties.\n\nEngagement of stakeholders in accordance with Section 172 of the Companies Act is detailed on page 157, further details with regard to engagement with the community is outlined on pages 110 to 112 and 122, and with shareholders on page 125.\n\n#1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principle E:\n\nThe board should ensure that workforce policies and practices are consistent with the company's values and support its long-term sustainable success. The workforce should be able to raise any matters of concern.\n\nThe Board has appointed a Non-executive Director to be responsible for employee engagement, and the processes involved in that role are detailed on page 126. The procedure to ensure that employees, and other stakeholders, can raise immediate concerns via the Company's whistleblowing procedures is explained on page 70.\n\nDuring the year, the Board monitored workforce culture and behaviour in a number of ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Regular reviews of whistleblowing reports and actions taken by management in response to issues raised via that medium (see page 70 for a further summary of whistleblower hotline calls during the year).\n- \u00b7 Receiving an update on the Prevention of Harassment programme, in particular the workshops that were held during the year for employees and unionised personnel.\n- \u00b7 By monitoring progress with the diversity, equity and inclusion programme and the development of an online training module on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, with the support of the University of Arizona.\n- \u00b7 Updates on the 'I Care, We Care' safety strategy (including elements designed to change behaviours and create a more mature and resilient safety culture). The Board receives and considers updates on health and safety performance at every Board meeting, in particular information analysing serious injuries and fatalities, Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate, Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate and new cases of occupational disease. These metrics have been used to monitor the progress made in improving the health and safety culture.\n- \u00b7 By monitoring updates on the outsourcing reform and progress on the actions that the Company has implemented as a consequence of this reform and assessing the likely impacts on corporate culture which may result from these changes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on culture and workforce engagement is set out on pages 126 and 171.",

        "page_content": "## Whistleblower hotline\n\nThe whistleblower hotline can be used by anyone who wishes to raise concerns, in confidence, about the Company's operations. The hotline is used by employees, contractors and, occasionally, other stakeholders such as suppliers and local communities. The use of the Company's whistleblower arrangements is monitored quarterly by the Audit Committee (see the Audit Committee Report on page 186). The Audit Committee reviews updates on management responses to calls made to the whistleblower line and reports to the Board twice a year on the operation of the whistleblower hotline. The Board received these reports at its meetings in April 2022 (in relation to 2H 2021) and July 2022 (in relation to 1H 2022). In 2022, the Audit Committee and Board monitored the reporting of incidences of harassment following the commencement of the anti-harassment protocol.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for the day-to-day stewardship of all stakeholder relationships and its members report to the Board on the key metrics and initiatives. The Board, either directly or through its Committees, engages or oversees engagement with the Company's stakeholders through a number of governance activities (which are described in more detail, along with further information about the Company's engagement with key stakeholders, in the Stakeholder Table on pages 118 to 125).\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic continued to present a significant challenge to the Company and required the Board to continually adapt and evolve the Company's practices. During the year, senior management and the HSECR Committee, on behalf of the Board, evaluated prevention protocols and engagement strategies. The Company will continue to be cautious in order to safeguard the wellbeing of the workforce and neighbouring communities. More information on engagement with our communities can be found on pages 110 to 112 and 122.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nOur workforce is the foundation that supports our business model. The Board believes that the wellbeing of our people and an ethical and inclusive culture are the drivers of higher levels of employee engagement and are essential to attract and retain talent.\n\nThe Board and its Committees receive information related to the workforce through a range of channels (see workforce engagement diagram), including direct engagement. Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has been designated as the Non-executive Director to act as a representative of the workforce in the boardroom. This enables the Board to understand the views of the workforce regarding their experiences of working for the Company as well as providing an additional mechanism to raise concerns.\n\nDuring 2022, the Company undertook two separate workforce engagement sessions led by Mr Fern\u00e1ndez. The sessions enabled Mr Fern\u00e1ndez to listen to the views of employees directly. These sessions involved representatives from all of the Group's operations, functions and demographics and included unionised and non-unionised workers. The meeting agendas considered relevant workforce issues while remaining open to encourage ideas and concerns being raised. The topics covered included:\n\n- \u00b7 Integral wellbeing, health, safety and Covid-19.\n- \u00b7 Ethical culture, diversity, inclusion and equity.\n\nThe openness and candour expressed during these engagement sessions provided important insights such as: the sense of pride in working for the Company, appreciation of investment in training and professional development, recognition of good job benefits in comparison to our competitors, and a recognition of the improvements in corporate communication. Areas of concern included security surrounding our operations, safety incidents and turnover rates, simplification of administrative processes, salary and wages in the context of inflation, and appeal mechanisms for performance appraisals. Further details are provided on page 126.\n\nFeedback received from these workforce engagement sessions was discussed at the July and October 2022 Board meetings. The insights are hugely valuable for boardroom discussions and decision-making. Feedback was also very useful in informing management programmes and practices. Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has shared with Company management the specific workforce concerns and is following these up to ensure that they are addressed appropriately. As the world is expected to gradually return to a new normality after the Covid-19 pandemic, both Mr Fern\u00e1ndez and the senior team will consider holding the workforce engagement sessions using a combination of a mixed virtual and physical format and/or with the physical presence of all participants.",

Such reports identify issues raised by investors during meetings with management during the previous quarter.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer meet with analysts, hold conference calls after quarterly production reports and engage with shareholders by participating in major roadshows in London and other key financial centres, after preliminary and half-yearly results are announced. In 2022, face-to-face meetings were resumed after the Covid-19-related restrictions were lifted.\n\nThe 2022 AGM was held in person and shareholders were invited to attend. Nevertheless, shareholders were provided with an opportunity to submit questions to the Board via a dedicated email address ahead of the AGM. It is anticipated that the 2023 AGM will be held in the normal way and shareholders will be invited to attend.\n\nThe Head of Investor Relations in London is responsible for maintaining relations with analysts and major shareholders on a day-to-day basis, which is done by way of telephone calls and meetings in London. Contact with investors in Mexico is maintained through the Investor Relations Office in Mexico City. The Senior Independent Director, who is based in London, is available to speak with shareholders concerning specific corporate governance questions as and when they arise.\n\n## The Board and climate\n\nIn relation to climate change and risk, the Board considers climate change during its discussions and when making decisions regarding the Group's strategy, risk management, investments, and stakeholders. On behalf of the Board, the HSECR Committee evaluates in greater detail, climate-related performance, risks and opportunities. Since 2020, climate change has been part of the agenda at all HSECR Committee meetings.\n\nThe HSECR committee reviewed:\n\n- \u00b7 The energy strategy and ambition of the Company's plans, factoring in the expectations of our stakeholders on setting ambitious targets and the current regulatory risks associated with renewable electricity in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 The technology strategy to explore opportunities to reduce the carbon emissions and water footprint of mineral processing.\n- \u00b7 The approach of the Company to identify, evaluate and respond to the risks and opportunities of climate change in the business model.\n- \u00b7 The Company's approach to adopt the TCFD recommendations.\n- \u00b7 The safe operation of TSFs.\n- \u00b7 The approach to partner with the scientific community to use climate models to better understand physical risks and socio-economic scenarios for transition risks.\n\nThe HSECR Committee periodically briefed the Board on climate change performance and the approach of the Company to adopt the TCFD recommendations. During the year the Board was also briefed by the Audit Committee on TCFD disclosure requirements and governance practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on this can be found in the Sustainability report on pages 86 to 109 and in the Audit Committee report on pages 182, 186 and 192.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Group requires that Directors complete a Director's List which sets out details of situations where each Director's interest may conflict with those of the Company (situational conflicts). Each Director re-submitted their Director's List as at 31 December 2022 for the Board to consider and authorise any new situational conflicts identified in the re-submitted lists. In addition, at the beginning of each Board meeting, the Company Secretary reminds the Directors of their duties under sections 175, 177 and 182 of the Companies Act which relate to the disclosure of any conflicts of interest prior to any matter that may be discussed by the Board. Further information about related party matters considered by the Board during the year are set out in the Audit Committee Report on pages 184, 191 and 192.\n\n## Relationship agreement\n\nPe\u00f1oles has entered into a relationship agreement with the Company (the 'Relationship Agreement') to ensure that relationships between the Fresnillo Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group are conducted at arm's length and on normal commercial terms. Messrs Alejandro Baill\u00e8res, Juan Bordes and Arturo Fernandez have been appointed to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement.\n\nThe Relationship Agreement complies with the independence provisions set out in Listing Rule 6.1.4DR for controlled companies. The independent Non-executive Directors annually review the good standing of the Relationship Agreement (with the most recent review being undertaken in July 2022) and they are satisfied that the Company has complied with the independence provisions included in the Relationship Agreement during the financial year ended 31 December 2022. As far as the Company is aware, such provisions have been complied with during the financial year ended 31 December 2022 by Pe\u00f1oles and/or any of its associates.\n\nPe\u00f1oles has also undertaken not to exercise its voting rights to amend the Articles of Association in a way which would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Relationship Agreement. It has also agreed to abstain from voting on any resolution to approve a 'related party transaction' (as defined in paragraph 11.1.5 R of the Listing Rules) involving any member of the Pe\u00f1oles Group.\n\n## Director concerns\n\nDirectors have the right to raise concerns at Board meetings and can ask for those concerns to be recorded in the Board minutes. The Board has also established a procedure which enables Directors, in relevant circumstances, to obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Division of responsibilities\n\n## Reporting on the application of the principle: Division of responsibilities\n\n## Principle F:\n\nThe chair leads the board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness in directing the company. They should demonstrate objective judgement throughout their tenure and promote a culture of openness and debate. In addition, the chair facilitates constructive board relations and the effective contribution of all non-executive directors, and ensure that directors receive accurate, timely and clear information.\n\nThe outcome of the Board evaluation process, detailed on pages 175 to 177, confirms that Board members are satisfied with the role that the Chairman takes to meet this principle. The Company Secretary working alongside the Chairman and executive management ensures that the Board receives timely and accurate information, and, again, the Board evaluation confirmed the Directors' satisfaction with this service.\n\n## Principle G:\n\nThe board should include an appropriate combination of executive and non-executive (and, in particular, independent non-executive) directors, such that no one individual or small group of individuals dominates the board's decision-making. There should be a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the board and the executive leadership of the company's business.\n\nThe structure of the Board is described in detail on page 179, and the Board, which is advised by the Nominations Committee, is satisfied that notwithstanding that there are no Executive Directors on the Board, that Principle G is met. As described on pages 173 and 174 the Nominations Committee has reviewed the independence of all independent Non-executive Directors and is satisfied that they remain independent in line with the guidance of the Code. As described on pages 173 and 174 there is a written division of duties between the Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior Independent Director.\n\n## Roles\n\nThe composition of the Board is structured to ensure that no one individual can dominate the decision-making processes of the Board. The Board is led by the Chairman. The Board as a whole currently consists of five Nonindependent Non-executive Directors and seven independent Non-executive Directors. One of the independent Non-executive Directors is designated as the Senior Independent Director. The Executive Committee provides operational leadership to the Group and is headed by the Chief Executive Officer. The respective responsibilities of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Independent Director are set down in a written statement which was last updated in October 2019.\n\n## Chairman's independence\n\nMr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res, was appointed as the Chairman of the Company in April 2021, when his father Alberto Baill\u00e8res stepped down from that role. Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res is beneficially interested in more than 50% of the share capital of the Company through his interest in Industrias Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V., the Company's controlling shareholder. Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res is the Chairman of Pe\u00f1oles and other companies within the BAL Group and was appointed to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement (see page 72), thus at the time of his appointment, he was not independent. With Penoles having a significant stake in the Company, the Board believes that the Chairman's non-independence is not a hindrance for his involvement on the Board but an asset to other shareholders especially as related party transactions are reviewed and approved by independent directors and the Audit Committee. The Board, therefore, believes that his involvement is a governance plus since it assures the Chairman's alignment with all shareholders interests. Having served as Deputy Chairman for more than three years and having received guidance from Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res for many years, the Board considers that Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res possesses significant\n\n## Principle H:\n\nNon-executive directors should have sufficient time to meet their board responsibilities. They should provide constructive challenge, strategic guidance, offer specialist advice and hold management to account.\n\nThe Board has considered potential conflicts of interest of Board members, and is satisfied that they have sufficient time to discharge their duties. The Board evaluation exercise described on pages 175 to 177, has confirmed that all Directors continue to continue to contribute fully, and provide a robust level of challenge to management. A working meeting of the Board focused on the risk element contained within the proposed strategy, and the Board reviewed and challenged management thoroughly on their proposals.\n\n#2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principle I:\n\nThe board, supported by the company secretary, should ensure that it has the policies, processes, information, time and resources it needs in order to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nAs described on pages 175 to 177, the Board evaluation exercise confirmed that all Directors were satisfied with the support they got from the Secretary, and that appropriate information was provided to them on a timely basis.\n\nknowledge and experience of the Company which it believes underpins his effectiveness in carrying out the role of the Chairman. The Board also considers that the continued oversight of the Company's strategic and operational integrity through its membership of the Pe\u00f1oles group enhances the quality of its corporate governance. Given Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res' experience and understanding of Mexican business and its regulatory context, this assessment gains further validity in the continuing political and social environment in Mexico. Notwithstanding the expectations of the Code, the Board values and endorses Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res' chairmanship of the Company.\n\nThe Relationship Agreement continues to provide a foundation for a transparent governance system, which ensures that the Company benefits from Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res' leadership and experience while being able to demonstrate to other shareholders that the Fresnillo Group is capable of carrying on its business independently of any companies with which he is connected. In particular, the Relationship Agreement ensures that transactions and relationships between the Fresnillo Group and its controlling shareholder are at arm's length and on competitive commercial terms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information regarding the Relationship agreement can be found on page 172.\n\n## Directors' independence\n\nThe Board considers the following Directors to be independent: Charles Jacobs, B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera, Georgina Kessel, Dame Judith Macgregor, Hector Rangel, Alberto Tiburcio and Guadalupe de la Vega. The Board, through the Nominations Committee, has assessed each of these Directors by reference to the criteria set out in Provision 10 of the Code and the Board remains satisfied that they are each independent in character and judgement. In making this assessment for Mr Alberto Tiburcio, the Board",

Mr Tiburcio is an independent Non-executive Director of Grupo Nacional Provincial, S.A.B. and Grupo Palacio de Hierro, S.A.B. de C.V., which are companies within the BAL Group. He is not involved in executive duties in any of those companies and has a similar obligation to be independent for those two companies as for Fresnillo. The Board does not consider that Mr Tiburcio's position as an independent Non-executive Director of the Company is adversely impacted by those two appointments. The Board also considers that Mr Tiburcio's experience in Mexican and international business and his experience and knowledge of Mexican and international accounting and audit practice and corporate governance are particularly valuable to the Board and the Audit Committee. At the 31 December 2022 and at the date of this report, Charles Jacobs and B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera continued to be independent Non-executive Directors as defined by Provision 10 of the Code. The Board intends to recommend to shareholders the reappointment of Charles Jacobs and B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera as independent Non-executive Directors at the AGM in May 2023, despite them both having been on the Board for more than nine years at the time of the 2023 AGM. The rationale for this recommendation is explained in the Nominations Committee report on page 179.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nCharles Jacobs is the Senior Independent Director. In February 2022, Mr Jacobs convened a meeting of the independent Non-executive Directors to evaluate the performance of the Chairman and to assess the good standing of the Relationship Agreement. The independent Non-executive Directors were satisfied that there were no issues or concerns in respect of either matter. Mr Jacobs provided feedback to the Chairman on those discussions.\n\n## Time commitment and overboarding\n\nAll Directors pre-clear any proposed appointments to listed company boards with the Chairman, prior to committing to them, and such appointments are ratified by the Board at the next possible meeting. During the 12 months prior to the date of this report Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res notified the Board of his appointment as Director of the Board of Directors of Fomento Econ\u00f3mico M\u00e9xicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV: FEMSA), and Mr Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez notified the Board of his appointment as Alternate Director of such Company.\n\nMs Guadalupe de la Vega notified the Board of her appointment as Director of the Board of Directors of Sitios Latinoam\u00e9rica, S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV: LASITE). No other Directors took on any significant new additional external appointments in the year.\n\nThe Non-executive Directors are required, by their letters of appointment, to spend 14 days per annum on Company business. The Nominations Committee is satisfied that all of the Directors, but particularly the Non-independent Non-executive Directors, spend considerably more than this amount of time on Board and committee activity.\n\nThe Nominations Committee annually reviews the time commitments to ensure that all Board members continue to be able to devote sufficient time and attention to the Company's business. Its philosophy in doing so, is to consider the total workload of each Non-executive Director and the particular value that each Director brings to the Board. In making this assessment, the Nominations Committee takes into account the following factors:\n\n- 1. As a single-product Company with operations primarily in just one country, and because of the relative commonality of the Company's activities, the Board does not consider that it needs more than four scheduled Board meetings with additional working meetings per year, a factor which is reflected in the relatively low fees that the Company pays its Non-executive Directors.\n- 2.  This relatively low number of meetings is further justified by the degree of governance oversight of the Company. This comes by virtue of it also being a member of the BAL Group. The calendar for Board and Committee meetings is scheduled to align with the meetings of other companies, including listed companies, within the BAL Group ownership structure. This ensures that Fresnillo plc Directors who are appointed to the boards of other companies within the BAL Group do not have any time conflicts with their other commitments on BAL Listed Entity boards.\n\nThe other listed company directorships of the Fresnillo plc Directors are set out on pages 164 to 167 of this report. The Board and Committee attendance record of each of the Directors during 2022 is set out on page 162 of this report.\n\n## Company Secretary\n\nThe advice and services of the Company Secretary (whose appointment and removal are matters reserved for the Board) are also available to the Directors. The Company also regularly receives advice on UK corporate governance and legal developments from its UK legal and corporate governance advisors.",

Both appointments and succession plans should be based on merit and objective criteria and, within this context, should promote diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths.\n\nThe Board is satisfied it has applied principle J.

A combination of externally facilitated and internally run evaluations is carried out over a three-year cycle and forms the Board Development Programme. The Board recognises that a continuous and constructive review of its performance is an important factor in achieving its objectives and realising its full potential.\n\nThe cycle of the Board's evaluations is summarised as follows:\n\n## Year 1\n\nExternally facilitated Board evaluation using questionnaires and/or interviews.\n\n## Year 2\n\nFollow-up on action plan prepared in response to Year 1 evaluation using internally-facilitated questionnaires.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Year 3\n\nFocus on outstanding and emerging issues arising from the action plan using internally-facilitated questionnaires.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principle K:\n\nThe board and its committees should have a combination of skills, experience and knowledge.

This is augmented by Directors who have significant commercial and other relevant expertise. The length of service of Board members is detailed on page 179.\n\n## Principle L:\n\nAnnual evaluation of the board should consider its composition, diversity and how effectively members work together to achieve objectives.

At its meeting in October 2022, the Board discussed the results. The overall conclusion from the Board effectiveness reviews was that the performance of the Fresnillo Board is rated very highly, highlighting the excellent work culture established both in the Board and in the Committees, and therefore the recommendations were characterised as points of potential further improvement rather than material changes of approach. Particular areas of Board governance which were commended in the report included: Board composition; stakeholder oversight; Board dynamics; Board support and Board committees; the management and focus of meetings; oversight of strategy and risk management and internal control.\n\nThere were four areas for change that the Board will consider over the coming year:\n\n- \u00b7 Increased focus on risk management, including appropriate mitigation measures.\n- \u00b7 Spend less time on details of the financial aspects of the business during the Board meetings.\n- \u00b7 Focus on the topics that were identified as the top strategic issues facing the Company over the next three to five years including: (i) Growth and development; (ii) Political and regulatory environment; (iii) Climate Change and ESG; (iv) Efficiency and cost control; (v) Technological developments; (vi) Security; and (vii) Geopolitical uncertainty.\n- \u00b7 Continue improving the Board's information packages.",

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible for the Non-executive Directors to make such visits in person in 2022. It is intended to resume visits to mines in 2023, if advisable.\n\nBriefings by the Company's legal advisers are arranged for all new Directors. In addition, the Chairman discusses training or development needs with Board members from time to time.",

The Committee considered, notwithstanding that the UK Corporate\n\nGovernance Code suggest that nine years' service could have an impact on independence, that both individuals continue to demonstrate independence in character and judgement. The Board is satisfied that they have not formed associations with management (or others), and as the Board's fees are a minor part of their income, their membership of the Board should not compromise their ability to exercise independent judgement or act in the best interests of the Company. The Committee also considers that the Board continues to benefit considerably from the broad business experience and knowledge of the capital markets in the UK and Mexico that they respectively bring. General restrictions on travel have not enabled the Committee to fully consider an appropriate succession plan in time to bring forward replacements for the shareholders to consider at the 2023 AGM. The Committee will focus on a recruitment process in 2023 to appoint two new independent Non-executive Directors for shareholder approval at the AGM in 2024.\n\n## Board diversity policy progress\n\nWe continue to recognise and embrace the benefits of having a diverse Board, particularly the value that different perspectives and experience bring to the quality of Board debate and decision-making. We hold fast to the importance of making Board appointments on the basis of merit; but we also take seriously considerations such as background and experience, age, gender, and shareholder perspectives in our reviews of the composition of the Board. We believe that setting targets for the number of people from a particular background or gender is not an effective approach and therefore we have no specific quotas or targets. Nevertheless, our direction of travel, as far as diversity is concerned, has been a progressive one. Our Board composition meets the target set by the Hampton-Alexander Review.\n\nSince February 2020, the Board has benefited from seven independent Non-executive Directors out of 12, the largest number of independent Directors the Company has ever had on the Board. This adds diversity of thought and input into our Board discussions.\n\nIt is pleasing to also note that in 2022 the Parker Review reported that Fresnillo plc has met its set ethnicity target for FTSE 100 companies. Since our IPO in 2008, the Board has consisted predominantly of Mexican Directors, alongside at least two British Directors, which enables the Board to benefit from a sound understanding of both the UK and Mexican cultural contexts of the Company in its decision-making.\n\n## Company-wide gender diversity\n\nIn 2021, the Company conducted surveys and focus groups to better understand the challenges and opportunities of developing a diverse and inclusive culture. A new strategy was implemented in 2022. This includes several initiatives designed to: improve the leadership opportunities for women; develop a better human resources infrastructure; adopt and use metrics to improve management; and monitor and promote the right culture and behaviours. Further information on the implementation of this programme is set out on page 77 in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nIn 2022, the review of the effectiveness of the Board was carried out using a questionnaire-based approach. Board members were invited to complete the questionnaires, the results of which were collated by Lintstock LLP, into a Board discussion document. A summary of the overall approach adopted and findings arising from this review is set out on pages 175 to 177 of the Corporate Governance Report. We were pleased that the overall conclusion from the reviews was that the performance of the Fresnillo Board of Directors and, indeed, the Nominations Committee, both continue to be rated very highly.\n\nI would be happy to speak with any shareholders who have questions about the work of the Committee.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n## Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res\n\nChairman of the Nominations Committee",

        "page_content": "## Role\n\nThe Nominations Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the structure, size and composition of the Board and its Committees and succession planning for the Directors and other senior executives. Before making appointments of new Directors and members of the Executive Committee, the Nominations Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and identifying and nominating suitable candidates for approval by the Board. Prior to making such recommendations, the Nominations Committee considers the other time commitments and significant external interests of such candidates to ensure that they are able to contribute effectively to the Board.\n\nThe Nominations Committee has approved Board Appointments and Diversity Policies which provide the framework for the Nominations Committee and the Board's approach to Board appointments. The Board has also approved a Group Diversity Policy. (Full versions of these Policies may be found on the Company's website - www.fresnilloplc.com). A further explanation of the steps that the Company is taking to promote diversity across its businesses is set out in the Sustainability Report on page 77.\n\n## Board appointments policy\n\nThe Nominations Committee and Board are strongly committed to the principle of equality of opportunity when making new appointments to the Board while ensuring that appointments are based on merit. The Nominations Committee continues to consider the composition of the Board with this commitment in mind.\n\nThe criteria for determining the composition of the Board and future Board appointments continue to be based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Relationship Agreement requirements for appointments to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles.\n- \u00b7 The Company's leading position as a precious metals miner in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 The Company's inclusion in the FTSE 100 Index.\n- \u00b7 The specific functions on Board committees which independent Directors will be required to fulfil.\n- \u00b7 The provisions set out in the current terms of reference of the Nominations Committee and the Board Diversity Policy.\n\n## Directors' length of tenure\n\n| As at 31 December 2022    |   0 to 3 years | 3 to 6 years   | 6 to 9 years   | Over 9  years   |\n|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Independent Directors     |              2 | 2              | 3              | -               |\n| Non-independent Directors |              1 | -              | -              | 4               |\n\nThe Nominations Committee does not use open advertising or retain any external consultants when making new appointments to the Board as it is not considered necessary considering the Company's contacts within Mexico and further afield.\n\n## Executive succession planning\n\nIn April 2022, in line with its usual practice, the Nominations Committee reviewed a schedule of possible successors for all the positions on the Executive Committee (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Exploration and Chief Operating Officer). This review considered both short-term emergency and long-term planning scenarios.\n\n## Non-executive Directors succession planning\n\nThe Committee has recommended to the Board that two Directors, Mr Charles Jacobs and Mrs B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera, be proposed to shareholders for re-election at the AGM in 2023, despite the fact that they will have been on the Board for more than nine years at the time of the 2023 AGM. With Mr Jacobs and Mrs Garza Lag\u00fcera having recused themselves from the discussion, the Committee considered that despite the UK Corporate Governance Guidelines suggesting that nine years' service could have an impact on independence, that both individuals continued to demonstrate independence and have not formed associations with management (or others) that might compromise their ability to exercise independent judgement or act in the best interests of the Company. The Committee also noted that, due to the global pandemic restricting the Committee from meeting in person, it had not been possible to meet and fully discuss an appropriate succession plan for independent Non-executive Directors' appointment during 2022. The Committee will focus on this task in 2023 and seek to appoint replacements for the two individuals for shareholder approval by the AGM in 2024. The Committee has also considered that the Board balance and diversity is appropriate and that all independent Non-executives Directors put forward for re-election, in addition to Mr Jacobs and Mrs Garza, continue to be independent.\n\n## Other Committee activity during 2022\n\nThe Nominations Committee also considered the following matters as part of its usual programme of activity:\n\n- \u00b7 Time commitment: A review of the time commitment required from each Director and their other external appointments, prior to making a recommendation to the Board supporting that all of the continuing Directors be proposed for re-election at the 2023 AGM. (Further analysis of the Nominations Committee's assessment is set out on page 174).\n- \u00b7 Committee Report: Approval of the 2021 Nominations Committee Report prior to publication.\n- \u00b7 Committee Evaluation: In February 2023, the Nominations Committee reviewed the outcome of the independent performance evaluation undertaken in 2022, which concluded that the Committee is performing very well.\n\n## Board skills and experience\n\n| Skill/experience                                                                                                                                                                                       |   Description | Percentage of  Board members                                                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sustainable commercial success in business at a senior executive level.                                                                                                                                |            83 | Commercial leadership                                                                                           |\n| Experience in enterprise-wide strategy development and implementation in industries with long cycles and  developing and leading business transformation strategies.                                   |            83 | Strategy                                                                                                        |\n| Mexican business experience                                                                                                                                                                            |            92 | Relevant experience and understanding of the Mexican political, cultural, regulatory and business environments. |\n| Extensive direct experience in environments requiring capital allocation, cost efficiency and cash flow  management disciplines, with proven long-term performance.                                    |            92 | Capital allocation and   cost efficiency                                                                        |\n| Extensive experience with complex workplace health, safety, environmental and community risks, frameworks  and issues.                                                                                 |            75 | Health, safety, environment   and community                                                                     |\n| Relevant experience and understanding of capital markets, institutional investor engagement and regulatory/ governance expectations.                                                                   |            83 | Capital markets                                                                                                 |\n| Board-level experience and/or long-term knowledge gained through working with companies operating in the  mining or natural resources sector.                                                          |            67 | Mining and natural resources                                                                                    |\n| Relevant experience in financial regulation and the capability to evaluate financial statements, financial controls  and risk.                                                                         |            75 | Financial expertise                                                                                             |\n| Extensive experience of public policy or regulatory matters, including fiscal and economic, ESG (in particular  climate change) and community issues, social responsibility and transformation issues. |            67 | Public policy expertise                                                                                         |\n| Workforce learning and skills development, diversity and wellbeing.                                                                                                                                    |            92 | Workforce well being                                                                                            |",

The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee Chair, and an explanation of the independence and effectiveness of the external audit process can be found on page 187 with detail of the reappointment of the statutory auditor on page 188.

Companies have needed to respond creatively to the challenges presented. The business has to prioritise the health and wellbeing of employees and other key stakeholders, while making every effort to maintain production. Taking account of the relevant safety measures in place during 2022, with regard to Covid-19 infection, our mines continued operating throughout and most of the Company's office-based employees were able to combine home and office working.\n\nAs a consequence of the challenging circumstances facing the business, the Committee has focussed closely on key financial processes and internal control. Further close attention has been given to the key areas of judgement and estimation in the financial statements, such as impairment of long-term assets, going concern and viability assessments. With the support of Internal Audit, Internal Control and Risk Management, the Committee concluded that the internal controls and processes were functioning appropriately, and no significant weaknesses have been identified. Close consultation and interaction by the Committee with the external auditor has also been maintained during the year.\n\nThe items of particular focus for the Committee during the year are detailed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Proposed changes to regulations: During the year, the Committee continued to consider the significant changes that may be introduced in future years as a result of the report arising from the UK Government's consultation on 'Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance' which was published in May 2022. We have also considered how to implement new requirements with regard to transparency, diversity and inclusion following prior year regulatory changes.\n- \u00b7 Labour law changes: During the year, the Committee continued to monitor the implementation of the action plan approved by the Board in response to the new rules which prohibit the subcontracting of personnel introduced by the Mexican Government in April 2021.\n- \u00b7 Tax contingencies: The Committee has continued to closely monitor tax contingencies, in particular the differences generated from prior years regarding the tax treatment of certain stripping costs and exploration expenses. These items were not explicitly determined by the Mexican tax law and consequently were subject to interpretation. During 2022, the Committee has received regular reports from management on their discussions with the Servicio de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria (SAT), the Mexican tax authority, concerning these matters. After 31 December 2022 and following the discussions held with the SAT, the Company agreed to amend the income tax and mining rights treatment for the periods 2014-2021 in respect of stripping costs and exploration expenses. This amendment impacted the income statement as of 31 December 2022 by US$17.4 million, of which US$11.5 million relate to interest and surcharges. No penalties were incurred in respect of this tax amendment. This effect was offset by a decrease in deferred corporate income tax of US$3.4 million.\n- \u00b7 Fraud detection: In response to the expected future regulatory changes, the Company has further strengthened its already firm commitment to reducing fraud by enhancing its fraud risk assessment process, reinforcing the controls currently in place to prevent and detect material fraud. The Committee has been working closely with Internal Control, Risk Management and the Internal Audit teams, on this area. More information on risk management systems can be found on page 127.",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee report continued\n\n- \u00b7 Climate-related financial disclosures: This Annual Report includes additional disclosures consistent with the guidelines set out by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). These disclosure requirements were discussed by the Committee and were the subject of particular attention while reviewing the Annual Report and the financial statements. The Committee has also considered the role of the HSECR Committee in monitoring climate-related risks, the mitigating actions being taken to manage those risks, as well as its own responsibility to ensure that accurate reporting is achieved and published, amending the Committee's Terms of reference accordingly. The Committee is satisfied that the disclosures reflect the Company's current position and is aware of the further progress that the Company needs to make in this area in order to fully comply with the TCFD recommendations in the future. Further details of the progress made during the year and actions expected to be taken during 2023 are set out in the Letter from the Chairman of the HSECR Committee on pages 64 to 65 and in the Sustainability Report on pages 86 to 118.\n- \u00b7 Reserves and resources: The Committee has been pleased to see an improvement in the timing of the delivery of the Reserves and Resources Statement by independent auditors. The Company has continued to make progress in correcting the observations from prior years with the result that the Company is able to report its reserves and resources with greater accuracy and certainty.\n- \u00b7 Anti-bribery and corruption: During the year, the Company carried out an externally facilitated ISO 37001 audit to assess the conformity of the Company's ABAC programme with ISO standards (in line with the UK Ministry of Justice Guidance). The result was satisfactory, and the Committee was kept informed of management's plan to implement the recommendations proposed following the audit. Further information about the Company's approach to bribery and corruption is set out on page 157 of the Strategic Report.\n\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity: IT security and data protection were also regularly reviewed by the Committee during the year to ensure that the improvements identified in previous years continue to be implemented on schedule. In 2022, the Committee continued to receive an update on the Group's IT strategy, and its linkage to the Group's overall business strategy, as well as the financial implications of that strategy for the business plan. It also monitored the progress of the Pe\u00f1oles and Fresnillo management teams in developing the cybersecurity framework for the Group. Further information about the Group's approach to IT is set out on pages 131 and 143 of the Strategic Report. The Company continues to make progress in this important area, and this will be monitored further by the Committee during 2023.\n\nThe Committee reviewed a letter from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in late 2022 with observations on the 2021 Annual Report and considered the Company's response to that letter. The Committee was pleased to note the FRC's confirmation, in December 2022, that it had concluded the correspondence on this matter.\n\nIn the second half of the year, Lintstock carried out an evaluation of the Board and its committees. With respect to the Audit Committee, I am pleased to report that the results of the evaluation were very positive. Nevertheless, we continue to look for ways to improve both the efficiency of the meetings and remain well-briefed on the subjects that we are required to consider as a Committee.\n\nAt the end of the year, the Committee undertook a questionnaire-based evaluation of the performance of the internal audit function and was satisfied with the outcome.\n\nIn closing, I would like to acknowledge the effort and valuable contributions made by the members of the Committee, and by the Company executives who work closely with it; as well as the invaluable support and trust that the Committee continues to receive from the Board.\n\nI would be happy to speak with any shareholders who have questions about the work of the Committee.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n## Alberto Tiburcio\n\nChairman of the Audit Committee",

Notwithstanding this, the Committee was able to operate in accordance with its terms of reference and it was able to follow its usual pattern of work which is reported under the following headings:\n\n## Reporting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Financial reporting: Overseeing the Company's financial and narrative reporting to shareholders (including considering whether it was fair, balanced, and understandable).\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder relationships and reporting: Overseeing the Company's reporting on certain stakeholder issues.\n\n## Risk and Controls\n\n- \u00b7 Risk: Overseeing the operation of the Company's risk management framework.\n- \u00b7 Internal control: Monitoring the Company's internal control environment.\n- \u00b7 Related parties: Overseeing the financial aspects of the Company's commercial relationships with related parties.\n- \u00b7 Whistleblowing: Overseeing on behalf of the Board, the cases reported through the whistleblower line and the work of the Honour Commission.\n\nDetails of the membership of the Committee and the Committee's effectiveness review are set out on pages 163 and 177 respectively of the Governance Section.\n\n## Reporting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nThe Company reports to shareholders on its financial performance twice a year. During the period from 1 January 2022 to the date of this report, the Committee reviewed the full-year financial statements and Annual Report for the year to 31 December 2021, the interim financial statements for the six months to 30 June 2022 and the full-year financial statements and Annual Report for the year to 31 December 2022. To aid the Committee members' understanding of the reported financial results during the year, the Chief Financial Officer updated the Committee on the Group's quarterly financial performance at each of its meetings in February, April, July and October.\n\nThe principal steps taken by the Committee during the period from 1 January 2022 to the date of this report in relation to its review of the published financial statements were:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the financial statements and Annual Report for the year ending 31 December 2021 and consideration of EY's comments on these documents;\n- \u00b7 Review of the 2022 interim financial statements and 2022 Interim Announcement and consideration of EY's comments on the drafts of these documents;\n- \u00b7 Review of plan for preparing the financial statements and Annual Report for the year ending 31 December 2022;\n- \u00b7 Review of the significant judgements and estimates that impact the financial statements (see below); and\n- \u00b7 Review of the financial statements and Annual Report for the year ending 31 December 2022 and consideration of EY's comments on these documents.\n\nIn addition, the Committee reviewed and recommended for approval, drafts of Parent Company interim accounts prepared as at 31 December 2021 and for the period then ended.\n\nDuring 2022, with the exception of the interim review, EY did not provide any assurance work in relation to non-audit matters.\n\n## Significant judgement areas\n\nThe Committee considered the principal areas of financial statement risk and judgements made in relation to both the interim and full year financial statements, prior to recommending those financial statements to the Board for approval. In many cases, these significant judgement areas were the same as those considered in previous years; however, as the mining cycle progresses these areas of judgement or estimation evolve, and new ones may need to be considered while others may become less important.\n\n## Process for the review of significant judgements\n\nThe significant judgement process may be summarised in the following way:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assurance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 External audit: Overseeing the work of and the Company's relationship with the external auditor.\n- \u00b7 Internal audit: Overseeing the work and findings of Internal Audit.",

In each case, the Audit Committee concluded that the accounting treatment and disclosure in the financial statements are appropriate.\n\n## Related party transactions including revenue recognition (see note 27 to the Financial Statements)\n\n## Assessment of risk\n\n## Variables considered\n\n## Sources of assurance\n\nFresnillo has a controlling shareholder and as a result has very strong ties both to Pe\u00f1oles and the broader BAL group. There is a risk that related party relationships could be taken advantage of to manipulate earnings, otherwise distort the Company's financial position and/or transfer value to Pe\u00f1oles or another BAL company inappropriately. Furthermore, related party transaction disclosure requirements allow investors to understand the nature and extent of the Company's transactions with related parties and there is a risk that disclosures in the financial statements could be inaccurate or incomplete.\n\nEvery year, the Committee scrutinises the probity of all major related party transactions to ensure that they are entered into transparently and fairly to all shareholders. The Committee continued reviewing the implementation of the Baluarte Minero reorganisation, which had started in 2021 (see the section of this report headed 'Related parties' on page 191).\n\nThe Committee considered management reports on the transactions with related parties during the year. In particular, it received confirmation from the Chief Executive Officer on the trading relationship with Met-Mex and the basis on which pricing is determined (using a methodology which was adopted in 2019) (see the 'Related Parties' section on page 191).\n\nThe Committee discussed EY's procedures to ensure that related party transactions are recognised accurately and correctly reported in the relevant disclosures in the Annual Report, as well as their related conclusions.\n\nInternal Audit routinely review agreements between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles, the results of which are reported to the Committee as part of its annual Internal Audit Programme updates. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) conducts annual reviews of the intercompany transactions each year (including related party transactions). In previous years, these reviews have not resulted in any adverse comments thus providing a basis of assurance for the usual approach; however, the PWC 2022 transfer pricing review will not be completed until after the date of approval of this report.\n\n## Mineral reserves and resources (see pages 296 to 301)\n\nAssessment of the risk\n\n## Variables considered\n\n## Sources of assurance\n\nReserves and resources are a primary driver of Fresnillo's market valuation and a significant input into calculations of depreciation and assessments of impairment. Such calculations are dependent on significant amounts of geological data provided by the Company's business units. Delays in gathering such data and inaccuracies in the estimation of reserves and resources would have broad implications for the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\nThe estimation of mineral reserves and resources requires significant judgement, not only in respect of mineral physically in place but also metal price and cost assumptions used to determine the cut-off grade for identifying economically viable ore bodies. There is also judgement in developing and maintaining the mine plans which estimate the timing and quantities of related production.\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee continued to assess the observations made in previous reports concerning the Group's processes for the estimation of reserves and resources. It continues to discuss with management the resourcing of the internal teams supporting this process and other steps taken to improve the quality and timeliness of the provision of data to SRK and AMC. Since 2021, the audit of reserves and resources was split between SRK and AMC to expedite the audit process. The Committee reviewed progress with the remedial action plan prepared by management in 2019 and noted that further progress had been made to deliver the reports from SRK and AMC on a more timely basis.",

The Committee further evaluated EY's  assessment of management's position on the mines most at risk and sensitivities performed by EY for alternative metals  price and discount rate scenarios. |\n|                                                                                                        | (see note 11 to the Financial Statements)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Taxation and PTU                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Assessment of risk:                                                                                    | The taxation of mining companies in Mexico has been the subject of much attention as reflected by a number of   tax inspections that are ongoing or have been initiated by the tax authorities.

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee report continued\n\n## Reporting continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ensuring that the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe Committee supports the Board in ensuring that the Annual Report is fair, balanced, and understandable. The approach taken by the Board in relation to the Annual Report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 is described on page 192 of the Corporate Governance Report. Different sections of the Report were circulated to Board members during early February 2023 to provide time for comments to be passed back to management. In addition, Internal Audit undertook a review of the non-financial reporting (which is extracted from the Company's operational records). In support of this process, prior to deciding whether to recommend them to the Board for approval, the Committee also:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the Annual Report and financial statements, taking into account comments made and reports issued by EY and comments discussed with management;\n- \u00b7 Reviewed with management the different disclosures relating to climate change throughout the Annual Report and, in particular, the TCFD reporting, including the statement of compliance;\n- \u00b7 Discussed the Annual Report and financial reporting with the Company's Chief Financial Officer; and\n- \u00b7 Discussed with Internal Audit points arising from their review of the principal non-financial numbers in the Annual Report.\n\n## Stakeholder reporting\n\nThe Committee plays a role in overseeing, on behalf of the Board, some key aspects of the Company's reporting concerning its relationships with key stakeholder groups.\n\nEmployees: The Committee reviewed the work of the Honour Commission in relation to matters raised via the whistleblower line (see following section).\n\nGovernment/Tax authorities: The Committee closely monitors the Company's relationship with the SAT, with the status of any outstanding tax audits reviewed at most meetings. The Committee receives regular reports from the Head of Tax on her interactions with the SAT concerning current tax audits.\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee reviewed the Company's Payments to Governments data, published in June; and the Company's UK Tax Strategy Statement, published in November.\n\nEnvironment/Climate: During the year, the Committee continued evaluating the role that it should play in overseeing the governance of climate change and environmental risks. In particular, it was agreed that the Committee should work closely with the HSECR Committee to ensure that the governance of climate-related risks and monitoring of KPIs associated with climate-related risks is aligned between Fresnillo's operations and financial reporting. The Committee's terms of reference were amended accordingly see page 182.\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nThe 'L\u00ednea Correcta' whistleblower hotline allows stakeholders to anonymously report (via an independent third party) violations of the Group's Code of Conduct. The hotline is available for all stakeholders, including employees and third parties, so that any concerns about misconduct or impropriety may be raised and dealt with appropriately. All matters raised via the hotline are processed by an independent third party for review by the Honour Commission (which comprises the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Compliance Officer, the Vice President of Exploration and the Head of Legal). A summary of the whistleblowing cases, which also includes the decisions of the Honour Commission in relation to each case, is reviewed by the Committee each quarter and the Chairman of the Committee gives a report to the Board every six months on the key trends and steps taken as a result of these reviews. Changes to the format of reporting to the Committee and the Board during the year have enabled the Board and Committee to better evaluate the reasons for the incidents reported, although the trends remain consistent year-on-year.\n\nIn 2022, there were a total of 113 reports (compared to 157 in 2021). In 2022, 105 (93%) of the reports were concluded in the year with the remainder, having been raised in the latter part of the year, still under investigation. Further details about the whistleblowing reports in 2022 is set out in the Sustainability Report on page 70. During the year, the Committee was satisfied that all matters had been or continue to be properly investigated with appropriate action taken.",

        "page_content": "## Assurance\n\n## External audit\n\n## Relationship with EY\n\nEY was re-appointed as the Company's auditor at the 2022 AGM. EY was originally appointed in 2008 and their appointment was re-confirmed in 2016 following a rigorous external audit tender process in 2015/2016. The next tender process is expected to be held no later than 2025. The current lead partner, Steve Dobson, has been in place since 2020. During 2022, the members of the Committee met twice with representatives from EY without management present and once with management without representatives of EY present, to ensure that there are no issues in the relationship between management and the external auditor which it should address. There were none.\n\nThe Company was in compliance with the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 during the year.\n\n## External audit process\n\nThe key steps in the Committee's interactions with EY during the period from 1 January 2022 to the date of this report were:\n\n- \u00b7 The review of a report from EY providing their observations and opportunities arising from the 2021 audit process and management responses to those observations in April 2022.\n- \u00b7 Discussion with EY of the findings from their review of the interim results for the period ended 30 June 2022.\n- \u00b7 The review of the 2022 half-year representation letter given to EY.\n- \u00b7 The review and approval of the external audit plan, fees and terms of audit engagement.\n- \u00b7 The review of the results of the 'hard close audit' for the ten months to 31 October 2022.\n- \u00b7 The review of the representation letter given to EY for the 2022 full-year audit.\n- \u00b7 The review of EY's report following completion of the audit for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nCovid-19: In 2022, EY's review of the half-year financial statements and the external audit of the full-year financial statements and 2022 Annual Report were conducted on a restricted basis due to some Covid-19 restrictions, however, the Audit Team was able to travel from the UK to Mexico and was able to visit some of the Company's mines.\n\nQuality, objectiveness and independence of the external auditor: The Committee is mindful of its responsibility to ensure that the external auditor maintains its independence and objectivity and is appropriately qualified with sufficient resources and expertise to fulfil the role. The Committee specifically reviewed, and is satisfied with, the independence of EY as the external auditor based on disclosures provided by EY in accordance with UK Ethical Standards for the audit profession. The Committee discussed the quality, objectiveness, and independence of the EY team with the management team and was satisfied that there were no concerns in this regard.\n\nNon-audit services policy: The Committee has adopted a policy for the provision of non-audit services to the Fresnillo Group by the external auditor (the 'Policy'). The Committee has maintained an ongoing dialogue with EY during the year concerning the services that it provides to the Company and the wider Pe\u00f1oles Group to ensure that where such services are provided, they are in line with the Policy or discussed with the Committee on a timely basis.\n\nThe current Policy permits the engagement of the external auditor to provide a narrow range of permitted services which are closely related to the audit and/or required by law or regulation. Any engagement of the external auditor to provide permitted services above US$5,000 is subject to the specific approval of the Committee. During 2022, EY provided audit-related assurance services in connection with the review of the interim financial statements (US$437,000). The ratio of fees paid for non-audit work in relation to audit work during the year was 0.2:1 (2021: 0.28:1.00).\n\nDetails of the fees paid to EY during the year are shown in note 28 to the financial statements.\n\n## Evaluation of the effectiveness of the external audit and the auditor\n\nThe Committee assesses the effectiveness of EY as its external auditor from two perspectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviews of the work of EY's UK practice, as a firm, undertaken by the Financial Reporting Council's Audit Quality Review Team; and\n- \u00b7 Its own assessment of the effectiveness of the external audit process and the role played by both EY's UK and Mexican teams in the performance of the annual audit.\n\nAudit Quality Review: The Committee reviewed the report of the FRC on its Audit Quality Review on EY as a firm and discussed with the EY Audit Partner whether any of the FRC's findings were relevant to the firm's audit of the Fresnillo financial statements. EY also shared the findings from their own internal quality review with the Chairman of the Committee. The conclusion from these reviews was that there were no major matters of concern to consider.\n\nAudit Committee assessment of EY: Following the completion of the 2021 Annual Report, the Committee undertook a review of the performance and effectiveness of EY at its April meeting. As part of this process, the Chief Financial Officer and finance team were invited to provide their insights into their interaction with the EY teams during that process. The Committee concluded that EY was generally performing well with an overall consensus being that the working relationship was good.\n\nThe Committee regularly monitors the steps taken by EY to ensure that the balance of work between the UK and Mexico is efficient and effective. The implementation of commitments made by EY for improving audit efficiency at the time of their successful tender in 2016 continued to be monitored by the Committee during 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The re-appointment of the auditor will be made subject to a review of proposed fees for the 2023 audit in July 2023.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe 2022 Internal Audit Annual Plan was approved by the Audit Committee in October 2021, incorporating audits across all of Fresnillo's business units with a focus on strategic priorities and key risks. In 2022, notwithstanding the continuation of Covid-19 restrictions in some instances, the Internal Audit programme was executed through a combination of site visits and remote audit procedures. Internal Audit continued to deploy technology and apply data analytics to achieve a satisfactory depth of audit coverage and gain deeper insights into Fresnillo's risk and control profile. Internal Audit completed a number of risk reviews along with process and controls assessments focusing on efficiency, productivity, cost management and regulatory compliance. Also, Internal Audit verified the validity, accuracy and completeness of the non-financial information included in the 2021 Annual Report and reported the results to the Audit Committee at the beginning of 2022.\n\nshutterstock\\_1635254404\n\nDue to the continued importance of cybersecurity and the evolving technology landscape, Internal Audit carried out assessments aimed at validating the design and effectiveness of Fresnillo's cybersecurity, IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operational Technology) processes and controls. In addition, due to the emergence of new regulations such as the Mexican Labour Law Reform, Internal Audit carried out a follow-up of Fresnillo's compliance risk management processes. The Audit Committee continues to review progress made in raising the level of cybersecurity maturity and actions taken by management to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. Towards the end of each year, Internal Audit presents the proposed Annual Internal Audit Plan and resourcing requirements for the following year. The 2023 Internal Audit Plan was presented to the Committee and approved in October 2022. The plan was developed according to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, and considered the following: shutterstock\\_736197394 shutterstock\\_1025305825 shutterstock\\_1635254404 shutterstock\\_1705437412 shutterstock\\_411624148 shutterstock\\_736197394 shutterstock\\_1025305825 shutterstock\\_1635254404 shutterstock\\_1705437412 shutterstock\\_411624148 shutterstock\\_1705437412 shutterstock\\_411624148 shutterstock\\_736197394 shutterstock\\_1025305825 shutterstock\\_1635254404 shutterstock\\_1705437412 shutterstock\\_439569301\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFresnillo's Strategic Plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnterprise Risk Assessment (including emerging risks)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement's concerns and previous Internal Audit results\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUniverse of processes, Business Units and projects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternal Audit Annual Plan 2022\n\nThe Internal Audit Plan for 2023 includes planned audits relating to strategic priorities and higher risk areas such as ESG, ongoing capital projects, compliance with laws and regulations (e.g., environmental laws, labour law, permitting requirements), reserves and resources procedures, tailings dam management, health and safety, taxes, cybersecurity and IT-OT processes and multi-risk operational compliance processes at mines.\n\nThe Head of Internal Audit attended all Audit Committee meetings throughout the year. Members of the Audit Committee meet with the Head of Internal Audit twice a year without management present.\n\nAt each meeting during the year, the Audit Committee also monitored the progress made by management in addressing 'red flag' items (i.e., relevant control observations) identified through Internal Audit work. The Audit Committee's focus is to ensure that the management responses to remediation are appropriate, and that timely progress is made in reducing the number of red flags over time.\n\nIn addition, the Audit Committee monitored the quality of the dialogue between Internal Audit and the Executive Committee in reviewing Internal Audit findings and agreeing action plans with appropriate levels of operational buy-in to address the points raised. The Audit Committee met with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer several times during the year to review the outstanding Internal Audit points and is satisfied with the progress achieved through this dialogue.\n\nAt the end of the year, the Audit Committee carried out an evaluation of the performance of the Internal Audit function, based on a focused questionnaire, and was satisfied with the outcome.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nshutterstock\\_411624148\n\nshutterst",

        "page_content": "## Risk and Controls\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk\n\nThe Committee monitors how the Company's risk management framework is operating. Operational responsibility for risk lies with line management (details of the risk management system are set out on page 127). The Audit Committee discusses potential changes to the Group's risk profile through its regular reviews of the Risk Matrix and its consideration of any associated recommendations from management proposing changes to the Risk Matrix to take account of changing and emerging risk. The Company defines emerging risk as: 'a new manifestation of risk that cannot yet be fully assessed, risks that are known to some degree but are not likely to materialise or have an impact for several years or a risk that the company is not aware of but that could, due to emerging macro trends in the mid or long-term future, have significant implications to achieve the organisation's strategic plan.'\n\nThe emerging risks were evaluated and reviewed by the Committee during the year. While the assessment of most of the emerging risks remained unchanged during the year, two new emerging risks are now being monitored (both connected to the Climate Change Principal Risk): (i) transition to a low-carbon future; and (ii) increasing societal and investor expectations in relation to climate change.\n\nThe Principal Risks and Uncertainties are reviewed every six months prior to the publication of both the interim and full-year reports. The Committee assessed the increase in the cybersecurity risk in the face of a greater number of global threats through ransomware and 'big game hunting' attacks. In addition, the Committee recommended considering the following three as main risks that were approved by the Board:\n\n- \u00b7 Potential government actions: Changes resulting from the labour reforms and consequently complications in the relationship with contractors, as well as the non-granting of mining concessions and longer periods for obtaining permits, among others.\n- \u00b7 Security: Increase in organised crime in the vicinity of all mining units and high-impact crimes (homicide, kidnapping and extortion) in the regions where we have operations, mainly Zacatecas, Guanajuato and Sonora.\n- \u00b7 Impact of metals prices and global macroeconomic developments: The impact on the supply chain of critical inputs for operation and costs resulting from macro-economic developments during the year.\n\nIn July 2022, the Board held a working meeting to discuss risk management arising from the Company's strategic plan. The Company's risk framework was discussed as well as how risks are identified, managed and controlled. In addition, key controls put in place to mitigate risks previously identified were discussed. Finally, the planned developments in UK regulatory matters relating to Corporate Governance and FRC Guidance on audit were considered.\n\n## Ethical risk\n\nThe Committee monitors ethical risk through regular reviews of progress with the Group's anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC) programme (including regular updates on the completion rates for the online training programmes). This demonstrates that the Group's corporate values and elements of the control culture in relation to ethics remain embedded throughout the organisation. To this end, during the year the Committee received reports on: the roll-out of training in relation to the disclosure of conflicts of interest; the Code of Conduct; Step-up Culture; and Harassment.\n\nThe Company widened the evaluation of its fraud risk assessment process to reinforce the controls to prevent and detect material fraud. Although the Company has always maintained a firm commitment to prevent and detect fraud through well-established practices and procedures, the Committee has been working closely with Internal Control and Internal Audit areas to identify any perceived weaknesses. The external auditors also expanded their procedures in this area.\n\nIn 2022 the Company carried out an externally facilitated ISO 37001 audit to assess the conformity of the Company's ABAC programme with ISO standards (in line with the UK Ministry of Justice Guidance). Further information about the Company's approach to bribery and corruption is set out on page 157 of the Strategic Report.\n\n## Financial risk management\n\nThe Company's objectives and policies on financial risk management including information on the Company's exposures to market risk, such as foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks, credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in note 16 to the financial statements. During the year, the Committee reviewed the Company's Treasury Policy and concluded that no further changes were required.\n\n## Non-financial risk areas\n\nThe Committee regularly reviews and receives management updates on current issues and developments that could have potential to give rise to specific risks. In this, the Committee is guided by regular updates it receives from management on specific issues that it considers should be kept under review. Thus, during 2022, regular reports were received on legal matters (including land titles and litigation) and a review of the Group's compliance with mining licence conditions at each of its Business Units. Internal Audit's findings in relation to water consumption reports were also considered by the Committee. Where new potential areas of risk are considered by management as part of their regular reviews of the Risk Matrix, the Committee may request further bespoke updates from management to supplement its general review of risk and internal controls. No new areas of non-financial risk were identified during 2022.\n\n## Information technology\n\nIn 2022, the Committee continued to receive updates on the Group's IT strategy, its linkage to the Group's overall business strategy and the financial implications of that strategy for the business plan. It also monitored the progress of the Pe\u00f1oles and Fresnillo management teams in developing the cybersecurity framework for the Group. Further information about the Group's approach to IT is set out on pages 131 and 143 of the Strategic Report.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and Controls continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors must satisfy themselves as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for a minimum of 12 months from the approval of the financial statements. The Committee supported the Board in this assessment by considering whether the Company has adequate liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due. In February 2023, the Committee reviewed the Group's budget and cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2024, taking into account the Company's anticipated production profiles at each mine, budgeted capital and exploration expenditure and the sensitivity of the cashflow forecasts to movements in metals prices, including stress testing those forecasts to identify the levels to which metals prices must fall to put pressure on working capital levels.\n\nThe Committee also considered EY's report on this assessment and on the reasonableness of assumptions therein, including their consistency with assumptions and estimates used elsewhere in the preparation of the financial statements. The Committee also challenged management on the feasibility of the mitigating actions and the potential speed of their implementation. Following this assessment, the Committee satisfied itself that the going concern basis of preparation is appropriate and the financial statements appropriately reflect the conclusions on going concern. The Going Concern statement is set out in the Strategic Report on page 154.\n\n## Viability assessment\n\nThe executive team has developed a comprehensive approach to the viability assessment which is then reported in the Viability Statement. The key steps of this approach are explained within the Viability Statement, which is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 153 and 154. In December 2022 the Committee received an update on the approach that the executive team proposed to adopt in preparing the Viability Statement and confirmed that there would not be any change in the scenarios which would be used for the purposes of the Viability Statement. In February 2023, it reviewed the proposed Viability Statement. It also considered the potential steps that could be taken to mitigate the cashflow impacts arising from the most negative scenarios (including delaying project capex or reducing exploration expenditure).\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Committee assists the Board in monitoring the effectiveness of the Company's internal control environment. This monitoring includes oversight of all material controls including financial, operational, regulatory and compliance. To accomplish this, there is a governance and organisational structure in place where internal control is secured by three lines of defence: process owners (1st line); committees, controllers, risk management and other oversight bodies (2nd line); and Internal Audit (3rd line). During the year, the Committee considered each of the quarterly internal control reports which were then circulated to the full Board for its review. At the end of the financial year, the Committee oversaw the annual process for monitoring the Group's system of internal controls. In this task, the Committee is directly supported by the work of the Internal Audit Team.\n\nWhile the pandemic did not present a high level of risk as in previous years, the Company continued to maintain strong health protocols and monitor Covid-19 indicators to detect, prevent and respond to any emerging risks in a timely manner. This enabled Internal Audit to conduct on-site reviews of operational processes in all units and projects safely, and Fresnillo plc continued executing important organisational programmes such as health and safety, as well as initiatives for the monitoring and management of tailings dams.\n\n## Quarterly internal control reports\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee continued to review each of the quarterly internal controls reports which were prepared and submitted to the Board at each of its regular meetings. This document specifically reports on developments in the Key Risk Indicators and the key internal control issues arising from the quarterly Internal Audit reports. From time to time, the Committee has proposed changes to those reports based on its own discussion of Internal Audit's findings.\n\n## Annual review of the system of internal controls\n\nThe Committee undertakes an annual review of the Group's system of internal controls in accordance with Provision 29 of the Code. This review aims to improve the understanding of how the various sources of assurance (through the three lines of defence) interact in the review and execution of material controls by identifying and addressing any gaps in the control framework. Consequently, once a year, the Committee oversees the review of the Group's system of internal controls through an assessment, conducted by Internal Audit, of the various sources of assurance over the execution of material internal controls. This is a comprehensive review incorporating operational management, financial management and executive management; along with the independent assessment of material risks and internal controls by Internal Audit within the third line of defence. This approach underpins assessment of the ongoing effectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls and the Committee provides oversight of this process.\n\nRemediation actions arising from the control exceptions identified throughout the year were those related to: (i) continuing to improve the effectiveness of the reporting system on water consumption, ii) enhancing operative discipline and training for safety and fortification systems, ore testing and grade validation controls and some other operational activities; and (iii) strengthening controls, training and oversight within mining processes to achieve operational efficiency and to optimise key inputs for operations.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and other senior managers were invited to meet with the Audit Committee to discuss their action plans and progress for remediating the issues identified.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board agreed that the following statement be made about the review of the system of internal control in the 2022 Annual Report.\n\nThe Board has, through the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee (at its February 2023 meeting), reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls. Following this review, the Board considers that the measures that have been or are planned to be implemented, particularly those specifically highlighted in this report, complement Fresnillo's risk management framework and are appropriate to the Group's circumstances. The Board is committed to the continued development of its internal control regime with a view to achieving and maintaining best practice levels of risk management and internal control for international mining companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.",

        "page_content": "## Related parties\n\nWith the Company's Parent Company, Pe\u00f1oles, owning just under 75% of the issued share capital of the Company (see page 213), it has and will continue to have a significant level of influence over the affairs and operations of Fresnillo. Being part of the same Group provides an opportunity to achieve synergistic operational, financial, and administrative improvements by combining the resourcing of common services that can be shared between Pe\u00f1oles and Fresnillo. Although these arrangements are beneficial to Fresnillo, the Committee performs a role in overseeing these arrangements to ensure that they continue to operate impartially.\n\nThe principal arrangements entered into between the Company and related parties and reviewed by the Committee during the year were:\n\n| The Met-Mex agreement   | As it does every year, the Audit Committee considered the reasonableness of proposed treatment and refining  charges in respect of the Met-Mex arrangements for 2022. Management circulated a paper setting out the  methodology to determine the charges, which takes industry benchmark charges and adjusts to reflect ore  composition and transport costs. The same methodology used in 2022 was used as in the previous three years.  The Committee reviewed this paper and recommended approval of the proposed charges by the independent  Directors at the Board meeting in October 2022.   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Other agreements        | There are other dealings with related parties in the ordinary course of business (e.g. insurance brokerage)  which, although not requiring approval by independent Directors, will from time-to-time be reviewed by the  Committee to ensure that the arrangements are on a reasonable arm's-length basis. During the year, the Audit  Committee reviewed the annual insurance renewal for which Grupo Nacional Provincial, S.A.B., a related party,  acted as broker.                                                                                                                              |\n\nThe Shared Services Agreement is an agreement between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles under which 24 categories of services are provided to the Company by Pe\u00f1oles. The Shared Services Agreement was renewed with effect from 1 January 2018. Internal Audit conducts reviews of approximately one-third of the services provided each year to ensure that these services are provided in accordance with the agreed KPIs. As a result, all services are reviewed by Internal Audit over a three-year cycle. Internal Audit reports to the Committee on its review of the Shared Services Agreement.\n\nAs further explained elsewhere in this Annual Report (on page 129), during 2021, the Company and Pe\u00f1oles decided to centralise certain specialised services into a single unit within Pe\u00f1oles, known as Baluarte Minero. During the year, the Committee reviewed the ongoing implications of that reorganisation on Fresnillo, taking into consideration the importance that related party transactions have in this Company and the importance of ensuring that they are in the interests of Fresnillo. The Committee was satisfied that this reorganisation had not resulted in any significant change to the working relationship between Pe\u00f1oles and Fresnillo nor generated additional costs in Fresnillo for equivalent services.",

An explanation of the process adopted in preparing the Annual Report and analysis of the basis upon which each requirement for it to be 'Fair', 'Balanced' and 'Understandable' had been met was summarised in a paper which the Board discussed at its meeting on 1 March 2023. The key features of this process were:\n\n- \u00b7 The narrative sections of the Annual Report were drafted by the members of the team with specific responsibility for the areas referred to in the sections that they prepare. The individuals involved included the Head of Investor Relations, the Head of Risk, the Head of Sustainability, the Compliance Officer and Head of Legal, Company Secretary and Mine Managers.\n- \u00b7 As narrative sections of the Annual Report were prepared, copies were circulated to Board members for review and comment. Such comments were incorporated into updated versions of the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 About a month prior to the Annual Report being approved by the Board, members of the Audit Committee and other Directors reviewed a current draft enabling them to assess whether the information was consistent with their understanding of the Company's business and the nature and content of discussions at the Board during the year. Comments were received from the Directors on most areas of the Annual Report, and these were incorporated into subsequent drafts of the Annual Report. The sections of the Annual Report which were particularly commented on included: the Operations reporting, the Sustainability Report and climate-related disclosures in particular, the presentation of information on diversity and inclusion and the presentation of health and safety information.\n- \u00b7 Suggested changes put forward by the Directors, based on knowledge obtained through Board and Audit Committee papers and discussion and other interactions with management were considered by management in preparing the final version of the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 The disclosures relating to climate change, in particular the TCFD statements, were reviewed by members of the Board to ensure that they were consistent with the approach and discussions relating to climate-related change at Board and Committee (particularly the Audit Committee and HSECR Committee) levels.\n- \u00b7 At the same time, Internal Audit undertook a review exercise of the principal non-financial numbers in the Annual Report which are extracted from the Company's operational records and their findings were appropriately reflected.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee also reviewed the Annual Report and financial statements, taking into account comments made and reports issued by EY and decided to recommend them to the Board for approval.\n\nAs a result of the above procedures, the Board considers that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\n## The Corporate Governance Report which is set out on pages 158 to 192 has been approved by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc.\n\nSigned on behalf of the Board.\n\n## Alberto Tiburcio\n\nIndependent Non-executive Director 6 March 2023",

We continue to welcome the support of our shareholders for our remuneration arrangements, and I was pleased to see that this support was again strongly demonstrated at our 2022 AGM.\n\nFor some time, however, the Remuneration Committee has been considering whether the annual bonus arrangements for our senior management team could be better aligned to our strategy. As the Company moves from a phase of rapid growth to one of consolidation, we believe that some realignment would be helpful.\n\nThe 2023 targets, performance against those targets and the basis of calculation of bonus points awarded will be disclosed in next year's report.\n\nThe Committee is recommending two changes to the existing Remuneration Policy at the 2023 Annual General Meeting, which: (i) will allow the Committee to review, and if it sees fit, increase the level of fees payable to Non-executive Directors during the lifetime of the Policy, taking account of the time commitment, responsibilities, market levels and the skills and experience required; and (ii) will give the Committee discretion to apply upward adjustments to the annual bonus in the case of outstanding personal performance which results in a significant benefit to the Company during the relevant year.\n\nIn our Remuneration Report, we continue to publish remuneration information in respect of our Chief Executive Officer as if he were a member of the Board, even though that is not the case. As ever, I am always interested to hear the views of shareholders on our approach to executive remuneration.\n\n## Our application of the Remuneration Policy in 2022\n\nDuring the year, we have applied the Remuneration Policy to executive remuneration without needing to exercise any form of discretion other than those elements of the executive bonus plan which require an element of judgement in determining outcomes for the year. The Committee has reviewed the current Remuneration Policy and, as noted above, considers that there are two areas (Non-executive Director fees and upward adjustments to the annual bonus) which should be amended, subject to shareholder approval.\n\n## Salaries and bonus\n\nLevels of salary increase for our Executive Directors and the Executive Committee continue to be aligned to the level of increase for all employees. The CEO's pay, and that of his Executive Team, was increased in line with the rest of the workforce.\n\nThe Committee decided in March 2023 that the Chief Executive Officer should not receive a bonus under the Annual Bonus Plan because his points total did not meet the minimum level at which bonuses are paid.",

Consequently, the Committee did not consider it necessary to exercise any discretion to amend the basis on which bonus payments were made during the year. Nevertheless, the Committee also considers that it will be helpful to have some flexibility in exceptional circumstances in future years to modify the KPIs to provide a fair reflection of the performance of the business during the coming years.\n\n## Committee discussions during 2022\n\nIn the last 12 months, the Remuneration Committee met three times and its discussions and decisions included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee compared to the KPIs set for 2022 and the decision not to award an annual bonus for the 2022 financial year based on the non-achievement of KPI targets.\n- \u00b7 Review of KPI targets for the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee for 2022 and 2023.\n- \u00b7 Review of the Non-executive Directors' fees.\n- \u00b7 Discussion of the review of the Committee undertaken internally.\n- \u00b7 Review and revision of the terms of reference of the Committee in response to UK regulatory developments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Remuneration Committee continues to believe that its approach to executive remuneration incentivises the right priorities for our Executive Team. I am always happy to discuss our approach to remuneration with shareholders and I hope that I will be able to attend the 2023 AGM to answer questions on this report.\n\nI would be happy to speak with any shareholders who have questions about the work of the Committee.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n## Alberto Tiburcio\n\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee",

('Pe\u00f1oles'). The Company and Pe\u00f1oles are part of the consortium known as Grupo BAL which was controlled by Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res and following his death is now controlled and directly or indirectly majority-owned by a Baill\u00e8res Family Trust, Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res being the major beneficiary. Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res and companies controlled by him hold, in aggregate 68.9% of the issued share capital (and voting rights) of Pe\u00f1oles. Pe\u00f1oles holds 552,595,191 Ordinary Shares (74.99%) of the issued share capital in the Company.\n\n## Our stakeholders and remuneration\n\nThe Committee seeks to ensure that its approach to executive remuneration matters is aligned with the interests of all of its key stakeholders.

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration report continued\n\n## Annual Report on Remuneration 2022 continued\n\n## Salary\n\nFactors considered in setting salary and workforce engagement on remuneration\n\n## Policy on the consideration of wider employment conditions and remuneration\n\nWhen setting pay and benefits for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, the Remuneration Committee takes account of pay and conditions across the Group. It will consider the overall pay increase percentage negotiated each year with employee representatives as its starting point taking account of inflation and other information supporting the annual pay award for employees.\n\nBenchmarking information on pay and employment conditions provided by Mercer, Hay Group and Data Compensation was used across the Group in determining salaries for all employee grades including senior management. These reports benchmarked salaries by reference to peer groups in mining, large companies in Mexico and internationally.\n\nThe Company negotiates salary increases with the unions annually, to take effect from 1 April each year. The agreed rates may also be used as the point of reference in setting the annual salary review for the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Executive Committee and non-unionised employees. In 2022, it was agreed that the Chief Executive Officer would receive a salary increase of 5% in 2022 in line with other employees. Consequently, the salary payable under Mr Alv\u00eddrez' service agreement is MX$1,118,930.42 per month, which excludes payments for holidays, Company-paid savings contributions, and other cash benefits.\n\n## Policy on the alignment of executive remuneration and the market\n\nReviews of the Executive Director and Executive Committee members' remuneration is conducted by Willis Towers Watson from time to time at the request of the Remuneration Committee. These enable the Remuneration Committee to validate the Company's policy towards remuneration and ensure that it is globally as well as locally competitive. The analysis evaluates the elements of base salary, short-term compensation (guaranteed payments and short-term bonus) and long-term compensation (primarily stock programmes) separately. With assistance from Willis Towers Watson, the Remuneration Committee has established a peer group which will be used to benchmark any Executive Director's and any Executive Committee member's remuneration (the 'Peer Group') to ensure that it remains within the parameters set out in the policy.\n\nThe Peer Group will be updated where necessary, to ensure that it remains an appropriate comparator group of companies.\n\n## Benchmarking\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has agreed that the Chief Executive's salary should be set within a range of 25-75% of the Peer Group for base salary. This will next be reviewed in April 2023. Since 2019, the Peer Group has consisted of the following companies.\n\n## Policy benchmarking peer group\n\n| Region     | Peer group companies                                                            |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mexico     | Grupo Mexico Leagold Mining                                                     |\n| USA/Canada | Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd Centerra Gold Hecla Mining Co. IAM Gold Newmont Goldcorp |\n| Europe     | Hochschild Mining Antofagasta                                                   |\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\n## Policy on annual bonus plan and variable remuneration\n\nIt is the Company's policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance. The Company's core strategy is one of long-term sustainable growth. Sustainable growth in mining requires the steady and safe expansion of the Group's operations through the discovery of new resources and construction, maintenance and/or expansion of new mines. No distinction is therefore made between short and long-term incentives.\n\n## Factors considered in setting the bonus\n\nThe Annual Bonus Plan includes metrics and targets which are aligned to at least one of the four main themes of the Group's strategy (see Remuneration at a glance section on pages 194 and 195).\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has set a cap on each of the KPIs (other than the Safety KPI) such that the points awarded on any KPI (other than Safety) cannot exceed 135% of the target set for that KPI at the beginning of the year.",

Membership of the latter scheme is voluntary, members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time may make contributions of 5% to the scheme.\n\nOn behalf of members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time the employing company may make contributions of 5% to the scheme. The employing company may also make additional contributions between 5-8% of salary to this plan. Members may elect to match percentages between 5-8% of salary. Executive Directors may participate the Group's pension schemes on the same basis as any other employee.\n\nMr Alv\u00eddrez is a member of the defined benefit scheme in relation to services with the Company prior to 1 July 2007. He is also a member of the defined contribution scheme. He is expected to retire at his normal retirement age of 60 years.",

The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement. The Chairman of the Company does not receive any fees for acting as Chairman other than his fees as a Non-executive Director.\n\nThe fees payable to Non-executive Directors are calculated on the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 A base fee of \u00a335,000 per annum is paid to each non-UK-based Non-executive Director to reflect the time commitment and level of involvement they are required to make in the activities of the Board as a whole.\n- \u00b7 There are no set fees for membership of any Board committees or for the chairmanship of the Board, other than as follows:\n- -The UK-based Non-executive Directors receive a higher fee, currently \u00a390,000 per annum, to reflect the additional time commitment that they make in order to travel to Board meetings in Mexico and for responsibilities as Committee members and, where appropriate, as Senior Independent Director and/or Chairman of any Committee.\n- -The Chairman of the Audit Committee will receive an additional fee of \u00a315,000 per annum.\n- -Members of the Audit Committee will receive an additional fee of \u00a35,000 per annum.\n\nThe key terms of the Non-executive Directors' letters of appointment for the directors serving at the end of the year are as follows:\n\nDate of\n\n| Director              | original letter of   appointment   | Notice period from  Director to the Company   | Duration   of term 1   | Fees p.a.   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|\n| Alejandro Baill\u00e8res   | 16 April 2012                      | 3 months                                      | 1 year                 | \u00a335,000     |\n| Juan Bordes           | 15 April 2008                      | 3 months                                      | 1 year                 | \u00a335,000     |\n| Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez      | 15 April 2008                      | 3 months                                      | 1 year                 | \u00a335,000     |\n| Fernando Ruiz         | 15 April 2008                      | 3 months                                      | 1 year                 | \u00a335,000     |\n| B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera | 11 April 2014                      | 3 months                                      | 1 year                 | \u00a335,000     |\n| Charles Jacobs        | 11 April 2014                      | 3 months                                      | 1 year                 | \u00a390,000     |\n| Alberto Tiburcio      | 4 May 2016                         | 3 months                                      | 1 year                 | \u00a350,000     |\n| Dame Judith Macgregor | 22 May 2017                        | 3 months                                      | 1 year                 | \u00a390,000     |\n| Georgina Kessel       | 7 May 2018                         | 3 months                                      | 1 year                 | \u00a340,000     |\n| Guadalupe de la Vega  | 30 May 2020                        | 3 months                                      | 1 year                 | \u00a335,000     |\n| Eduardo Cepeda        | 24 June 2021                       | 3 months                                      | 1 year                 | \u00a335,000     |\n| Hector Rangel         | 28 June 2021                       | 3 months                                      | 1 year                 | \u00a340,000     |\n\n- 1 Unexpired term: the Non-executive Directors all have rolling contracts which are subject to the annual re-election at the Annual General Meeting. The current term expires on the date of the next Annual General Meeting, but the appointment will continue after that date provided that each Director is re-elected at the AGM.\n- 2 Copies of the Directors' letters of appointment and service agreements are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.\n\n## Shareholders and remuneration\n\n## Policy on engagement with shareholders on remuneration\n\nThe composition of the Remuneration Committee has been designed to ensure that the views of the controlling shareholder (through the membership of the Chairman of the Board on the Committee) and the independent shareholders can be represented. The Remuneration Committee has considered the views of organisations such as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and the Investment Association both generally and as reported to the Company in relation to its own executive remuneration practices prior to each Annual General Meeting, when considering the Remuneration Policy and its application.\n\n## AGM voting on the remuneration report\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's approach to executive remuneration has received strong support from shareholders at every Annual General Meeting since the Company's listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2008. More than 90% of independent share votes cast on the advisory vote at each AGM have been in favour of the Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n|                           | All shares voted   | All shares voted   | Independent shares voted   | Independent shares voted   | No. of votes withheld   |\n|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Year                      | For                | Against            | For                        | Against                    |                         |\n| 2019: Remuneration Policy | 99.45%             | 0.55%              | 95.72%                     | 4.28%                      | 269,961                 |\n| 2019: Remuneration Report | 99.41%             | 0.59%              | 96.99%                     | 3.01%                      | 15,761                  |\n| 2020: Remuneration Report | 99.56%             | 0.44%              | 97.75%                     | 2.25%                      | 11,231                  |\n| 2021: Remuneration Report | 99.33%             | 0.67%              | 96.08%                     | 3.92%                      | 1,369,347               |\n| 2022: Remuneration Policy | 97.94%             | 1.76%              | 89.21%                     | 10.79%                     | 32,689                  |\n| 2022: Remuneration Report | 98.24%             | 2.6%               | 90.77%                     | 9.23%                      | 34,737                  |",

Such information is taken into account when considering Executive Committee remuneration. Willis Towers Watson advises the Remuneration Committee on executive remuneration matters from time to time. During 2022 the Group paid Willis Towers Watson US$nil (2021: US$nil). All of the consultants that the Group uses are independent of the Company and each of the Directors. No remuneration consultants are directly engaged by the Remuneration Committee itself.\n\nThe Company Secretary ensures that the Remuneration Committee fulfils its duties under its terms of reference and arranges regular updates to the Remuneration Committee on relevant regulatory developments in the UK. The Group Human Resources Department provides information on Mexican market trends and compensation structures for the broader employee population in the Fresnillo Group.\n\n## Additional information on remuneration\n\n## Share price performance\n\nAs required by the Regulations, the following graph sets out the performance of the Company's share price since its listing compared to the FTSE 100 Index. As the Company was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index for most of the year, this is deemed to be the most appropriate index for comparative purposes for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chief Executive Officer's service agreement\n\nDuring the year, Mr Alv\u00eddrez served as Chief Executive Officer but was not a member of the Board. Mr Alv\u00eddrez is employed under a contract of employment with Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of Fresnillo plc. Mr Alv\u00eddrez' contract commenced on 15 August 2012 and is governed by Mexican Federal Labour Law. Mr Alv\u00eddrez' service agreement does not have a fixed term and may be terminated in writing by either party. There is no provision in Mr Alv\u00eddrez' service agreement entitling him to additional compensation for termination other than those required by Mexican labour laws for termination without cause. No benefits are payable on termination.\n\nUnder his service agreement, Mr Alv\u00eddrez is entitled to 26 working days' paid holiday per year. He is not entitled to profit-sharing (PTU). Mr Alv\u00eddrez is also entitled to life insurance, the use of a chauffeur and company car, the payment of medical insurance premiums covering limited expenses and check-ups, meals and subsistence payments and club subscriptions.\n\n## Total remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe total remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer for the past nine years, in US dollars, has been as follows:\n\n| Year ending 31 December                         | 2013    | 2014   | 2015   | 2016   | 2017   | 2018    | 2019   | 2020    | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|--------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Total remuneration US$'000s                     |         |        |        |        |        |         |        |         |        |        |\n| Octavio Alv\u00eddrez                                | 1,116   | 1,217  | 1,166  | 1,111  | 1,072  | 886     | 1,164  | 939     | 975    | 916    |\n| Percentage change on previous year              | (41.5%) | 9.1%   | (4.2%) | (4.7%) | (3.5%) | (10.7%) | 31.4%  | (19.3%) | 3.8%   | 6.1%   |\n| Proportion of maximum bonus paid to CEO in year |         |        |        |        |        |         |        |         |        |        |\n| Octavio Alvidrez                                | 33.33%  | 33.33% | 33.33% | 66.66% | 33.33% | Nil%    | Nil%   | 20.83%  | Nil%   | Nil%   |",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration report continued\n\n## Appendix: proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis part of the Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the proposed new Remuneration Policy of the Company and has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 ('the Regulations'). The Remuneration Committee has assessed the criteria recommended by provision 40 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and believes that the Policy has always been inherently clear, simple, designed to avoid excessive rewards, predictable and proportionate. The proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy are: (i) to allow the Board to review, and if it sees fit, increase the level of fees payable to Non-executive Directors during the lifetime of the Policy, without further recourse to its shareholders; and (ii) to give the Remuneration Committee discretion to apply upward adjustments to the annual bonus in the case of outstanding personal performance which results in a significant benefit to the Company during the relevant year. The new Policy will be applied for the financial years ending 31 December 2023 onwards. It will be put to a vote at the 2023 Annual General Meeting and, if approved, the effective date of the policy will be the date of the 2023 Annual General Meeting of the Company. A copy of the Company's existing Remuneration Policy (approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM), can be found on pages 199 to 203 of the Fresnillo plc 2021 Annual Report and Accounts, which can be found on the Company's website (http://www.fresnilloplc.com/ media/533822/Proposed-Directors%E2%80%99-Remuneration-Policy-for-2022.pdf).\n\nAs required by English law, the Company's approved Remuneration Policy is binding in relation to Directors. The Company currently has no Executive Directors who would be bound by the Remuneration Policy. However, the Company will (as it has previously done) treat the Chief Executive Officer as if he were an Executive Director for the purposes of the Remuneration Policy and for reporting on his remuneration.\n\nDetails of the remuneration paid to the Chief Executive Officer for the year ended 31 December 2022 can be found in this year's Annual Report on Remuneration at page 198.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\nThe Group's Remuneration Policy seeks to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain and motivate its Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee. The retention of key management and the alignment of management incentives and the creation of shareholder value being key objectives of this policy.\n\nSetting base salaries for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee at an appropriate level is a key to managerial retention in Mexico. Therefore, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that salaries are market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies. Total compensation is set within a range around the median level for the Company's peer group within Mexico and internationally, total remuneration is benchmarked triennially to ensure that the whole remuneration package is maintained at this level over the long term. Salaries are positioned within the range according to experience and service.\n\nThe table below sets out the key elements of Executive Directors' pay set out in the Remuneration Policy (the 'Policy Table'):\n\n| Base salary                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Provides the core reward for the role | Provides the core reward for the role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Operation                             | Normally reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months starting on 1 April each year.

A scoring system is used for the plan. Each objective set for the executive at the beginning of the year is allocated a points-rating which represents a median performance target for that objective. Upper and lower thresholds are set to allow for outstanding performance and to ensure that underperformance is not rewarded. For each member of the Executive Committee (including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Vice President of Exploration and the Chief Operating Officer), a bonus is only payable if the aggregate performance equals or exceeds 100 points. Bonus payments are paid for aggregate performance against target at or above 100 points are made on a prorated basis between two months' salary paid for the achievement of 100 points and six months' salary paid for the achievement of 115 points or more, as follows:\n\n## Number of points:\n\n100.0\n\n100.01-115.00\n\n115.01+\n\n## Months' salary paid\n\nTwo months' salary\n\nProrated on a linear basis between two months' salary and six months' salary\n\nSix months' salary\n\nThe maximum percentage of salary payable as an annual bonus to an Executive Director is 50% (six months' salary) and is paid where the Executive Director achieves 115.01 points or more under the Annual Bonus Plan (the target is 100 points).\n\nThe KPI targets set out in the previous table will apply and are intended to focus on risks that are within the control and influence of management. Thus, the management of safety, security, project, human resource, exploration teamwork, synergies, community and environmental risks are all currently implicitly covered within the KPIs. The KPIs and targets, which are set by reference to the reserves and resources and financial metrics at the previous year end and/or set in the budget for the forthcoming financial year are also designed to ensure that both short-term objectives and the long-term development of the Fresnillo Group are given equal priority. The achievement of project milestones will be used to measure project management performance and the Committee's discretion will be applied for subjective metrics such as teamwork.\n\nDetails of the measures, targets and performance which are tested on an annual basis will be provided in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee considers that the KPIs, upon which bonuses are based, may need to evolve from year-to-year in line with the strategy and therefore it retains the discretion to make appropriate adjustments to the KPIs themselves, the bonus bands within the overall maximum and the individual KPI weightings from year-to-year.",

Information relating to the Mexican economic metrics is collated by management for the Remuneration Committee to consider.\n\nReviews of the Executive Directors' and Executive Committee members' remuneration are conducted by Willis Towers Watson from time to time at the request of the Remuneration Committee. These enable the Remuneration Committee to validate the Company's policy towards remuneration and ensure that it is globally as well as locally competitive. The analysis evaluates the elements of base salary, short-term compensation (guaranteed payments and short-term bonus) and long-term compensation (primarily stock programmes) separately. With assistance from Willis Towers Watson, the Remuneration Committee has established a peer group which will be used to benchmark any Executive Director's and any Executive Committee member's remuneration (the 'Peer Group') to ensure that it remains within the parameters set out in this Policy (see page 200 of the Annual Report on Remuneration). The Peer Group will be updated where necessary, to ensure that it remains an appropriate comparator group of companies.\n\n## The consideration of wider employment conditions and remuneration\n\nWhen setting pay and benefits for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, the Remuneration Committee takes account of pay and conditions across the Group. It will consider the overall pay increase percentage negotiated each year, with employee representatives as its starting point taking account of inflation and other information supporting the annual pay award for employees. Subject to the 10% limit in the Policy Table, the Remuneration Committee may agree pay increases above or below the agreed percentage in exceptional circumstances, where in its discretion it considers such variance to the norm to be justified. Other than the Willis Towers Watson report specifically commissioned by the Remuneration Committee, the same benchmark reports are used in the evaluation of executive and employee remuneration, thus providing a common approach to both.\n\nBelow Board level, a statutory profit-sharing arrangement (PTU) is operated which in some years has enabled employees to receive significant levels of bonus in line with the increased profitability of the relevant employing company. The Chief Executive Officer does not participate in a PTU scheme within the Fresnillo Group. Members of the senior management group below Board level are employed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S.A. de C.V. or Operaciones Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which pay annual PTU payments. However, such payments are modest.\n\nThe Group operates two pension schemes: (i) a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members on 1 July 2007 with benefits frozen at this date for existing members, subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index; and (ii) a defined contribution scheme (which was introduced on 1 July 2007). Membership of the latter scheme is voluntary, members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time may make contributions of 5% to the scheme.\n\nOn behalf of members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time the employing company may make contributions of 5% to the scheme. The employing company may also make additional contributions between 5-8% of salary to this plan. Members may elect to match percentages between 5-8% of salary.\n\nExecutive Directors may participate in the Group's pension schemes on the same basis as any other employee.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee does not consult with employees in setting Directors' remuneration. Engagement with employees as a stakeholder group is primarily the responsibility of the Board; however, where appropriate, the Remuneration Committee will consider any relevant feedback from employees to the Board in relation to remuneration matters when discharging its responsibilities under this Policy.\n\n## Engagement with shareholders on remuneration\n\nThe composition of the Remuneration Committee has been designed to ensure that the views of the controlling shareholder (through the membership of the Chairman of the Board on the Committee) and the independent shareholders can be represented. The Remuneration Committee has considered the views of organisations such as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and the Investment Association both generally and as reported to the Company in relation to its own executive remuneration practices prior to each Annual General Meeting, when considering the Remuneration Policy and its application. Following the Company's AGM in 2023, details of votes cast for and against the resolutions to approve the proposed remuneration policy and Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2023, will be announced to the market.",

        "page_content": "## Policy on recruitment\n\nThe Remuneration Committee will consider the remuneration of new Executive Directors by reference to the Policy Table set out above. The Remuneration Committee will not, as a matter of standard practice, pay sign-on payments or compensate new Directors for any variable remuneration forfeited from any employment prior to joining the Board. However, it may choose to do so in exceptional circumstances, when it considers this to be in the best interests of the Company (and therefore shareholders), in which case any buy-out payments will not exceed the remuneration relinquished and will mirror (as far as possible) the delivery mechanism, time horizons and performance requirements attached to that remuneration. Where possible this will be facilitated through the Company's existing Annual Bonus Plan, as set out in the Policy Table above, but if not, the Remuneration Committee may fulfil this requirement in line with the provisions of 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the value of any 'sign-on' and/or 'buy-out' payments will not count towards the limits on Annual Bonus in the Policy Table above. Any such payments will be fully explained in the next Annual Report on Remuneration both as to the reason for payment and the rationale for the quantum.\n\nSalary will be set so as to be market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies and taking account of the experience and seniority of the appointee coming into the new role. The Remuneration Committee is likely to set base salaries below median on appointment while retaining discretion to award increases during the first and, possibly, subsequent years to bring salaries into the normal range expected for Executive Directors, in line with the Company's stated Policy. Such increases will not exceed the maximum level set out in the Policy Table. New Executive Directors will receive benefits and pensions in line with the Company's existing policy and will be able to participate in the Annual Bonus Plan on a pro-rated basis for the portion of the financial year for which they are in post. The maximum level of variable pay for new recruits will be the same as that set out in the Policy Table for existing employees (pro-rated as necessary).\n\nIn the case of an internal appointment or promotion, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed to pay out according to its original terms stipulated on grant or adjusted as considered desirable to reflect the new role.\n\nWhere appropriate to recruit, promote or transfer individuals to a different location of residence, the Remuneration Committee may also, to the extent it considers reasonable, approve the payment of one-off relocation and repatriation related expenses. It may also pay or make a contribution towards any legal fees appropriately incurred by the individual in connection with their employment by the Group.\n\n## Policy on loss of office\n\nOther than in circumstances of gross misconduct, Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer, leaving employment from the Group, will be entitled to receive salary and pro-rated annual bonus based on performance to the date of leaving. Statutory entitlements are payable according to Mexican labour law, based on length of service. Employee and Company pension contributions are payable in accordance with the applicable pension plan rules. Mexican labour law does not make any provision for employers and employees to give or receive notice of termination of employment. Therefore, the Committee will not generally make payments in lieu of notice to departing executives. However, the Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation), or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an Executive Director's office or employment or by way of contribution to legal fees appropriately incurred by the individual in connection with the termination of their employment by the Group. No contractual commitments concerning loss of office were entered into with any Director prior to 27 June 2012.\n\n## Annual bonus plan and policy on variable remuneration\n\nIt is the Company's policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance. The Company's core strategy is one of long-term sustainable growth. Sustainable growth in mining requires the steady and safe expansion of the Group's operations through the discovery of new resources and construction, maintenance and/or expansion of new mines. No distinction is therefore made between short and long-term incentives.\n\nThe Company operates a single cash-based Annual Bonus Plan for Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer as described in the Policy Table above. In the event of a change of control, the Remuneration Committee shall, in accordance with the Annual Bonus Plan rules, as amended from time to time and in its absolute discretion, determine whether and to what extent the annual bonus will vest and be paid early. The Committee may also decide that the bonus award will vest to a greater or lesser extent having regard to the Director's or the Group's performance or such other factors it may consider appropriate. The Remuneration Committee may decide that bonus awards will vest pro-rata to take account of early vesting or in full.\n\n## Recovery of bonus\n\nThe absence of long-term incentives and the operation of Mexican law makes it difficult to adopt claw-back arrangements in order to recover bonuses that have already been paid. The Remuneration Committee has considered whether claw-back provisions should be incorporated into the service agreement for the Chief Executive Officer. Given that the Company does not operate any remuneration plans with a timeframe of more than one year, the Remuneration Committee does not consider that there is much value in introducing claw-back provisions into the contractual arrangements with the Chief Executive Officer at this stage. However, within this Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to apply malus to bonuses before they are paid where the KPI outcomes would result, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, in a bonus payment which cannot be justified by the Company's financial performance or the Executive Director's personal performance during the year (or previous years). In this case a downward adjustment to the bonus payment would be applied.",

Any such directorships must be formally notified to the Board.\n\n## Chairman and Non-executive Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in arrears. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement. Neither the Chairman nor any of the Non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company; however, each has entered into a letter of appointment with the Company.\n\n## Non-executive Directors' letters of appointment\n\nOn their initial appointment, each of the Non-executive Directors sign a letter of appointment with the Company, for an initial period of three years. The letters of appointment of serving Non-executive Directors are drafted in accordance with Provision 18 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, thus obliging them to retire at each Annual General Meeting and be subject to annual re-election by shareholders to serve for a further term of one year. The amendments have been drafted such that renewed appointment will not necessitate a new letter of appointment.\n\nThe Chairman of the Company shall not receive any fees for acting as Chairman other than his fees as a Non-executive Director. Each Non-executive Director is expected to commit a minimum of 14 days per year in fulfilling their duties as a Director of the Company.\n\nThe total fees for Non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, will not exceed the maximum stated in the Company's Articles of Association.\n\nThe level of fees is reviewed periodically and takes into account the time commitment, responsibilities, market levels and the skills and experience required. Non-executive Directors normally receive a basic fee and an additional fee for specific Board responsibilities, including chairmanship or membership of Board committees or acting as the Senior Independent Director. Additional fees may be paid to Non-executive Directors on a per diem basis to reflect increased time commitment in certain limited circumstances.\n\nExpenses incurred in the performance of non-executive duties for the Company may be reimbursed or paid for directly by the Company, as appropriate, including any tax and social security due on the expenses.\n\nNon-executive Directors may be provided with benefits to enable them to undertake their duties.\n\n## Shareholding guidelines\n\nFresnillo has not introduced share ownership guidelines. The Company does not operate share-based incentive arrangements given that the culture for incentives in the Mexican market does not favour share-based incentives. Consequently, there would be neither opportunity nor appetite for executives to build a shareholding in the Company and therefore the Remuneration Committee has not adopted any shareholding guidelines.\n\n## Payments under previous policies\n\nAny remuneration payment or benefit, or any payment for loss of office which a Director received or became entitled to under a previous Remuneration Policy or before the person became a Director (unless the payment was in consideration of becoming a director) shall lawfully be paid out under this policy, even though it may not be consistent with, or otherwise provided for under, the Policy Table set out above.",

The following is a summary of the structure, rights and restrictions of the Company's share capital:\n\nThe Company has two classes of share capital: 736,893,589 Ordinary Shares of US$0.50 ('Ordinary Shares') and 50,000 deferred shares of \u00a31.00 each ('Sterling Deferred Shares'). The Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Mexican Stock Exchange. The rights and obligations attaching to these shares are governed by UK law and the Company's Articles of Association.\n\nOrdinary shareholders are entitled to receive notice and to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. On a show of hands every shareholder present in person or by proxy (or being a corporation represented by a duly authorised representative) shall have one vote, and on a poll every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share held. The Notice of Annual General Meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the transfer of the Ordinary Shares other than:\n\n- \u00b7 the standard restrictions for a UK-quoted company set out in article 32 of the Articles of Association;\n- \u00b7 where, from time to time, certain restrictions may become imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and\n- \u00b7 pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority whereby certain Directors, officers and employees of the Company require the approval of the Company to deal in the Ordinary Shares.\n\nThe appointment and replacement of Directors is governed by the Company's Articles of Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. The Articles of Association provide that a Director may be elected by ordinary resolution of the shareholders or appointed by the existing Directors either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director, but so that the total number of Directors shall not thereby exceed the maximum in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association. At every Annual General Meeting, all Directors must automatically retire. A retiring Director is eligible for election or re-election, as applicable.\n\nSubject to the Articles, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation and any regulations as may be prescribed by special resolution of the Company, the Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company.",

| The Company was authorised by a shareholders' resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting held in May 2022 to  purchase up to 10% of its issued Ordinary Share capital. Any shares which have been bought back may be held as treasury  shares or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, thereby reducing the amount   of the Company's issued and authorised share capital. This authority will expire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting  and a resolution to renew the authority for a further year will be proposed. No shares were purchased by the Company  during the year.            |",

They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable UK law and regulations, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and regulations. In addition, the Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nNeither the Company nor the Directors accept any liability to any person in relation to the annual financial report except to the extent that such liability could arise under English law. Accordingly, any liability to a person who has demonstrated reliance on any untrue or misleading statement or omission shall be determined in accordance with section 90A and schedule 10A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.\n\n## Directors' responsibility statement under the UK corporate governance code\n\nIn accordance with Provision 27 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides information necessary to enable shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts\n\nEach of the Directors whose names are listed on pages 164 to 167 confirm that to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- a) the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- b) the Annual Report (including the Strategic Report encompassed within the 'Overview', 'Strategic Report', 'Performance' and 'Governance' sections) includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business, and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nFor and on behalf of the Board.\n\n## Alberto Tiburcio\n\nIndependent Non-executive Director 6 March 2023",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group and Parent in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 We walked through the process to confirm our understanding of management's going concern assessment process;\n- \u00b7 We confirmed that the Group is not subject to financial covenants on its borrowings, which we corroborated with borrowing agreements;\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's forecasting accuracy as reliable by comparing forecasts for the year ended 31 December 2022 to actuals and assessing the reasons for differences, including the effect of market-driven factors;\n- \u00b7 We assessed the completeness of the factors included in the going concern assessment by verifying the consistency of key assumptions with our understanding of the business and the environment within which it operates;\n\n\u00b7\n\nWe obtained management's going concern assessment, including the cash forecast for the going concern period which extends to December 2024.\n\nThe Group has modelled plausible adverse changes and applied reverse stress testing in respect of prices to the forecast liquidity of the Group;\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the factors and assumptions included in the base case and most severe adverse scenario for the cash forecast, in particular comparing forecast metals prices to analyst forecasts and comparing production forecasts to 2022 production, plant capacity and our understanding of the business and its future plans;\n- \u00b7 We considered the mitigating actions available to management, although these were not modelled due to the level of headroom in the plausible adverse cases;\n- \u00b7 We have challenged management's reverse stress testing in order to identify what reduction in metal prices, combined with an increase in operating costs, as the key variable inputs, would lead to the Group utilising all liquidity during the going concern period noting that those prices are below the minimum analyst price forecasts in the provided range for the going concern period. We also noted that management have sufficient mitigating actions available in the remote case of a scenario where both low sale prices and higher costs take place at the same time; and\n- \u00b7 We reviewed the Group's going concern disclosures included in the annual report, in both the strategic report and note 2 of the financial statements, in order to confirm that the disclosures were appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditor's report to the Members of Fresnillo plc continued\n\n## Our key observations:\n\n- \u00b7 The Directors' assessment forecasts that the Group will maintain sufficient liquidity throughout the going concern assessment period in both the base case and its plausible downside scenario in respect of prices. One of the most significant cash outflows considered in both scenarios is the repayment of US$371.9 million in respect of the 5.50% Senior Notes due November 2023.\n- \u00b7 The controllable mitigating actions available to management to increase liquidity over the going concern assessment period were not modelled by management, due to the level of headroom in management's plausible downside scenario.\n- \u00b7 Considering our challenge made in respect of the reverse stress test, management performed an additional scenario with lower prices and higher costs, and we noted that the controllable mitigating actions available to management are sufficient to allow the Company to continue operating. Our assessment is that the likelihood of this reverse stress test scenario is remote.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the period which extends to December 2024.\n\nIn relation to the Group and Parent Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Overview of our audit approach\n\n| Audit scope       | \u00b7 \u00b7   | Out of 12 components in scope, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of eight components being the six  operating mining units, the Parent Company and the entity which holds the Silverstream contract. These components represented  100% of revenues, 100% of the Silverstream revaluation effects, 96% of profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects  (Adjusted Normalised Profit) and 97% of total assets.  We performed specified procedures on certain balances at a further three components. These components represented 4% of  Adjusted Normalised Profit and 3% of total assets.   |\n|-------------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Key audit matters | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 | Recognition of related party transactions, including revenue recognition.

Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group, changes in the business environment and other factors when assessing the level of work to be performed at each company.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 15 reporting components of the Group, we selected 12 components covering entities within Mexico and Chile, which represent the principal business units within the Group.\n\nOf the 12 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of eight components ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining three components ('specified procedures scope components'), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within each component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.\n\nThe reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2021: 100%) of the Group's revenues, 100% (2021: 100%) of the Silverstream revaluation effects, 100% (2021: 99%) of the Group's Adjusted Normalised Profit, and 99% (2021: 99%) of the Group's total assets.\n\nFor the current year, the full scope components contributed 100% (2021: 100%) of the Group's revenues, 100% (2021: 100%) of the Silverstream revaluation effects, 96% (2021: 91%) of the Group's Adjusted Normalised Profit, and 97% (2021: 89%) of the Group's total assets.\n\nThe specified procedures scope components contributed 4% (2021: 9%) of the Group's Adjusted Normalised Profit, and 3% (2021: 10%) of the Group's total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group.\n\nOf the remaining three components that together represent less than 1% (2021: 1%) of the Group's Adjusted Normalised Profit and less than 1% (2021: 1%) of the Group's total assets, none are individually greater than 1% of Group Adjusted Normalised Profit. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review and testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.\n\nIn the current year we have updated our profit metric for coverage to align with the basis for determining materiality and we have restated comparatives.",

Of the eight full scope components, audit procedures were performed on two of these directly by the primary audit team. Of the three specified procedures scope components, the primary team performed audit procedures directly on one and for the other two specified procedures components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.\n\nSenior members of the component team and the Pe\u00f1oles audit team attended our virtual global planning meetings during the planning phase of the audit, and we discussed the results of interim procedures and interacted regularly with the local team in Mexico. The primary engagement team is predominantly composed of Spanish speakers to further enhance our interactions with both the component team and management.\n\nThe lifting of Covid-19 restrictions during 2022 allowed the primary team, including the Senior Statutory Auditor, to visit Mexico during both the planning and execution phases, with members of the team working with and supervising the component team in Mexico for a number of weeks over two visits. These visits involved discussion and oversight of the component team audit approach, consideration of significant accounting and auditing issues arising from their work, reviewing key audit working papers, meeting with management and attending closing meetings. In addition, members of the primary engagement team visited various mines during the year.\n\nThe primary team was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. For certain procedures, in particular areas involving significant judgement and heightened audit risk, we performed work ourselves with support where required from the component team. In other cases, we reviewed key working papers including, but not limited to, the risk areas described below.\n\nBased upon the above approach we are satisfied that we have been able to perform sufficient and appropriate oversight of our component team and the work performed by the auditor of Pe\u00f1oles relevant to our audit. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditor's report to the Members of Fresnillo plc continued\n\n## Climate change\n\nThere has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact Fresnillo plc. The Group has determined that the most significant adverse future impacts from climate change on its operations are likely to be from decarbonisation targets, carbon pricing, stringent regulations and investment trends, water availability, higher temperatures and extreme events. These are explained on pages 86-101 in the Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures and on page 152 in the principal risks and uncertainties, which form part of the 'Other information' rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated.\n\nAs explained in note 2(c) to the Group and parent company financial statements, governmental and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing, and are interdependent upon each other, and consequently financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. The degree of certainty of these changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into account when determining asset and liability valuations and the timing of future cash flows under the requirements of UK adopted international accounting standards and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Significant judgements and estimates relating to climate change have been described in note 2(c).\n\nOur audit effort in considering climate change was focused on ensuring that the effects of material climate risks disclosed on page 152 have been appropriately considered in the assessment of indicators of impairment of long-term non-financial assets and the timing and quantum of future cash flows underpinning the provision of mine closure costs and associated disclosures. We also considered whether other assets and liabilities were susceptible to material changes in measurement as a result of climate risks and opportunities. Details of our procedures and findings on the assessment of impairment indicators are included in our key audit matters below where relevant.\n\nWe also challenged the Directors' considerations of climate change in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures.\n\nBased on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter, however we have incorporated climate change considerations into our procedures over key audit matters where applicable.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter: Recognition of related party transactions, including revenue recognition \uf0a2\n\n- \u00b7 All of the Group's current year revenue from the sale of goods, being concentrates, dor\u00e9, activated carbon, slag and precipitates, excluding hedging (US$2,434.0 million; 2021: US$2,704.4 million), and a significant amount of its expenses incurred (US$143.8 million; 2021: US$168.7 million), arise from transactions with related parties. The Silverstream contract is also with a related party. These related parties are all subsidiaries of the Group's direct parent, Industrias Pe\u00f1oles (Pe\u00f1oles).\n- \u00b7 Principal transactions include the sale of goods to the Met-Mex Pe\u00f1oles refinery, administrative services received and the Silverstream contract.\n- \u00b7 There is a risk that, if not at arm's length or not reflecting the goods or services provided in the period, such transactions could be used to manipulate earnings or to distribute profits to the Group's Parent.\n- \u00b7 There is also a risk that revenues are inappropriately recognised as a result of incorrect cut-off or inappropriate measurement of product sold.\n- \u00b7 There is an ongoing focus by the Mexican tax authorities on transfer pricing as reflected by recently concluded and ongoing tax inspections. There is therefore the potential risk of tax exposures arising from related party transactions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur judgement is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year.\n\nWe have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year.\n\nRelated party transactions are disclosed in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues in note 5 and relevant accounting policies in note 2.",

These assumptions require management judgement and estimation.\n- \u00b7 The resulting valuation is sensitive to changes in future silver prices, total volume of production and the discount rate applied which may result in material revaluation effects in the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur judgement is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year.\n\nWe have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year.\n\nThe nature of the Silverstream contract and related valuation considerations are disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and the relevant accounting policies in note 2.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe performed full scope audit procedures over the valuation of the Silverstream contract at 31 December 2022 and related income statement revaluation effects. Consistent with 2021, these procedures covered 100% of the risk amount.\n\nValuation model\n\nReserves and resources and production profile of the Sabinas mine\n\nKey economic assumptions in the valuation\n\nAppropriateness and completeness of disclosures\n\n- \u00b7 In conjunction with our valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation approach and integrity of the model used by the Company to determine the fair value of the Silverstream contract under accounting standards by ensuring consistency in the methodology applied and review of formulas used in the model, corroborating key inputs to internal and external sources of evidence, as applicable.\n- \u00b7 We considered whether the valuation model required changes related to climate-related risks through our inquiries of management and our understanding of the Sabinas mine.\n- \u00b7 We made inquiries of the Sabinas mine geologist in order to understand the assumptions used in the estimation of reserves and resources and movements in the estimation in the year.\n- \u00b7 We made inquiries of management in financial and operational areas in respect of their review of the Sabinas mine plan prepared by Pe\u00f1oles, focusing on the comparisons between the current year plan and the 2021 plan.\n- \u00b7 We confirmed that the members of the Sabinas mine planning team involved in the preparation of the mine plan underpinning the Silverstream valuation have the appropriate experience to do so.\n- \u00b7 Controls over the development of the mine plan are our primary source of assurance in this respect. We therefore issued instructions to the auditor of Pe\u00f1oles to perform procedures and report to us in respect of the reserves and resources estimate and the mine plan of the Sabinas mine. These procedures detailed in the instructions included:\n- -conducting walkthroughs to confirm our understanding of Pe\u00f1oles management's processes to estimate quantities of reserves and resources and to develop the Sabinas mine plan;\n- -testing of certain key Pe\u00f1oles controls which address the risks associated with the estimation of reserves and resources quantities and the accuracy of the resulting mine plan;\n- -gaining an understanding of reasons for changes in estimates of reserves and resources in the year;\n- -assessing the professional competence, capabilities and objectivity of the Sabinas mine geologist involved in the estimation of reserves and resources quantities; and\n- -evaluating the reasonableness and appropriateness of inputs to the reserves and resources estimates and Sabinas mine plan used at 31 December 2022, by reference to external market and internal operational benchmarks.\n- \u00b7 We discussed the results of the above procedures with the auditor of Pe\u00f1oles and reviewed their key working papers.\n- \u00b7 With assistance from our valuation specialists, we challenged key economic assumptions in the valuation, including future silver prices and the discount rate applied.\n- \u00b7 This challenge included comparison to market data to consider the appropriateness of silver price and discount rate assumptions when considered together in the valuation model and analysis of the consistency of assumptions to other accounting estimates, such as recoverable amounts of mining assets.\n- \u00b7 We performed sensitivity analysis on the combination of silver price assumptions and discount rate.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the valuations specialists as an EY internal specialist.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the appropriateness and completeness of disclosures included in the notes to the financial statements and their consistency with the disclosures made in the front half of the Annual Report.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\n- \u00b7 The valuation model methodology is consistent with that used in prior periods and we consider this appropriate for the nature of this long-term derivative contract. Also, we tested the model's integrity noting no exceptions.\n- \u00b7 Our procedures confirmed that the mine plan underpinning the valuation was estimated in an appropriate way.\n- \u00b7 We demonstrated the sensitivity of the valuation in respect of economic input assumptions, mainly prices, total production and discount rates.\n- \u00b7 We concluded that the overall valuation of the contract is reasonable.\n- \u00b7 We confirmed the appropriateness and completeness of relevant disclosures in the financial statements.",

There is no impairment recorded in prior years that may be reversed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur judgement is that the level of risk in this area has increased from prior year due to the identification of impairment triggers in Fresnillo (no triggers identified in 2021).\n\nWe have considered the possible effect of climate change in the impairment trigger assessment, in line with the prior year.\n\nManagement's assessment of the judgement and estimation required is set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, with the results of management's assessment for impairment in note 13. The reserves and resources tables are presented after the Parent Company notes.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in seven components and specified procedures over this risk in one component, which covered 100% of the risk amount.\n\nIndicators of impairment and methodology used to estimate\n\nrecoverable values\n\nEstimation process for reserves and resources including external specialists engaged by management\n\nKey assumptions used in management's estimate of the recoverable values of mining assets\n\nSensitivity disclosures\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the appropriateness of sensitivity disclosures included in the financial statements in light of our other audit procedures.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the Reserves and Resources Specialists as appropriate specialists engaged by management for the purposes of auditing the reserves and resources of the Group.\n- \u00b7 We concluded that there are no indicators of impairment on the mining units, except for Fresnillo.\n- \u00b7 We consider that management's discount rates applied are lower than our independently calculated range. Consequently, we assessed the impact of using discount rates within our range and concluded that no impairment charges are required.\n- \u00b7 Based on the procedures performed, we concluded that the carrying values of mining assets, including Fresnillo, are recoverable at 31 December 2022, and that therefore no impairment charges were required.\n- \u00b7 We concluded that the sensitivity disclosures in the financial statements are appropriate given the decrease in headroom for certain assets.\n\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's identification of indicators of impairment under accounting standards and considered whether climate risks could represent indicators.\n- \u00b7 We challenged management's assessment with particular emphasis on whether inflationary pressures and increasing interest rates (and corresponding discount rates) would result in an impairment trigger by performing our own independent assessment based on inputs calculated by our valuation specialists.\n- \u00b7 We verified information from our procedures in respect of reserves and resources (as described below) to management's indicator assessment to ensure that the most recent reserves information was used.\n- \u00b7 We considered the results of our other procedures, including in respect of the mine closure provision and our analytical review procedures over production to evaluate whether there were any unidentified indicators of impairment. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, who independently assessed management's approach against industry practices, we assessed the methodology used by management to estimate the recoverable value of each mining asset for which an impairment test was performed to ensure that this is consistent with accounting standards.\n\nWe performed procedures over the estimation of reserves and resources to evaluate the extent to which we can rely on those estimates when concluding whether an indicator of impairment existed.\n\n- \u00b7 We walked through the process of the estimation of the reserves and resources quantities and tested relevant controls.\n- \u00b7 We walked through the process of determining mine plans from estimated reserves and resources quantities.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the competence of the Reserves and Resources Specialists, as well as capabilities and objectivity as specialists engaged by management to audit the Group's estimates of reserves and resources and confirmed the scope of their work was appropriate for the purpose of financial reporting. We also discussed the potential impact of climate-related matters on the estimates.\n- \u00b7 We read the reports prepared by the Reserves and Resources Specialists, gained an understanding of the changes in reserves and resources estimates in the year and considered their observations on the Group's reserve and resource estimation process insofar as they affect the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 We engaged our own specialist (geologist) to evaluate the information provided by the Reserves and Resources specialists.\n- \u00b7 We discussed directly with the Reserves and Resources specialists the results of their reports.\n- \u00b7 We compared related production profiles to the current mine plans for each mine where an impairment test was performed and considered their consistency with our understanding of future plans at the mines obtained through enquiries with both operating and senior management.\n- \u00b7 We assessed operating and capital costs included in the cash flow forecasts to ensure consistency with current operating costs, forecast mine production and other forecast information, by reviewing the cost assumptions and understanding the methodology applied by management in their budgeting process. We considered the possible effect of climate change on cost estimates.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we assessed management's assumptions relating to future metals prices and discount rates by comparing these to market data and also for consistency with other estimates used in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 We performed sensitivity analysis on management's calculated recoverable values for alternative assumptions for metals prices, costs and the discount rate applied.",

Refer to related considerations in the key audit matter above.\n\n- \u00b7 In addition, management estimates the recoverable value of exploration projects in considering the recoverable value of subsidiaries.\n- \u00b7 Changes to assumptions could lead to material changes in estimated recoverable amounts, resulting in either impairment or reversals of impairment taken in prior years (2022 aggregate net impairment of US$1,755.0 million, 2021 aggregate net reversal of US$107.6 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur judgement is that the level of risk in this area, on balance, remains consistent with the prior year.\n\nAs with the recoverable amount of mining assets, in the current year we have also considered the possible effect of climate change in the impairment trigger assessment.\n\nManagement's assessment of the judgement and estimation required is set out in note 2 to the Parent Company financial statements, with management's assessment of investments in subsidiaries included in note 5.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in one component, which covered 100% of the risk amount.\n\nIndicators of impairment and methodology used to estimate recoverable values\n\nKey assumptions used in management's estimate of the recoverable values of investments in\n\nsubsidiaries\n\nSensitivity\n\ndisclosures\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the methodology used by management to determine whether there were any indicators of impairment for each investment in subsidiaries to ensure that this is consistent with accounting standards. Refer to the 'our audit response' section of the key audit matter above with respect to procedures performed relating to the recoverable value of mining assets.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's approach to valuing exploration prospects.\n- \u00b7 Refer to the key audit matter above with respect to procedures performed relating to the recoverable value of mining assets.\n- \u00b7 We performed sensitivity analysis on management's calculated recoverable values for alternative assumptions for metals prices, costs and the discount rate applied.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the appropriateness of sensitivity disclosures included in the financial statements considering our other audit procedures.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\n- \u00b7 We confirmed that our observations with respect to reserves and resources set out in the key audit matter in respect of the recoverable amount of mining assets above are also relevant for the recoverable amounts of investments in subsidiaries.\n- \u00b7 We considered the approach to determining the recoverable value of investments in subsidiaries, including the valuation of exploration assets, to be appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Our procedures confirmed that the estimates of operating and capital costs are consistent with the production profiles of respective mines and related mine plans.\n- \u00b7 We consider that prices used in the models are reasonable.\n- \u00b7 We consider that management's discount rates applied are lower than our independently calculated range. On this basis, we have assessed the impact of using discount rates within our range on the impairment models. This resulted in an additional impairment change of US$157.7 million, which the Company adjusted for.\n- \u00b7 We concluded that the impairment and sensitivity disclosures reflected in the Parent Company financial statements is appropriate.\n\nIn the prior year, our auditor's report included a key audit matter in relation to the re-estimation of quantities held in leaching pads at Herradura. For this year's audit, we no longer consider this to be a key audit matter as the risk and extent of our related audit procedures have decreased following the reduced degree of estimation uncertainty in light of the lack of significant variations between actual and expected recovery rates since the last re-estimation.",

Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be US$21.0 million (2021: US$24.0 million), which is 5% (2021: 5%) of the five-year average profit before tax prior to Silverstream revaluation effects, adjusted for any material one-off transactions ('Adjusted Normalised Profit'). At planning, we use forecast profit figures to estimate materiality for 2022. We revisited our materiality at year end noting that actual profits for the year supported our assessment made at planning. We believe this measure of profit represents one of the main considerations for members of the Group, particularly as the Silverstream revaluation effects are principally non-cash in nature and one-off transactions are not reflective of the ongoing operations of the business.\n\nWe have concluded that, solely for the purposes of determining materiality, there are sufficient indicators to normalise the basis for determining materiality using the five year average, which is in line with the Directors' viability assessment period. An illustration of our approach to Adjusted Normalised Profit is set out below, with profit before tax prior to Silverstream revaluation effects as the starting point.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdjusted Normalised Profit used in materiality calculation\n\nExcluded one-off expense\n\nExcluded one-off income\n\nFive-year average\n\nWe determined materiality for the parent company to be US$47.1 million (2021: US$65.4 million) which is 1% (2021: 1%) of equity. The materiality of the Parent Company is higher than that of the Group, reflective of the Parent Company's primary role being that of a holding company.\n\n## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2021: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely US$16.0 million (2021: US$18.0 million). We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to the level of historical misstatements, our ability to assess the likelihood of misstatements and the effectiveness of the internal control environment.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.\n\nAssigned performance materiality decreased in all components, reflecting the overall performance of the Group. Where assigned performance materiality decreased, this represents the changes in the relative contribution of profit of that component:\n\nKey audit matters:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReflecting the fact that dividends are a key focus for shareholders and that the dividends are derived from the operating results of the Group, we apply Group materiality to our procedures around dividends, including distributable reserves.",

The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and those reports have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements;\n- \u00b7 the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 in the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules sourcebook made by the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA Rules), is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements; and\n- \u00b7 information about the Company's corporate governance statement and practices and about its administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the FCA Rules.\n\n## Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatement in:\n\n- \u00b7 the Strategic Report or the Directors' Report; or\n- \u00b7 the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the FCA Rules.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u00b7 certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u00b7 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- \u00b7 a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the Company.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nWe have reviewed the Directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group and Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 154;\n- \u00b7 Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the Company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on pages 153-154;\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meets its liabilities set out on page 154;\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 192;\n- \u00b7 Board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 189;\n- \u00b7 The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on pages 189-190; and\n- \u00b7 The section describing the work of the Audit Committee set out on pages 180-192.",

        "page_content": "## Responsibilities of Directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the Directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 214, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Company and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are those related to the reporting framework (UK adopted international accounting standards and Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code), regulations impacting mining operations including mining laws, environmental and labour regulations and tax and employee profit-sharing requirements in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of our forensics specialists, we understood how Fresnillo plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of Board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it is considered there was a susceptibility of fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included using data analytics to test manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free of fraud or error. In the current year, forensic specialists reviewed our fraud risk assessment.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved enquiries of Group management and those charged with governance, legal counsel, internal audit and the risk and compliance departments; journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and those indicating large or unusual journals based on our understanding of the business; and challenging the assumptions and judgements made by management in respect of significant accounting estimates. Where observations are raised about management's process or controls surrounding compliance with laws and regulations by us or others, we consider the potential effect of those observations.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 Following the recommendation from the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the Company on 4 May 2016 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2017 and subsequent financial periods.\n- \u00b7 The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 15 years, covering the years ending 2008 to 2022.\n- \u00b7 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## Steven Dobson\n\n(Senior statutory auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor London 7 March 2023",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 1. Corporate information\n\nFresnillo plc. ('the Company') is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 5 of the Parent Company accounts ('the Group').\n\nIndustrias Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V. ('Pe\u00f1oles') currently owns 75 percent of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baill\u00e8res family, whose beneficial interest is held through Pe\u00f1oles. The registered address of Pe\u00f1oles is Calzada Legaria 549, Mexico City 11250. Copies of Pe\u00f1oles' accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. Further information on related party balances and transactions with Pe\u00f1oles' group companies is disclosed in note 27.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2022 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 6 March 2023.\n\nThe Group's principal business is the mining and beneficiation of non-ferrous minerals, and the sale of related production. The primary contents of this production are silver, gold, lead and zinc. During 2022 and 2021 all the production were sold to Pe\u00f1oles' metallurgical complex, Met-Mex, for smelting and refining. Further information about the Group operating mines and its principal activities is disclosed in note 3.\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies\n\n## (a) Basis of preparation and consolidation, and statement of compliance\n\n## Basis of preparation and statement of compliance\n\nThe Group consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for trade receivables, derivative financial instruments, equity securities and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out above in the Strategic Review on pages 2-157. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Financial Review in pages 52-61. In addition, note 31 to the financial statements includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\nIn making their assessment of the Group's ability to manage its future cash requirements, the Directors have considered the Company and Group budgets and the cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2024 (being the going concern assessment period). The Directors have also considered the cash position as of 31 December 2022 (US$ 969.1 million) and the net current asset position (US$1,252.3 million), which includes the debt repayment due in 2023 (US$317.9 million), as described in the financial review. In addition, they reviewed a more conservative cash flow scenario with reduced silver and gold prices of US$20.0 and US$1,718 respectively throughout this period, whilst maintaining current budgeted expenditure and only considering projects approved by the Executive Committee. This resulted in our current cash and cash equivalents balances reducing over time but maintaining sufficient liquidity throughout the period.\n\nThe Directors have further calculated prices (US$18.5 and US$1,574 for silver and gold respectively), which should they prevail to the end of 2024 would result in cash balances decreasing to minimal levels by the end of 2024, without applying mitigations.\n\nShould metal prices remain below the stressed prices above for an extended period, management have identified specific elements of capital and exploration expenditures which could be deferred without adversely affecting production profiles throughout the period. Finally, management could amend the mining plans to concentrate on production with a higher margin in order to accelerate cash generation without affecting the integrity of the mine plans.\n\nPreviously, the Directors reviewed scenarios that incorporated an estimated potential impact of government-imposed stoppages due to Covid-19 restrictions. The Directors reassessed the situation in the current year, considering in particular the fact mining was declared an essential activity by the Federal Government and there have been no further stoppages at any of our mines. Furthermore, as previously reported, we have implemented additional health and safety measures at each of our mines coupled with extensive targeted and random testing. The Directors concluded that the risk of government-imposed stoppages was low and therefore disclosure of a specific Covid scenario is no longer relevant.\n\nAfter reviewing all of the above considerations, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that management have sufficient flexibility in adverse circumstances to maintain adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements set out the Group's financial position as of 31 December 2022 and 2021, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years then ended.\n\nEntities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the number of shares owned by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3.",

        "page_content": "All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity therein. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the amount attributed to such interests at initial recognition and the non-controlling interest's share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Any losses of a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions - that is, a transaction with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interest are also recorded in equity.\n\n## (b) Changes in accounting policies and disclosures\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021, except for the adoption of some amendment as follow:\n\n- \u00b7 Proceeds deducted from the cost of Property, plant and equipment.\n\nAmendments to IAS 16, 'Property, plant and equipment' prohibit a company from deducting from the cost of property, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced while the company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, a company will recognise such sales proceeds and related cost in profit or loss. This resulted in a change to the Group's accounting policies.\n\nOre generated as part of the development stage may be processed and sold, giving rise to revenue before the commencement of commercial production. Prior to 1 January 2022, where such processing was necessary to bring mining assets into the condition required for their intended use (for example, in testing the plants at the mining unit in development), revenues from metals recovered from such activities were credited to mining properties and development costs. From 1 January 2022, such revenue is recognised in profit or loss and cost of sales is measured based on operating cost once commercial production has been initiated. The adoption of this amendment did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group as there were no sales from ore processed by plants in their testing period in the years where the amendment is applicable.\n\n## New standards, interpretations and amendments (new standards) adopted by the Group\n\nOther than above, a number of new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. The Group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these standards.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective\n\nThe IASB has issued other amendments resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.\n\n## (c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These judgements and estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Judgements\n\nAreas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 are:\n\nRecognition and classification of assets at Soledad and Dipolos mine:\n\nIn 2009, five members of the El Baj\u00edo agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont ('Penmont'), submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court (Tribunal Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo, Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of the Soledad & Dipolos mine are located. The litigation resulted in a definitive court order, with which Penmont complied by vacating 1,824 hectares of land, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad & Dipolos. Whilst the claim and the definitive court order did not affect the Group's legal title over the mining concession or the ore currently held in leaching pads near the mine site, land access at the mine site is required to further exploit the concession at Soledad & Dipolos.\n\nIn addition to, but separate from, the lands mentioned above, Penmont is the legal and registered owner of the land where the Soledad & Dipolos leaching pads are located but has not yet been able to gain physical access to these pads due to opposition by certain local individuals. This land was purchased by Penmont from the Federal Government of Mexico in accordance with due legal process. The Group has a reasonable expectation that Penmont will eventually regain access to the Soledad & Dipolos assets and process the ore content in the Soledad & Dipolos leaching pads. This expectation considers different scenarios, including but not limited to potential negotiation scenarios and the different legal proceedings that Penmont has presented in order to regain access to the lands, as well as other ongoing proceedings including claims by members of the agrarian community requesting the cancellation of Penmont's property deed over this area, which claims Penmont believes are without merit. All such proceedings are pending final resolution. Therefore, the Group continues to recognise property, plant and equipment and inventory related to Soledad & Dipolos, as disclosed in note 13 and note 15, respectively. Due to the fact that it is not yet certain when access may be granted so that the inventory can be processed, this inventory is classified as a non-current asset.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\nFurthermore, claimants from the El Baj\u00edo community also presented claims against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels other than the surface land where Soledad & Dipolos is located. Penmont has had no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont. The Agrarian Court has issued rulings declaring such occupation agreements over those land parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate such lands to the state that they were in before Penmont's occupation as well as returning any minerals extracted from this area. The case relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to final conclusion. However, given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining operations or had specific geological interest in these land parcels, any contingencies relating to such land parcels are not considered material by the Group. There are no material assets recognised in respect of these land parcels at 31 December 2022 or 31 December 2021.\n\n## Layback agreement:\n\nIn December 2020, the Group entered into multiple contracts with Orla Mining Ltd. and its Mexican Subsidiary, Minera Camino Rojo, S.A. de C.V. (together herein referred to as 'Orla'), granting Orla the right to expand the Camino Rojo oxide pit onto Fresnillo's 'Guachichil D1' mineral concession. Based on the terms of the contracts, the Group will transfer the legal rights to access and mine the mineral concession to Orla.\n\nDue to the fact that the contracts were negotiated together, the Group has considered the layback contracts as a single agreement (Layback Agreement) for the purpose of determining the accounting implications of the transaction. The Group determined that the transaction should be accounted for as the sale of a single intangible asset. As such, it is relevant to consider the point at which control transfers in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 15 regarding when a performance obligation is satisfied and in light of the continuing performance obligations on the part of the Group.\n\nThe effectiveness of the agreement was subject to the approval of the Mexican Federal Competition Commission (COFECE), which was granted in February 2021. The consideration includes three payments: US$25.0 million that was paid upon the approval of COFECE, US$15.0 million that was paid in November 2022, and US$22.8 million that will be paid no later than 1 December 2023. The future amounts bear interest at an annual rate of 5%. Upon notification of approval by COFECE, the Group recognised the fair value of consideration set out in the contract (US$67.2 million, being the cash flows set out above discounted at the risk-free rate).\n\nAs set out in the Layback Agreement the Group had continued to provide support to Orla in respect of other negotiations relevant to their acquisition of the rights to access from the local ejido, thus the Company had recognised the total value of the agreement as deferred income. In December 2022 the Group successfully concluded with the support to Orla with respect to the negotiations relevant to the acquisition of the rights to access. Thus, the Company considers all the obligations established in the Layback Agreement to have been completed and has recognised the total value of the agreement in profit or loss as other income.\n\n## Juanicipio project:\n\nThe Group assesses the stage of each mine under development/construction to determine when a mine moves into the production phase, this being when the mine is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. The criteria used to assess the start date are determined based on the nature of each mine project, considering its complexity, location and other relevant factors.\n\nThe criteria to assess this date considers the level of capital expenditure compared with the estimated construction cost, the availability of ore reserves to sustain ongoing extraction, the extraction of ore from production areas and the production feasibility considering the operating resources available.\n\nWhen the production phase is considered to have commenced, all related costs are transferred from 'Construction in progress' to the relevant class of 'Property, plant and equipment'. At this stage, the capitalisation of development costs ceases, depreciation commences, and additional costs are either recognised as costs of inventories or expenses, except for those that qualify for capitalisation relating to mining asset additions or improvements, underground mine development or mineable reserve development.\n\nDuring 2021 the Group finalised the construction of the Juanicipio project. As of 1 January 2022, the mine started commercial production, while the plant commissioning activities were postponed due to delays in the connection of the plant to the national electricity grid. Consequently, the Group assessed the production start date for the mine and the plant separately. As a result, the Group determined that the Juanicipio mine started operations from 1 January 2022. During 2022 the activities necessary to connect the plant to the national electricity grid continued and in December were concluded satisfactorily. The Group has determined that as of 31 December 2022, the plant facilities are substantially complete and the commissioning process has begun. As at 31 December 2022 the plant's assets US$228.3 million are presented within property, plant and equipment and its depreciation will commence once production takes place. The costs incurred as a part of the testing of equipment prior to the connection to the power grid including employees training has been considered as unabsorbed production cost as presented in note 6.\n\n## Climate change:\n\nIn the climate disclosure in the Strategic Report, the Group's set out its assessment of climate risks and opportunities (CROs). The Group recognises that there may be potential financial statement implications in the future in respect of the mitigation and adaptation measures to the physical and transition risks. The potential effect of climate change would be in respect of assets and liabilities that are measured based on an estimate of future cash flows. The Group specifically considered the effect of climate change on the valuation of property, plant and equipment, deferred tax assets, the Silverstream contract and the provision for mine closure cost. The Group does not have any assets or liabilities for which measurement is directly linked to climate change performance (for example: Sustainability-Linked Bonds).\n\nThe main ways in which climate has affected the preparation of the financial statements are:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group has already made certain climate-related strategic decisions, such as to focus on decarbonisation and to increase wind energy. Where decisions have been approved by the Board, the effects were considered in the preparation of these financial statements by way of inclusion in future cash flow projections underpinning the estimation of the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and deferred tax assets, as relevant.\n- \u00b7 As described in note 14, the costs inherent in the Silverstream contract are determined based on the provisions of that contract. This reduces the exposure of the valuation of the asset to the effect of any cost implications related to CROs.\n- \u00b7 Further information about the potential effect of CROs on the provision for mine closure cost is set out in note 21.",

        "page_content": "The Group's strategy consists of mitigation and adaptation measures. To mitigate the impacts by and on climate change the Company relies on renewable electricity, fuel replacement and efficiency opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint. The approach to adaptation measures is based on climate models to produce actionable information for the design, construction, operation and closure of its mining assets, considering climate change. In addition, societal expectations are driving government action that may impose further requirements and cost on companies in the future. Future changes to the Group's climate change strategy, global decarbonisation signposts and regulation may impact the Group's significant judgements and key estimates and result in material changes to financial results and the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities in future reporting periods. However, as at the balance sheet date the Group believes there is no material impact on balance sheet carrying values of assets or liabilities. Although this is an estimate, it is not considered a critical estimate.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions\n\nSignificant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include:\n\nEstimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources, note 2(e):\n\nOre reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group's mining properties. Mineral resources are an identified mineral occurrence with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons relating to the geological and technical data on the size, depth, shape and grade of the ore body and suitable production techniques and recovery rates, in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code 2012. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data. The estimation of recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources is based upon factors such as geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body, estimates of commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, future capital requirements and production costs.\n\nAs additional geological information is produced during the operation of a mine, the economic assumptions used and the estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources may change. Such changes may impact the Group's reported balance sheet and income statement including:\n\n- \u00b7 The carrying value of property, plant and equipment and mining properties may be affected due to changes in the recoverable amount, which consider both ore reserves and mineral resources, refer to note 13;\n- \u00b7 Depreciation and amortisation charges in the income statement may change where such charges are determined using the unit-of-production method based on ore reserves, refer to note 13;\n- \u00b7 Stripping costs capitalised in the balance sheet, either as part of mine properties or inventory, or charged to profit or loss may change due to changes in stripping ratios, refer to note 13;\n- \u00b7 Provisions for mine closure costs may change where changes to the ore reserve and resources estimates affect expectations about when such activities will occur, refer to note 21; and\n- \u00b7 The recognition and carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes regarding the existence of such assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets, refer to note 11.\n\n## Estimate of recoverable ore on leaching pads (note 15)\n\nIn the Group's open pit mines, certain mined ore is placed on leaching pads where a solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold and enable extraction. The determination of the amount of recoverable gold requires estimation with consideration of the quantities of ore placed on the pads, the grade of the ore (based on assay data) and the estimated recovery percentage (based on metallurgical studies and current technology).\n\nThe grades of ore placed on pads are regularly compared to the quantities of metal recovered through the leaching process to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimated recovery (metallurgical balancing). The Group monitors the results of the metallurgical balancing process and recovery estimates are refined based on actual results over time and when new information becomes available. Any potential future adjustment would be applicable from the point of reestimation and would not by itself change the value of inventory and as such no sensitivity included.\n\n## Silverstream (note 14):\n\nThe valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires estimation by management. The term of the derivative is based on the Sabinas life of mine and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of estimates, including the estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources and future production profile of the Sabinas mine on the same basis a market participant would consider, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. For further detail on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative, and the impact of changes in key assumptions are included in note 14.\n\n## Income tax, notes 2 (q) and 11:\n\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses, requires management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.\n\n## Covid-19\n\nDuring 2022, the Group continued to apply measures to safeguard the health of its employees and their local communities while continuing to operate safely and responsibly. During 2022 operations have not been suspended, all mines have operated at normal production capacity. The Group incurred other production costs of US$2.7 million (2021: US$4.7 million) related to Covid-19 measures which include community support, the acquisition of additional personal protective equipment and other safety measures. These are presented in cost of sales.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, attempts at containment of Covid-19 have resulted in decreased economic activity, which has adversely affected the broader global economy. In the current environment, assumptions about future commodity prices, exchange rates, and interest rates are subject to greater variability than normal, which could in the future affect the valuation of the Group's assets and liabilities, both financial and non-financial. As at 31 December 2022, there were no material changes to the valuation of the Group's asset and liabilities as a result of Covid-19.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (d) Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Parent Company's functional currency. The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be more than one currency in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. For all operating entities, this is US dollars.\n\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined.\n\nFor entities with functional currencies other than US dollars as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in other comprehensive income. On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (e) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.\n\nThe cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item's estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and equipment used in the mine production process (except mobile equipment) or on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset that are not related to the mine production process. Changes in estimates, which mainly affect unit-of-production calculations, are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. Land is not depreciated.\n\nThe average expected useful lives are as follows:\n\n|                                           |   Years |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Buildings                                 |       8 |\n| Plant and equipment                       |      10 |\n| Mining properties and development costs 1 |       8 |\n| Other assets                              |       4 |\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising at de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is de-recognised.\n\nNon-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Assets are not depreciated when classified as held for sale.\n\n## Disposal of assets\n\nGains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed.\n\n## Mining properties and development costs\n\nPayments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project when incurred.\n\nPurchased rights to ore reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination.\n\nMining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of time in which benefits are expected to be obtained from that specific concession.\n\nMine development costs are capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment. Mine development activities commence once a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. When an exploration prospect has entered into the advanced exploration phase and sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals has been obtained pre-operative expenses relating to mine preparation works are also capitalised as a mine development cost.",

        "page_content": "The initial cost of a mining property comprises its construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property into operation, the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost, and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. The Group cease the capitalisation of borrowing cost when the physical construction of the asset is complete and is ready for its intended use.\n\nOre generated as part of the development stage may be processed and sold, giving rise to revenue before the commencement of commercial production. Where such processing is necessary to bring mining assets into the condition required for their intended use (for example, in testing the plants at the mining unit in development), revenues from metals recovered from such activities are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nUpon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate.\n\nMining properties and mine development are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any.\n\n## Construction in progress\n\nAssets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. The cost of construction in progress is not depreciated.\n\n## Subsequent expenditures\n\nAll subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of those parts that are replaced, is de-recognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.\n\n## Stripping costs\n\nIn a surface mine operation, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste material in order to gain access to the ore bodies (stripping activity). During development and pre-production phases, the stripping activity costs are capitalised as part of the initial cost of development and construction of the mine (the stripping activity asset) and charged as depreciation or depletion to cost of sales, in the income statement, based on the mine's units of production once commercial operations begin.\n\nRemoval of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a surface mine. At the time that saleable material begins to be extracted from the surface mine the activity is referred to as production stripping.\n\nProduction stripping cost is capitalised only if the following criteria are met:\n\n- \u00b7 It is probable that the future economic benefits (improved access to an ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow to the Group;\n- \u00b7 The Group can identify the component of an ore body for which access has been improved; and\n- \u00b7 The costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably.\n\nIf not all of the criteria are met, the production stripping costs are charged to the income statement as operating costs as they are incurred.\n\nStripping activity costs associated with such development activities are capitalised into existing mining development assets, as mining properties and development cost, within property, plant and equipment, using a measure that considers the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production. This measure is known as 'component stripping ratio', which is revised annually in accordance with the mine plan. The amount capitalised is subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity asset, by using the units of production method. The identification of components and the expected useful lives of those components are evaluated as new information of reserves and resources is available. Depreciation is recognised as cost of sales in the income statement.\n\nThe capitalised stripping activity asset is carried at cost less accumulated depletion/depreciation, less impairment, if any. Cost includes the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. The costs associated with incidental operations are excluded from the cost of the stripping activity asset.\n\n## (f) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## The recoverable amount of an asset\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The cash flows used to determine the recoverable amount of mining assets are based on the mine plan for each mine. The mine plan is determined based on the estimated and economically proven and probable reserves, as well as certain other resources that are assessed as highly likely to be converted into reserves. Fair value less cost of disposal is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in an orderly sale transaction between market participants. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independently of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. The Group's cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Reversal of impairment\n\nAn assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (g) Financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u00b7 those to be measured at amortised cost;\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value through OCI; and\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe classification depends on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nThe Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\n\nPurchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.\n\n## Classification\n\nThe Group holds the following financial assets:\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nThe Group's financial assets at amortised cost include receivables (other than trade receivables which are measured at fair value through profit and loss).\n\n## Equity instruments designated as fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.\n\nThe Group elected to classify irrevocably its listed equity investments under this category.\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains/(losses) in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.\n\nThe Group's trade receivables and derivative financial instruments, including the Silverstream contract, are classified as fair value through profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "## De-recognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nFor receivables (other than trade receivables which are measured at FVPL), the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nThe Group classifies its financial liabilities as follows:\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nThe Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Classification\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities held by the Group are classified as financial liabilities as amortised cost.\n\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.\n\nAmortised cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## De-recognition of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## (h) Inventories\n\nFinished goods, work in progress and ore stockpile inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method based on cost of production which excludes borrowing costs.\n\nFor this purpose, the costs of production include:\n\n- \u00b7 personnel expenses, which include employee profit sharing;\n- \u00b7 materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore;\n- \u00b7 the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore; and\n- \u00b7 related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity).\n\nWork in progress inventory comprises ore in leaching pads as processing is required to extract benefit from the ore. The recovery of gold is achieved through the heap leaching process. The leaching process may take months to obtain the expected metal recovery and mainly depends on the continuity of the leaching process. When the ore in leaching pads is in active leaching, it is classified as current. When the leaching process has stopped and not expected to restart within 12 months, ore in the leaching pads affected is classified as non-current.\n\nOperating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. An allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock. A regular review is undertaken by management to determine the extent of such an allowance.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.\n\n## (i) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (j) Provisions\n\n## Mine closure cost\n\nA provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure, restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas) based on a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and is depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations. Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value, the portion of the increase is charged directly as an expense. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## (k) Employee benefits\n\nThe Group operates the following plans for its employees based on Mexico:\n\n## Defined benefit pension plan\n\nThis funded plan is based on each employee's earnings and years of service. This plan was open to all employees in Mexico until it was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007. The plan is denominated in Mexican Pesos. For members as at 30 June 2007, benefits were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI).\n\nThe present value of defined benefit obligations under the plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year end balance sheet date. The discount rate is the yield on bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.\n\nPast service costs are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs and when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.\n\nThe defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.\n\nNet interest cost is recognised within finance cost and return on plan assets (other than amounts reflected in net interest cost) is recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.\n\n## Defined contribution pension plan\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due. The contributions are based on the employee's salary.\n\nThis plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme.\n\n## Seniority premium for voluntary separation\n\nThis unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary per year for those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service. Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service. For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary.\n\nThe cost of providing benefits for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur.\n\n## Other\n\nBenefits for death and disability are covered through insurance policies.\n\nTermination payments for involuntary retirement (dismissals) are charged to the income statement, when incurred.\n\n## (l) Employee profit sharing\n\nIn accordance with the Mexican legislation, companies in Mexico are subject to pay for employee profit sharing ('PTU') equivalent to ten percent of the taxable income of each fiscal year capped to three months of salary or average of the profit sharing paid in the last three years.\n\nPTU is accounted for as employee benefits and is calculated based on the services rendered by employees during the year, considering their most recent salaries. The liability is recognised as it accrues and is charged to the income statement. PTU, paid in each fiscal year, is deductible for income tax purposes.",

        "page_content": "## (m) Leases\n\n## Group as a lessee\n\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate;\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n- \u00b7 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- \u00b7 any initial direct costs; and\n- \u00b7 restoration costs.\n\nEach lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.\n\nVariable lease payments that are not linked to price changes due to changes in a market rate or the value of an index and are linked to future performance or use of an underlying asset are not included in the measurement of the lease liability. Such cost are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment.\n\n## (n) Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue is recognised when control of goods or services transfers to the customer based on the performance obligations settle in the contracts with customers.\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nRevenue associated with the sale of concentrates, dor\u00e9, slag, precipitates and activated carbon (the products) is recognised when control of the asset sold is transferred to the customer. Indicators of control transferring include an unconditional obligation to pay, legal title, physical possession, transfer of risk and rewards and customer acceptance. This generally occurs when the goods are delivered to the customer's smelter or refinery agreed with the buyer; at which point the buyer controls the goods. Inventory in transit to the smelter or refinery does not represent a significant proportion of total revenue at the end of the reporting period given the distance to the mine units.\n\nThe revenue is measured at the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled, being the estimate of the price expected to be received in the expected month of settlement and the Group's estimate of metal quantities based on assay data, and a corresponding trade receivable is recognised. Any future changes that occur before settlement are embedded within the provisionally priced trade receivables and are, therefore, within the scope of IFRS 9 and not within the scope of IFRS 15.\n\nGiven the exposure to the commodity price, these provisionally priced trade receivables will fail the cash flow characteristics test within IFRS 9 and will be required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss up from initial recognition and until the date of settlement. These subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in revenue but separately from revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nSales contracts with our customer establish that for products other than refined silver and gold, refining and treatment charges are deducted from revenue from sales of products. Refining and treatment charges represent an element of the cost that will be incurred by our customer in processing the products further to extract the metal content for onward sale to its customers.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (o) Exploration expenses\n\nExploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource.\n\nExploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions:\n\n- \u00b7 Cost of sales: costs relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life; and\n- \u00b7 Exploration expenses:\n- -Costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves.\n- -Costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and which are identified by project.\n- -Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufficient probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project from which time further expenses are capitalised as exploration costs on balance sheet as Property, plant and equipment.\n\n## (p) Selling expenses\n\nThe Group recognises in selling expenses a levy in respect of the Extraordinary Mining Right as sales of gold and silver are recognised. The Extraordinary Mining Right consists of a 0.5% rate, applicable to the owners of mining titles. The payment must be calculated over the total sales of all mining concessions. The payment of this mining right must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year and can be credited against corporate income tax.\n\nThe Group also recognises in selling expenses a discovery premium royalty equivalent to 1% of the value of the mineral extracted and sold during the year from certain mining titles granted by the Mexican Geological Survey (SGM) in the San Juli\u00e1n mine. The premium is settled to SGM on a quarterly basis.\n\n## (q) Taxation\n\n## Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the country the Group operates.\n\n## Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\n\nUnrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\n\n## Mining Rights\n\nThe Special Mining Right is considered an income tax under IFRS and states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities (see note 11 (e)). The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities on temporary differences arising in the determination of the Special Mining Right (see note 11).",

        "page_content": "## Sales tax\n\nExpenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax, except when the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item. The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\n\n## (r) Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nThe Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodities price which impact its financial and business transactions. Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic market conditions.\n\nSuch derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The full fair value of a derivative is classified as non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the item is more than 12 months.\n\nAny gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement as finance income or finance cost respectively.\n\nDerivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, European foreign exchange options are valued using the Black Scholes model. The Silverstream contract is valued using a Net Present Value valuation approach.\n\nThe documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 There is 'an economic relationship' between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n- \u00b7 The effect of credit risk does not 'dominate the value changes' that result from that economic relationship.\n- \u00b7 The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\nHedges which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is recorded as in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. For gains or losses related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk these are included, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reflected. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and will not be recognised in OCI for the period. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised directly as finance costs, in the income statement of the related period.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in other comprehensive income from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\nWhen hedging with options, the Group designates only the intrinsic value movement of the hedging option within the hedge relationship. The time value of the option contracts is therefore excluded from the hedge designation. In such cases, changes in the time value of options are initially recognised in OCI as a cost of hedging. Where the hedged item is transaction related, amounts initially recognised in OCI related to the change in the time value of options are reclassified to profit or loss or as a basis adjustment to non-financial assets or liabilities upon maturity of the hedged item, or, in the case of a hedged item that realises over time, the amounts initially recognised in OCI are amortised to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the life of the hedged item.\n\nWhen hedging with forward contracts, the forward element is included in the designation of the financial instrument. Therefore, there is no cost of hedging in relation to forward contracts.\n\n## (s) Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 12 or more months to get ready for its intended use or sale (a qualifying asset) are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.\n\nWhere funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds are available for a short term from funds borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (t) Fair value measurement\n\nThe Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 30 and 30 (b).\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 In the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- \u00b7 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities based on the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in note 30.\n\n## (u) Dividend distribution\n\nDividends on the Company's Ordinary Shares are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the Company's discretion. Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are declared following approval by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting.\n\n## 3. Segment reporting\n\nFor management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group has seven reportable operating segments as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The Fresnillo mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;\n- \u00b7 The Saucito mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;\n- \u00b7 The Ci\u00e9nega mine, located in the state of Durango, an underground gold mine;\n- \u00b7 The Herradura mine, located in the state of Sonora, a surface gold mine;\n- \u00b7 The Noche Buena mine, located in state of Sonora, a surface gold mine;\n- \u00b7 The San Juli\u00e1n mine, located on the border of Chihuahua/Durango states, an underground silver-gold mine; and\n- \u00b7 The Juanicipio mine, in the State of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine. 1\n- 1 The Juanicipio mine is now considered as a segment due to the commencement of its operations and its contribution to the Group's revenues and segment profit. Accordingly, the comparative segment information has been restated to reflect this change.\n\nThe operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management. As the Group's chief operating decision-maker does not review segment assets and liabilities, the Group has not disclosed this information.\n\nManagement monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and making decisions about resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included in Revenue as reported in the consolidated income statement, and certain costs included within Cost of sales and Gross profit which are considered to be outside of the control of the operating management of the mines. The table below provides a reconciliation from segment profit to Gross profit as per the consolidated income statement. Other income and expenses included in the consolidated income statement are not allocated to operating segments. Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on an arm's length basis similar to transactions with third parties.\n\nIn 2022 and 2021, all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico.",

and (ii) the deduction of exploration expenses.\n\nThese amendments were applied to tax returns from 2014 to 2021 (for the year 2021 the amendment also included Minera Penmont as the merging entity of Desarrollos Mineros Fresne) and resulted in an increase in the current corporate income tax charge of US$3.2 million and current special mining right charge of US$2.7 million and a recoverable income tax balance of US$3.2 million.This effect was offset by a decrease in deferred corporate income tax of US$3.4 million. The amendment also resulted in US$11.5 million of interest and surcharges presented in finance costs.",

current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to the same fiscal authority.\n\nBased on management's internal forecast, a deferred tax asset of US$117.7 million (2021: US$90.4 million) has been recognised in respect of tax losses amounting to US$391.6 million (2021: US$301.5 million). If not utilised, US$33.2 million (2021: US$29.5 million) will expire within five years and US$358.4 million (2021: US$272.0 million) will expire between six and ten years. Of the total deferred tax asset related to losses, US$34.4 million (2021: US$23.3 million) is covered by the existence of taxable temporary differences, the remaining US$83.3 million (2021: US$67.1 million) corresponds to Fresnillo plc which maintained a deferred net asset position. The Group has performed an assessment of the recoverability of tax losses before their expiration, thus there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.\n\nThe Group has further tax losses and other similar attributes carried forward of US$91.9 million (2021: US$72.6 million) on which no deferred tax is recognised due to insufficient certainty regarding the availability of appropriate future taxable profits. Based on the applicable tax legislation the tax losses are not subject to expire.\n\n## (d) Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries\n\nThe Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences is expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,006 million (2021: US$1,056 million).",

Income tax expense continued\n\n## (e) Corporate Income Tax ('Impuesto Sobre la Renta' or 'ISR') and Special Mining Right ('SMR')\n\nThe Group's principal operating subsidiaries are Mexican residents for taxation purposes. The rate of current corporate income tax is 30%.\n\nOn 30 December 2018, the Decree of tax incentives for the northern border region of Mexico was published in the Official Gazette, which provided a reduction of income tax by a third and also a reduction of 50% of the value added tax rate, for taxpayers that produce income from business activities carried out within the northern border region. The tax incentives were applicable since 1 January 2019 and remained in force until 31 December 2020. On 30 December 2020 and extension of the Decree was published in the Official Gazette which remains in force until 31 December 2024. Some of the Group companies which produce income from business activities carried out within Caborca, Sonora, which is considered for purposes of the Decree as northern border region, applied for this Decree tax incentives before the Mexican tax authorities, and were granted authorisation for income tax and value added tax purposes.\n\nThe 'SMR' states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities and is considered as income tax under IFRS. For the fiscal year 2021 the SMR allows as a credit the 50% of payment of mining concessions rights up to the amount of SMR payable within the same legal entity. The 7.5% tax applies to a base of income before interest, annual inflation adjustment, taxes paid on the regular activity, depreciation and amortisation, as defined by the new ISR. This SMR can be credited against the corporate income tax of the same fiscal year and its payment must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended 31 December 2022, the Group credited US$0.00 million (2021: US$11.5 million) of mining concession rights against the SMR. Total mining concessions rights paid during the year were US$24.6 million (2021: US$22.9 million) and have been recognised in the income statement within cost of sales and exploration expenses. Mining concessions rights paid in excess of the SMR cannot be credited to SMR in future fiscal periods, and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to the excess. Without regards to credits permitted under the SMR regime, the current special mining right charge would have been US$38.3 million (2021: US$64.6 million).\n\n## 12.

Borrowing costs were capitalised at the rate of 5.02% (2021: 5.02%).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe key assumptions on which management bases the recoverable value calculations of the mining assets are commodity prices, future capital requirements, production costs, reserves and resources volumes (reflected in production volumes) and discount rate.\n\nManagement considers that the recoverable value models support the carrying amounts of mining assets as at 31 December 2022. The models are most sensitive to changes in commodity price assumptions and production volumes.\n\nOther than as disclosed below, management has considered no reasonably possible change in any other key assumption above would cause the carrying value of any of its mining assets to exceed its recoverable amount.\n\nIn the absence of any changes to any of the other key assumptions, a change in the below assumptions would have the following impact as at 31 December 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 A decrease of 10% in gold and 15% in silver prices would result in an impairment charge of US$318.6 million.\n- \u00b7 A decrease of 10% in the forecasted volume of silver produced would result in an impairment charge of US$128.0 million. A decrease of 10% in the forecasted volume of gold produced would not result in an impairment charge.\n\n## 14. Silverstream contract\n\nOn 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Pe\u00f1oles through which the Group is entitled to receive the proceeds received by the Pe\u00f1oles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine ('Sabinas'), a base-metals mine owned and operated by the Pe\u00f1oles Group, for an upfront payment of US$350 million. In addition, a per ounce cash payment of $2.00 in years one to five and $5.00 thereafter (subject to an inflationary adjustment that commenced from 31 December 2013) is payable to Pe\u00f1oles. The cash payment to Pe\u00f1oles per ounce of silver for the year ended 31 December 2022 was $5.54 per ounce (2021: $5.43 per ounce). Under the contract, the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Pe\u00f1oles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver. If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces, a further payment is due from Pe\u00f1oles of US$1 per ounce of shortfall.\n\nThe Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at FVPL and classified within non-current and current assets as appropriate. The term of the derivative is based on Sabinas' life of mine which is currently 26 years. Changes in the contract's fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the asset through the receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 2022 total proceeds received in cash were US$33.4 million (2021: US$49.0 million) of which, US$4.8 million was in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2021 (2021: US$7.7 million in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2020). Cash received in respect of the year of US$28.5 million (2021: US$41.3 million) corresponds to 2.06 million ounces of payable silver (2021: 2.4 million ounces). As at 31 December 2022, a further US$8.3 million (2021: US$4.8 million) of cash receivable corresponding to 453,158 ounces of silver is due (2021: 274,237 ounces).",

This derivative has a term of over 26 years and the valuation model utilises several inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs and/or the duration of the contract. Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican peso and US dollar, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.\n\nThe estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined. The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time. Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Pe\u00f1oles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company. The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the operational mine plan, with certain amendments to reflect a basis that a market participant would consider, that is provided to the Company by Pe\u00f1oles. The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years.\n\nManagement regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs described above and determines their impact on the total fair value. The fair value of the Silverstream contract is significantly sensitive to a reasonably possible change in future silver price. the discount rate used to discount future cash flows and total recoverable resources and reserves over the life of mine. The sensitivity of these key inputs is as follows:\n\n|                        | Commodity price                       | Commodity price                                                  | Discount rate                                      | Discount rate                                                     |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Year ended 31 December | Increase/ (decrease)  in silver price | Effect on profit  before tax: increase/ (decrease) US$ thousands | Basis point  increase/ (decrease) in interest rate | Effect on profit  before tax:  increase/ (decrease) US$ thousands |\n| 2022                   | 20%                                   | 133,736                                                          | 100%                                               | (41,860)                                                          |\n|                        | (15%)                                 | (100,302)                                                        | (25%)                                              | 11,452                                                            |\n| 2021                   | 15% (15%)                             | 104,419 (104,419)                                                | 25% -                                              | (13,219) -                                                        |",

Silverstream contract continued\n\nManagement considers that an appropriate sensitivity for volumes produced and sold is on the total recoverable reserve and resource quantities over the contract term rather than annual production volumes over the mine life. Reasonably possible change in total recoverable resources and reserves quantities over the life of the mine of an increase of approximately 6% would result in an increase in the value of the contract of US$30.6 million (a reduction of 6% in reserves and resources quantity would decrease the fair value of the contract by US$30.6 million).\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated. The Sabinas mine is a polymetallic mine that contains copper, lead and zinc as well as silver, which is produced as a by-product. Therefore, changes to base metals prices (rather than the price of silver) are most relevant to the Sabinas mine production plans and the overall economic assessment of the mine.\n\nThe effects on profit before tax and equity of reasonably possible changes to the inflation rates and the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso on the Silverstream contract are not material. The Group's exposure to reasonably possible changes in other currencies is not material.\n\n## 15.

Short-term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months, depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates. Short-term deposits can be withdrawn at short notice without any penalty or loss in value.\n\n## 18. Equity\n\n## Share capital and share premium\n\nAuthorised share capital of the Company is as follows:\n\n|                                                 | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                 | 2022                | 2022                | 2021                | 2021                |\n| Class of share                                  | Number              | Amount              | Number              | Amount              |\n| Ordinary Shares each of US$0.50                 | 1,000,000,000       | $500,000,000        | 1,000,000,000       | $500,000,000        |\n| Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares each of \u00a31.00 | 50,000              | \u00a350,000             | 50,000              | \u00a350,000             |\n\nIssued share capital of the Company is as follows:\n\n|                     | Ordinary Shares   | Ordinary Shares   | Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares   | Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares   |\n|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                     | Number            | US$               | Number                              | \u00a3                                   |\n| At 1 January 2021   | 736,893,589       | $368,545,586      | 50,000                              | \u00a350,000                             |\n| At 31 December 2021 | 736,893,589       | $368,545,586      | 50,000                              | \u00a350,000                             |\n| At 31 December 2022 | 736,893,589       | $368,545,586      | 50,000                              | \u00a350,000                             |\n\nAs at 31 December 2022 and 2021, all issued shares with a par value of US$0.50 each are fully paid.

Equity continued\n\n## Reserves\n\n## Share premium\n\nThis reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value.\n\n## Capital reserve\n\nThe capital reserve arose as a consequence of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation as a result of using the pooling of interest method.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\nThis reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge, net of tax. When the hedged transaction occurs, the gain or the loss is transferred out of equity to the income statement or the value of other assets.\n\n## Cost of hedging reserve\n\nThe changes in the time value of option contracts are accumulated in the costs of hedging reserve. These deferred costs of hedging are either reclassified to profit or loss or recognised as a basis adjustment to non-financial assets or liabilities upon maturity of the hedged item, or, in the case of a hedge item that realises over time, amortised on a systematic and rational basis over the life of the hedged item.\n\n## Fair value reserve of financial assets at FVOCI\n\nThe Group has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in equity securities in OCI, as explained in note 2(g). These changes are accumulated within the FVOCI reserve within equity. The Group transfers amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are derecognised.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial information of entities with a functional currency different to that of the presentational currency of the Group.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nThis reserve records the accumulated results of the Group, less any distributions and dividends paid.\n\n## 19.

        "page_content": "As previously reported, in late 2019 the Directors became aware of a technical breach of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) whereby certain dividends paid between 2011 and 2019 (the 'Historic Dividends') had been made without having filed interim accounts in accordance with the Act. The relevant interim accounts have now been filed with the Registrar of Companies and these show that the Company had sufficient distributable reserves at the point at which each of the Historic Dividends was paid. As a matter of prudency, in 2022 the Directors put forward a resolution to shareholders in order to regularise the position. The resolution was passed at the 2021 annual general meeting. This matter will have no effect on the monies received pursuant to these dividends and will not adversely impact shareholders or the Company. The Company therefore considers the matter closed.\n\nThe Directors have proposed a final dividend of US$13.3 cents per share, which is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting and is not recognised as a liability as at 31 December 2022. Dividends paid from the profits generated from 1 January 2014 to residents in Mexico and to non-resident shareholders may be subject to an additional tax of up to 10%, which will be withheld by the Group.\n\n## 20. Interest-bearing loans\n\n## Senior Notes\n\nOn 13 November 2013, the Group completed its offering of US$800 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes due November 2023 (the 5.500% Notes). On 29 September 2020, the Group repurchased certain of its 5.500% Notes that had a carrying value of US$482.1 million for a consideration of US$543.0 million.\n\nOn 2 October 2020, the Group completed its offering of US$850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050. The proceeds were partially used to finance the repurchase mentioned above.\n\nMovements in the year in the debt recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:\n\n|                                                | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                | 2022  US$ thousands | 2021 US$ thousands  |\n| Opening balance                                | 1,157,545           | 1,156,670           |\n| Accrued interest                               | 56,475              | 56,384              |\n| Interest paid 1                                | (56,371)            | (56,370)            |\n| Amortisation of discount and transaction costs | 908                 | 861                 |\n| Closing balance                                | 1,158,557           | 1,157,545           |\n| Less - Current portion                         | 317,879             | -                   |\n| Non-current portion                            | 840,678             | 1,157,545           |\n\nThe Group has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of all outstanding Senior Notes:\n\n## Change of control:\n\nShould the rating of the senior notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control (defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or more of the common shares; the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group; starting a dissolution or liquidation process; or the loss of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Group is obligated to repurchase the notes at an equivalent price of 101% of their nominal value plus the interest earned at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor.\n\n## Pledge on assets:\n\nThe Group shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key assets). Nevertheless, the Group may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the Notes keeps the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 21. Provision for mine closure cost\n\nThe provision represents the discounted values of the risk-adjusted estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the estimated date of depletion of mine deposits. Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning, dismantling and reclamation alternatives, timing; the effects of climate change, and the discount, foreign exchange and inflation rates applied. Closure provisions are typically based on conceptual level studies that are refreshed at least every three years. As these studies are renewed, they incorporate greater consideration of forecast climate conditions at closure.\n\nThe Group has performed separate calculations of the provision by currency, discounting at corresponding rates. As at 31 December 2022, the discount rates used in the calculation of the parts of the provision that relate to Mexican pesos range from 10.08% to 10.62% (2021: range from 6.39% to 8.33%). The range for the current year parts that relate to US dollars range from 3.08% to 4.44% (2021: range from 0.57% to 1.40%).\n\nMexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to regulations in many other jurisdictions. It is the Group's intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican law, and estimated costs reflect this level of expense. The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the lives of the mines.\n\nThe provision is expected to become payable at the end of the production life of each mine, based on the reserves and resources, which ranges from one to 22 years from 31 December 2022 (3 to 24 years from 31 December 2021). As at 31 December 2022 the weighted average term of the provision is 12 years (2021: 12 years).\n\n|                                    | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                    | 2022 US$ thousands  | 2021 US$ thousands  |\n| Opening balance                    | 260,307             | 245,688             |\n| Increase to existing provision     | 23,757              | 17,078              |\n| Effect of changes in discount rate | (63,061)            | (7,821)             |\n| Unwinding of discount rate         | 15,243              | 11,622              |\n| Payments                           | (1,085)             | (879)               |\n| Foreign exchange                   | 12,046              | (5,381)             |\n| Closing balance                    | 247,207             | 260,307             |\n| Less - Current portion             | 4,827               | 3,351               |\n| Non-current portion                | 242,380             | 256,956             |\n\nThe provision is sensitive to changes in discount rates. Changes in market rates and risks not considered in the risk-adjusted cost estimates could change the discount rate. To illustrate the sensitivity of the provision to discounting, if the discount rate at 31 December 2022 decreased by 50 basis points then the provision would be US$13.0 million higher (2021: US$43.4 million). If the discount rate increased by 50 basis points then the provision would be US$12.0 million lower (2021: US$27.2 million).\n\n## 22. Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans\n\nThe Group has a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan.\n\nThe defined contribution plan was established as from 1 July 2007 and consists of periodic contributions made by each Mexican non-unionised worker and contributions made by the Group to the fund matching workers' contributions, capped at 8% of the employee's annual salary.\n\nThe defined benefit plan provides pension benefits based on each worker's earnings and years of services provided by personnel hired up to 30 June 2007 as well as statutory seniority premiums for both unionised and non-unionised workers.\n\nThe overall investment policy and strategy for the Group's defined benefit plan is guided by the objective of achieving an investment return which, together with contributions, ensures that there will be sufficient assets to pay pension benefits and statutory seniority premiums for non-unionised workers as they fall due while also mitigating the various risks of the plan. However, the portion of the plan related to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers is not funded. The investment strategies for the plan are generally managed under local laws and regulations. The actual asset allocation is determined by current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile. Within this framework, the Group ensures that the trustees consider how the asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the respective potential impact on the funded status of the plan, including potential short-term liquidity requirements.\n\nDeath and disability benefits are covered through insurance policies.",

Contingencies\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the Group has the following contingencies:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.\n- \u00b7 Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities (SAT, by its Spanish acronym) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances, the reviews may cover longer periods. As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future.\n- \u00b7 On 8 May 2008, the Company and Pe\u00f1oles entered into the Separation Agreement (the 'Separation Agreement'). This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 ('Admission'). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles so that, in the case of Pe\u00f1oles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Pe\u00f1oles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.\n- \u00b7 In 2011, flooding occurred in the Saucito mine, following which the Group filed an insurance claim in respect of the damage caused (and in respect of business interruption). This insurance claim was rejected by the insurance provider. In early 2018, after the matter had been taken to mutually agreed arbitration, the insurance claim was declared valid; however, there is disagreement about the appropriate amount to be paid. In October 2018 the Group received US$13.6 million in respect of the insurance claim, however this does not constitute a final settlement and management continues to pursue a higher insurance payment. Due to the fact that negotiations are on-going and there is uncertainty regarding the timing and amount involved in reaching a final settlement with the insurer, it is currently not practicable to determine the total amount expected to be recovered.\n- \u00b7 It is probable that interest income will be earned on the Group's outstanding income and value added tax receivable balances; however, there is no certainty that this interest will be realised until the underlying balance is recovered. Due to that uncertainty, it is also not practicable to estimate the amount of interest income earned but not recovered to date.\n\n## 27.

        "page_content": "The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values:\n\n## Option and forward foreign exchange contracts\n\nThe Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency.\n\n## Option commodity contracts\n\nThe Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option commodity contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity.\n\n## Silverstream contract\n\nFor further information relating to the valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair value of the Silverstream contract as well as the sensitivity of the valuation to the key inputs are disclosed in note 14.\n\n## Equity investments:\n\nThe fair value of equity investments is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1). These investments were irrevocably designated at fair value through OCI as the Group considers these investments to be strategic in nature. As of 31 December 2022, approximately 91.6% of the investments correspond to 9,314,877 shares (2021: 9,314,877 shares) of Mag Silver, Corp. for an amount of US$145.5 million (2021: US$146.1 million) and 5.7% of Endeavor, Inc. represented by 2,800,000 (2021: 2,800,000 shares) shares for an amount of US$9.1 million (2021: US$11.9 million). These equity investments are listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange. The prices per share as 31 December 2022 were US$15.62 (2021: US$15.69) and US$3.24 (2021: US$4.23), respectively.\n\n## Interest-bearing loans\n\nThe fair value of the Group's interest-bearing loan is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1).\n\n## Trade receivables:\n\nSales of concentrates, precipitates dor\u00e9 bars and activated carbon are 'provisionally priced' and revenue is initially recognised using this provisional price and the Group's best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery (see note 2 (n)). This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and therefore the entire related trade receivable is measured at fair value.\n\nAt each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non-observable input to this valuation.\n\n## 31. Financial risk management\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Group's principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade and other receivables, cash, equity instruments at FVOCI, interest-bearing loans, notes payable and trade payables.\n\nThe Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate and equity price risks.\n- \u00b7 Credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk.\n\nThis note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks and the Group's objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.\n\nThe Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.\n\nThe Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## (a) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Group's income or the value of its financial instruments.\n\nThe objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.\n\nIn the following tables, the effect on equity excludes the changes in retained earnings as a direct result of changes in profit before tax.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group has financial instruments that are denominated in Mexican peso and other foreign currencies which are exposed to foreign currency risk. Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar include the purchase of services, fixed assets, spare parts and the payment of dividends. As a result, the Group has financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.\n\nIn order to manage the Group's exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, the Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and derivatives financial instruments (excluding Silverstream which impact is disclosed in note 14) to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Group's profit before tax and equity, with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative financial instruments.\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Strengthening/ (weakening) of US dollar   | Effect on  profit before tax:  increase/ (decrease) US$ thousands   | Effect on equity: increase/ (decrease) US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2022                     | 5%                                        | 742                                                                 | 1,120                                                  |\n|                          | (5%)                                      | (820)                                                               | 3,610                                                  |\n| 2021                     | 10% (5%)                                  | 2,123 (1,229)                                                       | 1,251 (1,587)                                          |\n\nThe Group's exposure to reasonably possible changes in other currencies is not material.\n\n## Commodity risk\n\nThe Group has exposure to changes in metals prices (specifically silver, gold, lead and zinc) which have a significant effect on the Group's results.

Interest-bearing loans and notes payable are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount. Therefore, interest-bearing loans, notes payable and loans from related parties are excluded from the table below.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding Silverstream which impact is disclosed in note 14) to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date. There is no impact on the Group's equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Basis point  increase/ (decrease) in interest rate   | Effect on profit  before tax:  increase/ (decrease) US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2022                     | 100                                                  | 8,667                                                               |\n|                          | (25)                                                 | (2,167)                                                             |\n| 2021                     | 25                                                   | 3,088                                                               |\n\nThe sensitivity shown in the table above primarily relates to the full year of interest on cash balances held as at the year end.\n\n## Equity price risk\n\nThe Group has exposure to changes in the price of equity instruments that it holds as equity investments at FVOCI.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of equity investments at FVOCI to a reasonably possible change in market price of these equity instruments, reflecting the effect on the Group's profit before tax and equity:\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Increase/ (decrease) in equity price   | Effect on  profit before tax:  increase/ (decrease) (US$ thousands)   | Effect on equity:  increase/ (decrease) US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2022                     | 10%                                    | -                                                                     | 15,881                                                  |\n|                          | (25%)                                  | -                                                                     | (39,703)                                                |\n| 2021                     | 25%                                    | -                                                                     | 40,707                                                  |\n\n## (b) Credit risk\n\nExposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Group's ordinary course of business and is applicable to trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, the Silverstream contract and derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe Group's policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties' failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter party. The Group's financial assets are with counterparties with what the Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 27, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Group's financial assets were neither credit-impaired nor past due, other than 'Other receivables' as disclosed in note 16. The Group's policies are aimed at minimising losses from foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company's foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.\n\nThe Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty Met-Mex Pe\u00f1oles, the Group's sole customer throughout 2022 and 2021. A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract. Both Met-Mex and the counterparty to the Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Pe\u00f1oles group which currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and is considered by management to be of appropriate credit rating.\n\nThe Group's surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments investing in several financial institutions. Accordingly, on an ongoing basis the Group deposits surplus funds with a range of financial institutions, depending on market conditions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Group only deposits surplus funds with financial institutions with a credit rating of MX-1 (Moody's) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor's) and above. As at 31 December 2022, the Group had concentrations of credit risk as 35% of surplus funds were deposited with one financial institution of which the total investment was held in short-term deposits.\n\nThe maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 17 for the maximum credit exposure to cash and cash equivalents note 16 for other receivables and note 27 for related party trade and other receivables. The maximum credit exposure with relation to the Silverstream contract is the value of the derivative as at 31 December 2022, being US$511.5 million (2021: US$529.5 million).",

Management considers capital to consist of equity and interest-bearing loans, excluding net unrealised gains or losses on revaluation of derivatives financial instruments and Equity instruments at FVOCI. Refer to notes 18, 20 and 30 respectively for a quantitative summary of these items.\n\nIn order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder's capital invested in the Group management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Group's dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows, including cash flows from the Silverstream.\n\nOne of the Group's metrics of capital is cash and other liquid assets which in 2022 and 2021 consisted of only cash and cash equivalents, which details are disclosed in note 17.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Parent Company financial statements\n\n## 1. Corporate information\n\nFresnillo plc ('the Company') is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 5. The Company is a Mexican resident for taxation purposes with tax residency in Mexico City. For further information see note 4.\n\nIndustrias Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V. ('Pe\u00f1oles') currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baill\u00e8res family, whose beneficial interest is held through Pe\u00f1oles. The country of incorporation of Pe\u00f1oles is Mexico. Copies of Pe\u00f1oles' accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx.\n\nThe primary activity of the Company is as a holding company for the Fresnillo Group of companies. See note 5.\n\nThe financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2022 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 6 March 2023.\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies\n\n## (a) Basis of preparation and statement of compliance\n\nThe Company's separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and equity securities which have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$000) except when otherwise indicated.\n\nThe basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe financial position of the Company and its cash flows are set out in the balance sheet and statement of cashflows respectively. In addition, note 16 includes the Company's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\nIn making their assessment of the Company's ability to manage its future cash requirements, the Directors have considered the Company budgets and the cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2024 (being the going concern assessment period). The Directors have also considered the cash position as of 31 December 2022 (US$559.7 million) and the net current asset position (US$1,190.7 million), which includes the debt repayment due in 2023 (US$317.9 million).\n\nAfter reviewing all of the above considerations, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that management have sufficient flexibility in adverse circumstances to maintain adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\n\n## (b) Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the separated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n## New standards, interpretations and amendments (new standards) adopted by the Company\n\nA number of new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. The Company did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these standards.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective\n\nThe IASB has issued other amendments resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company. The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.\n\n## (c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These judgements and estimates are based on management's knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is in the accounting policies and the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Judgements\n\nThe area of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is:\n\n## Deferred tax asset (note 4):\n\nThe Company has recognised a deferred tax asset of US$277.7 million (2021: US$223.8 million) in respect of tax losses amounting to US$83.3 million (US$67.1 million). In accordance with the tax legislation tax losses amounting US$26.5 million (US$22.3 million) will expire in a period of four years and US$251.2 million (US$201.5 million) in a period between eight and ten years. The Company has performed an assessment of the recoverability of tax losses before their expiration, thus there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.",

        "page_content": "## Climate change:\n\nWe describe how climate-related risks and opportunities (CROs) may affect and was considered in the preparation of the financial statements in note 2(c) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the cash flows underpinning the recoverable amount of mining assets also underpin the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries holding those mining assets, the considerations set out in that note also apply to the Parent Company financial statements. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities for which measurement is directly linked to climate change performance (for example: SustainabilityLinked Bonds).\n\nAs disclosed in note 2(c) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, future changes to the Group's climate change strategy, global decarbonisation signposts and regulation may impact the Group's significant judgements and key estimates and result in material changes to financial results and the carrying values of certain of the Group's assets and liabilities in future reporting periods, which could ultimately result in material changes in the carrying value of the Company's assets and liabilities. However, as at the balance sheet date, management believes there is no material impact on the Company's balance sheet carrying values of assets or liabilities. Although this is an estimate, it is not considered a critical estimate.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions\n\nThe significant area of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the financial statements is:\n\n- \u00b7 Recoverable value of investments in subsidiaries (notes 2(e) and 5):\n\nThe Company assesses investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and the value in use. Due to the nature of the subsidiaries, the assessment of the recoverable amount is generally determined based on the net present value of future cash flows related to the subsidiaries requiring the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, reserves and resources and the associated production profiles, discount rates, future capital requirements, and productions costs. These cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The determination of that rate requires certain judgements.\n\nWhere an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge. At 31 December 2022 the Company recognised an impairment charge of US$1,755.0 million (2021: net impairment charge of US$107.6 million) resulting in a cumulative impairment relating to subsidiaries of US$3,740.7.0 million (2021: US$1,985.7 million).\n\n## (d) Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Company's financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.\n\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined.\n\n## (e) Investments in subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities which the Company controls due to it being exposed to, or having the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. Impairment charges and reversals, up to the value of the merger reserve, are reclassified from retained earnings to the merger reserve.\n\nWhen the Company increases its capital investment in or where there is a return of share capital from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised as an addition to, or return of the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established.\n\nAt each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The Company usually determines fair value based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount.\n\nWhere an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is reversed to profit or loss to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\n## (f) Financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u00b7 those to be measured at amortised cost;\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value through OCI; and\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe classification depends on the Company's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nThe Company reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\n\nPurchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.\n\n## Classification\n\nThe Company holds the following financial assets:\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses.\n\nThe Company's financial assets at amortised cost include receivables from loans granted to related parties.\n\n## Equity instruments designated as fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Company can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-byinstrument basis.\n\nGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the Company benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.\n\nThe Company elected to classify irrevocably its listed equity investments under this category.\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains/(losses) in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.\n\nThe Company's derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## De-recognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nFor loans granted to subsidiaries the Company evaluate the expecting credit loss using a one-year probability of default corresponding to the mining industry determined by a specialised financial institution and considering an appropriate severity based on the cost of capital of the Company.\n\nFor other receivables, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nThe Company classifies its financial liabilities as follows:\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.",

        "page_content": "The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Classification\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities held by the Company are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost.\n\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.\n\nAmortised cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## De-recognition of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## (g) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months.\n\n## (h) Share capital\n\nOrdinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue. The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue.\n\n## (i) Dividends receivable\n\nDividends are recognised when the Company's right to receive payments is established. Dividends received are recorded in the income statement.\n\n## (j) Income tax\n\n## Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\n## Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\n\nUnrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.",

Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (k) Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nThe Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodity prices which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n\nIn the Group's consolidated financial statements certain of these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company's stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges.\n\nAny gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement.\n\nDerivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.\n\n## (l) Fair value measurement\n\nThe Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 15 and 16.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 In the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- \u00b7 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nThe Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities based on the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in note 15.\n\n## (m) Dividend distribution\n\nDividends on the Company's Ordinary Shares are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the Company's discretion. Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are declared following approval by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting.\n\nMexican Income Tax Law establishes a 10% withholding on earnings from 2014 and thereafter, for dividends paid to foreign residents and Mexican individuals.\n\nDividends paid are not subject to income tax if paid from the Net Tax Profit Account (CUFIN). Dividends paid that exceed CUFIN are subject to an income tax payable at a rate of 30%. The tax is payable by the Company and may be credited against the normal income tax payable by the Company in the year in which the dividends are paid or in the following two years. Dividends paid from earnings previously taxed are not subject to any withholding or additional tax payment.\n\n## 3. Segment reporting\n\nSegmental information is not presented in the Company's stand-alone financial statements as this is presented in the Group's consolidated financial statements.",

The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,006 million (2021: US$1,056 million).\n\n## (c) Corporate Income Tax ('Impuesto Sobre la Renta' or 'ISR')\n\nThe Company is a Mexican resident for taxation purposes.

As a result, a cumulative impairment loss of US$3,740.7 million is recognised with respect to certain of the Company's investment in subsidiaries (2021: US$1,985.7 million).

Accordingly, the fair value is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The price assumptions used to calculate FVLCD are determined with reference analysts' consensus of long-term prices. As at 31 December 2022, the Company used long-term price assumptions of US$1,838/ounce (2021: US$1,600/ounce) and US$24.1/ounce (2021: US$21.20/ounce) for gold and silver, respectively.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nAs at 31 December 2022 management has performed a sensitivity analysis for those subsidiaries where cumulative impairment may be affected by a reasonably possible change in silver and gold prices. Management has considered a decrease in gold and silver of 10% and 15% respectively (2021: 10% gold,15% silver). The sensitivity resulted in an additional impairment on Minera Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V. of US$465.0 million (2021: US$592.9 million), Minera Mexicana la Ci\u00e9nega, S.A. de C.V. US$91.4 million (2021; US$149.5 million), Minera Saucito, S.A. de C.V. US$133.0 million (2021: US$205.3 million). Minera San Juli\u00e1n, S.A. de C.V. US$131.7 million (2021: nil) and Minera Penmont, S. de R.L. de C.V. US$189.2 million (2021: nil).\n\nAdditionally, as at 31 December 2022 management has performed a sensitivity analysis for those subsidiaries where cumulative impairment may be affected by a reasonably possible change in future production and operating costs considering in isolation each input. Management has considered a decrease in future production of 10% and an increase in operating costs of 8%. These sensitivities resulted in an additional impairment on Minera Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V. of US$262.0 million and 132.9 million respectively, Minera Saucito, S.A. de C.V. of US$72.8 million and 30.7 million respectively and Minera Penmont, S. de R.L. de C.V. US$188.4 million and US$82.8 million respectively.\n\nOther than as disclosed above, management has considered that the fair value of the investments in subsidiaries are not significantly sensitive to reasonably possible change in any other key assumptions.",

Movements in this reserve during 2022 and 2021 represent the impairment losses and reversals of the carrying value of Fresnillo's investments in subsidiaries transferred from retained earnings.\n\n## Fair value reserve of financial assets at FVOCI\n\nThe Company has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in equity securities in OCI, as explained in note 2(f). These changes are accumulated within the FVOCI reserve within equity. The Company transfers amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are derecognised.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nThis reserve records the accumulated results of the Company, less any distributions and dividends paid.\n\n## 9.

The proceeds were partially used to finance the repurchase mentioned above.\n\nMovements in the year in the debt recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:\n\n|                                                | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December    |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                | 2022  US$ thousands | 20221  US$ thousands |\n| Opening balance                                | 1,157,545           | 1,156,670            |\n| Accrued interest 1                             | 56,475              | 56,385               |\n| Interest paid                                  | (56,371)            | (56,370)             |\n| Amortisation of discount and transaction costs | 908                 | 860                  |\n| Closing balance                                | 1,158,557           | 1,157,545            |\n| Less - Current portion                         | 317,879             | -                    |\n| Non-current portion                            | 840,678             | 1,157,545            |\n\nThe Company has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of all outstanding Senior Notes:\n\n## Change of control:\n\nShould the rating of the senior notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control (defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or more of the common shares; the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group; starting a dissolution or liquidation process; or the loss of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Company is obligated to repurchase the notes at an equivalent price of 101% of their nominal value plus the interest earned at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor.\n\n## Pledge on assets:\n\nThe Company shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key assets). Nevertheless, the Company may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the Notes keeps the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets.\n\n## 11. Contingencies\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the Company has the following contingencies:\n\n- \u00b7 The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.\n- \u00b7 Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities (SAT, by its Spanish acronym) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances, the reviews may cover longer periods. As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future.\n- \u00b7 It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future inspections that may be initiated. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Company has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.\n- \u00b7 On 8 May 2008, the Company and Pe\u00f1oles entered into the Separation Agreement (the 'Separation Agreement'). This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 ('Admission'). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles so that, in the case of Pe\u00f1oles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Pe\u00f1oles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.",

Financial instruments continued\n\nThe following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values:\n\n## Option and forward foreign exchange contracts\n\nThe Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency.\n\n## Option commodity contracts\n\nThe Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity.\n\n## Equity investments\n\nThe fair value of equity investments is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1). These investments were irrevocably designated at fair value through OCI as the Company considers these investments to be strategic in nature. As of 31 December 2022, approximately 91.6% of the investments correspond to 9,314,877 shares (2021: 9,314,877 shares) of Mag Silver, Corp. for an amount of US$145.5 million (2021: US$146.1 million) and 5.7% of Endeavor, Inc. represented by 2,800,000 (2021: 2,800,000 shares) shares for an amount of US$9.1 million (2021: US$11.9 million). These equity investments are listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange. The prices per share as 31 December 2022 were US$15.62 (2021: US$15.69) and US$3.24 (2021: US$4.23), respectively.\n\n## Interest-bearing loans\n\nFair value of the Company's interest-bearing loan, is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1).\n\n## Loans with related parties\n\nFair value of the Company's loan to related party is determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market interest rates at each reporting date.\n\n## 16. Financial risk management\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Company's principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade and other receivables, equity investment at FVOCI, cash, available-for-sale financial assets, loans to related parties, interest-bearing loans and trade payables.\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks.\n- \u00b7 Credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk.\n\nThis note presents information about the Company's exposure to each of the above risks and the Company's objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework.\n\nThe Company's risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.\n\nThe Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\n## (a) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the Company income or the value of its financial instruments.\n\nThe objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services, payment or receipt of dividends and other items. As a result, the Company has financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.",

These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to hedge against precious metals commodity price exposure in its subsidiaries.\n\nThe table below reflects the aggregate sensitivity relating to changes in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts of financial assets and liabilities, reflecting the impact on the Company's profit before tax with all other variables held constant. There is no impact on the Company's equity other than the effect on profit before tax.\n\n|                        | Increase/(decrease) in commodity prices   | Increase/(decrease) in commodity prices   | Increase/(decrease) in commodity prices   | Increase/(decrease) in commodity prices   | Effect on profit                                 |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Year ended 31 December | Gold                                      | Silver                                    | Zinc                                      | Lead                                      | before tax:  increase/ (decrease)  US$ thousands |\n| 2022                   | 10%                                       | 20%                                       | 20%                                       | 15%                                       | -                                                |\n|                        | (10%)                                     | (15%)                                     | (15%)                                     | (15%)                                     | -                                                |\n| 2021                   | 10% (10%)                                 | 15% (15%)                                 | 25% (15%)                                 | 15% (15%)                                 | 2,707 (4,861)                                    |\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments. The Company's earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating element of the loans with related parties and interest earned on cash balances. Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount. Therefore, interest-bearing loans and loans from related parties (for which exposure is not material) are excluded from the table below.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date. There is no impact on the Company's equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Basis point  increase/ (decrease)  in interest rate   | Effect on profit  before tax:  increase/ (decrease)  US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2022                     | 100                                                   | 15,108                                                               |\n|                          | (25)                                                  | (3,777)                                                              |\n| 2021                     | 25                                                    | 1,911                                                                |",

Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Company's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter party. The Company's financial assets are with counterparties that the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 12, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Company's financial assets were neither credit-impaired nor past due other than 'Related party accounts receivables' as is disclosed in note 12. The Company's policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency and commodity hedging contracts. The Company's foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.\n\nThe Company's surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in several financial institutions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of M-1 (Moody's) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poors) and above, and only for periods of less than three months.\n\nThe maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 15 (a) for the maximum credit exposure for other financial assets, note 7 for cash and cash equivalents and note 12 for related party balances.\n\n## (c) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.\n\n|                                                 | Within 1 year   | 2-3 years   | 4-5 years   | > 5 years   | US$ thousands Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2022                          |                 |             |             |             |                       |\n| Interest-bearing loans                          | 374,249         | 75,973      | 75,973      | 1,723,686   | 2,249,881             |\n| Derivatives financial instruments - liabilities | 487             | -           | -           | -           | 487                   |\n| Trade and other payables                        | 1,249           | -           | -           | -           | 1,249                 |\n\n|                                                 | Within 1 year   | 2-3 years   | 4-5 years   | > 5 years   | US$ thousands Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2021                          |                 |             |             |             |                       |\n| Interest-bearing loans                          | 56,370          | 412,236     | 75,973      | 1,761,672   | 2,306,251             |\n| Derivatives financial instruments - liabilities | 3,885           | -           | -           | -           | 3,885                 |\n| Trade and other payables                        | 1,049           | -           | -           | -           | 1,049                 |",

Management considers capital to consist of equity and interest-bearing loans, as disclosed in the balance sheet and equity investments at FVOCI. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder's capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Company's dividend policy aims to pay out 33-50% of profit after tax each year, while making certain adjustments to exclude non-cash effects in the income statement. Dividends are paid in the approximate ratio of one-third as an interim dividend and two-thirds as a final dividend. Before declaring a dividend, the Board carries out a detailed analysis of the profitability of the business, underlying earnings, capital requirements and cash flow. The Company aim is to maintain enough flexibility to be able to react to movements in precious metals prices and seize attractive business opportunities.",

Ore Reserves are reported at variable cut-off value based on metal price assumptions, metallurgical recovery assumptions, mining costs, processing costs, G&A costs, sustaining capital costs, and variable trucking costs.\n- \u00b7 JORC Code was used for reporting of Ore Reserves.\n- \u00b7 NSR values are calculated as:\n- -NSR = 29.54*Au+0.42*Ag+15.16*Pb+13.40*Zn. Units Au (g/t), Ag (g/t), Pb (%), Zn (%).\n- -NSR factors are based on metal prices of US$1,450/oz Au, US$18.50/oz Ag, US$0.90/lb Pb, and US$1.15/lb Zn and estimated recoveries of 73.21% Au, 85.83% Ag, 86.63% Pb, and 76.10% Zn.\n- -Payable metal assumptions for Au are 95% for lead concentrates, 98% for precipitate, and 65% for zinc concentrate; for Ag: 95% for lead concentrates, 97% for precipitate, and 70% for zinc concentrate. Lead 95% payable and zinc 85% payable.\n- -The all-inclusive stope operating cost for longhole stope and cut-and-fill stope is US$101/tonne and US$109/tonne respectively (265 g/t AgEq based on weighted average for mining method). The marginal stope cut-off value is US$81.3/tonne.\n- -The stope hangingwall and footwall dilution (ELOS) was included in the stope optimisation process. The dilution thickness for stope hangingwall and footwall varies by mining methods.\n- -An additional operational mucking dilution of 0.5 m for longhole and cut-and-fill stopes is applied to the reserve calculation. An extra endwall dilution for longhole stope is 0.50 m.\n- -Mining recovery factors range from 95% for longhole stopes to 98% for cut-and-fill stopes. Mining recovery factors for ore drive development is 99%. Mining recovery factors for sill pillars and rib pillars are 10% and 0%, respectively.\n- -Exchange rate of 20.5 MXP to US$1.\n- -The Mineral Reserves were estimated by Fresnillo. Gary Methven.

These calls come from fraudsters operating in 'boiler rooms', mostly based abroad. While high profits are promised, those who buy or sell shares in this way usually lose their money. Most victims are experienced investors, losing on average \u00a320,000.\n\n## Protect yourself\n\nIf you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted shares, inflated prices for shares you own, or free company or research reports, take these steps before handing over any money:\n\n- 1. Get the name of the person and organisation.\n- 2. Check the Financial Services Register at www.fca.org.uk/register to ensure they are authorised.\n- 3. Use the details on the Financial Services Register to contact the firm.\n- 4. Call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there are no contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.\n- 5. Search the list of unauthorised firms and individuals to avoid doing business with.\n- 6. REMEMBER: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!\n\nIf you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares, you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.\n\n## Report a scam\n\nIf you are approached about a share scam you should tell the FCA using the form at www.fca.org.uk/scams (where you can also review the latest scams) or call the Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.\n\n## If you have already paid money to share fraudsters then contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.\n\n## For further information, please visit our website:\n\nwww.fresnilloplc.com or contact:\n\nFresnillo plc\n\nTel: +44(0)20 7399 2470 Gabriela Mayor, Head of Investor Relations",

        "page_content": "## Forward-looking statements\n\nThis document includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, 'forward-looking statements'. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms 'believes', 'estimates', 'plans', 'projects', 'anticipates', 'expects', 'intends', 'may', 'will', or 'should' or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy, plans, objectives, goals, future events or intentions. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this document and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Group's intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, the Group's results of operations, financial position, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the silver and gold industries. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances.\n\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results of the Group's operations, financial position and liquidity, and the development of the markets and the industry in which the Group operates, may differ materially from those described in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this document. In addition, even if the results of operations, financial position and liquidity, and the development of the markets and the industry in which the Group operates are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this document, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. A number of factors could cause results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, general economic and business conditions, industry trends, competition, commodity prices, changes in regulation, currency fluctuations (including the US dollar and Mexican peso exchange rates), the Group's ability to recover its reserves or develop new reserves, including its ability to convert its resources into reserves and its mineral potential into resources or reserves, changes in its business strategy, political and economic uncertainty.\n\nForward-looking statements may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. Any forward-looking statements in this document speak only as of the date of this document, reflect the Group's current view with respect to future events and are subject to risks relating to future events and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to the Group's operations, results of operations, growth strategy and liquidity. Investors should specifically consider the factors identified in this document which could cause actual results to differ before making an investment decision. Subject to the requirements of the Prospectus Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules or applicable law, the Group explicitly disclaims any obligation or undertaking publicly to release the result of any revisions to any forward-looking statements in this document that may occur due to any change in the Group's expectations or to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrinted on material from well-managed, FSC \u00ae certified forests and other controlled sources.
