Since then, Japan has experienced many difficult periods and dramatic societal changes, such as the Great Kanto Earthquake, defeat in war, and the advance of motorization. Yet with our purpose, 'To protect customers and society in times of need,' as our foundation throughout our history, we have confronted societal challenges through our core insurance business and strived to provide solutions. It could be said that all of our business activities contribute to addressing societal challenges. Our employees work under the premise of 'The more Tokio Marine grows, the better for society.' As a result, we are confident in our continued ability to achieve sustained profit, while providing value to all our stakeholders, including customers, society, shareholders, and our employees.\n\nIn 2021, we clearly defined the next generations as an addition to the above stakeholders, based on the strong belief that we have a responsibility to pass on our shared natural environment to the next generation in a sustainable state. Of course, it is not an easy task to continuously provide value to all stakeholders. But the optimal solution is always there, waiting to be found. With this conviction, and our unwavering purpose in mind, we will continue working towards a sustainable society while addressing ever-more complex societal challenges. As a result, we will achieve growth for the Company and continue to provide value to all our stakeholders.\n\n## \u25b6FY2022 Performance\n\nNet Premiums Written\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Environment Awareness\n\nToday, 144 years since our founding, we have grown into a global company, and more than half of Group profits originate from overseas operations. For us, the issues occurring today\u0336 wherever in the world\u0336are not simply someone else's problems.\n\nNatural catastrophes are intensifying alongside climate change. The war in Ukraine has been prolonged, further rupturing our world. Under the situation, the global supply chain continues to be reconfigured and economic security is reassessed, all at tremendous speeds. Against this backdrop, inflation is rising rapidly around the globe. The bankruptcy of some U.S. financial institutions demonstrates the tightening of monetary policy, and there is increased risk of an economic downturn. VUCA is deepening across all fields, including political, economic, and social, making it harder to outlook the future in a few weeks' time , let alone months.\n\nWithin this business environment, and in contrast to fiscal 2021, when we posted record profits, fiscal 2022 was affected by temporary factors such as natural catastrophes including typhoons and hurricanes, and COVID-19. These had a negative impact of 173.1 billion yen, a 23% year-on-year drop, and we finished at 444 billion yen. However, insurance exists to support customers in times of need. To this end, we look at fiscal 2022 as a year when we faced many moments of truth. In those moments, we demonstrated the value of our existence. Through these experiences, we believe without a doubt that we will bounce back even stronger moving forward.\n\nIn fact, net premiums written, one of the benchmarks of client confidence in our business, saw a year-on-year increase of 15%, rising to 4.4 trillion yen despite the pandemic. Also, our normalized base profit, which excludes one-time factors, saw a year-on-year increase of 22%, rising to 617.1 billion yen. This past year gives us confidence that our underlying capabilities are stronger and will continue to be stronger as we evolve and grow.\n\nAdjusted Net Profit (normalized basis * )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*: Natural catastrophes are normalized to an average annual level. Excluded in 2021 are the impact of COVID-19; capital gains in North America, etc.; and capital gains from sale of business-related equities (for part of sale exceeding 100 billion yen). In addition, 2022 excludes the war in Ukraine and South African floods.",

We start with the premise that something will occur somewhere on the globe, and then, by managing those risks, we ensure sound business. It is our imperative in running our business that no matter the circumstances, we always keep our promises to our customers.\n\nTo achieve our goals at a high standard, it is very important to diversify risk across the globe.\n\nGlobal risk diversification, the strong foundation that supports Tokyo Marine's stable management and growth, cannot be built overnight. Over these past 15 years, we have allocated capital gained from the sale of business-related equities to M&A, thereby increasing overseas insurance risk that has a low correlation with Japanese non-life risk. This approach has brought profit growth while curbing risk growth.\n\nOur large acquisitions began with Kiln in the United Kingdom back in March 2008, followed by Philadelphia Insurance (PHLY) in the United States (December 2008), Delphi (DFG) (May 2012), HCC (October 2015), and Pure (February 2020). Simultaneously, we aggressively invested in emerging markets and pursued bolt-on acquisition to bolster our existing businesses. On the other hand, we have identified and divested certain businesses with a forward-looking view to optimize the business portfolio.\n\nEven in years when we saw large-scale natural catastrophes and the COVID-19 pandemic, our global risk diversification has helped to keep the bottom-line impact to under 30%\u0336although we are not yet satisfied with this level. Calculated diversification effect currently stands at 47%, and we aim to implement more initiatives that further diversify our risk profile.\n\nIn addition, we have built and are steadily evolving our unique strength of global Integrated Group Management.\n\nThrough M&As, we have acquired very 'Good Companies' that fit with our corporate culture and continue to grow. Yet for Tokio Marine, our greatest achievement is welcoming talent with great expertise and knowledge. Social challenges and risks, including climate change and healthcare, continue to grow and become more complex around the world. At Tokio Marine, we intend to accurately identify these challenges, create solutions, and manage the risks. We will also balance growth and governance to a high degree. Such capabilities are required now, and we will assign appropriate talent in areas where they can address challenges and exercise our collective global expertise. This is a powerful form of corporate diversity, and it enables us to improve the quality, accuracy, and speed of our management decision-making.\n\nWe are in our eighth year of global Integrated Group Management, and by increasing the number of non-Japanese executive officers and appointing deputy CxOs, we continue to evolve. We are also seeing results reflected in quantitative terms. For example, we now offer our Japanese clients insurance products that leverage the expertise of HCC (currently TMHCC) and Kiln (currently TMK) based in the United States and in Europe. We have earned higher investment returns by allocating Group assets to U.S.-based Delphi (DFG), which has industry-leading expertise in asset management. These Group level synergy discussions are happening organically among Group Company and the synergy effect is now valued at $470 million, increasing the unique value of the Group.\n\nNow, it is important to firmly address societal challenges, such as climate change, disaster resilience, and healthcare, by leveraging our strengths in global risk diversification and global Integrated Group Management. In doing so, our local entities in 47 countries and regions throughout the world, including Japan, will benefit from the unwavering trust of our local stakeholders.\n\nThe harder we work, the more Tokio Marine can give to our world and people. This, in turn, will allow us to realize a sustainable society more effectively, and ultimately, we too will grow in a more sustainable way. In my introduction, I touched on our purpose, and we will continue to spread the foundational initiatives rooted in our purpose across the entire Group throughout the globe.\n\nNaturally, it goes without saying that upgrading our own capabilities is essential if we are to address new social challenges. With our purpose as our foundation, we will bolster internal capital, which includes human and intellectual capital, as well as collaborate with external partners (social capital), and create a cycle of business activities and solutions to societal challenges. This is how we will steadily refine our strengths and strategies and galvanize our problem-solving capabilities. We continue to place importance on this approach, and it is our endless challenge to continue this cycle.\n\nWe already have a number of initiatives running to bolster internal capital, namely promoting and instilling diversity and inclusion and leveraging interactive AI. Our officers (CHRO on human capital, CDO on intellectual capital) will introduce these themes in more detail, so I would like to highlight just one point. I would like to introduce our latest human capital initiative, the TLI (Tokio Marine Group Leadership Institute), and this is not just because I have a long career background in HR. The TLI, established in April 2023, is a program that aims to continuously and globally nurture group-level management leaders with a deep understanding of Tokio Marine Group's purpose. There are three core points. First, fully leverage the Japanese and global talent data collected thus far, and sophisticatedly link the TLI with our talent management framework. Second, management teams in Japan and abroad are committed to passing down their vision and experiences directly to the next generation, that is, passing on the baton of our spirit\u0336our purpose\u0336which lives on in Tokio Marine Group. Third, gather the global wisdom of talent development of Group Company HR sections and collaborate to foster our prospective leaders on\n\na global scale. As we go forward, we will position the TLI at the center of group-level management leader development to build our own systematic program.\n\nRegarding collaborative creation with our external partners and in terms of disaster resilience, development of comprehensive disaster prevention and mitigation solutions will finally start in Japan this summer. This is led by CORE, a disaster prevention consortium which transcends industry boundaries. By combining the strengths, data, and know-how of participating companies, our aim is to provide end-to-end solutions for the value chain in the disaster prevention and mitigation fields. These span from ascertaining the current situation in disaster-affected areas to rebuilding daily lives, including the use of insurance. In the United States, and in tandem with the University of Hawaii, we are exploring ways to mitigate risk for deteriorating condominiums. In China, we set up a health\n\nconsortium to develop cross-industry healthcare solutions that extend the healthy life expectancy of Chinese citizens. These seeds are only just sprouting, but they will grow into trees and eventually a forest. It is very encouraging to see these initiatives accelerate, not only in Japan but also around the world. I believe that the continuation of these efforts, including the strengthening of internal capital, will be the engine that propels Tokio Marine's sustainable growth for the next 100 years.\n\n## \u25b6Tokio Marine Group\u029fs Approach to Value Creation\n\nExpanded version: pp. 8,9\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "1\n\n## Steadily Moving toward the Realization of the Society and the Group We Envision\n\nAs a result of carrying out our strategies, for fiscal 2023, we forecast adjusted net income of 670 billion yen and adjusted ROE of 17.1%. Fiscal 2023 is the final year of our current Mid-Term Business Plan, and we expect to finish significantly higher than what we set out in the initial plan (adjusted net income of approximately 480 to 540 billion yen and adjusted ROE of approximately 12%). We believe that the numbers prove our capabilities, and they are steadily increasing.\n\nAs I have explained on various other occasions, we believe that business profit growth and shareholder returns should be consistent. With that in mind, we set the fiscal 2022 regular dividend at 100 yen per share, as planned at the beginning of the year. For the fiscal 2023 regular dividend, we intend to increase it by 21 yen from the previous year to 121 yen, and raise our dividend payout ratio to 50%. This represents twelfth consecutive year of a dividend increase.\n\nThis 670 billion yen profit plan for fiscal 2023 would be record high profit, but our management acknowledges that it is only a checkpoint\u0336a milestone in our journey to fulfill our vision to achieve a sustainable society where everyone can live safely and securely, and embrace challenges, and a milestone in our journey to fulfill our purpose or long-term goal to be a global\n\n## \u25b6The Tokio Marine Group\u029fs Future Vision\n\ninsurance group with sustainable growth by providing safety and security to customers around the world.\n\nSo, the question is, just how much will our profits grow? Currently, we are working to announce in May 2024, our next Mid-Term Business Plan (FY2024-2026). With an even longer perspective, following three points have been determined: (1) Continue to achieve world-class EPS growth (currently at approx. +5-7%) through organic growth\n\n(2) Raise ROE to be on a par with European and American peers, and expand equity spread\n\n(3) Increase shareholder returns as a result of the above\n\nOf course, it goes without saying that in achieving these financial targets, it is also essential to achieve our non-financial targets, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and a higher representation of female directors and auditors. As such, we have set non-financial KPIs to address the social challenges that the Company faces for our own sustainable growth. For example, climate change. As highlighted in the TCFD section (pp. 72-85), climate change will lead to larger and more frequent natural disasters, which could seriously impact claims payment and business continuity. Accordingly, our own initiatives for carbon neutral are a major premise for Tokio Marine. As a responsible insurance company, institutional investor, and global corporation, we actively engage with customers in their effort to transition towards zero carbon society, with the goal to have insurance clients and investees achieve net zero by fiscal 2050.\n\nExpanded version on pp. 10,11\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In Closing\n\nIn closing, allow me to reiterate my commitment as the CEO of Tokio Marine Group.\n\nOnce again, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of our shareholders and investors for the support which makes it possible for Tokio Marine to continue our business activities\u0336thank you. As mentioned earlier, this is a once-in-a-hundred-year tipping point, rocked by uncertainty in global affairs and facing large-scale managerial and business environment changes. Our business is no exception. In the face of these issues, we need to act as pioneers, proactively taking action to create the future, rather than simply responding to changes.\n\nWe often host meetings where we discuss serious issues in a relaxed environment with the aim of reiterating our purpose and culture\u0336we call this 'Majikirakai.' Here, I often address our employees with the following ideas: 'Think deeply and challenge what you can change in your day-to-day work. What can you leave for your successors and the next generation?; What can you do to reach out and connect with the future?' and 'Tokio Marine must become a company that values those who get five hits in 20 at bats with a batting average of .250, rather than two hits in three at bats and a batting average of .666. Instead of setting a limit for yourself, I want you to go up to the batter's box and swing as many times as you can.'\n\nA young employee in his 30s turned his attention to a niche market, which was not easy to access for Tokio Marine & Nichido. With the aim of creating alliances across various business partners to provide tailored insurance products and services, we created Tokio Marine X Small-Amount Short-Term Insurance Co. Ltd. The company is an example of 'standing in the batter's box and swinging the bat' and exemplifies our determination to 'keep swinging.' In a digitally centered niche market, it is important to quickly learn and move forward through repeated trial and error. Therefore, we chose small-amount, short-term insurance for the company, as it combines life and non-life insurance and facilitates agile product development.\n\nSmall-amount, short-term insurance is subject to a maximum handling of 5 billion yen in insurance premiums. From a Group-wide perspective, the impact of this new business is small. Nonetheless, as long as it is aligned with our purpose, I want to acknowledge our employees to challenge. The team is very diverse and made up mostly of members in their 20s and 30s, with a mix of gender and a variety of careers. I do not want them to be bound by\n\nLeveraging digital technologies to create new insurance value\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTeam Members of Tokio Marine X Small-Amount Short-Term Insurance (Commenced business in March 2023) Kohei Miyatani (President), third from the left\n\nYoung employees in their 20s restructure the London branch, which was in financial crisis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMembers\u00a0of\u00a0Tokio\u00a0Marine\u00a0London\u00a0Branch\n\nFront\u00a0center,\u00a0Kenkichi\u00a0Kagami,\u00a0and\u00a0front\u00a0far\u00a0left,\u00a0Hachisaburo\u00a0Hirao\n\n(future\u00a0Minister\u00a0of\u00a0Education)\n\nPhotograph\u00a0taken\u00a0around\u00a01898\n\nconventional thinking but rather to have a flexible mindset as they drive the business forward.\n\nIf you compare these two pictures on this page, you might think that Tokio Marine has always been supported by the young generation. However, last year, I formed the 'CEO Team' that includes non-Japanese officers, with the aim of enhancing management decision-making. This year, I established the Global Communications Department to further enhance internal and external communication. I personally will not cease to take on new challenges. There are not any role models, prototypes, or right answers in our search for our unique management style. However, as Group CEO, I am happy to take the lead and continue swinging the bat. We are in uncharted waters, and predicting even a little further ahead is not easy. However, the whole Group works together for high cadence of hypotheses testing cycle to plan and execute a seamless growth strategy.\n\nFrom the outset, insurance is a 'people's business.' As Group CEO, it is my job to nurture a culture and a climate that allows our staff to pour their passion into fulfilling our purpose. I place the utmost importance on this as I execute my responsibilities.\n\nBy continuing to serve our customers and society, we as a Company will continue to sustainably grow and increase our corporate value. This is the business management style that I want to achieve, and I am determined in my cause. I want you to keep the Company actively working, and I intend to build a future that meets everyone's expectations. Please accept my appreciation, and I kindly ask for your continued support.",

New social challenges unlike any we have ever faced are appearing. We are now in an era where what seemed like common sense in the past no longer applies. It is precisely because of this complex era that our business domains and areas of activity in the risk and underwriting business continue to expand.\n\nThere are many social challenges and domains that we would like to help address, but as far as the world and insurance companies are concerned, the immediate challenges are the advancement of climate change countermeasures, improved disaster resilience, and supporting healthy and enriched lives. The first is climate change. The numerous adverse effects of climate change, which include the intensification of natural disasters, threaten the safety and security of people's everyday lives and are starting to hinder the sustainable development of society. As a responsible insurance company, institutional investor, and global enterprise, Tokio Marine stands ready to face this challenge head-on.\n\nNext, improved disaster resilience. The intensification of natural disasters is already severe. As a company that was founded in Japan\u0336a country prone to natural disasters\u0336 Tokio Marine has long been contributing to improved disaster resilience as our very purpose. As natural disasters intensify, in addition to protecting our customers and local communities in their times of need, we will strengthen and expand our business into the domains of pre- and post-incident insurance events, such as disaster prevention/mitigation and early recovery/prevention of recurrence. Through this, we will contribute to the improved resilience of society as a whole.\n\nFinally, supporting healthy and enriched lives. As we prepare for the coming era of the 100-year life, the risks of prolonged periods of poor health and the depletion of assets during our life spans are becoming more serious. We will support this era of the 100-year life by providing higher-added-value products and services that combine life and non-life insurance, and by supporting corporate health and productivity management.\n\n1\n\nPurpose Story 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, as Japan is an island nation, there are high hopes that offshore wind power could be its trump card in its effort to shift to renewable power sources as a main source of energy.\n\n*1 Compared to pre-Industrial Revolution levels\n\n## To Achieve Our Vision\n\n## 1. As an Insurance Company\n\nTo advance the spread of renewable energy, it is essential to establish an environment where suppliers feel comfortable investing in such business and can carry out their operations with peace of mind. One of our entities is GCube, a leading underwriting player in the global renewable energy field. GCube has access to accident data on a wide range of renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and hydro, as well as LC and LP* 1 expertise. Through the provision of insurance products and services, risk consulting, and claims services that leverage this high-level expertise, we are supporting the development of renewable energy.\n\nAs for Japanese offshore wind power, for example, construction work at sea is not easy, and it is especially important to be prepared for typhoons. In providing insurance products and consulting for risks unique to Japan's offshore wind power generation, we are able to leverage Tokio Marine's experience and accident data from our insurance business in Japan, as well as GCube's loss prevention know-how, which is gained from a track record of underwriting numerous offshore wind power projects in Europe. *1 LC/LP are abbreviations for Loss Control (accident mitigation) and Loss Prevention (accident prevention).\n\n## 2. As an Institutional Investor\n\nAs an institutional investor, we support the development of companies that are advancing GX. For example, in 2023, we made a commitment to invest in a forest fund. By lengthening periods between deforestation and by improving forest operation and management (such as tree planting) we are contributing to an increased amount of GHG absorbed by forests. Through investment in Japan's first blue bond* 2 in 2022, we invest in and are supporting environmentally sustainable fisheries and aquaculture businesses.\n\n## As an Insurance Company and Institutional Investor\n\nThrough the theme of environmental engagement, as a responsible insurance company and institutional investor, we support our customers' corporate innovation and transition toward decarbonization and carbon neutrality.\n\nAs an insurance company, we engage with a wide range of over 250 business partners.* 3 For more than 120 of these companies, we leverage our advanced underwriting and risk management know-how to provide proposals and support to address the challenges of corporate decarbonization. For example, for one corporate customer that plans to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 and has started developing and looking into new technologies, we presented various proposals (participation in demos, prototype risk underwriting, loss prevention, etc.) related to the risk reduction of new technologies.\n\n## 3. As a Global Company\n\nOur Group has reduced GHG emissions related to business activities by 34% compared with fiscal 2015 (2022 results). We did this by switching to electricity generated from renewable sources, purchasing electric vehicles for company use, reducing utility usage, and more. We have been planting mangroves since 1999 and are steadily increasing the amount of GHG absorption and fixation. As a result, in fiscal 2022 we achieved carbon neutrality for the 10th consecutive year.\n\nOur Group also participates in various international climate-related initiatives, conducting surveys, research, and advocacy. For example, at\n\nAs of the end of March 2023, our group balance of sustainability-related investments and loans increased by approximately 109 billion yen.  We will continue supporting enterprises that are driving GX forward across a wide range of fields.\n\n*2 Bonds that raise funds for businesses involved in marine protection.\n\nWe contribute to the acceleration of GX-related customer initiatives as an institutional investor through engagement that considers the non-financial information of investment and loan customers.\n\nOf course, in our climate change policy, we also share our thoughts on divestment (details on p. 83). However, we are not fulfilling our responsibilities just by divesting. While divestment is sometimes necessary, we are closer to corporate customer transition through engagement. 'How can we contribute to the realization of a net-zero society?' While considering this question alongside our customer businesses, we want to contribute to the decarbonization and carbon neutrality of all society. *3 FY2022 results\n\nthe Geneva Association, an insurance industry think tank composed of chairpersons and CEOs from approximately 70 insurance companies worldwide, we co-chaired the working group 'Climate Change and Emerging Environmental Issues' and lead surveys and studies on 'Climate Change and the Environment,' an important issue for the insurance industry. As a TCFD member involved in the founding of the TCFD Consortium in Japan, as well as giving recommendations, we contributed to the spread and promotion of climate-related information.\n\n## \u25b6Upward Spiral of Our Social Value and Economic Value (image)\n\nThe more work we do, the more our social value increases.

In fact, the global economic losses from natural disasters in 2022 amounted to some $313 billion, a level higher than the average since 2000. Within that, the amount of insurance claims paid (industry estimate) for Hurricane Ian in the United States was approximately $52.5 billion, second only to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. While the severity of natural disasters has thus become more pronounced, losses not covered by insurance (the protection gap) still stands at 58%. Closing this protection gap is critical in improving disaster resilience.\n\nThe protection gap is partly due to factors on the customer side, such as customers feeling that they do not need to be insured or cannot afford it. However, the gap can also be attributed to supply-side issues, such as\n\n## \u25b6Growing Global Economic Losses (by natural disaster type)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: 2023 Weather, Climate and Catastrophe Insight, Aon\n\nrisk being too great or uncertain for insurance companies to provide coverage or companies insufficiently explaining the necessity of coverage to customers. An example can be seen with earthquake insurance in Japan. The risk was thought so great that it was difficult for private non-life insurance companies alone to underwrite it, and for a long time no insurance existed. But a public-private joint insurance system was established following the major earthquakes that occurred in the 1960s. Thus, the protection gap is an issue that requires action not only by insurances companies but also by governments, research institutions, and local communities around the world. In other words, industry, academia, government, and citizens worked together to determine what is best and how to tackle the issue.\n\n*1 Cumulative from 2020 onward\n\n## \u25b6Protection Gap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: 2023 Weather, Climate and Catastrophe Insight, Aon\n\n## Our Vision for Tokio Marine\n\nIn addition to protecting our customers in their times of need, by expanding our insurance business into the domains of pre- and post-insurance events such as disaster prevention, mitigation, early recovery, and prevention of\n\nrecurrence, we intend to evolve into a partner that always provides support. We are working to build a resilient world that coexists with the risks of natural disasters.\n\n## Achieving Our Vision\n\n## 1. As a Partner Who Always Provides Support\n\nInsurance claims payment is the most important function of an insurance company, but this alone does not mean that we adequately support our customers. Overall, it would be preferable if disasters did not happen. When they do, the less damage and the quicker the recovery, the better. And they should not reoccur. Our Group also strives to provide peace of mind in preand post-disaster insurance events, including disaster prevention, mitigation, early recovery, and prevention of recurrence. Rather than only paying insurance claims in times of need, by evolving into a partner that always supports customers, we will earn customer recognition and reduce our loss ratio.\n\nAs for disaster prevention and mitigation, for example, we believe that we can provide even better products and services not only by leveraging our own capabilities but also by working with leading companies in various industries. In November 2021, we launched CORE, the Disaster Prevention Consortium,\n\n## 2. Always Be There in Times of Need\n\nFire insurance is an essential type of insurance that protects customers from natural disasters. Due to the intensification of natural disasters in recent years, this line of business is constantly in the red. If we are entrusted with valuable capital from our shareholders, we should not tolerate sloppy accounting just because overall business is in the black\u0336and it is unsound from the perspective of fairness to policyholders. In addition to improving our own\n\nbusiness efficiency (cost reduction, etc.), we will work together as a Group to flexibly revise premium rates and products and optimize reinsurance to make fire insurance sustainable and in order to always support customers and local communities in times of need. Through these comprehensive and thorough initiatives to improve profitability, we expect to secure profitability (ROR >7%) equivalent to the cost of capital in fiscal 2026. (Details on p. 135)\n\n## Our Specific Initiatives\n\n| Increased Business Efficiency   | First, Tokio Marine will work to significantly reduce our administrative workload by leveraging digital technology* 2 , thereby reducing our  operating expense ratio to the 31% level* 3  in fiscal 2026. *2 Reduce administrative workload by 20-30% by fiscal 2026 (compared with fiscal 2019) *3 Private health insurance base                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Revision of Rates and Products  | To make fire insurance profitable, we have revised rates and products for four consecutive years since 2019. Through this, we expect an  improvement in earnings of approximately 60 billion yen in fiscal 2023 (compared with fiscal 2020). However, even with this measure, we  are still unable to secure profitability equivalent to our cost of capital (ROR >7%). For this reason, we are also considering rate and product  revisions during the next mid-term business plan (FY2024-2026). In addition, to make insurance premiums among policyholders fairer, we  are examining the introduction of regional segmentation of our current nationwide uniform flood disaster premium. |\n| Optimization of Reinsurance     | In Europe and the United States, due to the effects of Hurricane Ian and reinsurer capital reductions attributable to rising interest rates,  reinsurance premiums have risen sharply, and underwriting preconditions have been tightened. However, in fiscal 2023, we are able to curb  increases in reinsurance premiums in Japan and overseas without increasing our risk through strategic negotiations with reinsurers using the  collective strengths of our Group, reviewing earnings cover through cycle management, as well as by abolishing inefficient programs, and more.                                                                                                        |\n\n## \u25b6Upward Spiral of Our Social and Economic Value (image)\n\nThe more work we do, the more our social value increases. The more our social value increases, the more our economic value increases.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand are working to create and implement solutions that contribute to disaster prevention and mitigation in Japan, where natural disasters are becoming more severe. Currently, over 100 corporations and organizations representing a wide array of industries are participating in the creation of solutions such as (1) resilience information services, (2) building damage cost simulations, and (3) real-time hazard maps. This summer, we will finally enter the phase of concrete business development. (Details on p. 37)\n\nWe have also long focused on services that reduce and prevent accidents and damage caused by natural disasters (LC/LP* 1 ) by accurately ascertaining the environment and risks surrounding client companies. In fiscal 2022, Tokio Marine Nichido implemented around 1,500 loss control and loss prevention cases. These include cases for which we were able to contribute to reduced customer damage costs and accident numbers by about 30%. *1 LC/LP = Loss Control (accident mitigation) and Loss Prevention (accident prevention)",

While this itself is welcome, the difference between average life expectancy and healthy life expectancy is as much as ten years. In anticipation of the era of the 100-year life, how to reduce the difference between average life expectancy and healthy life expectancy has become an urgent issue extending healthy life expectancy has become an important social issue. Avoiding asset depletion is also an urgent challenge, as living longer with an illness can lead to increased financial burden on the individual and their family.\n\nAlso, due to Japan's declining birthrate, the proportion of the population of working-age (15-64 years old) is just 59.4%\u0336the lowest level among developed countries\u0336and this is expected to further decline to about 52.8% by 2060. As the problem of labor shortages in Japan gradually emerges, companies are entering an era in which it is difficult to maintain and improve employee recruitment and retention rates. In addition to corporate initiatives such as improving productivity through innovation, an increasing number of companies are strategically working on corporate health and productivity management as they start to regard employee health management and the promotion of health as an investment.\n\n## \u25b6Average Life Expectancy and Healthy Life Expectancy Trends in Japan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare\n\n## \u25b6Population Trends in Japan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Vision for Tokio Marine\n\nWe support people's long, healthy lives by providing products and services that support the extension of healthy life expectancy, as well as the avoidance of asset depletion. As labor shortages become more acute, through support for health and productivity management, we will support the employees of our client companies so they can work in good physical and mental health.\n\nBy helping to address challenges related to the declining birthrate and aging society in Japan and refining our solutions, we will support countries around the world that are likely to confront the same challenges as Japan in the future.\n\n## To Achieve Our Vision\n\n## 1. Support for Extended Healthy Life Expectancy and the Avoidance of Asset Depletion\n\nWe leverage the latest technology and external expertise to help our customers have an extended healthy life span.\n\nIn Japan, as average life expectancy increases, the number of people suffering from lifestyle-related diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and strokes is also increasing. To prevent these lifestyle-related diseases, it is essential that we raise awareness of health-related issues and improve our lifestyles. To that end, Tokio Marine Nichido Anshin Life began offering 'Anshin Healthcare' from August 2023. We support heightened customer awareness in relation to health and lifestyle through services including predicting the risk of developing hypertension, diabetes etc. from health checkup results that big data-assisted AI and providing online consultation with a nurse when customers are concerned about their health checkup results.\n\nAmong lifestyle-related diseases, some cancers, if diagnosed at an early stage, can be successfully treated in 90% of cases thanks to recent advances in medicine. Therefore, Tokio Marine Nichido Anshin Life has teamed up with Craif, a company we invested in, to offer 'miSignal,' a simple cancer risk test using urine samples for affordable, early detection of cancer. Serious cancer cases might require expensive treatment costs\n\n## 2. Supporting Corporate Health Management\n\nOur company's corporate health management initiatives are evaluated favorably, and we are the only company in the insurance industry to have been selected as a top health management brand for eight consecutive years. We make the best use of our health management know-how to support the health management needs of our client companies.\n\nFor example, at Tokio Marine Nichido, we launched the Health Management Task Force where we have more than 200 employees working as promoters nationwide. We support the certification of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) throughout Japan as Excellent Health Management Organizations by providing insurance that supports a balance between treatment/nursing care and work, and services including support\n\nthat are not covered by the public medical insurance system, leading some to give up on their desired form of treatment due to financial constraints. At Tokio Marine Nichido Anshin Life, we developed and now offer 'Anshin Cancer Treatment Insurance,' which provides coverage for the latest cancer treatments up to 100 million yen* 1 , the highest amount in the life insurance industry.\n\nWe are also taking measures to avoid customer asset depletion. Tokio Marine Nichido Anshin Life provides Market Link (regular premiums variable insurance) that supports customers' long-term asset formation through long-term and diversified investment.\n\nAs we enter an era of the 100-year life, our products and services, which accurately capture customer needs, are being evaluated favorably by customers. Thanks to that, Tokio Marine Nichido Anshin Life's top line* 2 of senior healthcare and regular premiums variable insurance is steadily expanding (Senior healthcare sector: 3-year CAGR: approx. +26%. Asset formation: 3-year CAGR: approx. +39%).\n\n- *1 Tokio Marine Nichido Anshin Life survey, November 2021.\n- Insurance of up to 100 million yen when 'Specific Cancer Treatment Insurance' is attached to 'Anshin Cancer Treatment Insurance'\n- *2 Annualized insurance premiums for new policies\n\nfor formulating a BCP to counter infectious diseases as well as countermeasures against mental health issues and workplace harassment. In fiscal 2022, we supported 2,000 companies, or 12% of all certified corporations.\n\nThe initiatives of Tokio Marine Nichido are also highly evaluated by corporate customers. Thanks to them, the top line* 3 of insurance that is highly compatible with health management is growing at a five-year CAGR of +6%.\n\n- *3 Statistical insurance premiums for corporate and group insurance that compensate employees and cover work-related accident risks, unemployment risks, medical and nursing care risks, etc.\n\n## \u25b6Upward Spiral of Our Social and Economic Value (image)\n\nThe more work we do, the more our social value increases.

Underpinning this strategy are our abilities to execute M&As and PMI and to manage our portfolio.\n\nMore than seven years have already passed since HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. (TMHCC), where I was CEO, became a member of Tokio Marine Group. As a Vice President Executive Officer of Tokio Marine Holdings, I am currently playing a role in implementing integrated Group management, while leading our international insurance business as the Co-Head of International Business. Here, I would like to explain our global risk diversification strategy, which is the essence of the business management of Tokio Marine Holdings.\n\n## Risk Diversification Using M&As\n\nInsurance is a business that underwrites risk. Under no circumstances can we allow the foundations of our business to be shaken. This is why the Group has spent more than 15 years working to expand its insurance business overseas where there is a low correlation with natural disasters in Japan. These efforts are intended to balance appropriate control of risk amount and sustainable growth by diversifying risks across geographic areas, businesses, and products.\n\n## \u25b6Effect of Risk Diversification\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY2013\n\nDiversification\n\neffect\n\n30 %\n\nPost-diversification risk capital 3.0 trillion yen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristopher Williams Vice President Executive Officer Co-Head of International Business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have executed international M&As in the cumulative total value of over two trillion yen, using the capital and funds generated from the sale of business-related equities.\n\nAs a result, the diversification effects have risen to 47%, which has enabled us to control the impact of COVID-19 and large-scale natural catastrophes on our business results below 30% even in the years we experienced these events.\n\nFY2023\n\nDiversification\n\neffect\n\n47 %\n\nPost-diversification risk capital\n\n3.4 trillion yen\n\n## \u25b6M&A Transactions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u25a0 Domestic Non-Life (Underwriting) \u25a0 Domestic Non-Life (Investment) \u25a0 Domestic Life \u25a0 International \u25a0 Others\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1\n\n## Domains and Companies Targeted in M&A\n\nFor Tokio Marine Group, M&A is not a goal but rather a method for global risk diversification. Aimed at achieving this goal, our main M&A targets in developed countries in Europe and North America are companies with little overlap with our existing businesses in terms of customer base and products in the field of specialty insurance while in emerging countries companies mainly with a personal line of\n\nnon-life insurance in regions with large market size and high growth potential. Furthermore, while more than 80% of the profits of our overseas insurance business come from North America, our portfolio in this business is well diversified, consisting of business lines that do not have much correlation centered on specialty insurance.\n\n## Stringent Acquisition Guidelines Emphasizing Cultural Fit\n\nTo execute M&As in a disciplined manner, we adhere to the following three principles: (1) acquire a business which has strong results and a promising outlook; (2) acquire a business whose business results are supported by a unique business model that cannot be emulated by other companies; and (3) acquire a business whose culture, business purpose, and management values are in alignment with those of Tokio Marine. Based on these principles, we have identified and acquired 'good companies' that are expected to generate a good return on investment.\n\nAmong these, we value cultural fit the most. Looking back, culture was perhaps the single greatest factor in HCC (TMHCC) joining Tokio Marine Group.\n\nlists, the International Executive Committee (IEC), comprised of the Group's C-level officers and head of the overseas insurance business, holds discussions to carefully screen acquisition candidates, but using quantitative metrics is not sufficient to evaluate an acquisition. When seeking a cultural fit, both parties need to feel certain through in-depth conversations that the directions of our businesses and our chemistry match.\n\nTokio Marine has executed M&A deals giving top priority to cultural fit, so conversely, there have been several deals that did not materialize because the cultural fit was not there, even though the guideline for high profitability was met.\n\nWe have a market intelligence (MI) function internally that we use to identify deals and then compile long and short lists. Based on these\n\n## Growth after Joining Tokio Marine Group* 1\n\n## ROI from Large-Scale M&A* 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Lloyd's Annual Report and S&P Capital IQ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Oversight Respecting the Autonomy and High Growth of Target Companies\n\nIn addition to cultural fit, another characteristic of our M&A style that remains unchanged today is that we respect the autonomy of the target company and avoid invasive acquisitions. There are few companies in the world that use a federated approach to Group business operations like Tokio Marine. I believe that our integrated approach to Group management represents a unique business model.\n\nOn occasion, I am asked about business integration of an acquired company, but this would destroy the unique DNA of these companies. Since we acquire 'good companies' with a strong business model and\n\nhigh profitability, maintaining the target companies' autonomy and having them fully utilize their own strengths lead to further growth after they join the Group. This is something I am convinced of from my time as President of Tokio Marine HCC (TMHCC), which in many cases used bolt-on M&A. In actuality, our large acquisitions of Philadelphia Consolidated Holding Corp. (PHLY), Delphi Financial Group, Inc. (DFG), and TMHCC, which drive overseas profits, have shown growth above and beyond the market after joining the Group, and Pure joins these three companies.\n\n## Forward-Looking Business Divestments\n\nOptimizing our business portfolio is an ongoing process of not only acquisition but also forward-looking divestments, as strategically necessary to shake up our portfolio. As in the sale of Tokio Millenium Re (TMR) in March 2019, we use the capital and funds generated\n\nthrough such sale to execute the next acquisitions so that we can further diversify risks and grow our business. Thanks to this approach to portfolio management, our adjusted ROE has risen to 15.1% (for fiscal 2022 on a normalized basis).\n\n## Closing\n\nOur proven M&A track record and reputation will help us to find the next great M&A opportunity. This is one of our major strengths that few competitors can easily match.\n\nWe are able to simultaneously achieve risk diversification and business growth by acquiring 'good companies' with low risk correlation and little overlap in terms of customer base and products. At the same time, we sell\n\n## \u25b6Stringent Acquisition Guidelines\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Acquired and   |            |               |          |              |               |           |\n|----------------|------------|---------------|----------|--------------|---------------|-----------|\n| IN             | March 2008 | December 2008 | May 2012 | October 2015 | February 2020 | June 2022 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u25b6Forward-Looking and Disciplined Portfolio Review\n\nDivestment/\n\nRun-off\n\nOUT\n\nNon-Japanese\n\nbusiness\n\nin Europe*\n\n1\n\nJanuary 2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEgyptian Life\n\nTakaful Company\n\nSeptember 2020\n\nAugust 2022\n\nSeptember 2022 Run-off\n\n*1 U.K. non-Japanese business and some unprofitable non-Japanese businesses in other European regions (continuing the Lloyd's business) *2 Agent handling construction insurance in the Tokio Marine Highland (former WNC) group owned by TMK\n\nHighland*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTMK Reinsurance\n\nBusiness\n\nbusinesses determined to lack contributions to diversification and growth and allocate the capital and cash generated to further diversification and growth.

However, these mechanisms and approaches cannot end with the so-called first generation. It is important to nurture the next generation of talented management and pass the baton\u0336and we are taking steady steps toward achieving that. We also leverage our 'TLI,' a Group-wide, global human resource development program launched in April, as a gateway to success for next-generation management personnel. We will continue to work on our talent development and succession planning linked to global talent management, which we have been driving forward since 2019.\n\n## Creating Synergy through Culture Fit Employees work with enthusiasm and contribute to growth\n\nAlmost 15 years have passed since we joined Tokio Marine Group in 2008. Since then, our company has more than doubled our revenue. Our workforce has increased to more than 2,000 from 1,400.\n\nWe have been able to achieve such remarkable growth not only because we were blessed with the opportunity for a wealth of synergies that led to increased revenue and profits but also because, as the basis for this growth, Tokio Marine respected our autonomy after joining the Group, and due to this, we believe that each and every one of our employees continues to play an active role.\n\nI have been approaching work with my 'motto', 'Always maintain a positive mental attitude,' and the time spent with colleagues around the world working together in the culture of our company keeps me in a positive mood.\n\nNeedless to say, it is important to trust each other in terms of autonomy and collaboration between Group companies. The more our teams interact with one another, the better we understand each other's product appetite, which can lead to more successful synergy opportunities. There is no doubt that the fact that Tokio Marine Group and our company are united by the spirit of 'Good Company,' that we share the same purpose, and that we were able to achieve a true culture fit, contributed greatly to our growth.\n\nJohn Glomb Executive Officer President and CEO of Philadelphia Insurance Co.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOptimized allocation of our Talented Workforce globally to strengthen integrated group management\n\nBy increasing the number of overseas officers and the appointment of chief officers, we will bring together global insight to decide upon and execute important management matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTokio Marine Group Leadership Institute (TLI), established in April 2023\n\nA unique training program aimed at producing management leaders who will promote the integrated group management on a stable and continuous basis\n\n## \u25b6Features of TLI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25cf Consolidation of talent management data from Group companies\n- \u25cf Program design linked to talent management data\n- \u25cf Gather and utilize global wisdom on leadership development\n- \u25cf Strengthen cooperation with Group companies and HR departments on a global basis\n- \u25cf Offering experience to deal with difficulties in and out of the Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25cf A structure linked with global recruitment of younger generation/mid-career employees\n- \u25cf Commitment by current global management to the development of next-generation leaders\n- \u25cf Succession of our purpose and values\n\n1\n\nPurpose Story 2023",

Led by our CEO, who also serves as the Group Culture Officer (CCO), we conduct physical and remote dialogues with Group employees around the world to discuss our purpose. All on-site employees contemplate the question, 'What is our business for?' with sincerity while they consider how our work contributes to customers and society, and how we can address the challenges presented to us by customers and society. These present opportunities to think about the Company's purpose and reaffirm the significance of our work. In addition to the above, management's thoughts and feelings about our purpose and culture are regularly conveyed via video messages. We use these messages as tools in 'Majikirakai' meetings worldwide and in workplaces, in which serious discussions take place in a relaxed atmosphere, regardless of division and position. By steadily continuing these down-to-earth initiatives that unite the management and the workplace, we aim to be a company whose purpose reaches every corner of the world, and whose passion and sense of unity are second to none.\n\n## Regular Distribution of Management Messages\n\nVideo messages from the Group CEO are distributed almost monthly and feedback is sought from employees, facilitating two-way communication\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dialogue aimed at penetration of our purpose ('Majikirakai\u02a1 meetings)\n\nMaking use of remote and in-person opportunities globally, top management hold dialogue with management and employees to spread the message of the Company's purpose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Good Company Booklet for worldwide distribution\n\nUsed worldwide as a tool to help employees think about and discuss our company's purpose and culture with their co-workers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strengthening Governance through Our Purpose\n\nGlobally, we have shared our culture of aiming to be a 'Good Company' based on the spirit of 'Look Beyond Profit.'\n\n'Although it's not written in the rules or manuals, we do not do things that a Good Company wouldn't do,' and 'we do the right thing in the right way.' This stance and way of thinking reaches not only our board of directors and management, but also every employee around the world. It is one form of governance we pursue.\n\nFor us, governance that leverages the advantages of being a Japan-based company is governance based on the permeation of culture. In recent years, it has been called purpose-driven management, but in Japan, this kind of governance has been handed\n\ndown since the late 1800s. This was the era of Eiichi Shibusawa, who was instrumental in the establishment of our company.\n\nIn other words, Japanese culture facilitates the control of things through the spirit of autonomy and self-control. We want to further evolve our corporate governance by combining Japanese-style governance, which is in line with our culture, social norms, strengths, and way of thinking, with the best aspects of Western-style governance. It is a big challenge, but it is what we are always aiming for, and we believe it is possible. This approach is truly an endless journey. We intend to further evolve our unique integrated group management through the penetration of our Purpose and Culture.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Recently, the Company has been leveraging this expertise to address social issues along with other businesses.\n\nFor example, in 2022, we entered a business alliance with Kokumin Kyosai co-op, and in October, we established a joint venture, Kyodo Jimu Chosa Services Co.\n\nFrom the moment a customer is involved in an accident until the payment of insurance or a mutual aid claim is completed, various tasks must be carried out, such as entering accident information into the system, sending claim documents, contacting the customer, calculating the amount to be paid, and making a payment decision. Utilizing Tokio Marine Nichido's expertise in these areas, Kokumin Kyosai co-op plans to review its business processes and reform its systems to make procedures more convenient and operations more efficient for its members and policyholders.\n\nKyodo Jimu Chosa Service K.K. will develop a mutual aid payment system to support the new business process being restructured by Kokumin Kyosai co-op, provide the system's functions to Kokumin Kyosai co-op and take care of the\n\nadministrative procedures for loss investigation related to mutual aid insurance for automobiles.\n\nThrough this initiative, we aim to cooperate beyond the framework of insurance and mutual aid, while playing a role as a compensation provider on a permanent basis. This is exactly in line with our Group mission to protect our customers and local communities in times of need.\n\nWe believe that by thinking differently and utilizing intellectual property and know-how related to loss services that have been amassed over many years in the domestic P&C insurance business, we will be able to identify growth potential in the domestic market, create new income-generating opportunities, and make more effective use of our management resources.\n\nSince 2020, we have been utilizing satellite data to assess flood damage and speed up insurance payments, and we intend to use the satellite data expertise we have built up through these initiatives to work with local governments and private companies to address social issues.\n\nThus, we are carrying out many initiatives to leverage the strengths of our loss services, and we will continue to hone these strengths to achieve outstanding results in the future.\n\n## Initiatives that leverage the strengths of loss services\n\n## Case Study \u2776 Business alliance with Kokumin Kyosai co-op\n\n## Case Study \u2777 Utilization of satellite data\n\n\u00b7Develop and offer mutual aid procceds payment system \u00b7Consignment of part of auto mutual aid loss adjustment business, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expected Impact\n\n\u00b7Bottom-line impact equivalent +6 billion yen p.a.* from fiscal 2025 \u00b7Further improve business efficiency, etc.\n\n## Expected Impact\n\n- \u00b7Fundamental reform of loss adjustment operation, reduce operation cost\n- \u00b7Improve convenience of members and policyholders, etc.\n\n*Bottom-line effect from recovery of labor costs, system-related costs, etc.\n\n\u00b7Tokio Marine has leveraged satellite since 2020 for prompt insurance payment for flood claims \u00b7Currently considering selling the know-how of utilizing satellite data to local government, etc. (Projecting an average of 50 million yen per transaction)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Despite increasing adjusted return on equity (ROE) to 15.1% in fiscal 2022, we acknowledge that this result has been influenced by factors such as the reduction in net assets due to rising interest rates, which is applicable to the entire industry. As such, we are not content with this figure alone and are determined to enhance ROE at its core, elevating it to a level that aligns with our global peers. In my capacity as Group CFO, I am devoted to leading these efforts, particularly focusing on capital policy considerations.\n\nOur capital strategy is built upon a three-pronged approach. First, we will strategically review our portfolio based on organic growth and expedite the divestment of business-related equities to generate capital and funds. Second, we will channel the capital and funds into strong business investments. Third, if there are no favorable investment prospects, we will prioritize returning capital to shareholders, aiming to bolster ROE and maintain a balanced capital management cycle. In the following sections, I will provide a comprehensive explanation of each of these components.\n\nOur approach does not align with the typical 'shrink to grow' strategy. Instead, our key focus for boosting ROE revolves around molecular expansion, or  'organic growth,' specifically aiming for the world's top-class EPS growth. The characteristics of our portfolio are (1) a domestic market foundation that generates stable earnings, (2) growth of specialty companies in developed countries encompassing less correlated business lines, and (3) high growth in emerging countries such as Brazil and Asia.\n\n## \u25b6Capital Management Cycle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn my role as Group CFO, I contribute to the growth of each business by actively engaging in the management strategies developed by each business, which are formulated based on capital allocation and other measures.\n\n## Adjusted Net Income* 2\n\n## Adjusted ROE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *2: The breakdown of adjusted net income is the profit of each business unit.\n- *3: Domestic non-life insurance = TMNF\n- *4: Domestic life insurance = TMNL\n- *5: Other domestic non-life insurance, financial, and other businesses, and gains relating to sales of business-related equities, etc., that are not included in business unit profits\n- *6: The following one-time effects totaling +72.9 billion yen were excluded from the fiscal 2021 actual result of 578.3 billion yen: 1) Natural disasters: Approximately +17.0 billion yen, 2) North American capital gains, etc.: Approximately +24.0 billion yen, 3) COVID-19: Approximately +23.0 billion yen, and 4) Gains on the sale of business-related equities: Approximately +9.0 billion yen (on the portion of sales exceeding 100.0 billion yen)\n- *7: The following one-time effects totaling \u0202173.1 billion yen were excluded from the fiscal 2022 actual result of 444.0 billion yen: 1) Natural disasters: Approximately \u020226.0 billion yen, 2) North American capital gains, etc.: Approximately \u020210.5 billion yen, 3) COVID-19: Approximately \u0202134.0 billion yen, 4) Conflict: Approximately \u020214.0 billion yen, 5) South African floods: Approximately \u02024.0 billion yen, and 6) Gains on the sale of business-related equities: Approximately +15.0 billion yen (on the portion of sales exceeding 100.0 billion yen)\n\nWe aim to maintain the world\u029fs top-class EPS growth and lift the level of ROE equivalent to global peers through the implementation of a disciplined capital policy.\n\n## Kenji Okada\n\nSenior Managing Director Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\n\n## \u25b6Track Record of Disciplined Capital Management\n\n## Average of the Past 5 Years (2018-2022)\n\n## Average of the Past 10 Years (2013-2022)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*1\uff1aCombined only with the amounts disclosed (acquired from Refinitiv Eikon)\n\n## Organic Growth\n\nFor instance, I collaborate with the senior leadership of each business to address shifts in the business landscape, evaluate strategic advancements, and determine if any adjustments are warranted.

        "page_content": "2\n\n## Portfolio Review/Business Investment\n\nAs an insurance company, we increase returns by taking risks in insurance underwriting and asset management as a key to our business. We have positioned Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) as the cornerstone of Group management. ERM takes into consideration our risk appetite, to what extent we undertake risks (risk strategy), whether return on risk is sufficient, and whether risks are appropriately diversified (see pp. 50-53). We have also established the ERM Committee to discuss ERM strategy. As the Committee's chair, I assess the growth potential and profitability of all businesses and the risks associated with each strategy in a forward-looking manner and formulate a capital allocation plan to optimize the business portfolio from a Group-wide perspective.\n\nFrom the standpoint of business investment, we often receive inquiries during our dialogues with the capital market about 'the next step in M&A.' However, for us, M&A is a 'means' for risk diversification and profit growth, rather than being an ultimate 'goal.' Therefore, we deliberately refrain from setting an 'M&A budget' or a 'profit plan dependent on M&A.' In the case of large-scale M&A opportunities, we generally perceive current valuations to be inflated. Consequently, we believe that exercising patience is crucial as we engage in Market Intelligence activities, constantly monitoring long and short lists of potential acquisition targets, and carefully selecting 'promising companies' that offer a sufficient return on investment (ROI). Concurrently, we proactively seize opportunities for smaller-scale bolt-on M&A, capitalizing on the experience and insights within the Group to execute these initiatives consistently.\n\nUnder this guiding principle, we have pursued disciplined and strategic approaches to various entry (M&A, etc.) and exit (divestment, etc.) opportunities, considering risk diversification and future growth prospects. For instance, we have undertaken initiatives such as the acquisition of Pure Group, establishment of a local entity in Canada, and bolt-on M&A through Delphi Financial Group (Standard Security Life Insurance Company) and Tokio Marine HCC (Gulf Guaranty Employee Benefit Services, Inc.). Simultaneously, we have divested from reinsurance subsidiaries and Tokio Marine Kiln's subsidiary Highland, all aimed at achieving optimal capital allocation.\n\nFollowing a review of our capital structure, we issued hybrid bonds when we acquired Pure in consideration of capital costs. In the future, we will also explore the use of hybrid bonds as necessary as one of the means for achieving the optimal capital structure while preventing equity dilution.\n\nFrom a capital restructuring perspective, we have been consistently reducing business-related equities for over 20 years. Recently, we announced our intention to sell more than 600 billion yen worth of business-related equities over the next four years, to 2026. We intend to prudently utilize the capital generated from this accelerated divestment.\n\nBy following this approach, we have consistently enhanced our corporate value by effectively refreshing our risk portfolio. Looking ahead, we will maintain proper risk control while accelerating growth through well-considered capital allocation.\n\n## \u25b6Achieving Growth through a Flexible Capital Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk diversification through the expansion of our international business\n\n## Profit Composition *1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1 The breakdown of profit is based on the profit of each business segment (yearly\n- plan), except 'Other businesses' are included in 'Japan.' *2 Profit on a financial accounting basis for TMNL\n\n## Accelerated reduction of business-related equities\n\n<!-- image -->",

Specifically, we calculate ordinary dividends based on our 5-year average adjusted net income to temper volatility and apply a dividend payout ratio that aligns with global peer standards. For fiscal 2023, against the backdrop of consistent profit growth, we have been steadily expanding the foundation for dividends, our 5-year average adjusted net income. As planned, by raising the dividend payout ratio to the targeted global peer level of 50%, we forecast a 21%\n\nincrease in DPS compared with the previous year, marking the 12th consecutive year of dividend growth.\n\nWe use share buybacks as a means of adjusting capital levels and decisions will be made based on comprehensive consideration of economic solvency ratio (ESR), market conditions, opportunities for M&A, and additional risk-taking. Given our ESR of 124% as of the end of March 2023, well within the target range, our approach for fiscal 2023 is to implement a flexible share buyback plan of 100 billion yen throughout the year, with an initial resolution of 50 billion yen made in May.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1\uff1a DPS = Five-year adjusted net income \u00d7 Payout ratio / Number of shares\n- *2\uff1a Figures in parentheses are prior to the three-for-one stock split in October 2022.\n\n## \u25b6Status of the Economic Solvency Ratio (ESR)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| ESR   |        | \u25cf  Business investment, and/or  \u25cf  Additional risk-taking, and/or \u25cf  Shareholder return Implement:   |\n|-------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 140%  | Target | \u25cf  Business investment, and/or  \u25cf  Additional risk-taking, and/or Strategically consider:            |\n| 100%  | Range  | \u25cf  Shareholder return \u25cf  Aim to recover the capital level through the accumulation                   |\n| 100%  |        | of profit \u25cf  Control the risk level by reducing risk-taking activities                               |\n\n*3: Amount of risk calculated by a model using 99.95% VaR (AA-rated basis)\n\n## ROE\n\nAs a result of these initiatives, our adjusted ROE has been consistently above the 7% cost of capital.

Specifically, these risks are identified through internal discussions, considering results from subsidiary assessments and information from external sources.\n- *3: Material risks refer to risks that could have a substantial impact on financial soundness, business continuity, and other critical aspects. Specifically, we focus on emerging risks as well as material risks from the previous business year within the Group. We assess the impact (evaluating economic, business continuity, and reputational impacts) and consider the frequency and likelihood to identify the most significant factors. We specify these risks using the following 5\u00d75 matrix.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *4: For material risks, we formulate response measures (Plan), implement these measures (Do), assess the outcomes (Check), and make improvements (Act).\n\nbut are comprehensively assessing risk in qualitative and quantitative ways.\n\nIn addition, we are continuing our efforts to further strengthen the ERM structure. For instance, we are enhancing risk assessments to include risks that are difficult to quantify, such as cyber risks, and improving natural disaster risk management, including a review of our reinsurance schemes.\n\n## Reference: Qualitative Risk Management\n\nIn qualitative risk management, all risks, including risks that emerge due to changes in the environment, are identified and reported to management, while risks to the Group are discussed at the management level as needed. Risks identified in this manner are evaluated not only in terms of the economic loss or frequency of occurrence but also in terms of business continuity and reputation. Risks that have a large impact on the financial soundness and business continuity of the Group or of individual Group companies\n\nare identified as 'material risks.' For identified material risks, we assess the sufficiency of capital through the quantitative risk management process described below, draw up control measures before the risks emerge and countermeasures* 5 to be taken if the risks do emerge, and conduct PDCA management.\n\n- *5: Pre-emergence risk control measures include monitoring and risk management based on the market environment

on the latest knowledge available, verifying from multiple perspectives that its capital is sufficient relative to the risks it holds, with the aim of maintaining its credit ratings and preventing bankruptcy.\n\nSpecifically, the Company quantifies potential risks using a statistical metric called 'Value at Risk (VaR)' on a 99.95% confidence level, which corresponds to an AA credit rating, and verifies its capital adequacy based on the Economic Solvency Ratio (ESR) arrived at by dividing net asset value* 1 by risk capital. A 99.95% VaR is equivalent to the damage caused by an occurrence of a risk that happens once in 2,000 years. Although many insurance companies around the world use 99.5% VaR (once in 200 years), Tokio Marine Group uses a much more stringent standard to evaluate risk capital.\n\nThe target range of the Group's ESR is 100%-140%, and as of March 31, 2023, the Group's ESR was 124%, confirming that the Group is adequately capitalized.\n\nWe also conduct stress tests based on scenarios involving significant economic losses from material risks such as domestic and international economic crises, disruptions in financial and capital markets, loss of confidence in Japanese government bonds, major earthquakes, major wind and water-related disasters, and widespread outbreaks of new viruses. We also assess scenarios where multiple critical risks materialize simultaneously. Through these stress tests, we confirm separately that there are no issues regarding capital adequacy and liquidity.\n\n- *1: Calculated by adding the value of catastrophe loss reserves, deducting for goodwill, and making other adjustments to consolidated net assets on a financial accounting basis.\n\n## \u25b6Status of the Economic Solvency Ratio (ESR)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *2: Amount of risk calculated by a model using 99.95% VaR (AA-rated basis)",

Based on this purpose, we have confronted evolving social challenges head-on and offered solutions that only we can. Our historical contributions, from supporting Japan's modernization as a trading nation through maritime insurance to aiding postwar motorization with automobile insurance and promoting renewable energy through tailored insurance packages, illustrate how our core business activities inherently address social issues and embody sustainability. The spirit of sustainability ingrained in our 40,000 employees worldwide is the very essence of our DNA, a legacy passed down through generations since our founding.\n\n## Environmental Changes Surrounding Sustainability\n\nIn this rapidly changing and unpredictable era, the environment surrounding sustainability is also undergoing constant shifts. The scope of societal issues we need to address has expanded beyond global warming and climate change and the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters to encompass such areas as human\n\nBy contributing to building a better society through constantly seeking and offering solutions to ever-changing global issues as only Tokio Marine can, we will accelerate the upward spiral of resolving social issues while growing our business.\n\n## Kiyoshi Wada\n\nManaging Director\n\nGroup Chief Sustainability Office (CSUO)\n\nrights and biodiversity preservation. Against this backdrop, my mission as CSUO is to make sure we continue to embody this long-established DNA of solving social problems and directly connect that to growth for society and the Company. That is, 'to continue building a sustainable society by balancing our corporate activities and the resolution of social issues.' Despite the changing times, the core concept of our deeply rooted sustainability strategy has remained unchanged since our inception. We must continue to step up our efforts and capacity to solve issues. As these challenges become increasingly diverse and complex, it is important that we employ our expertise and know-how globally and mobilize as 'one team' to combat them. It is imperative that we unite the individual contributions of each Group company and carry out collective activities with a greater sense of urgency.\n\n## Establishment of Promotional Framework and Penetration of Global Sustainability Strategy\n\nTo swiftly execute this strategy across the board, in fiscal 2021 we enacted the Group Sustainability Policy applicable to all Group companies and identified eight key areas (materiality) for focused\n\ninitiatives based on our purpose. We also established the Sustainability Committee, which includes executives from overseas Group companies, to actively engage in discussion regarding our global sustainability strategy and initiatives.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee goes beyond discussing overarching policies; it also focuses on showcasing how social challenges are tackled through both domestic and international business operations. This approach has led to increased communication between Japanese and overseas branches and played a crucial role in expediting strategic decision-making and implementation throughout the Group. These initiatives have effectively propelled the permeation of sustainability policies and strategies across the Group. Centered on the eight key areas (materiality), efforts to address social challenges through business activities are gaining global momentum.\n\nIn addressing climate change, we are not only developing and offering products and services that contribute to the growth of renewable energy, but also engaging with more than 250 companies on climate change and environmental themes and operating a renewable energy fund to promote green investments. Furthermore, we have established the GX Round Table to foster collaboration across the Group in the green transformation (GX) field, advancing support for the global transition to a decarbonized society.\n\nWithin the domain of disaster resilience, we are actively broadening our efforts across pre-emptive and post-incident strategies, with the goals of accident prevention, mitigating burdens during incidents, and expediting recovery while averting future recurrences. Harnessing digital technology, we have established streamlined and automated insurance claim procedures, ensuring swift delivery of benefits to those impacted. In the United States, we provide accident-detection sensors free of charge, integrating digital innovation into product evolution and launch to forestall accidents and curtail losses through data-driven insights. Our commitment extends to collaborative efforts in disaster prevention and mitigation across diverse industries through CORE, a disaster prevention consortium. This consortium has generated specific solutions such as the Real Time Hazzard and resilient information delivery services, garnering support from over 100 participating companies and magnifying its societal impact.\n\nWe are also making consistent strides in other crucial domains, such as broadening Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment and financing, making contributions towards future generations, improving disclosures in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and crafting a policy for human rights due diligence.\n\n## Accelerated Integration with Business Activities and Response to New Social Challenges\n\nThese initiatives have contributed to the incremental global adoption of our sustainability strategy, and we will take steps to further refine it\n\n## \u25b6Changes in Major Areas of Activity\n\n| FY2021 (Results)                                            | FY2021 (Results)

Specifically, we aim to create a state where exceptional ideas arising from each workplace, which contribute to solving social challenges, are transformed into unique businesses and services distinctive to the Group through effective communication among diverse employees and persistent hypothesis testing. To achieve this, we are enhancing the incorporation of our sustainability strategy into business plans and establishing a mechanism to review initiatives based on key performance indicators (KPIs). This initiative takes center stage in 2023. Furthermore, we recognize the importance of cultivating individuals who can drive the execution of strategies at each Group company. These individuals should embrace the sustainability strategy as their own, integrate it into their organizational plans, and champion its implementation by involving their peers. To this end, we are developing a systematic curriculum for talent development in the theory and practice of sustainability strategy, scheduled for implementation this fiscal year.\n\nAs new social issues related to human rights and biodiversity conservation emerge, we remain attuned to changing perspectives and societal expectations, responding promptly. Addressing human rights concerns, we have already created a human rights risk map, identifying priority areas for action among 'business partners,' 'value chains,' and 'employees.' In terms of biodiversity conservation, we continue to advance activities emblematic of the Group, such as mangrove planting and ocean conservation, while considering the forthcoming Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework for assessing impacts on ecosystems and natural capital resulting from business activities.\n\nThese endeavors do not operate in isolation, however. By proactively disclosing our various initiatives, such as our TCFD Report and Human Capital Report, we seek to invigorate dialogue with stakeholders, leveraging insights gained to further elevate our sustainability strategy.\n\n## Enhancing Value by Circulating Corporate Activities and the Resolution of Social Issues\n\nGuided by our enduring purpose of protecting customers and society in times of need, we will combine the collective capabilities of the Group and take pride in our commitment to be a front-runner in solving social issues. At the same time, we will strive to increase both social value and economic value (profit growth) by circulating our corporate activities against the resolution of social issues.\n\nWe sincerely appreciate the ongoing understanding and support of all our stakeholders.",

Launched in 2021, this committee includes not only the CEO, CFO, CSO, and CHRO but also non-Japanese chief officers. By creating working groups and task force under this\n\nframework, we have created a flexible structure to address the very essence of social challenges and facilitate coordinated efforts on a global and Group-wide level.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee convened four times in fiscal 2022, setting plans and challenges, executing initiatives, and reviewing outcomes.

We have also developed mechanisms to ensure effectiveness, such as creating a process for reviewing these initiatives and building a system to recognize outstanding ideas and initiatives into the TokioMarine Innovation\n\nProgram*. Additionally, by externally disclosing specific initiatives and processes that emerge from these efforts, we aim to engage in dialogue with our stakeholders, incorporating their feedback into the following year's initiatives.\n\nBy setting this PDCA cycle in a positive feedback loop throughout the Group, we further embed our sustainability strategy and elevate the content and insights of our initiatives, enabling us to accelerate our sustainability strategy across the Group.\n\n- * An initiative where ideas from employees of Group companies are solicited for addressing social challenges through business activities, and applicants themselves bring these ideas to fruition.\n\n## \u25b6Accelerating the Sustainability Strategy through a PDCA Cycle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDevelop personnel capable of driving sustainability initiatives",

Further assessment was undertaken based on the dual axes of 'stakeholder expectations and\n\ninterests' and 'relevance to Tokio Marine Group's business,' leading us to pinpoint four priority issues that warrant focus. For each material issue, we implement diverse measures depending on their impact on the Group's operations in terms of risk and opportunity ('How').

(Materiality)\n\nTokio Marine Group has identified eight material issues on which the Group should focus as it works to provide value to each of the aforementioned stakeholders while referencing the scope of principal frameworks on social issues in and outside Japan, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ISO 26000, and new industry visions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Selecting Four Priority Issues\n\nBased on an assessment along the lines of the following two axes, we selected four priority issues on which to focus from among the eight material issues.\n\n- (1) Expectations and the interest of stakeholders\n\nAssessment based on the content of a stakeholder survey while also taking into consideration such factors as social perceptions toward each issue and status of incorporation into various ratings.\n\n- Assessment based on the relationships with the degree of contribution to the Group's purpose, business strategy,\n- (2) Importance for Tokio Marine

In fiscal 2022, we established a cross-functional global task force to discuss initiatives for contributing to future generations, which identified three key themes and five priority initiatives to focus on. In fiscal 2023, we will promote these efforts both domestically and internationally.\n\n| Areas of focus                                                 | Outline of key initiatives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Restoration of natural capital  and response to climate change | Disclosure of information on biodiversity conservation and natural capital (planting of mangrove trees and other  reforestation efforts, restoration of seagrass beds) Investment in natural capital (ESG investment and financing) (impact investment targeting natural capital,                                                                            |\n| Nurturing the leaders  of tomorrow                             | Educational support for children and students and industry-academia collaboration (conducting educational  classes and fostering talent through collaboration with educational institutions) Support for participation in business activities (providing opportunities for high school students to intern and  young employees to participate in management) |\n| Supporting the transition to  a circular economy               | Support for waste reduction and recycling through insurance (promoting regeneration and reuse of damaged  goods through property insurance)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n## Restoration of Natural Capital and Response to Climate Change\n\nThe preservation of biodiversity and the natural environment is a global priority. Tokio Marine Group started planting mangroves in 1999, and since then we have been engaging in this distinctive endeavor as 'insurance for the future of the earth' to pass down a safe and secure environment to future generations (total of 12,261 hectares as of March 31, 2023). In fiscal 2022, we initiated efforts to preserve seagrass beds, which possess a high capacity for absorbing and sequestering atmospheric CO2, along with their water purification capabilities. Across the Group, we are committed to advancing initiatives that safeguard the global environment. Also in 2022, we established a team at TMNF dedicated to impact investments that harmonize both social and economic value, specifically targeting investments in natural capital. In addition to renewable energy funds and environmental funds, we also committed to investing in a new field, forest funds, in fiscal 2023. Through these endeavors, we are exploring approaches for disclosing information about natural capital and conducting assessments of the effects (including economic value) on ecosystems, such as mangrove reforestation. We are also looking into disclosures that align with the guidelines set forth by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).\n\n## Nurturing the Leaders of Tomorrow\n\nRegardless of the era, it is our profound duty to educate and instill awareness in the young minds destined to shape the future. We have been conducting disaster prevention classes in Japan since 2012 to empower children with the essential skills for disaster readiness, with around 77,000 participants as of March 31, 2023. Moreover, we have recently extended comparable initiatives on a global scale. For instance, in Vietnam, we introduced an educational program addressing the prevention of water-related accidents, a critical social concern. Additionally, at TMNF, we are committed to continuing our educational and awareness initiatives for children. This includes organizing junior internships centered on addressing social challenges for high school students.\n\n## Supporting the Transition to a Circular Economy\n\nWe are engaged in efforts to reduce food waste and promote recycling through insurance. In Japan, TMNF has formed a consortium to combat food loss with three private companies, collecting data related to food waste and developing insurance policies to compensate for the costs of food recycling. In Southeast Asia, we offer cargo insurance that provides compensation for food products that have lost commercial value due to damage to outer packaging in transit with the condition of donating them. This supports the circular economy by contributing to the promotion of sustainable practices for still-edible food items.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Commitment to Respecting Human Rights\n\nTokio Marine Group is dedicated to respecting human rights across all business endeavors. Guided by principles such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the ILO International Labor Standards, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we established the Tokio Marine Group Basic Policy on Human Rights and are actively advancing initiatives based on this. We have also established the Human Rights Subcommittee as part of a promotion structure, conducting risk assessments and impact evaluations regarding human rights issues concerning our stakeholders to clearly identify high-priority challenges. In the future, we will continue to engage in dialogue with our stakeholders, enhancing the sensitivity of our leadership and each employee towards human rights to enable swift response to human rights issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Summary of Key Initiatives                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Formulated the Basic Policy on Human Rights and established the Human Rights Subcommittee Formulated the Policy to Address Environmental and Social Risks Developed the Responsible Procurement Guidelines |\n| Formulated a human rights risk map Held human rights workshops                                                                                                                                             |\n| Conducted interviews and surveys with rights holders in the value chain                                                                                                                                    |\n| Implemented employee education and training  Established a hotline (internal reporting channel)                                                                                                            |\n| Issued the Integrated Report and the Sustainability Report Engaged in dialogue with external experts                                                                                                       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Establishment of Policies\n\nIn December 2021, we formulated the Tokio Marine Group Basic Policy on Human Rights aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, clarifying our commitment as a Group to respect human rights across employers, businesses, and the value chain. Additionally, we developed the Responsible Procurement Guidelines as a normative framework towards promoting responsible procurement and procurement practices throughout the value chain.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n- \u25a0Development of Human Rights Risk Map We have identified the risks related to human rights issues of key stakeholders relevant to our business.\n- \u25a0Human Rights Workshop In November 2022, a human rights workshop was organized and held by members of the Planning and Administrative Section. Taking into account the insights of external experts, we conducted an assessment of risks within our business areas (insurance underwriting and investment, value chain, and Company employees).\n\n## \u25b6Key Areas of Focus for Each Business Area Identified in the Workshop\n\n| Business  Areas                         | Areas of Focus                                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Insurance  underwriting  and investment | Insured companies  and individuals as insurance customers  and financing recipients                                                    |\n| Value chain                             | Insurance agents Foreign technical trainees and workers engaged  in automotive maintenance The Group\u029fs suppliers and service providers |\n| Company  employees                      | Employees                                                                                                                              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impact Evaluation\n\nBased on the results of the workshops, we pinpoint key areas of focus considering the impact and potential risks to our stakeholders and conduct an impact evaluation. In fiscal 2022, we focused on foreign technical trainees engaged in automotive repairs within our value chain.  With guidance from external experts, we conducted interviews to gain a better understanding of the actual situation. Based on the findings, we will work on addressing the challenges identified.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The following are some examples of risks and opportunities in the Group's business activities.\n\n|                                                                                                                                            | Examples of events                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Examples of risks to the Group\u029fs business activities   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Potential for growing frequency and scale of  typhoons, floods, and other weather events                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Acute                                                  |\n| Rising temperatures Other weather changes, such as droughts and heat waves Rising sea levels Impact on arthropod-borne infectious diseases | \u25cf  Impact on insurance payouts \u25cf  Impact on business continuity caused by damage to buildings and  other facilities at bases                                                                                                   | Chronic                                                |\n| Increase in carbon prices Strengthening of environment-related regulations and standards Increase in climate-related legislation           | \u25cf  Decreases in the corporate value of portfolio companies and in the  value of the assets held by the Company due to higher carbon  prices \u25cf  Influence in liability insurance payments                                       | Policies and  regulations                              |\n| Technological innovation toward the transition to  a decarbonized society                                                                  | \u25cf  Decreases in the corporate value of portfolio companies that have  missed the transition to a decarbonized society and in the value of  the assets held by the Company                                                      | Technology                                             |\n| Changes in the demand for and supply of products  and services                                                                             | \u25cf  Decline in revenue due to technological innovation and inability to  ascertain changes in customer needs                                                                                                                    | Markets                                                |\n| Changing customer and societal awareness of initiatives  surrounding the transition to a decarbonized society                              | \u25cf  Drastic increase in the need for insurance for renewable energy  \u25cf  Reputational damage due to the Company\u029fs efforts being deemed  inadequate                                                                               | Reputation Resource efficiency,  energy sources,       |\n| Demand for products and services aligned with  changes in energy sources and designed to  increase resilience; changes in public awareness | projects \u25cf  Increase in investment and financing opportunities on the back of  companies\u029f increasing funding needs associated with response to  decarbonization \u25cf  Increase in disaster prevention and mitigation needs toward | products and services,  markets and resilience         |\n\nAs is described in the 'risk management' items below, we identify the 'risk of major wind and flood disasters' as a 'material risk' that will have an extremely large impact on our financial soundness and business continuity. We believe such risks could increase in frequency and severity, owing to the effects of climate change.\n\n## Scenario Analysis\n\nScenario analysis is the process of identifying and evaluating the potential impact of climate change based on certain scenarios. The Group believes it can be flexible and resilient to these\n\nimpacts, as most non-life insurance policies are relatively short term and the Group's assets under management are highly liquid financial assets.\n\n## (1) Physical Risks\n\nPhysical risks are those related to physical impacts of climate change. Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, which could impact claims payments and business continuity. We conduct a scenario analysis of physical risks as part of our efforts to identify and assess their impact. The Group takes part in the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). Using analysis and assessment\n\ntools developed by UNEP FI's climate change impact assessment project, we have created the following assessment of the impact of changes in the intensity (wind speed) and number of tropical cyclones on our insurance payments under the IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario forecast as of 2050.\n\n## \u25b6Changes in Insurance Payments in 2050\n\n| Intensity (wind speed)   |                | Number                     |\n|--------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| +5\uff05 to +53\uff05            | -30\uff05 to +28\uff05 | Japan (typhoons)           |\n| 0\uff05 to +37\uff05             | -36\uff05 to +30\uff05 | United States (hurricanes) |\n\n- * The figures above reflect economic losses, assuming the same impact on insurance payments.\n- * The figures above show the rate of change from current weather conditions (1980-2000) to those in around 2050.\n\nThe Tokio Marine Research Institute, a Group company, began conducting research in 2007 to evaluate and calculate the impact on insurance loss of changes in wind disaster risk associated with typhoons under future climate conditions (impact under the IPCC's RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios) and changes in flood risk due to increased rainfall (impact resulting from temperature increases of 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C). Referring to the results of this scenario analysis, we assess the impact on underwriting of natural disasters resulting from increasingly severe climate change.\n\nFuture projections of climate change scenarios are subject to\n\n## a. Change in Weather Events\n\nHow a weather event will change due to the impact of climate change and the degree of confidence of such an impact forecast will vary depending on the type of weather event. Figure 1 shows the confidence of climate change impact projections by weather event type. Notably, the confidence in impact projections is greater for extreme rainfall compared to tropical cyclones, such as typhoons and hurricanes. However, the impact on extreme rainfall entails more uncertainty compared to temperature variations such as extreme heat or extreme cold.\n\nFor extreme rainfall and tropical cyclones (typhoons in Japan and hurricanes in the United States), which are two weather events that considerably affect Tokio Marine Group, we consider the impact of climate change as follows.\n\nuncertainties, as described later (see p. 77). In assessing the impact of climate change, it is also important to evaluate not only weather phenomena but also the vulnerability\n\nof society to disasters as well as the extent to which real estate and personal properties will be concentrated in areas exposed to natural disaster risk in the future and the extent to which their asset values will increase (in other words, the extent to which asset concentration will change). The basis for these projections and assessments is indicated in the following pages.\n\nHow well we understand the likely influence on event types in general\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Created by Tokio Marine Holdings based on material prepared by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\n## \u25b6Impact of Climate Change on Heavy Rains\n\nIn Japan, the frequency of heavy rains has been on the rise since 1900 (Figure 2). The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report released in August 2021 states that heavy rains will become more severe in the future in step with a temperature rise and that for every temperature rise of about 1\u00baC, the intensity (precipitation) of heavy rains will increase by approximately 7%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As climate change affects each of these factors, the impact of climate change on tropical cyclones consequently becomes more uncertain. Looking at past trends, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report reported an increase in the number of strong typhoons in Japan. However, the certainty level is not yet high, and longer-term, higher-quality observations will be needed to monitor changes in long-term\n\ntrends (Japan Meteorological Agency).\n\nAs for hurricanes making landfall in the United States, even though the ratio of intense hurricanes has risen over the past 40 years, a longer-term survey covering the period from 1900 revealed that there is no discernible trend either in the number of hurricanes or the intensity of those hurricanes (IPCC Sixth Assessment Report).\n\nFigure 3: Number of hurricanes in the United States Source: Created by Tokio Marine based on Klotzbach et al. 2018*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * \uff1a Philip J.

Amer.\n\nIn the future, while the number of tropical cyclones is expected to level off or decrease overall, the ratio of intense tropical cyclones is forecast to increase. As such, there are both decrease and\n\nincrease projections for the number of intense tropical cyclones (IPCC Sixth Assessment Report).\n\nFigure 4: Changes in tropical cyclones due to a temperature change of +2\u00baC Source: Created by Tokio Marine Holdings based on Knutson et al. 2020*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *\uff1a Thomas Knutson, Suzana J.

Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc.,\n\n## b. Changes in Vulnerabilities in Society and Asset Exposure\n\nAs shown in Figure 2 on p. 75, the frequency of heavy rains in Japan has been increasing since 1900. Figure 5 below, on the other hand, shows a declining trend for flooded areas. This is\n\nbecause Japan's disaster prevention infrastructure, including embankments, has improved since the mid-19th century and is effectively reducing the occurrence of floods during heavy rains.\n\nYear\n\nFigure 5: Areas inundated by floods (ha) Source: Tokio Marine Holdings based on materials from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (flood statistics)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe amount of damage will vary significantly if there is a change in asset exposure, that is, a change in the degree of concentration of assets or in the value of assets in areas exposed to natural disaster risk. In this way, we recognize that identifying\n\nchanges in weather events themselves, such as heavy rains and typhoons, as well as society's vulnerabilities to disasters and changes in asset exposure are essential in predicting damage due to natural disasters.\n\n## \u25b6Change of Vulnerabilities in Society\n\nIn Japan, revisions to the Building Standards Act have proved to directly translate into the better resilience of society. In fact, revisions made in 1981 to the seismic building codes and in 2000 to the wind pressure resistance building codes have greatly contributed to the improved resistance of buildings against natural disasters. More recently, Typhoon Faxai, which made landfall in 2019 and caused damage to the roofs of many houses, has prompted revisions to the standards for roofing on countermeasures against intense winds that were enacted in January 2022. In addition, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has announced its policy that the anticipated intensification of natural disasters should be considered in improving disaster prevention infrastructure in the\n\nfuture, making its recommendations for rivers in 2019 and for high tides in 2020.\n\nOverseas, efforts to increase resilience throughout society have also been under way. The United States, for example, has improved its disaster prevention infrastructure and revised building codes following huge natural disasters, including Hurricanes Katrina in 2005, Sandy in 2012, and Irma in 2017.\n\nIn keeping with the move toward strengthening resilience in and outside Japan, Tokio Marine Group has been contributing to greater resilience of the entire society by supporting customers to cope with disasters through the dissemination of disaster information.",

Over the period from 2015 to 2040, even though the number of households in the country is projected to\n\ndecline 4.8% on a national average, an increase is expected in some prefectures, including Tokyo. As such, the trend of changes in asset exposure varies from region to region.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrom the viewpoint of damage due to natural disasters, an important factor is the exact location of assets (whether within a hazardous area). In response to the frequent occurrence of natural disasters in recent years, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,\n\nTransport and Tourism has stated that it is important to consider flood risk reduction when determining the locations of housing districts and city functions. Accordingly, Tokio Marine Group is monitoring the policy trends of the national and local governments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 7: Direction of urban development based on the risk of water-related disasters\n\nSource: Tokio Marine Holdings based on materials from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (website)\n\nThe importance of changes in asset accumulation when considering the damages caused by natural disasters is a common factor, both domestically and internationally. While it is known that the economic losses from past hurricanes have been on the rise in the United States,\n\nadjusting for the influence of asset accumulation reveals a reduced trend of significant changes. This emphasizes that the increase in economic losses is largely attributed to asset accumulation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * \uff1a Philip J. Klotzbach, Steven G.

As the global momentum toward decarbonization accelerates and the transition to a decarbonized society progresses, we anticipate more stringent regulations, technological innovation, asset value fluctuations and changes in the investment environment as well as in customer needs, which could affect the Group's businesses.\n\nTransition risks include impact on the corporate value of investee companies and the value of assets held by the Company due to increased costs associated with GHG emissions resulting from climate change. To reduce the impact of these factors, we are decreasing total holdings of business-related equities and promoting engagement with investee companies.\n\nWe have estimated the impact of transition risks on assets under management by Tokio Marine Group (equities, corporate bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), and government bonds) using 'Aladdin Climate,' a model provided by\n\nBlackRock Solutions. With the model, we have quantified the impact on corporate value due to changes in scenario variables (carbon prices, energy demand, fuel prices, emissions, etc.) based on scenarios provided by The Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). More specifically, the quantification of the impact on corporate value has been conducted by comparing the scenario where current policies continue to 2050 (NGFS's Hot House World-Current Policies scenario, assuming limited policy changes and a 3.3\u00b0C temperature rise at the end of this century) with the following two scenarios, also of NGFS.\n\n(1) Orderly: Net Zero 2050 (assuming a temperature rise suppressed to 1.5\u00b0C and net zero CO2 emissions both by 2050) (2) Disorderly: Delayed Transition (assuming a 1.8\u00b0C temperature rise by 2050 due to delayed policy changes)\n\nThe following shows the results of the model-based estimates of transition risks of assets (equities, corporate bonds, CMBS, and government bonds) (impact analysis on asset prices based on scenarios up to 2050) held by Tokio Marine Group as of March 31, 2023.\n\n|                  | Transition risks   | Transition risks   |\n|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                  | Orderly            | Disorderly         |\n| Total            | -1.5%              | -1.3%              |\n| Equities         | -7.7%              | -5.6%              |\n| Corporate bonds  | -2.4%              | -1.8%              |\n| CMBS             | -0.0%              | -0.2%              |\n| Government bonds | -0.0%              | -0.4%              |\n\n- * The Aladdin Climate analytics of BlackRock Solutions contained in this report should not be construed as a characterization of the materiality or financial impact of the corresponding information.

Moreover, we believe that this and other quantification models of climate change are\n\nstill in the development stage, undergoing upgrades based on the latest research findings. We thus have no plan, at this point, to use the data in our management decision-making process, but will continue to carry out research and investigations to explore more appropriate ways to utilize such quantification modeling methods.\n\n## Implementation of Climate Change Strategy\n\n## (1) Initiatives of Tokio Marine Group\n\nTokio Marine Group assumes the roles of an insurance company, institutional investor, asset manager, global company, and good corporate citizen. In every role, we are promoting the creation of a\n\nsafe, secure, and sustainable future to protect our customers and local communities in times of need even 100 years from now. In the following sections, we describe our initiatives in each role.\n\n## a. Initiatives as an Insurance Company (Insurance Products and Services)\n\nTokio Marine Group engages in the development and provision of insurance products and services that support the transition to a decarbonized society. As one example, we provide insurance related to renewable energy. There is momentum toward decarbonization worldwide and a shift to renewable energy in major countries for a more efficient electricity supply. In building and expanding the use of offshore wind power generation plants, for example, insurance is indispensable as project financing will not be extended without insurance. However, offshore construction work is never easy, and there is also a need to reduce work errors and prepare for typhoons. It thus represents a challenging domain requiring high levels of underwriting and claims services capabilities.\n\nTokio Marine Group has acquired GCube Insurance Services, Inc., a leading company offering insurance to renewable energy operators. Based on its advanced underwriting and claims services capabilities, we are driving the more widespread use of renewable energy on a global basis through insurance underwriting and insurance payments, seamlessly covering everything from the construction phase to the operational phase after the launch.\n\nIn February 2021, Tokio Marine & Nichido (TMNF), a Group company, established the company-wide Green Transformation (GX) Task Force to support customers' efforts to become carbon neutral and transition to a decarbonized society and contribute to the growth and development of the industry.\n\nThe Task Force is engaging in the development and provision of insurance products and solutions that will contribute to the more widespread use of renewable energy, including offshore wind power and solar power, the spread of storage batteries, and the promotion of the use of hydrogen. Specific efforts to contribute to customers' transition to a decarbonized society are multifaceted. They include developing defect warranty insurance for the liability of contractors constructing offshore wind power generation plants; undertaking an initiative to support local communities in achieving decarbonization by utilizing a solar\n\npower purchase agreement (PPA) model; developing insurance products to help electricity retailers to stabilize their management and secure a power supply capacity; and providing a service to support information disclosures based on the TCFD recommendations.\n\nWe believe that engagement on the theme of the environment with business partners is essential to shift to a decarbonized society and realize carbon neutrality. To date, TMNF has made engagement and held dialogue with more than 250 companies. Of these, the company has offered solutions to resolve various issues to more than 120 companies while leveraging its expertise.\n\nAs one engagement example, TMNF has been holding dialogue with power plants for which the company has provided insurance. The company encourages them to consider the environment through the adoption of innovative high-efficiency power generation technologies and carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage technologies (CCUS/carbon recycling) that reduce GHG emissions and supports their transition by providing relevant products and consulting services.\n\nIn November 2022, TMNF also launched, jointly with MUFG Bank, Ltd., a service to support disclosures of climate change risks and opportunities and other related information in accordance with the TCFD recommendations as a service solution to help companies promote GX.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Initiatives as an Institutional Investor (Investment and Financing)\n\nAs a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) through Group companies TMNF and Tokio Marine Asset Management, we have established a policy concerning environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment and financing, considering not only financial information but also ESG elements. By incorporating climate-related elements into the investment decision-making process, we are supporting the transition to a decarbonized society.\n\nSpecifically, we are undertaking ESG engagement to support increased corporate value and the sustainable growth of investee companies through constructive and purposeful dialogue that considers non-financial factors including ESG elements in addition to their financial data as well as ESG integration where both financial data and non-financial data are used in the investment decision-making process.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, TMNF established a team to carry out impact investment that generates both social and economic value and has made investment commitments to renewable energy, environmental, and other funds conducive to countering climate change. In fiscal 2023, the company committed to investment in a new field, specifically a forestry fund, to promote the passing down\n\nof valuable forest resources to future generations.\n\nAs for our ongoing themed investment and financing efforts, such as those related to green bonds and sustainability bonds, we are also promoting the creation of social and economic value in new fields. In fiscal 2022, we invested in Japan's first blue bonds to support the investee companies' efforts related to environmentally sustainable fishery and aquafarming businesses. We have also invested in transition bonds issued by gas, iron and steel, and other companies. In this way, we have been providing a broad range of support for the realization of a decarbonized society in the investment and financing field.\n\nThe total balance of ESG-themed investments and financing, including green bonds, sustainability bonds, and green loans, was about 109 billion yen as of March 31, 2023, for TMNF, TMNL, and NF. In fiscal 2022, TMNF started making impact investments in funds with measurable social returns, such as renewable energy funds. Such commitments amounted to approximately 13 billion yen as of March 31, 2023.\n\nWe have also begun using data providers to conduct quantitative analyses of the GHG emissions of our investee companies.\n\n## c. Initiatives as an Asset Manager (Fund Formation)\n\nTokio Marine Asset Management has been operating a renewable energy fund targeting investments in solar power plants since 2012, effectively backing initiatives aimed at the transition to a decarbonized society.\n\nPerformance of renewable energy funds (total as of March 31, 2023)\n\n| Amount committed \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7   | Approx. 62 billion yen                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Units installed                                           | \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 45 |\n| Power generation capacity (DC) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7     | Approx. 280 MW                                                                                 |\n\n## d. Initiatives as a Global Company (Leading Discussions at International Climate Change Conferences)\n\nAs climate change is an important social issue that needs to be addressed by the entire world, Tokio Marine Group actively engages in dialogue with international organizations, governments, industries, academic communities, NPOs, and NGOs.\n\nWe have led discussions at international conferences, which includes co-chairing a climate change-related working group for the Geneva Association since 2008. We have also joined the Association's climate change task force and have been engaging in the formulation of scenario analysis and stress test guidelines to perform forward-looking impact assessment of climate change.\n\nIn July 2018, TMNF became a founding member of the insurer pilot group, launched by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) under the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) framework to examine and develop methodologies and analytical tools for the insurance industry to make climate-related disclosures based on the TCFD recommendations. The company has contributed to the publication of the final report of the UNEP FI pilot project, titled 'Insuring the climate transition,' in January 2021.\n\nTokio Marine Kiln(TMK) and Tokio Marine HCC International from Tokio Marine Group have joined ClimateWise, a climate change-related international initiative in the insurance industry. They have been carrying out studies and research on various risks and opportunities related to climate change jointly with about 30 leading insurers in the world.\n\nTMK is also a member of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, an insurance industry task force envisioned by the then Prince Charles of England and established in June 2021.\n\nIn Japan, the then Chairman of the Board of Tokio Marine Holdings worked as one of the founders and contributed to the establishment of the TCFD Consortium in May 2019. Since the establishment, Tokio Marine Holdings has been a member of the Planning Committee to deliberate on the consortium's course of action. We have contributed to the creation of the three versions of the TCFD Guidance released in December 2018, July 2020, and October 2022, respectively, and 'A Guide to Flood Risk Assessments for Enhanced TCFD Disclosures' released by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in March 2023. We also participate in discussion on effective ways for companies to disclose climate-related information and how to link the disclosed information to appropriate investment decision-making of financial and other organizations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdditionally, through industry-academia collaboration with The University of Tokyo, Nagoya University, Kyoto University, and Tohoku University, we engage in research on climate change and natural disaster risks in an effort to gain deeper scientific insight into disaster prevention and mitigation and to raise the sophistication of measuring methods through risk modeling to ascertain risk volume in even greater detail. Our efforts in this area include development of a stochastic risk assessment approach. We believe that in addition to providing products and services in developed countries it is also important to\n\ndisseminate the ideas of an insurance mechanism and risk management practices in developing countries and regions particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change and natural disasters in accordance with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which provides new world guidelines for disaster risk reduction.\n\nTokio Marine Group is contributing to the creation of international rules and the progress in research on climate change and natural disaster risks through these initiatives.\n\n## e. Initiatives as a Good Corporate Citizen (Social Contribution)\n\nMangrove forests have an effect on the prevention and mitigation of global warming by absorbing and fixing a significant volume of CO2. Under the concept of 'Insurance for the Future of the Earth,' TMNF has engaged in the Mangrove Planting Project since 1999. As of March 31, 2023, approximately 12,261 hectares of mangrove forest have been planted through this project in nine countries, primarily in Asia. In addition to TMNF, other Group companies are now planting mangroves. We have also announced the Mangrove-Based Value Co-creation 100-Year Declaration, which aims to create value through the blessings of nature brought by mangroves in collaboration with forestry NGOs. Under the declaration, we will continue to undertake this project in the future.\n\nIn 2022, we launched activities to protect eelgrass beds. Eelgrass is a type of seagrass, which grows in sandy, shallow waters with sunlight and gentle waves. It has a high ability to absorb and fixate CO2 from the atmosphere as well as purify water. Together with mangroves, we will promote this initiative as an effort to protect the global environment.\n\nAt every age, educating and enlightening children who will lead the future is a great responsibility adults must assume. Around the\n\nworld, Tokio Marine Group is visiting schools to provide Green Lessons and Disaster Prevention Lessons to children to raise their environmental awareness and disaster preparedness.\n\nWith our strong belief that 'it is our responsibility to pass on a bright future to future generations,' Tokio Marine Holdings has positioned future generations as its stakeholders in addition to customers, society, employees, shareholders, and investors since 2021. We will step up our tree planting, education, and other efforts to pass on a sustainable environment and society to these future generations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (2) Policies Concerning Insurance Underwriting as well as Investment and Financing\n\nOur basic policy on climate change is to support the decarbonization of customers and local communities through insurance products and services as well as investments and financing through constructive dialogue with stakeholders. We individually set up a policy on each transaction for the areas that could cause significant, negative impacts on the environment or society.\n\nAt the end of September 2020, we published 'Tokio Marine: Our Climate Strategy,' which we revised at the end of September 2021 and the end of September 2022. The following sections describe our policies concerning insurance underwriting as well as investment and financing to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\n## a. Insurance Underwriting\n\nTokio Marine Group has not provided new insurance underwriting capacities to coal-fired power generation projects since September 2020 or thermal coal mining projects since September 2021, regardless of whether they are newly constructed. However, we might grant exceptions after careful consideration for projects with innovative technologies and approaches, such as CCS/CCUS* 1 and mixed combustion, aiming to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nSince September 2022, Tokio Marine Group has also strengthened its commitment by protecting the environment and supporting the transition to a decarbonized society by no longer providing new insurance underwriting capacities to oil and gas company extraction projects* 2 in the Arctic Circle (all areas north of latitude 66\u00b033, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR) and oil sands mining.\n\n- *1 Carbon dioxide capture and storage/Carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage\n- *2 Exemptions for projects/companies with decarbonization plans that are aligned with the Paris Agreement\n\n## b. Investment and Financing\n\nWith respect to investment and financing, Tokio Marine Group will not provide new financing for coal-fired power generation projects or thermal coal mining projects. However, as with our insurance underwriting policy, we might grant exceptions after careful consideration for projects with innovative technologies and approaches, such as CCS/CCUS and mixed combustion, aiming to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn aligning with our insurance underwriting policy, we also no longer provide new financing for oil and gas extraction projects in the Arctic Circle and oil sands mining and are stepping up our efforts to support the protection of the natural environment and transition to a decarbonized society.",

Through the ERM cycle, we comprehensively identify and assess risks, using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. In the insurance business, which pursues profit through risk-taking, risk\n\n## (1) Qualitative Risk Management\n\nWe identify all forms of risks comprehensively, including those for natural disasters such as major storms, and emerging risks due to environmental changes. Of these risks, we define risks that will have an extremely large impact on our financial soundness and business continuity as 'material risks.' We include the risk of major wind and flooding disasters (including climate change\n\nphysical risks) in the 'material risks' category, which we believe could become more frequent and severe due to the effects of climate change. For these material risks, we also formulate control measures prior to risk emergence and response measures for after risks occur.\n\n## (2) Quantitative Risk Management\n\nFor material risks, through measuring risk amounts and implementing stress tests, we are able to perform a multifaceted review of the adequacy of capital relative to the risks held for the purpose of maintaining ratings and preventing bankruptcy. We calculate risk amounts posed by natural disasters using a risk model (for Japan, a risk model we developed in-house based on engineering theory and the latest knowledge of natural disasters, and for overseas, models provided by outside vendors). We independently analyze past tropical cyclones (typhoons in Japan and hurricanes in the United States), torrential rains, and other changing trends and incorporate this data as necessary in order\n\nto properly assess current weather phenomena. Furthermore, within material risks, we conduct stress tests based on scenarios in which extreme economic losses are expected and scenarios where multiple material risks occur at the same time. As for risks involving major wind and flood disasters, for example, we assume these scenarios to be on a much larger scale than the major typhoons that hit the Greater Tokyo Area in 2018 and 2019 causing extensive damages. We update scenarios continuously while taking into account stress tests released by regulatory authorities of every country, the latest knowledge (including that of climate change), and recent case studies.\n\n## Appropriately Control Risk through Risk Diversification and Reinsurance, etc.\n\nNatural disasters are inevitable in Japan, our home market. For that reason, we have sought to control risk capital by geographic, business, and product risk diversification through M&A overseas. In addition, reinsurance, as a hedge against risk, is also an effective way to protect our capital and stabilize profits. The\n\nGroup utilizes reinsurance to prepare for natural disasters (capital events) that occur once every few centuries, and we determine earnings coverage from the standpoint of economic rationality and take necessary measures.\n\n## Acquisition of Knowledge (Industry-Academia Collaboration, etc.)\n\nTokio Marine Group is deepening collaboration with both inside and outside experts to acquire knowledge about risks. Tokio Marine Research Institute collaborates with The University of Tokyo, Nagoya University, and Kyoto University, among others, to carry out impact analysis based on the possibility for increased insurance losses associated with natural disasters that are\n\nbecoming more severe in nature. Moreover, Tokio Marine dR and a team of experts in natural disasters working in Atlanta, the United States, are leading efforts to upgrade natural disaster risk management across the entire Group, including various evaluations of natural disaster risk models.\n\nassessment is the foundation of our business. The Group has been working for many years to assess material risks (including those due to natural disasters) both quantitatively and qualitatively. Specific initiatives are as follows.\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\nWhile Tokio Marine withdrew from the international initiative, the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), in May 2023, our commitment to contributing to the transition towards a decarbonized society based on the Paris Agreement remains unchanged.\n\n## Metrics and Targets for Fiscal 2050\n\n## \u25cfReduction of GHG emissions\n\nAiming to reduce GHG (CO2) emissions from Tokio Marine Group to net zero by fiscal 2050 for our own operations (including insurance customers and investment and financing recipients)* 1,2\n\n## Metrics and Targets for Fiscal 2030\n\n## \u25cfReduction of GHG emissions\n\nReducing GHG emissions (CO2) for operations from Tokio Marine Group by 60% (vs. 2015)* 3\n\n## \u25cfRenewable electricity use\n\nUsing 100% of renewable electricity at Tokio Marine Group's major business facilities\n\n- \u25cfElectrification of company-owned vehicles (TMNF, TMNL, and NF) Switching all vehicles owned by TMNF, TMNL, and NF to electrified vehicles (EV, PHV, HV, etc.)\n\n## Metrics and Targets for Fiscal 2023 (Increase or Improvement vs. Fiscal 2020)\n\nIncreasing income from insurance premiums on GX-related insurance products by around 7 billion yen (TMNF)\n\n\u25cfIncrease in insurance products that will contribute to green transformation (GX) \u25cfImprovement of profitability of fire insurance\n\nImproving profitability of fire insurance by more than 45 billion yen* 4 (TMNF)\n\n- *1: Medium-term targets still under consideration\n- *2: Scope 3, Category 15, based on the GHG Protocol standards\n- *3: Associated with our own business activities (Scope 1 [direct emissions] + Scope 2 [indirect emissions] + Scope 3 [other indirect emissions; Categories 1, 3, 5, and 6] based on the GHG Protocol standards)\n- Scope 3 includes categories of importance to the Group for which numerical values can be obtained.\n- *4: Supposing natural catastrophe claims in an average year\n\n## GHG Emission Reduction Record\n\n## Achieve Carbon Neutrality in Business Activities\n\n- \u25cfReduction of GHG (CO2) emissions from Tokio Marine Group operations* 5 : 80,201 tons (34% reduction vs. fiscal 2015) (Scope 1: 13,362 tons; Scope 2: 41,190 tons; Scope 3* 6 : 25,649 tons)\n- \u25cfAmount of GHG (CO2) fixed and reduced: 93,000 tons\n\nTokio Marine Group is working to reduce the environmental impact (domestic and international) and become carbon neutral by (1) conserving energy and using energy more efficiently, (2) planting mangroves to absorb and fix CO2, (3) using renewable energy (such as by procuring green electricity), and (4) amortizing\n\ncarbon credits. As a result of these efforts, in fiscal 2022 we achieved carbon neutrality for the tenth consecutive year (since fiscal 2013) thanks to the absorption and fixation effects of mangrove planting and the use of carbon credits outperforming the CO2 emissions generated by the Group's overall business activities.\n\n## GHG Emissions for Investment Portfolio\n\nTo assess the climate change-related risks and opportunities of its investee companies and financing recipients, TMNF has performed analysis of total GHG emissions and weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) on its domestic listed equity and bond portfolios as of March 31, 2022, the disclosure of which is\n\nrecommended by the TCFD (see p. 26 of the TCFD Report). We will continue to urge our investee companies to fully disclose climate change-related information and work toward a decarbonized society through engagement, while also making use of this analysis.",

The insurance business, being a 'People's Business,' thrives on the trust forged by individuals, and I firmly believe that maximizing this strength is key to realizing our Purpose. Since our establishment in 1879, we have positioned human capital as the driving force for growth and our most valuable asset, wholeheartedly embracing human capital management. In June 2023, we released the Human Capital Report to share our vision and concrete initiatives. Here, I will provide an overview of its essence.\n\n## Human Resources Strategy Aimed at Facilitating Business Strategy\n\nOur human resources strategy is designed to enhance the probability of realizing the goals of our business strategy and propel Group growth. Of particular importance are the building of a talent portfolio aligned with business concepts and the establishment of an organizational environment where the potential of such talent can be fully realized. As a result, our human resources strategy is built upon 'People' and 'Corporate culture,' working in harmony to create synergies that uphold and further enhance our distinctive capability of 'Integrated Group Management.'\n\nBy constructing a strategically aligned talent portfolio and fostering high engagement among individuals, we aim to achieve growth in each business. Strengthening our Group management structure enhances management decision-making, enabling more effective execution of 'In/Out' strategies. The foundation of this lies in nurturing an organizational culture and Group unity to further drive the growth of each business and elevate the quality of\n\ndecision-making. This virtuous cycle embodies our vision for human capital management and serves as a force for improving our ROE to match global peers.\n\n## \u02a0People\u02a1 Supporting Integrated Group Management\n\nFor human resources, we identify the capabilities required to execute and realize our business strategy. We then evaluate the disparities between these capabilities and reality, taking steps to bridge these gaps. Looking ahead, we have identified areas to strengthen: 'Group management talent,\" 'highly specialized professionals,\" and 'globally adept individuals.' Our focus is on recruiting and nurturing talent in these areas. For instance, to consistently produce global management talent to steer the future of integrated Group management, we actively advance talent management across the Group, drawing from the human resource system introduced to Tokio Marine Holdings in 2019. We routinely hold discussions concerning diverse global talent, and in April, we established the unique development program, Tokio Marine Leadership Institute (TLI), to nurture future Group management leaders as we look to expand training beyond borders. Fostering unity through such programs fuels synergies across the Group.\n\nConsistent with efforts to strengthen expertise throughout the Group, which we recognize is the wellspring of new added value, we take care in ensuring that the right human resources brought into the Group through M&As and other means are assigned to the right place on a global basis.\n\nIn addition, Chief Officers work closely together to hire highly specialized personnel in the field of corporate functions and to develop data scientists internally.\n\n## \u25b6The Human Capital Report Released in June 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u02a0Corporate Culture\u02a1 Supporting Integrated Group Management\n\nCentral to all human capital management endeavors is each employee's alignment with the Group's Purpose. Our Purpose acts as a guiding light for the entire Group, providing a sense of direction. To unite our diverse workforce of over 40,000 individuals worldwide and unleash their full potential, the CEO spearheads initiatives as Chief Culture Officer (CCO), driven by a strong belief in embedding these principles.\n\nMoreover, a 'culture of growth' has taken root wherein each individual actively pursues self-improvement and positively influences others. This culture has thrived due to our history and continued efforts in addressing social challenges since our inception. It stands as our unique advantage, fostered by the ongoing sharing of these values among our employees. Through initiatives that embed our Purpose, we share the role we have played in addressing social issues and the genuine aspirations of our employees, making the Purpose a personal commitment. Employees who internalize the Purpose then experience a sense of societal trust through their work and derive the motivation to contribute to future problem-solving. This cycle, we believe, also contributes to enhancing overall organizational engagement.\n\nHowever, in today's rapidly changing business landscape with increasingly complex societal issues, it is vital to leverage the knowledge and experiences of our diverse employees in management. We have positioned the promotion of Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) as part of our growth strategy and are taking related steps. To cater to varied work preferences, we have introduced new work styles, including remote work to overcome location restrictions, flexible hours for individual scheduling, internal\n\nside jobs for cross-departmental project participation based on interest, and external side jobs that allow employees to bring the growth gained from new networks and experiences, which might not be accessible within the Company, back to their work tasks. The aim is to bolster employee growth by enhancing satisfaction and optimizing time.\n\nWithin this context, we conduct employee perception surveys to regularly gauge employee and organizational status, following a PDCA cycle to identify challenges and enact solutions. We prioritize employee satisfaction, motivation, and organizational culture. These factors are set as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the executive compensation evaluations. Management leads efforts to boost employee engagement and nurture an organizational culture, actively driving these initiatives forward.\n\n## Achieving Sustainable Growth through the Synergy of \u02a0People\u02a1 and \u02a0Corporate Culture\u02a1\n\nThe concepts of 'People' and 'Corporate culture' I have discussed are closely intertwined. Our corporate culture, built on Group unity and increased engagement, helps attract and retain valuable talent. Meanwhile, appropriate human resource recruitment, development, and placement generates both personal and corporate growth, further enriching Group unity and employee engagement. Through ongoing efforts, we will sustain this synergy and virtuous cycle to foster lasting growth. Irrespective of how much global conditions and the business environment change, the fact remains that people are the cornerstone of our competitiveness. We will continue to invest in our human resources, practicing human capital management to ensure we support customers in times of need for the next century.\n\n## Tokio Marine Group \u0336 Our People (Our Philosophy on Human Resources)\n\n- \u25cf Our people are the most valuable asset of our Group and a key driver of our Good Company vision.\n- \u25cf We aim to attract and retain the best talent in every aspect of our business to ensure we deliver safety and security to our customers and their communities.\n- \u25cf Our people bring passion and a challenging spirit to their endeavors, and we provide them opportunities for career development and ongoing personal growth.\n- \u25cf Our people embody diversity, and we value inclusion as a truly global company. We work hard to create a business environment where we can achieve our full potential as we continue our endless journey to be a Good Company.",

As CDO, my objective is to harness our intellectual assets, encompassing the Group's exclusive data and digital technology, as a source of competitive advantage. In addition to the drive towards global digital synergies, I aim for evolving into a company that always supports its customers and streamlining internal business processes.\n\nOver the course of many years, we have amassed, analyzed, and effectively utilized extensive volumes of data through our underwriting and claims services. Leveraging this intellectual capital, Tokyo Marine dR Co., Ltd. (TdR), plays a pivotal role as our data-centric subsidiary (see p. 41), enabling us to unlock its full potential. Its endeavors encompass novel domains such as advanced data-driven underwriting, data solutions, and embedded insurance. Moreover, the reach of data goes beyond our internal resources; strategic partnerships with external entities can extend data and distribution models, leading to innovative value generation. By continually honing our intellectual capital and fostering collaboration as part of our social capital, we strive to broaden the horizons of our value proposition.\n\n## Evolve into a Company That Always Supports Its Customers, Creating New Profit Streams\n\nTo continue fulfilling our Purpose of protecting customers and society in their times of need, we aim to go beyond mere insurance payouts during emergencies to cover both preventive and responsive measures and expand the domains we provide value in. This includes preventing accidents, alleviating burdens in case of incidents, facilitating swift recovery, and preventing recurrences. We are intensifying efforts in disaster prevention and mitigation, focusing on both pre- and post-disaster domains by sharing expertise to drive novel business ventures through the CORE, disaster prevention consortium (see pp. 37, 96), together with over 100 partners. Several ventures have already progressed to the commercialization phase, and in the coming decade, we intend to nurture these into substantial profit streams of several billion yen, alongside our existing businesses.\n\nWe aim to leverage intellectual capital in the form of the Group\u029fs data and digital technology as a source of competitive advantage to evolve into a company that always supports its customers and transforms internal business processes.\n\n## Masashi Namatame\n\nManaging Executive Officer Group Chief Digital Officer (CDO)\n\n## Reform of Internal Business Processes\n\nOver the course of approximately two decades, we have diligently pursued enhanced operational efficiency by undertaking substantial process reforms. In line with this, the ongoing Mirai Project at TMNF is seen as an extension of these efforts, aimed at digitally streamlining the operational workflows of our insurance business. Within the framework of the Mirai Project, improvements in contract procedures and the automation of insurance claims processes are anticipated to yield a reduction in administrative burden by approximately 15%, from the end of fiscal 2019 (equivalent to a profit contribution of 20-25 billion yen annually) by fiscal 2023. As of the end of fiscal 2022, this effect had reached 9%.\n\nIn addition, we are actively exploring the application of generative AI, which has gained significant attention across diverse fields. Generative AI demonstrates competence in understanding text and generating responses, presenting opportunities for enhancing operational productivity and elevating customer service standards within the insurance industry. Nevertheless, the insurance industry, characterized by intricate dialogues laden with specialized terminology, poses specific hurdles for the practical integration of generative AI. Additionally, harnessing this technology necessitates the mitigation of various risks, encompassing concerns related to data leaks and potential copyright violations.\n\nTo tackle these obstacles, we have partnered with PKSHA Technology Inc. and Microsoft Japan Co., Ltd., to create safeguards against external data leaks and secondary usage of input information. Leveraging our extensive repository of manuals and insurance policy terms, we are in the process of crafting a dedicated interactive AI tailored to the insurance domain.\n\nBy conducting a trial operation of this interactive AI, initiated in June 2023, our objective is to continue gathering insights and address any remaining risks. Our aim is to roll out this feature for widespread employee usage by the end of fiscal 2024. In addition, we will explore and pursue new use cases that maximize the potential of generative AI, aiming to enhance operational productivity and customer service excellence.\n\nOur commitment lies in driving additional growth by channeling the time generated from these endeavors into creating novel profit opportunities.\n\n## Foundation Underpinning Our Intellectual Capital Strategy\n\n## (1) Global Synergies (Development of Global Labs)\n\nIn addition, we are dedicated to strengthening collaboration both domestically and internationally in the digital realm. We are actively engaged in fostering digital synergy globally. Through our network of seven Global Labs and the Digital Roundtable that brings together overseas Group companies, we are facilitating the sharing of diverse knowledge and expertise from around the world. This is accelerating digital transformation (DX) across the Group.\n\n## (2) Investment in and Development of DX Personnel\n\nIn order to expedite these efforts, investing in and nurturing talent with strong DX skills is crucial. We have brought on board approximately 100 dedicated digital experts, encompassing engineers and designers. Graduates from our internal DX talent development program, known as Data Science Hill Climb, are equipped to lead digitalization efforts as proficient data scientists. Additionally, our Project Request System (see p. 89) enables enthusiastic employees nationwide to contribute to projects across corporate departments at the head office. Through these initiatives, we are fostering a united organization-wide approach to propel our DX strategy.\n\n## \u25b6Global Synergies (Development of Global Labs)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTokyo\n\n- \u25cf Oversight of Global Labs\n- \u25cf Investigating trends in cutting-edge technology and new business models in Japan\n- \u25cf Implementing strategic investments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSilicon Valley\n\n- \u25cf Exploring the world\u029fs most advanced technologies and building networks\n- \u25cf Supporting innovation in North American Group companies\n- \u25cf Nurturing digital talent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTaipei\n\n- \u25cf Center of digital development for subsidiaries in Taiwan\n- \u25cf Researching and identifying new business models\n\nLondon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25cf Global oversight of the cyber field \u25cf Researching and identifying start-ups in Europe\n\n## Singapore\n\n- \u25cf Researching and identifying start-ups and new business models in Asia\n- \u25cf Supporting innovation in Asian Group companies\n\nNew York\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25cf Researching and identifying start-ups and new business models in North America (East Coast) \u25cf Supporting innovation in North American Group companies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSao Paulo\n\n- \u25cf Center of digital technology and innovation for subsidiaries in Brazil Researching and identifying new\n- \u25cf business models\n\n## \u25b6Investment in and Cultivation of DX Talent\n\nDevelopment of the Data Science Hill Climb program for training data scientists internally and advancing the in-house development of AI through its graduates\n\nData Science Hill Climb\n\n- \u25cf Conducting comprehensive training supervised by Professor Yutaka Matsuo of The University of Tokyo, totaling over 260 hours\n\n## \u25cf A program aimed at nurturing skilled data scientists\n\n- \u25cf Collaborating with three companies experienced in educating data science personnel: NABLAS Inc., ALBERT Inc., and SKILLUP AI, Ltd.\n\n## External Evaluation (DX Stock 2023)\n\nTokio Marine was again selected as a Digital Transformation Stock (DX Stock) in 2023 following on from our selection in fiscal 2022, marking the first time in the insurance industry to receive the honor two years in a row.

What was the discussion in the Board of Directors?\n\nSecretariat: The COVID-19 losses at the Tokio Marine Taiwanese joint venture announced in August 2022 came as a\n\nmajor surprise. Initially, there were critical voices from the capital markets, asking if it was really necessary to respond to the capital increase and if there would be similar problems at other small, medium, and minor entities. In this context, the capital markets show a strong interest in the content of discussions by\n\n## the Board of Directors.\n\nNagano: First of all, as Chairman of the Board, I would like to apologize for causing concern to the people of the capital markets regarding this matter. As explained by our executives so far, this event occurred due to the change in Taiwan from a zero COVID-19 policy to a coexisting with COVID-19 policy and impacted the whole of the Taiwanese market. However, the loss based on the Tokio Marine equity was about 100 billion yen, and I take it seriously as management because of its scale. Katanozaka: I took the stage at the IR conference in May 2023, where I received questions directly from an analyst about this issue. I answered the question of why the Board of Directors of the Company decided to increase the capital when Tokio Marine,\n\nwhich was a minority at the time, was not legally obligated to cover the excess liabilities as follows.\n\n- \u25cf With regard to the portion of the capital increase to be allocated to the payment of claims, the Board of Directors believes that it is the insurer's responsibility to pay the claims and bear an appropriate burden for that purpose, and made its decision in consideration of its global reputation.\n- \u25cf With regard to the portion to capture future growth in the Taiwanese market, based on detailed figures and facts, we discussed the future of the Taiwanese market and the growth strategies of the Taiwanese joint venture, and evaluated that the economic rationale was comparable to other M&A deals that Tokio Marine has implemented to date.",

        "page_content": "2\n\nNagano: A total of five Board of Directors meetings were held to fully share information and discuss this matter. We spent a lot of time not only on the decision concerning the capital increase that Mr. Katanozaka explained, but also on identifying the true cause of the situation and on the growth strategy of the Taiwanese joint venture and strengthening our Group-level structure based on the true cause. Outside Directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members pointed out many things and gave very useful advice from various angles ranging from management of overseas subsidiaries to geopolitical risks.\n\nThis is something I always try to do, and I want to be open to Outside Directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members, even regarding embarrassing topics, and to engage in candid discussions. By putting this into practice, I think we were able to make the right management decisions, from identifying the true cause of the problem, to increasing our capital and acquiring a major share, and then to formulating measures to strengthen our management structure.\n\nEndo: When a problem arises, as in this case, it is easy to get caught up in the idea of solidifying local top management with people from the headquarters side. While this does not negate the value of having members of the headquarters on the ground, including more sophisticated risk controls and better reporting to\n\nTsuyoshi Nagano\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nheadquarters, it is important to understand that local people will always be needed to fully understand the local context and possibly to engage in tough negotiations with stakeholders. In that regard, after Tokio Marine acquired a major share, it dispatched the Chairperson of the Board as well as an expert in risk control from Tokyo as a CRO as a matter of course, but it appointed as the President a local person who was familiar with the local insurance market. I think that was the right decision.\n\nIn addition, market events such as infectious diseases and natural catastrophes can occur anywhere in the world, and from the perspective of taking advantage of the lessons learned this time, it is also worthy of praise that initiatives to advance ERM management at small, medium, and minor entities (see p. 125) are accelerating on a global basis.\n\nKatanozaka: I offered the advice that to strengthen our cultural fit with local partner companies, it is important to have closer communication with top management and to reform the workplace culture. Under the Tokio Marine Group Purpose, front-line workers and top management, as well as the partner company and Tokio Marine, need to forge stronger ties and turn problems into opportunities.\n\nI think it was very positive for the future that Mr. Komiya, the CEO, visited the site in person and deepened communication with the top management of the partner company.\n\nNagano: As you said, I think it is really important to continue our efforts to spread our corporate culture, even at our small, medium, and minor entities.\n\nKatanozaka: I also raised a few other questions and issues. For example, in Asian regions where various issues such as politics and ethnicity are interwoven, it is essential to improve a wide range of intelligence that goes beyond areas directly related to Tokio Marine operations.\n\nEndo: I agree, and to continuously develop the Taiwanese joint venture in the future, we need to evolve so that we can firmly grasp changes that are difficult to predict, such as changes in COVID-19 policy, and build a strategy based on that.\n\nNagano: I would like to thank the Outside Directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members again for their advice and judgment on this matter from a high-level perspective. But what's really important is the execution phase. We will make steady efforts toward the sustainable growth of the Taiwanese joint venture, including reforming our corporate culture and enhancing our intelligence. We hope that Outside Directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members will continue to make fact-based judgments while receiving status reports from the executive officers.\n\nTokio Marine announced in May 2023 that it would accelerate the sale  of  business-related  equities.  What  was  discussed  by  the Board of Directors?\n\nSecretariat: Even before the establishment of the Corporate Governance Code, Tokio Marine had positioned the reduction of business-related equities as an important management task and has been promoting the sale of business-related equities for the 20 years from fiscal 2002. In May 2022, the policy was revised, and it was announced that they would continue to be sold. Subsequently, we announced in November 2022 that we would accelerate the pace of the sale, and in May 2023 that we would front-load the acceleration (600 billion yen or more over the four years from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026). These initiatives have been well received by the capital markets.\n\nOn the other hand, there are various opinions on business-related equities. For example, some shareholders are opposed to the appointment of the top management when the amount of business-related equity exceeds a certain level of net assets. Please tell us about the 'Evaluation of Tokio Marine's Stance and Initiatives for the reduction of business-related equities' and 'Discussions by the Board of Directors.'\n\nKatanozaka: As the secretariat explained, Tokio Marine has taken a series of measures to meet the expectations of investors regarding the sale of business-related equities. All directors unanimously agree with this policy and direction. Tokio Marine also owns shares in ANA Holdings, of which I am Chairman, and I myself believe that accelerating sales is the right direction, and of course shares of ANA are no exception.\n\nThe Board of Directors discussed not only the pros and cons of the revision of the Guidelines, but also the feasibility of accelerating sales. Specifically, what impact the new policies would have on our client companies, what kind of message would be appropriate to negotiate reductions without damaging our business relationship, and would the sales departments involved in sales negotiations face considerable difficulties were discussed.\n\nOutside Directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members are usually strict, but I was a little surprised at the fact that they made a lot of comments on the executive side, ha ha. Endo: I was one of them, ha ha. The most important thing in business is the balance among stakeholders. While reduction is a major premise, for customers who are concerned about the impact on the stock price, we should listen to their requests as carefully as possible, such as to proceed with the sale within a time frame and try to respond accordingly.\n\nNagano: When I was CEO, I remember being told in a dialogue with investors that they decide whether to take equity risks from other companies, so they wanted us to take risks in our core business. We cannot deny the views of our customers we heard from Mr. Endo or the views of those investors. As Mr. Endo pointed out, we must listen carefully to the opinions of our stakeholders and continue to engage in careful dialogue with them as we move steadily forward with sales.\n\nKatanozaka: At an in-house meeting in October 2022, the directors in charge expressed gratitude to the sales department managers who were responsible for day-to-day operations, including sales negotiations. I think it's tough on the front line,\n\nShinya Katanozaka\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbut I think they can work with a sense of security that they have approval from the executives.\n\nEndo: Another important aspect of the sale of business-related equities is the question of how to use the capital and funds generated from the sale.\n\nNagano: It has been discussed many times in Board of Directors' meetings and strategy discussions. You are exactly right. To date, Tokio Marine has used the capital and funds generated through the sale of business-related equities in overseas M&A, and we have realized global risk diversification and sustainable profit growth by shifting equity risk to overseas insurance risk, which has a low correlation with domestic non-life insurance. Although it goes without saying that overseas M&A will continue to be one of the candidates for the use of capital and funds in the future, in addition to this, we will further diversify risk and achieve sustainable profit growth by making greater use of our human and intellectual capital and more capital-efficient fee businesses that contribute to the realization of our Purpose, such as disaster prevention and mitigation. As a result, we will increase returns to our customers and shareholders.\n\nAt Tokio Marine, we believe it is our management responsibility to continue to demonstrate to our stakeholders that we will do what needs to be done to improve Tokio Marine's corporate value and that we will follow the right path.",

        "page_content": "2\n\n## In the era of VUCA, what are the challenges for Tokio Marine, as a global company, to further increase corporate value?\n\nSecretariat: With our Purpose as our starting point, Tokio Marine has been able to solve social issues and increase corporate value as a result. Although these strategies will not change in the future, please tell us your thoughts on what Tokio Marine, as a global company, needs to do to further increase its corporate value in an era when social issues are expanding and becoming increasingly complex.\n\nKatanozaka: Steady progress has been made in global risk diversification (see pp. 27-29), one of the strengths of Tokio Marine. As Mr. Nagano mentioned earlier, by expanding both our domestic and international businesses, which have a low correlation with each other, we have increased the diversification effect from 30% in fiscal 2013 to 47% in 10 years. In the unprofitable domestic fire insurance markets, we have been able to implement comprehensive measures over the past four years, including rate increases, product revisions, and reinsurance cycle management. Even amid the materialization of unexpected risks such as natural catastrophes and COVID-19, I think there has been sufficient speed in responding to risks to Tokio Marine.\n\nOn that basis, if I were to raise one issue, it would be the issue of residential fire insurance in the United States. An increasing number of insurance companies are withdrawing from California, where wildfires are growing in scale. We also hear that the number of so-called 'insurance refugees' who cannot get insurance as a result of soaring insurance premiums is increasing in Florida, where hurricane damage is worsening.\n\nNagano: Insurance serves as 'social infrastructure.' However, if the economic value of an insurance company is damaged, it will not be able to run its business, and as a result, it will not be able to fulfill its role as 'social infrastructure.' In this era of VUCA, we are confronted with the difficulty of balancing the 'social value' and 'economic value' of insurance companies.\n\nEndo: This is a very difficult problem, but I think one solution lies in data. VUCA is a result of being unable to see the future, so if you can use the power of 'data' to figure out the true cause, you can see the future. This ability to see ahead is the method to escape from VUCA. At the end of the day, the insurance business is a human business. Of course, the situation differs depending on the country or region, but there must be many things in common across the world. Accordingly, I would like to see Tokio Marine further strengthen its systems and capabilities to accumulate and analyze information on a global basis, including industry-academia collaboration, and continue to protect our customers and society in times of need on a global basis.\n\nIn addition to strengthening our core insurance business, Tokio Marine plans to expand its business into preparation and recovery areas such as preventing and mitigating disasters, preventing disease, and promoting early recovery and preventing recurrence. I believe that data will be a key success factor in these areas as well.\n\nNagano: That's right. To achieve our Purpose, Tokio Marine is looking to go beyond the framework of traditional insurers and into the preparation and recovery of insured events, but this is unknown territory that no insurer in the world has touched. To create new value, in addition to the data mentioned by Mr. Endo, we believe that diversity of human resources is essential. I am aware that one of the most important issues for the future is how to match Tokio Marine's strategies with human resources strategy.\n\nEndo: To create innovation, it is essential to accept a variety of differences, such as age, gender, nationality, and the presence or absence of disabilities, to discuss, and to make use of the diversity of discussions. To take full advantage of this diversity, I think we should put even more effort into building a corporate culture that respects individual independence and a personnel system that values that.\n\nKatanozaka: By individual independence we mean someone focused who can say 'no' to the company or the president. What\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nkind of employee were you, Mr. Nagano?\n\nNagano: Now that you mention it, I might have been a little like that. When we acquired PHLY of the United States in 2008, I was unofficially told by Mr. Sumi, the president at the time, to oversee this deal as the director in charge of corporate planning. At the time, I said that in the middle of the subprime crisis, a deal worth 500 billion yen was risky, and it was time to solidify our position. In the end, I was persuaded by him to focus on PMI with an emphasis on cultural fit so that I could fulfill my roles. And you know the results of the acquisition. It was the second successful large-scale M&A after TMK.\n\nEndo: If you look at the results alone, you might say, 'Mr. Sumi was right,' but the important thing in this discussion is whether there is an environment in which individuals can say what they think to anyone, even the president. In other words, to make the most of diversity, it is important to have a culture that allows for failures and mistakes. I want to leave big and difficult work where people expect mistakes to young people, more and more, and I want them to firmly inherit a 'focus' like Mr. Nagano.\n\nNagano: I believe that the essence of global management lies in diversity and culture.\n\nFirst, we must create new value by incorporating diversity into our business. For example, in fiscal 2022, two top executives of acquired companies were newly appointed as Executive Vice Presidents and asked to participate and play active roles at the Group level. They and the Japanese C-suite led by the CEO, Mr. Komiya, discuss priority issues of the entire Group about twice a week.\n\nHowever, the more diversity you incorporate, the more difficult it is to determine the direction in which the members are heading.\n\nTherefore, through the spread of culture, we can unite various members as a team.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTokio Marine's global integrated group management (see pp. 30-33) is now in its eighth year, and we believe it has evolved into the best for Tokio Marine. However, I hope that Tokio Marine will continue to evolve agilely in line with the changes of the times and the direction it is heading. Nagano: The Company's Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board were reorganized in July 2023. With the addition of three outside directors, including one foreign director, and one outside Audit & Supervisory Board member, the Company now has a total of 20 officers, half of which are internal officers and half external. Mr. Katanozaka is the chairman of the Nomination Committee, and Mr. Endo is the chairman of the Compensation Committee.\n\nAs I have mentioned, in the era of VUCA, of course, the content of the discussions by the Board of Directors will change from time to time, but the roles of the Board of Directors in Tokio Marine have not changed at all.\n\nAs a spokesperson for stakeholders, the Board of Directors is the last stronghold to answer the questions of if Tokio Marine will solve social issues through its corporate activities, and if the results will lead to sustainable improvements in corporate value, and whether Tokio Marine leads businesses and society to the future through the realization of its Purpose.\n\nWe have been and will continue to engage in substantial discussions toward the realization of our Purpose and the enhancement of corporate value.\n\nSecretariat: Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule today.",

Furthermore, the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee, which ensure transparency\n\n## \u25b6Corporate Governance System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nomination Committee\n\n- \u25cf Deliberates appointment and dismissal of CEO, Directors, and Audit & Supervisory Board Members; reports to the Board of Directors\n- \u25cf Deliberates CEO successor plan and supervises the development of successor candidates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\n- \u25cf Deliberates policies related to Director and Executive Officer performance evaluations, compensation systems and levels, and determination of officer compensation; reports to the Board of Directors\n\nin the process of determining the nomination and remuneration of Directors, consist of a majority of outside officers and are both chaired by an outside officer.\n\nSince its founding in 2002, the Company has worked to improve its corporate governance. In this way, we have determined that the current system, which emphasizes management functions while also ensuring monitoring functions, is optimal at this point in time.\n\nHowever, we also believe that we must be in constant pursuit of the most optimal solutions to improve monitoring functions, including ways of institutional designing, increasing the number of non-Japanese directors, and increasing the ratio of outside directors and female directors.\n\n## \u25b6Record of Measures to Strengthen Corporate Governance\n\nFY2002 FY2004 FY2005 FY2011 FY2013 FY2015 FY2016 FY2017 FY2018 FY2019 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023\n\nJuly\n\nNomination Committee and Compensation Committee discretionally established\n\nNovember\n\nEvaluations of effectiveness of the Board of Directors (surveys administered to all Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members) commenced\n\nJune\n\n4\n\nAugust\n\n4\n\nJune\n\n6\n\nMay\n\nCorporate Governance Policy renamed Tokio Marine Holdings Fundamental Corporate Governance Policy\n\nJuly Ratios of performance-linked bonuses increased for certain officers\n\nStructure\n\nOutside Directors\n\nOutside Audit & Supervisory Board Members\n\n## Non-Japanese Executive Officers\n\nPolicies\n\nCompensation\n\nMay Corporate Governance Policy formulated\n\nJuly\n\nStock options introduced\n\nApril\n\n5\n\nNovember The first evaluations of effectiveness of the Board of Directors by a third-party organization\n\nJune Ratio of Outside Directors raised to one-third\n\nApril\n\n6\n\nApril\n\n6\n\nJune\n\n5\n\nNovember\n\nTokio Marine Holdings Fundamental Corporate Governance Policy revised (Major areas of revision: Appointment conditions and dismissal policies for the President)\n\nJuly\n\nStock ownership plan introduced\n\nJuly Same as previous update\n\nJuly Non-financial indicators added to performance-linked bonuses\n\nDiversity in the members of the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board is accelerating.\n\nRatio of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members (compared with July 1, 2022)\n\nRatio of Female Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members (compared with July 1, 2022)\n\nRatio of Non-Japanese Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members (compared with July 1, 2022)\n\nFiscal 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFiscal 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFiscal 2022\n\n(3 out of 19) 16 %\n\nFiscal 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJune First non-Japanese Outside Director appointed\n\nApril\n\n7\n\nMembership\n\nApril Millea Holdings (currently Tokio Marine Holdings) established as a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3 (decreased in fiscal 2005)\n\nApril Millea Group Corporate Philosophy established\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJune\n\nFirst non-Japanese\n\nExecutive Officer\n\nappointed\n\n<!-- image -->",

As part of that, the Company, as the insurance holding company taking charge of the Group, is building highly sound and transparent corporate governance and internal control as well as administering Group companies as appropriate. The Board of Directors in this company with an Audit & Supervisory Board makes important business decisions as well as supervises the work of the directors.\n\nFor the Board of Directors to properly fulfill its role, the board needs to possess the necessary skills on the bases of the business content, business development, governance structure, and so forth of Tokio Marine Group. Moreover, the necessary skills will differ depending on changes in the business environment. To facilitate important business decisions and proper supervision in the Company, board members first need to deeply understand the business, which means having a thorough understanding of the 'insurance business.' Moreover, the basis of all decision-making is skills in 'financial economics,' 'financial accounting and finance,' 'legal compliance,' 'human resources strategy,' and 'governance and risk management.' Moreover, as the planet's environment and technological innovation have become issues for society, the importance of skills pertaining to 'environment' and 'technology' is growing as well.\n\nIn addition, Directors are expected to have skills relating to 'internationality' and 'business administration.' Considering our global\n\nbusiness reach, insights from global environmental awareness and business administration are extremely beneficial for Tokio Marine Group.\n\nWe also consider it preferable for the Audit & Supervisory Board members to have skills similar to those of the members of the Board of Directors, so that they can properly audit the work of the Board of Directors. Skills in 'financial accounting and finance' are thought of as especially important.\n\nBased on this direction, we appoint as outside directors not only four with business administration experience (of whom one has extensive experience as a business administration consultant) but also one with experience in scholarship, as an economist, and as a lawyer. Moreover, the outside directors also include a lawyer, an analyst, and an academic expert. Most of the outside directors have rich international experience. In this way, the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board consist of members with diverse skills. Within the framework of the Board of Directors, etc., the outside directors provide advice about the management of the Company based on these skills. In addition, from a gender perspective, we have appointed two female directors and two female Audit & Supervisory Board members so that the ratio of female members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board is 20%.\n\n|                       |                                                                               | Skills and experience

The third-party organization has evaluated that the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board members appropriately fulfill their respective roles and functions, thereby ensuring the high effectiveness of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Fiscal 2022 evaluation of effectiveness and fiscal 2023 operation policy (Report to the Board of Directors in April 2023)\n\n## (1) Overall evaluation\n\nA third-party organization evaluated the Company's Board of Directors as an organization where many important management issues were discussed under appropriate agenda setting and management, with the chairperson, internal and outside Directors, and Audit & Supervisory Board members fulfilling their roles and functions appropriately. The Board of Directors also conducted a review of the evaluation results of the third-party organization and confirmed again that the functions of the Board of Directors had been fully demonstrated, as was the case with effectiveness evaluations results based on the in-house survey. The main review results of the Board of Directors are as follows.\n\n- \u25cf Free and open-minded discussions are taking place and governance functions well.\n- \u25cf Consider securing more discussion time and opportunities to discuss medium- to long-term strategies and directions and to enhance discussions to realize them.\n\n## (2) Main proposals from third-party organizations and future policies\n\n## (Proposal 1)\n\nAlthough there are time constraints in the Board of Directors meetings, it is desirable to secure discussion time and opportunities for enhancing deliberations on medium- to long-term themes.\n\n## (Response 1)\n\nAdd Board of Directors meeting slots and work to secure time for discussions.\n\n## (Proposal 2)\n\nIt would be better to report the details of the discussions by the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee to the Board of Directors.\n\n## (Response 2)\n\nAfter clarifying the content to be shared with the Board of Directors, we will work to enhance the content of reports to the Board of Directors.\n\n## (3) Operation policy for fiscal 2023\n\nIt is extremely important for the Board of Directors to fulfill its expected roles in enhancing corporate value. In order to further improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, we will steadily respond to the proposals from the third-party organization and continue to study this matter.",

It is for this purpose that the Board of Directors holds 'Discussions on Corporate Strategy,' which are discussions about themes such as the current management environment and management challenges. The themes are selected based on questionnaire responses from directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members as well as themes that come up at 'independent officers' meetings.'\n\nThe following themes were discussed in fiscal 2022, and similar discussions will be held in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe Company also holds one meeting a year that is attended by independent officers only. It is entirely conducted by independent officers, including establishing agenda items. Opinions are exchanged objectively and from broad perspectives. In fiscal 2022, discussions were held on corporate culture, compliance, and other issues, with recommendations made based on these discussions.\n\n## \u25b6\u02a0Discussions on Corporate Strategy\u02a1 Themes\n\n| Fiscal Year Themes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| We discussed what Tokio Marine Group values, the competencies of human resources we seek, and personnel strategies based  FY2022                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| opinions through a Q&A format.

The Nomination Committee shall deliberate on the succession plan for the President, and appropriately supervise the operation of the plan so that the development of successor candidates is carried out in a planned way.\n- 4. The Nomination Committee shall specify the skills, etc., required of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members and use that as a reference for deliberations on the appointment and dismissal under Paragraph (2), Item (1).\n\n## CEO Selection Criteria\n\n- \u25cf Having the qualities to lead the business to sustainable growth and medium- to long-term improvements in the corporate value of the Group\n- \u25cf Good understanding of the Company's business conditions\n- \u25cf Broad knowledge needed for corporate management\n- \u25cf Sufficient decision-making ability\n- \u25cf Properly exercising one's competencies as an officer, past achievements and experiences, personal character, etc.\n\nLikewise, regarding the succession of others on the management team (including foreign national officers) who are not the CEO, discussions are held at talent management meetings where principal officers participate, while training plans and other matters are reported to the Nomination Committee.\n\nIn April 2023, the Group established TLI, a Group-wide global human resource development program to foster future management candidates (see pp. 30, 31 for details). In addition, specific training measures are implemented in a planned way so that the managerial capabilities of candidates are honed, for example, by dispatching them to external executive programs (training) where they study together with management from other companies.\n\n## Nomination Committee Members\n\nThe majority of the Nomination Committee consists of outside officers, and the Chairman is elected from the outside officers.\n\n| Chairman   | Shinya Katanozaka   | Outside Director      |\n|------------|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| Members    | Emi Osono           | Outside Director      |\n| Members    | Kosei Shindo        | Outside Director      |\n| Members    | Tsuyoshi Nagano     | Chairman of the Board |\n| Members    | Satoru Komiya       | President and CEO     |\n\nThe number of meetings differs by fiscal year; there were two in fiscal 2021 and two in fiscal 2022 with three planned in fiscal 2023.

Since we will continue to sell beyond that point, the ratio to net assets of 20% is just a 'milestone.'\n\n- *2: At the IR conference held in November 2022, the Company explained that it would consider accelerating the divestment to 120-150 billion yen in fiscal 2023 and to about 1.5 times the current level from fiscal 2024.\n\n## \u25b6Content of Revisions to Fundamental Corporate Governance Policy\n\n## Before Revision\n\nAfter Revision\n\n(Policy relating to business-related equity holdings) Article 3 Business-related equities are implemented by a portion of the Company's business subsidiaries (companies at which the Company directly holds a majority of voting rights. The same shall apply hereinafter.) with the intent of strengthening transaction relationships, and held with the intent to improve the corporate value of the Group. However, the Company will continue to improve its capital to items that are not easily affected by fluctuations in share price, and from the viewpoint of improving capital efficiency, continue to work to reduce the total amount.\n\n(Policy on business-related equity holdings) Article 3 The Company will review the Group's risk portfolio and reduce the amount of equities it holds as business-related equities in order to redirect capital toward areas such as resolving social issues and growing business fields.\n\n## \u25b6Ratio of Holdings to Net Assets* 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *3: Net assets for fiscal 2023 and after are estimates for each fiscal year\n- *4: Scheduled for disclosure in May 2026\n\nAt meetings of its Board of Directors, the Company verifies the risk and returns associated with holding such shares on an individual basis, as well as the portfolio as a whole, and, confirms the economic rationality of holding the business-related equities. The economic rationality is determined by comparing the ROR (Return on Risk)* 5 calculated from risks and returns of both insurance transactions and equity investments to the Company's cost of capital.\n\nAt the meeting of its Board of Directors held in October 2022, the Company reviewed the economic rationality as of the end of March 2022, and confirmed that the ROR of the whole portfolio is above the cost of capital. As for respective companies with an ROR less than the cost of capital, the Company works to improve returns from these companies through discussion regarding their business policies, and improvement and new proposals of their insurance programs.\n\n- *5: ROR (Return on Risk) is an indicator calculated by dividing insurance underwriting profit and dividends, etc., obtained from the owned corporate group concerned by the calculated amount of risk relating to insurance underwriting and stock price fluctuations calculated based on the Company's risk management risk model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dialogue Based on the Stewardship Code\n\nThroughout the year, the Tokio Marine Group holds four types of dialogues: dialogues with companies with particularly large market values; dialogues based on financial conditions, etc.; dialogues based\n\n## \u25b6Overview\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non the status of consideration for ESG; and, in the process of scrutinizing proposals for general meetings of shareholders of the companies in which the Company invests, dialogues based on voting rights exercise criteria.\n\n## \u2460Dialogue with companies with particularly large market values\n\nDialogue based on the impact on the market and the value of the Company's assets.\n\n## \u2461Dialogue based on financial conditions, etc.\n\nThe Company decides which investee to engage in a dialogue, by taking into account the financial conditions of the companies.\n\n## \u2462Dialogue based on the status of consideration for ESG\n\nThe other party to the dialogue will be decided based on the company's consideration for ESG.\n\n## \u2463Dialogue based on voting rights exercise criteria\n\nRegarding the proposals at the General Meeting of Shareholders of all listed companies, the Company will engage in a dialogue, if necessary, in accordance with the Company's voting criteria.\n\n## \u25b6Examples of Dialogues with Investees\n\n|    | Content of the Dialogue                                                                                                                                         | Responses of Investees                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|    | \u25cf  We asked a leading company that is  committed to achieving carbon neutrality by  2030 about its concrete initiatives and  progress.                          | \u25cf  We received a response that in terms of specific initiatives, in the short term, the  company is steadily expanding the use of renewable energy and switching power  generation facilities to LNG.

Furthermore, through constructive dialogue between management and shareholders and investors, the Company will gain an appropriate understanding of how it is viewed and the state of the capital markets and provide that understanding and feedback to management and within the Company to lead to the improvement of management itself and further enhance corporate value.\n\nIn April 2023, we established the Global Communications Department as an organization responsible for interdepartmental operations of IR, SR, and PR, with the aim of further strengthening dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders, including capital markets, shareholders, the media, and employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dialogue with Investors\n\n## Dialogue with Institutional Investors\n\nOrganizing financial results conference calls, IR conferences, and theme-focused strategy conferences, the Company holds these both onsite and on the Internet (broadcast live across the globe) and is thereby engaging in dialogue with shareholders and investors around the world.\n\nAt the IR conference held in May 2023, Outside Directors, who serve as representatives of minority shareholders, took the stage and gave objective responses to questions about the Board of Directors discussions and Tokio Marine Group from the perspective of outside directors. Participants commented that they had further deepened their understanding of the Company's management and the opportunity to hear the voices of outside directors was valuable, and that they would like to see such opportunities offered in the future.\n\nWe also continuously hold briefings focusing on topics of high interest in capital markets. In fiscal 2022, Special IR Meetings were held in London and New York City, where presentations were made by the CEOs and executives of major subsidiaries in Europe and the United States, and Q&A sessions were held with participants. In Japan, we also held two special briefings on overseas subsidiaries, featuring the CEOs of overseas subsidiaries as speakers,\n\nand received favorable responses.\n\nWe have also resumed face-to-face dialogue, including overseas IR activities in North America, Europe, and Asia. In fiscal 2022, we held dialogues with approximately 530 company investors in Japan and overseas while improving the quality of these dialogues.\n\n(May 2023 IR conference video)\n\nhttps://webcast.net-ir.ne.jp/87662305e/index.html\n\n## Dialogue with Individual Investors\n\nWe hold conferences for individual investors every year, featuring the Group CEO. Since fiscal 2022, we have held briefings in Osaka, Fukuoka, and Aichi, in addition to Tokyo. The Company also provided easy-to-understand explanations of the 'Group's management strategy' and 'shareholder return,' which are of great interest to individual investors. These explanations received about 90% participant satisfaction rate.\n\nAlso, in response to requests from many individual investors for stock splits, in October 2022 we implemented a three-way stock split. We will continue to engage in careful dialogue with investors with the aim of expanding our base of investors and expanding our Tokio Marine fan base.\n\n(Conference video, Japanese only)\n\nhttps://webcast.net-ir.ne.jp/8766ko2209/index.html\n\n## Feedback\n\nThe Company is also making efforts to report the opinions obtained through dialogue with shareholders and investors widely to management and other members of the Company, and to reflect them in improvement of management. Many of our employees have no contact with the capital markets in their daily work, but through the IR activity reporting sessions, they understand the voices of the capital markets, the evaluation of the Company, and the connection between their work and the capital markets. This has a positive impact on their own motivation and growth and, as a result, a virtuous circle of company growth is also created.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we also used remote tools to share and interact with 2,748 Group employees.\n\n## Awards Related to Disclosure\n\nAs a result of these efforts, we have received various awards.\n\n2nd Nikkei Integrated Report Award 2022 Semi-Grand Prix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMay 2023 IR conference\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## General Meeting of Shareholders\n\n## Presentation by the Group CEO\n\nIn order to promote a deeper understanding of the Company's management and business, the Group CEO routinely conducts presentations. At the 20th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (June 26, 2023), under the theme of 'Business Strategy of Tokio Marine Group,' the Group CEO gave an easy-to-understand presentation in recognition of the current environment and on our strategy for sustainable future growth.\n\n(Presentation video)\n\nhttps://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/ir/event/movie/2023\u0332meeting.mp4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Results of Exercise of Voting Rights\n\nThe results of the exercise of voting rights at the 21st Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders are as follows:\n\n## Details of the Resolutions\n\nItem 1: Appropriation of Surplus\n\nMatters regarding the distribution of dividends and its aggregate amount Amount of cash dividend per common share of the Company: 50 yen Aggregate amount of cash dividends: 99,661,077,600 yen\n\nItem 2: Election of Fifteen (15) Directors\n\nElection of the following fifteen individuals as directors: Tsuyoshi Nagano, Satoru Komiya, Kenji Okada, Yoichi Moriwaki, Yoshinori Ishii, Kiyoshi Wada, Shinichi Hirose, Takashi Mitachi, Nobuhiro Endo, Shinya Katanozaka, Emi Osono, Kosei Shindo, Robert Alan Feldman, Kichiichiro Yamamoto, and Haruka Matsuyama\n\nItem 3: Election of One (1) Audit & Supervisory Board Member\n\nElection of the following individual as an Audit & Supervisory Board member: Junko Shimizu\n\n## \u25b6 Results of the Resolutions\n\n| Item                 | Number of Affirmative Votes   | Number of Negative Votes   | Number of Abstentions   | Approval Ratio (%)   | Result of the Resolution   |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|\n| Item 1               | 16,109,839                    | 7,146                      | 707                     | 98.28                | Approved                   |\n| Item 2               |                               |                            |                         |                      |                            |\n| Tsuyoshi Nagano      | 13,516,871                    | 2,596,417                  | 3,995                   | 82.46                | Approved                   |\n| Satoru Komiya        | 13,597,511                    | 2,516,857                  | 2,909                   | 82.95                | Approved                   |\n| Kenji Okada          | 15,502,469                    | 540,903                    | 73,923                  | 94.57                | Approved                   |\n| Yoichi Moriwaki      | 15,584,931                    | 458,440                    | 73,923                  | 95.08                | Approved                   |\n| Yoshinori Ishii      | 15,584,846                    | 458,525                    | 73,923                  | 95.07                | Approved                   |\n| Kiyoshi Wada         | 15,585,186                    | 458,185                    | 73,923                  | 95.08                | Approved                   |\n| Shinichi Hirose      | 15,584,117                    | 459,254                    | 73,923                  | 95.07                | Approved                   |\n| Takashi Mitachi      | 15,945,563                    | 168,828                    | 2,909                   | 97.28                | Approved                   |\n| Nobuhiro Endo        | 15,944,453                    | 169,938                    | 2,909                   | 97.27                | Approved                   |\n| Shinya Katanozaka    | 14,768,606                    | 1,312,390                  | 36,286                  | 90.10                | Approved                   |\n| Emi Osono            | 15,988,524                    | 125,868                    | 2,909                   | 97.54                | Approved                   |\n| Kosei Shindo         | 14,742,554                    | 1,338,446                  | 36,286                  | 89.94                | Approved                   |\n| Robert Alan Feldman  | 16,008,738                    | 103,637                    | 4,925                   | 97.66                | Approved                   |\n| Kichiichiro Yamamoto | 15,499,462                    | 543,911                    | 73,923                  | 94.55                | Approved                   |\n| Haruka Matsuyama     | 16,099,657                    | 14,735                     | 2,909                   | 98.22                | Approved                   |\n| Item 3               | 16,106,074                    | 8,795                      | 2,909                   | 98.25                | Approved                   |",

As regards the number of reports and consultations received by the Group in fiscal 2022, there were 316 cases (110% compared with fiscal 2021). We ensure that these reports and consultations are appropriately investigated and responded to, leading to the early detection of problems and the implementation of corrective and recurrence prevention measures.\n\nAlso, each Group company in Japan is putting in place the necessary systems for responding to whistleblowers based on the Amended Whistleblower Protection Act, which came into effect on June 1, 2022.\n\n## \u25b6Compliance System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Crisis Management System\n\nWe have established a crisis management system, emergency action, etc., to minimize economic losses and other impacts incurred in an emergency and immediately restore ordinary business operations.\n\nAlso, we provide support, instructions, and guidance to Group companies, and Group companies report to, communicate, and consult with us.

The Tokio Marine Group's basic ideas and compliance standards are determined from the perspective of people, processes, and technologies, and include constant monitoring, log analyses, periodic vulnerability-scanning, penetration tests, and risk assessments.\n\nFurthermore, in order to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks that are becoming more sophisticated year by year, we use the PDCA cycle to formulate and execute improvement plans in response to issues identified in this process, while taking into account the amount of risk at each Group company, intelligence gained from inside and outside the Group, and the application of new technologies.\n\nManagement,' each company establishes departments to oversee information security management and formulate policies and regulations.

Each region carries out regular countermeasures such as employee training, including security monitoring on a daily basis, cyber drills (conducted multiple times a year mainly for relevant parties), targeted e-mail drills (conducted multiple times a year for all employees), etc. Also, in the event of a cyber incident, each region strives to establish an efficient and effective system by identifying the scope of the impact, and promptly implementing initial responses, recovery, and recurrence prevention measures to prevent the spread of damage while cooperating with other regions.\n\nA Group-wide committee made up of security experts gathers knowledge from around the world and promotes advanced security measures to support our customers and society in times of need.\n\n- *1: Tokio Marine&Nichido Systems, the core systems company of the Tokio Marine Group, acquired ISO27001 certification\n- *2: Abbreviation of Computer Security Incident Response Team\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *7: Independent Administrative Agency Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan\n\n## \u25b6(Reference) Enhancement of ERM Management at Small to Medium-Sized Entities and Minority Investments in Light of Losses from the COVID-19 Outbreak in Taiwan\n\nIn fiscal 2022, our Taiwanese JV suffered a major loss due to a market event caused by COVID-19 insurance.

After the incident was discovered, external lawyers were hired to conduct an investigation. News releases were issued on June 20 and August 4, 2023. We will continue to analyze the causes and make efforts to prevent recurrence of such cases.\n\nJune\u00a020,\u00a02023 Tokio\u00a0Marine\u00a0&\u00a0Nichido\u00a0Fire\u00a0Insurance\u00a0Co.,\u00a0Ltd.\n\n## Regarding the series of reports on Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance\n\nAs reported in a series of media reports, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd. (President: Shinichi Hirose; hereinafter 'TMNF') has filed a misconduct report with the Financial Services Agency regarding an incident in which TMNF conducted premium adjustments with other non-life insurance companies under a coinsurance contract concluded between a customer (one corporation) and multiple non-life insurance companies including TMNF, and received a report submission order from the Financial Services Agency regarding this incident.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and concern caused to our customers and related parties due to the inappropriate behavior of our employees. We will respond sincerely to the requests of the report submission order and strive to prevent recurrence of such cases.\n\n## 1. Outline of the case\n\nIn this case, a coinsurance contract between a customer (one corporation) and multiple non-life insurance companies, including TMNF, involved an 'adjustment of insurance premiums' led by our employees.\n\nThe coinsurance contract was a non-life insurance contract that was bid on by multiple non-life insurance companies at the customer's request. However, the customer had doubts about the insurance premium levels offered by each non-life insurance company at the time of bidding, so the bids were redone, and the bidding was conducted again. Therefore, in the end, the insurance contract was not underwritten with an unreasonable premium caused by a premium adjustment. However, in light of the circumstances, TMNF submitted a report of misconduct to the FSA as inappropriate business conduct, and subsequently received a report submission order from the FSA under the Insurance Business Act.\n\n## 2. Background of the discovery\n\nAs stated in 1. Outline of the case above, on December 20 of the previous year, the customer had doubts about the level of insurance premiums of each non-life insurance company, and confirmed with TMNF's sales department in charge whether there was any inappropriate act which made us aware of the case. Subsequently, we engaged external lawyers to conduct data analysis (forensic investigation) of e-mails, mobile phone records, etc., in order to confirm facts with persons in charge of the contract and related parties in TMNF and investigate if there are any other cases. The results were reported to the FSA on March 24 of the current year.\n\nIn addition, although this case did not result in underwriting with an unreasonable premium caused by the premium adjustment, we will also report it to the Fair-Trade Commission.\n\n## 3. Future initiatives such as measures to prevent recurrence\n\nIn response to this incident, we have established a Special Investigation Committee, which has appointed several outside lawyers, and are working to confirm the facts. At this point in time, we are not aware of any other similar cases, but we take it very seriously that any inappropriateness concerning the Anti-monopoly Act has occurred, and we will continue to investigate whether there are any similar cases within the company, and if cases of inappropriateness are discovered, we will respond strictly.\n\nIn addition, TMNF will endeavor to prevent such incidents by analyzing the cause of the incident and formulating and steadily implementing measures to prevent recurrence through governance and thorough implementation of employees' basic behaviors based on the causes.\n\n-\n\nFor more information, please refer to the news releases dated June 20 and August 4, 2023.

Basic Policies of Response by Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \u02a0TMNF\u02a1) regarding the Incident\n\n- \u25cf We understand that the recent fraudulent insurance claims by the sheet metal division of BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd. betrayed the relationship of trust between insurance companies and the auto repair shop and defrauded insurance money, and it is truly regrettable. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and concern we have caused to customers and related parties in being unable to prevent such fraudulent claims, for introducing customers who were involved in accidents to BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd.'s auto repair shop for the repair of their important vehicles, and for including BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd. as an insurance agent for TMNF.\n- \u25cf We have positioned the recovery of the damage of the affected customers as our top priority. We are continuing to strongly urge BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd. to take the necessary measures to recover the damage, but we do not yet have a full picture of the situation.\n- \u25cf Based on the above, TMNF will take the following actions for customers who have suffered or may have suffered damage from unauthorized repairs by BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd. that led to fraudulent claims, to eliminate any concerns about the results of the repairs, and to recover the damages of customers who have actually received unauthorized repairs.\n\n## 2. TMNF's response to customers who have suffered or may have suffered unauthorized repairs\n\n## (1) Establishment of a dedicated call center for customers\n\n- In response to this incident, we set up a dedicated customer contact (call center) on July 28 in consideration of the concerns about customers' vehicles and the complaints we have received about this incident.\n\n## (2) Contacting customers who were introduced to BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd.\u029fs auto repair shops through TMNF\n\nWe will contact all customers who had their vehicles that were involved in accidents repaired at BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd.'s auto repair shops sequentially in writing. It is expected that it will take some time to clarify the entire picture of the fraudulent insurance claim by BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd. and the damage to individual customers, etc. Until then, we will consider measures so that customers, etc., who feel worried or anxious can drive their cars with peace of mind (for example, help to confirm the safety of the car, explanation of the repair details, etc.).\n\n## (3) Response to the unauthorized repair cases that have already been revealed by the Special Investigation Committee of BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd.\n\nAt the present time, no information has been disclosed regarding cases of unauthorized repairs pertaining to individual customers that have already been identified by the investigation conducted by the Special Investigation Committee established by BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd. Therefore, in order to expedite the recovery of our customers' damage, we strongly request BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd. and the Special Investigation Committee to disclose information on such cases, especially at an early stage, and we will sequentially contact our customers as soon as the information is disclosed.\n\n## (4) Contacting customers to confirm the auto insurance contract grade for those who suffered damage from unauthorized repairs\n\nCustomers who would not have used the auto insurance for repair if BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd. had not made a padded claim will be contacted after we have confirmed the net difference between the 'insurance premiums if no claims were made' and the 'insurance premiums actually paid' as well as the 'correct amount for repair' when a padded claim is found. We will take steps to correct the auto insurance grade for customers who think, based on the information we provide, that they would not have needed to make an insurance claim had the correct repairs had been made.\n\nFor details, please refer to the news release dated August 1, 2023.

Outside Japan, we aim to achieve a CAGR of +9% or more through improvements in underwriting profit fueled by rate increases and risk selection, growth in emerging countries, and investment income expansion. In the domestic life insurance business, plans are in place to secure an annual stream of stable profits around the 50 billion yen level.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the final year of the current MTP, we expect overseas profit growth to significantly exceed that of the plan and lead the Group as a whole. As for domestic non-life insurance, while the improvement of profitability in fire insurance is making steady progress, the deterioration of loss cost in auto insurance and the hardening of the reinsurance market, among other factors, mean results are projected to be as planned. In addition, the domestic life insurance business is expected to fall short of the plan due to an increase in the first-year burden associated with top-line growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1: Domestic non-life insurance = TMNF\n- *2: Domestic life insurance = TMNL\n- *3: Other domestic non-life insurance, financial and other businesses, and sales of business-related equities not included in business unit profit, etc.\n- *4: Starting numbers for the current MTP (the impact of natural catastrophes is assumed to come in at around the annual average, and the impact of COVID-19 and FX rate fluctuations is deducted).\n- *5: As outlined at an IR presentation in May 2021, organic growth was projected to come in at 5% or higher.\n- *6: Compared with FY2020",

This is due to top-line growth at a pace that exceeds plans and steady improvements in the C/R. As a result, trends in underwriting profit substantially exceed the target of the current MTP (a 15 billion yen increase compared with fiscal 2020).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1: North America + Europe segments.

For sustainable earnings growth, it is important to appropriately control rises in the loss cost due to inflation. Among them, economic inflation (goods and services) has a particular impact on loss cost in fire insurance and auto insurance, which are traditional insurance lines. However, Tokio Marine's U.S. operations, which are centered on specialty insurance, are relatively resistant to this impact.\n\nHowever, in specialty insurance, which is one of our strengths, loss cost in medical stop-loss insurance and excess workers' compensation, for example, are susceptible to economic inflation (medical care and wages), while liability insurance is susceptible to social inflation. In response to these developments, we have strengthened our resilience to inflation by proactively implementing measures such as rate increases, reviewing underwriting, and reducing the number of lawsuits by promoting early settlements.\n\nBy continuing this proactive approach, we will continue to improve our ability to respond to sudden environmental changes and generate stable profits.\n\n## \u25b6Tokio Marine Strategies by Inflation Type\n\n- Identify high-risk contracts potentially deteriorating future performance in advance, and proactively take measures by reviewing underwriting details, etc.\n- As a result of significantly reducing high limit policies of 10 million USD or more, which are often targeted by lawsuits, more than 90% of all in-force policies* 2 have a limit less than 5 million USD\n- Reduced number of lawsuits by approximately 60%* 3 through early settlement efforts\n- Rate increases in light of rising loss cost\n- Loss reserves in select liability lines strengthened and prior year reserves have developed favorably since fiscal 2019\n- Although there are impacts on excess workers' compensation and medical stop-loss due to increases in medical expenses and wages, etc., they are controlled through proactive rate increases and increases in self-insurance retention, etc.\n- Increasing rates in light of increased loss cost due to inflation\n- We have a structure that is relatively resistant to the impact of economic inflation due to centering on specialties (low proportion of fire and automobile insurance, etc.)\n- The current inflation index for goods and services (flexible CPI, construction price index, etc.) has declined since peaking in 2021, and the risk of inflation on goods and services has relatively decreased\n\n## Social inflation\n\nEconomic inflation (medical care and wages)\n\nEconomic inflation (goods and services)\n\n- *1: Tokio Marine North U.S. subsidiaries loss reserves by inflation type as of the end of fiscal 2022\n- *2: Umbrella insurance with many high-value limit contracts\n- *3: Compared with Q2 of fiscal 2020 when the Company commenced early settlement initiatives\n\n## \u25b6Loss Reserve Ratio by Inflation Type for Our U.S. Business* 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (4) Ability to execute bolt-on M&As\n\nWe are executing bolt-on M&A deals and forward-looking divestments with the aim of strengthening existing businesses, diversifying risk, and stabilizing C/Rs.\n\nBolt-on M&As are distinguished by their high rate of success.

With the application of 'Accounting Standard for Business Conbinations' (Accounting Standards Board of Japan ('ASBJ') Statement No.21), the former Net income is Net income attributable to owners of the parent from FY2015.\n- 2. Number of employees is staff head-count currently at work.\n- 3.  Figures for Comprehensive income, consolidated solvency margin ratio, and number of employees outside Japan are provided beginning with the fiscal year from which data collection and disclosure began.\n- 4.  Dividends per share for FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020 do not include one-time dividends of approximately JPY50.0 billion, JPY25.0 billion, and JPY25.0 billion, respectively.\n- 5.  A stock split was implemented (a ratio of three shares per share) in October 2022. The 'BPS,' 'EPS,' 'DPS,' 'Number of shares outstanding at year-end,' and 'Share price at year-end' for FY2021 and earlier fiscal years have been recalculated based on after the stock split.\n- 6.  The Key Performance Indicators have been newly defined in FY2015 and figures for FY2012 and thereafter have been restated. FY2021 onward is based on new definition.\n- 7.  The main reason for the increase in CO2 emissions from FY2015 was the expansion of coverage for calculation of Scope 3 (Other Indirect Emissions). The CO 2 emissions for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 reflects a CO2 reduction effect of 14,074 tons from green power purchases.",

Consolidated Results of Operations\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, the world economy remained on the recovery path that started in the fiscal year 2021. The pace of recovery, however, slowed due to record price inflation caused by such factors as surging energy prices and supply constraints. The Japanese economy gradually recovered, mainly driven by personal consumption, despite the impact of price inflation, due to the gradual relaxation of restrictions relating to the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the ongoing normalization of economic activities.\n\nUnder these circumstances, as a result of our efforts to expand our domestic and overseas business, which is centered on non-life insurance and life insurance, our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year 2022 were as follows:\n\nOrdinary income increased by 784.8 billion yen to 6,648.6 billion yen from the previous fiscal year, the main components of which were Underwriting income of 5,634.8 billion yen and Investment income of 875.4 billion yen.

However, the Company does not consider Japan Earthquake Reinsurance Co., Ltd. to be its affiliate since it cannot exert a significant influence on any decision making of its policies given the highly public nature of their business.\n- (4) When a company accounted for by the equity method has a different closing date from that of the Company, in principle, the financial statements prepared at its closing date are used for presentation in the consolidated financial results.\n\n## 3. Balance sheet date of consolidated subsidiaries\n\nThere are one domestic subsidiary and 162 overseas subsidiaries whose balance sheet dates are December 31. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of these subsidiaries for the period ended December 31. Necessary adjustments for the consolidation are made for material transactions that occur during the three-month lag between the balance sheet dates of these subsidiaries and the consolidated balance sheet date.\n\n## 4. Accounting policies\n\n## (1) Accounting for insurance contracts\n\nAccounting for insurance contracts such as insurance premiums, outstanding claims and underwriting reserves of domestic consolidated insurance subsidiaries is stipulated under Insurance Business Act and other laws and regulations.\n\n## (2) Valuation of securities\n\n- a.  Trading securities are measured at fair value, with the costs of their sales being calculated based on the moving-average method.\n- b.  Bonds held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost based on the moving-average method (straight-line method).\n- c.  Bonds earmarked for underwriting reserves are stated at amortized cost under the straight-line method in accordance with the Industry Audit Committee Report No. 21 \"Temporary Treatment of Accounting and Auditing Concerning Securities Earmarked for Underwriting Reserve in Insurance Industry\" (issued by the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the \"JICPA\"), November 16, 2000).\n\nThe following is a summary of the risk management policy concerning bonds earmarked for underwriting reserves. In order to adequately manage interest rate risk related to assets and liabilities, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life has established \"part of underwriting reserve for individual insurance policies (non-participating or participating)\" as an underwriting reserve subgroup. Tokio Marine & Nichido Life's policy is to match the duration of the underwriting reserve in the subgroup with the same or similar duration of bonds that are earmarked for underwriting reserves.\n\n- d.  Available-for-sale securities (except for securities without a market price) are measured at fair value. Unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net assets, and the costs of sales are calculated using the moving-average method.\n- e.  Securities without a market price in available-for-sale securities are stated at original cost by the moving-average method.\n- f.  Securities held in individually managed money trusts that are mainly invested in securities for trading are measured at fair value.\n\n## (3) Valuation of derivative transactions\n\nDerivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.\n\n## (4) Depreciation methods for material depreciable assets\n\n- a.  Tangible fixed assets\n\nDepreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated using the straight-line method.\n\n- b.  Intangible fixed assets\n\nIntangible fixed assets recognized in acquisitions of overseas subsidiaries are amortized over the estimated useful life reflecting the pattern of the assets' future economic benefits.\n\n## (5) Accounting policies for significant reserves and allowances\n\n## a.  Allowance for doubtful accounts\n\nIn order to prepare for the losses from bad debts, allowances are provided pursuant to the rules of asset self-assessment and the rules of asset write-off. Allowances are provided by major domestic consolidated subsidiaries as follows:\n\nFor receivables from any debtor who has legally, or in practice, become insolvent (due to bankruptcy, special liquidation or suspension of transactions with banks based on the rules governing clearing houses, etc.) and for receivables from any debtor who has substantially become insolvent, allowances are provided based on the amount of any such receivables deducting the amount expected to be collectible calculated based on the disposal of collateral or execution of guarantees.\n\nFor receivables from any debtor who is likely to become insolvent in the near future, allowances are provided based on the amount of any such receivables deducting the amount expected to be collectible through the disposal of collateral or execution of guarantees and the overall solvency assessment of the relevant debtor.\n\nFor receivables other than those described above, allowances are the amount of receivables multiplied by the default rate, which is calculated based on historical default experience in certain previous periods.\n\nIn addition, all receivables are assessed by the asset accounting department and the asset management department in accordance with the rules of asset self-assessment. Subsequently, the asset auditing departments, which are independent from other asset-related departments, conduct audits of the assessment results of the other asset-related departments. Allowances are provided based on such assessment results as stated above.\n\n- b.  Provision for employees' bonus\n\nTo provide for payment of bonuses to employees, the Company and its major consolidated domestic subsidiaries recognize Provisions for employees' bonus based on the expected amount to be paid.\n\n- c.  Provision for share awards To provide the Company's shares to Directors and Executive Officers pursuant to the share delivery rules, the Company recognizes Provision for share awards based on the expected amount of obligation as of the end of the fiscal year 2022.\n\nd.  Reserve for price fluctuation\n\nDomestic consolidated insurance subsidiaries recognize reserves in accordance with Article 115 of the Insurance Business Act in order to provide for possible losses or damages arising from fluctuation of share prices, etc.\n\n## (6) Accounting methods for retirement benefits\n\n- a.  The method of attributing expected retirement benefits to periods\n- In calculating the retirement benefit obligations, the method of attributing expected retirement benefits to periods is based on the benefit formula basis.\n- b.  The method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses and past service costs\n\nActuarial gains and losses for each fiscal year are amortized proportionally from the following fiscal year using the straight-line method over a certain number of years (5 to 13 years) within the average remaining work period of employees at the time of occurrence.\n\nPast service costs are amortized by the straight-line method over a certain number of years (7 to 13 years) within the average remaining work period of employees at the time of occurrence.\n\n## (7) Consumption taxes\n\nFor the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, consumption taxes are accounted for by the tax-excluded method except for costs such as Operating and general administrative expenses incurred by domestic consolidated insurance subsidiaries which are accounted for by the tax-included method.\n\nIn addition, any non-deductible consumption taxes, in respect of assets, are included in Other assets and are amortized over five years using the straight-line method.",

Interest rate\n\nTo mitigate interest rate fluctuation risks associated with long-term insurance policies, Tokio Marine & Nichido and Tokio Marine & Nichido Life conduct Asset Liability Management (\"ALM\") to control such risks by evaluating and analyzing financial assets and insurance liabilities simultaneously.\n\nAs for interest rate swaps that are used to manage such risks, Tokio Marine & Nichido and Tokio Marine & Nichido Life apply deferred hedge accounting to the swaps based upon the Industry Committee Practical Guideline No. 26, \"Accounting and Auditing Treatments related to Application of Accounting for Financial Instruments in the Insurance Industry\" (issued by the JICPA, March 17, 2022).\n\nAssessment of hedge effectiveness is omitted because the companies group hedged insurance liabilities with the interest rate swaps that are the hedging instruments, based on the period remaining for the instruments, and the hedge is highly effective.\n\n## b.  Foreign exchange\n\nMajor domestic consolidated insurance subsidiaries apply fair value hedge accounting, deferred hedge accounting or assignment accounting for certain foreign exchange forwards and certain currency swaps used to reduce future currency risk such as in assets denominated in foreign currency. Assessment of hedge effectiveness is omitted because the principal terms of the hedging instruments and the hedged items are identical and the hedge is highly effective.\n\n## (9) Methods and periods of amortization of goodwill\n\nRegarding goodwill recognized as an asset on the consolidated balance sheet, goodwill in connection with Philadelphia Consolidated Holding Corp. is amortized over 20 years using the straight-line method. Goodwill in connection with HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. is amortized over 10 years using the straight-line method. Goodwill in connection with Privilege Underwriters, Inc. is amortized over 15 years using the straight-line method. Other goodwill is amortized over 5 to 15 years using the straight-line method. Other goodwill in small amounts is amortized immediately.\n\nNegative goodwill incurred before March 31, 2010 and recognized as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet is amortized over 20 years using the straight-line method.\n\n## (10) Scope of Cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statement of cash flows\n\nCash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statement of cash flows consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments such as time deposits with original maturities or redemption of three months or less at the date of acquisition.\n\n## Significant Accounting Estimates\n\nItems including accounting estimates that could have a significant impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are as follows:\n\n## 1. Outstanding claims\n\n(1) The carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023\n\n(Yen in millions)\n\n|                    | As of March 31, 2023   | As of March 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Outstanding claims | 4,287,286              | 3,609,687              |\n\n(2) Information on the significant accounting estimates\n\n- a.  Calculation method\n\nOutstanding claims are estimated as the amount of claims, refunds and other benefits (hereinafter referred to as \"Claims\") deemed to have resulted in an obligation under an insurance contract that have not yet been paid.\n\n- b.  Key assumptions used in the calculations\n\nOutstanding claims are estimated based on the ultimate settlement of Claims by using the assumptions calculated mainly from historical payment experience.\n\n- c.  Impact on the consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal year\n- Due to the revision of laws and regulations or court decisions, etc., the ultimate settlement of Insurance Claims may change from\n\nthe initial estimate, and the amount recorded for outstanding claims may increase or decrease.\n\n## 2. Impairment of goodwill\n\n(1) The carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023\n\n(Yen in millions)\n\n|          | As of March 31, 2023   | As of March 31, 2022   |\n|----------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Goodwill | 428,601                | 453,433                |\n\n(2) Information on the significant accounting estimates\n\n- a.  Calculation method\n\nImpairment of goodwill is recognized mainly in accordance with the procedures for identifying indications of impairment, assessing the recognition of an impairment loss and measuring an impairment loss for each unit to which goodwill is attributed (hereinafter referred to as \"Reporting unit\") whose performance is reported independently for the Company's management purpose.\n\nFirst, for each Reporting unit, the Company assesses if indications of impairment are identified, such as deterioration in the latest operating results and future prospects, a significant negative deviation compared to the business plan at the time of acquisition, or significant adverse changes in the business environment including market conditions. For Reporting units for which indications of impairment were identified, an impairment loss is recognized if the total amount of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the book value of goodwill. For Reporting units for which recognition of an impairment loss is deemed necessary, the book value of goodwill shall be reduced to the recoverable amount which is calculated by discounting future cash flows, and recognizes the reduced amount as impairment loss.\n\n- b.  Key assumptions for the calculations\n\nFuture cash flows and discount rates are used to calculate impairment loss on goodwill.\n\nFuture cash flows are estimated based on the latest rational business plan, taking into account the growth, etc., based on the business environment of each Reporting unit.\n\nThe discount rate is the pre-tax interest rate, which is the cost of capital plus necessary adjustments such as interest rate differentials.\n\n- c.  Impact on the consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal year\n\nAn impairment loss may be incurred if undiscounted future cash flows significantly decline due to, for example, a significant deterioration in profitability from the assumption at the time of acquisition and a significant downward deviation from the business plan.\n\n## 3. Market value evaluation of financial instruments\n\n- (1) The carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023 Please refer to \"Information on Financial Instruments\".\n\n## (2) Information on significant accounting estimates\n\n- a.  Calculation method and Key assumptions for the calculations\n- With regards to the calculation method of the fair value of financial instruments and key assumptions for the calculations, please\n\nrefer to \"Information on Financial Instruments-2. Fair value of financial instruments and breakdown by input level (Note 1)\".\n\n- b.  Impact on the consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal year\n\nKey assumptions may change due to changes in the market environment, and the fair value of financial instruments may increase or decrease.",

Overview\n\nThe Accounting Standards Board of Japan (\"ASBJ\") has revised PITF No. 18 \"Practical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to Foreign Subsidiaries, etc. for Consolidated Financial Statements\" and PITF No. 24 \"Practical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to Associates Accounted for Using the Equity Method\". The major amendments are as follows:\n\nFor overseas subsidiaries that present subsequent changes in fair value of investment in equity instruments in Other comprehensive income, when investments in the equity instruments are sold, an adjustment is to be made to recognize the difference between the acquisition cost and sales price as a gain or loss for the corresponding fiscal year within the consolidation process, in accordance with the Tentative Practical Solution of \"Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to Foreign Subsidiaries, etc. for the Consolidation Process\".\n\nFor overseas subsidiaries that need to recognize any asset impairment, an adjustment is to be made to recognize the valuation difference as a loss for the corresponding fiscal year within the consolidation process.\n\n## 2. Date of application\n\nThe Company plans to adopt the aforementioned standards from the beginning of the fiscal year in which its overseas subsidiaries adopt IFRS 9 \"Financial Instruments\".\n\n## 3. Impact of application of standards\n\nThe Company has not yet evaluated the impact of the application of the aforementioned standards at the timing of the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Changes in Accounting Policies\n\nThe Company has applied \"Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement\" (ASBJ Guidance No.31, June\n\n17, 2021) (hereinafter referred to as \"Guidance for Application of Fair Value Measurement\") from the beginning of the fiscal year 2022. In accordance with the transitional treatment set forth in Paragraph 27-2 of Guidance for Application of Fair Value Measurement, the Company has prospectively applied a new accounting policy prescribed by Guidance for Application of Fair Value Measurement.\n\nThe effect of applying Guidance for Application of Fair Value Measurement on consolidated financial statements is immaterial.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nThe Company and its major domestic consolidated subsidiaries have adopted a structure called Board Incentive Plan Trust (hereinafter, the \"BIP Trust\") as a stock-based compensation system (hereinafter, the \"System\") for its Directors and Executive Officers (hereinafter, the \"Directors, etc.\"). The Company and its major domestic consolidated subsidiaries have applied the \"Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company's Own Stock to Employees, etc. through Trusts\" (Practical Solution Report No. 30, March 26, 2015) to the accounting treatment for the System.\n\nUnder the System, the Company and its major domestic consolidated subsidiaries entrust with the trustee the monies to pay for the Company's stock-based compensation to acquire the Company's shares through the trust. The Eligible Directors, etc. who meet certain beneficiary requirements will receive, after their resignation, the Company's shares in the number that is equivalent to a certain ratio of the granted points accumulated pursuant to the share delivery rules and money corresponding to the conversion value of the Company's shares through the trust.\n\nThe Company's shares remaining in the trust are recorded as treasury stock in shareholders' equity. The book value of such treasury stock is 4,272 million yen and the number of shares is 2,117,000 shares at the end of the fiscal year 2022, and 4,958 million yen and 819,000 shares at the end of the fiscal year 2021, respectively.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Balance Sheet\n\n- *1.

Accounting treatment of tax effect accounting for corporate and local income taxes\n\nThe Company and some of its domestic consolidated subsidiaries have adopted the Group Tax Sharing System from the fiscal year 2022. Accordingly, for the accounting treatment and disclosure of deferred tax accounting related to corporate and local income taxes, the \"Practical Solution on the Accounting and Disclosure Under the Group Tax Sharing System\" (PITF No. 42, August 12, 2021) has been adopted from the beginning of the fiscal year 2022.\n\n## Information on Financial Instruments\n\n## 1. Qualitative information on financial instruments\n\n## (1) Investment policies\n\nThe core operation of the Group is its insurance business, and it invests utilizing the cash inflows mainly arising from insurance premiums. Therefore, the Group seeks to appropriately control risks based on the characteristics of insurance products primarily through ALM. The Group thereby aims to ensure stable, long-term earnings while realizing efficient management of liquidity.\n\nSpecifically, the Group's approach entails controlling interest rate risks associated with insurance liabilities by utilizing interest rate swaps and other transactions while assuming a certain degree of credit risks by investing in bonds with high credit ratings. At the same time, the Group endeavors to ensure medium-to-long-term earnings by diversifying risks and asset management approaches in Japan and overseas through the utilization of a wide range of products including foreign securities and alternative investments. Foreign exchange forwards and other derivative transactions are used to mitigate risks associated with the Group's asset portfolio.\n\nThrough these approaches, the Group aims to increase investment income in order to maximize net asset value in the medium-to-longterm and maintain financial soundness.\n\nWith regard to financing, the Group issues corporate bonds and undertakes borrowings mainly to secure funds for investments. When financing is necessary, amounts and methodologies are determined based on the Group's cash flow status.\n\n## (2) Details of financial instruments and their risks\n\nThe Group holds financial instruments including equity securities, bonds, other securities, loans and derivatives. These instruments are exposed to market risk, which refers to the risk of losses arising from fluctuations in stock prices, exchange rates, interest rates, and other market indicators. They are also exposed to credit risk, which refers to the risk of losses when the value of an investment declines or is lost due to deterioration in the financial condition of the debtor. Other risks to which these instruments are exposed include market liquidity risk, which refers to the risk of losses that may occur from being unable to make transactions due to disorderly market conditions or being forced to make transactions at extremely unfavorable prices.\n\nSome currency risk is hedged through foreign exchange forwards, currency swaps and other such transactions. Hedge accounting is applied to some of these transactions.\n\nCredit risk associated with over-the-counter derivative transactions includes the risk of losses when the counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations due to insolvency or for other reasons. In order to reduce such credit risk, netting arrangements and collateral transfers equivalent to fair value of derivative transactions may be used with financial institutions and other counterparties with whom there are frequent transactions. Also, interest rate risk associated with long-term insurance liabilities is hedged by interest rate swaps and other transactions for which hedge accounting is applied in some cases.\n\nWith regard to hedging instruments, hedged items, hedging policies and evaluation of hedge effectiveness, please refer to \"Significant Accounting Policies - 4. Accounting policies - (8) Hedge accounting\".\n\n## (3) Risk management structure\n\n## a. Market risk and credit risk management\n\nBased on the \"Investment risk management policy\" established by the Board of Directors, Tokio Marine & Nichido executes risk management activities both quantitatively and qualitatively to control investment risk related to financial instruments, such as market risk and credit risk, at the risk management department, which is independent of trading departments.\n\nIn accordance with the policy, \"Investment guidelines\" are established, which set the rules for which instruments to invest in, risk limits, and actions to take when limits are exceeded for each segment set in the annual investment plan. Investment risk is quantitatively measured using VaR-like concepts. Compliance with the guidelines and investment risk and return are reported on a regular basis to directors.\n\nTokio Marine & Nichido appropriately manages credit risk by regularly monitoring the concentration and the status of issuers and borrowers using internal credit rating guidelines set by the \"Guidelines for managing credit risk concentration\".\n\nIn order to control individual investments, Tokio Marine & Nichido also executes pre-investment review and post-investment monitoring according to the \"Review guidelines\" and others.\n\nRisk monitoring operations are reported to the Board of Directors depending on their importance.\n\nOther consolidated subsidiaries maintain risk management structures based on the aforementioned risks.\n\n## b. Liquidity risk management\n\nThe Group manages liquidity risk by controlling payment schedules and ensuring various ways of financing through treasury management by each consolidated subsidiary and by the Group as a whole.\n\n## (4) Supplementary information on fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments is measured under certain assumptions, therefore it may differ under other assumptions.",

Fair value of financial instruments and breakdown by input level\n\nThe tables below show carrying amounts shown on the consolidated balance sheet, fair value, differences of financial instruments, and fair value breakdown by input level.\n\nSecurities without a market price, and investments in partnerships are not included below. (Refer to Note 3.)\n\nThe fair values of financial instruments are classified into the following three levels depending on the observability and significance of the input used in the fair value calculation:\n\n- Level 1: Fair value measured by the market price of the asset or liability in active markets among the observable inputs\n- Level 2: Fair value measured by the observable inputs other than the Level 1 inputs\n- Level 3: Fair value measured by unobservable inputs\n\nIf multiple inputs are used with a significant impact on the fair value measurement, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input.\n\n- (1) Financial instruments recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet\n\n## As of March 31, 2023\n\n(Yen in millions)\n\n|                               | Carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet   | Carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet   | Carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet   | Carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n|                               | Level 1                                                   | Level 2                                                   | Level 3                                                   | Total                                                     |\n| Monetary receivables bought   | -

These valuation techniques include the inputs such as yield curves, prepayment rates and market prices of similar type of securities.\n\nThe fair value is categorized within Level 2 if unobservable inputs are either not included or not significant in the valuation techniques. It is categorized within Level 3 if unobservable inputs are significant in the valuation techniques.\n\n## Securities\n\nThe fair value of securities which is measured using quoted prices in active markets is categorized within Level 1. The fair value of securities which is based on quoted prices in inactive markets is categorized within Level 2.\n\n- If quoted prices in markets are not available, the fair value of securities is measured using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow and matrix pricing. These valuation techniques include the inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads and market prices of similar type of securities.\n\nThe fair value of major investment trusts for which quoted prices in markets are not available, is based on net asset value and categorized within Level 2, as there is no significant restriction on cancellation.\n\n## Loans\n\nWith regard to floating rate loans, fair value is measured using the book value and is categorized within Level 3 as long as there are no significant changes in the credit status of the borrowers, since the fair value is considered to approximate the book value as the changes in interest rates are reflected in a timely manner in the future cash flows.\n\nWith regard to fixed rate loans, the fair value is measured using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow. These valuation techniques include the inputs such as yield curves and credit spreads. The fair value of fixed rate loans is categorized within Level 3.\n\nWith regard to loans of which borrowers are insolvent or in bankruptcy proceedings, the fair value approximates the amount after deducting the estimated uncollectible debts from the carrying amount. Therefore, the fair value is measured with such amount and is categorized within Level 3.\n\n## Corporate bonds\n\nThe fair value of Corporate bonds is measured using quoted prices in markets and others and categorized within Level 2.\n\n## Derivative transactions\n\nWith regard to exchange-traded derivative transactions, the fair value is measured using the closing prices at exchanges and others. For over-the-counter derivative transactions, the fair value is measured using valuation techniques such as the Black-Scholes model and the discounted cash flow, using the inputs such as swap rates, forward rates, volatilities and basis swap spreads.\n\nThe fair value of derivative transactions which is measured using closing prices at exchanges and others is categorized within Level 1. It is categorized within Level 2 if unobservable inputs are either not included or not significant in the valuation techniques. It is categorized within Level 3 if unobservable inputs are significant in the valuation techniques.",

Most subsidiaries in Tokio Marine Group engage in non-life insurance business, life insurance business and Small Amount and Short Term insurance business. In addition to reserves to cover claim payments, payments for maturity refunds of saving type insurance policies, etc., it is necessary for insurance groups to maintain sufficient solvency in order to cover risks that exceed normal estimates, e.g. occurrences of a major catastrophe, or a significant decline in value of assets held by insurance groups.\n- 2. (C) Solvency margin ratio is the ratio of (A) Total amount of solvency margin (i.e. solvency of insurance company groups in terms of their capital, reserves, etc.) to (B) Total amount of risks (i.e. risks that exceed normal estimates) which is calculated in accordance with the Insurance Business Act.\n- 3. \"Risks that exceed normal estimates\" is composed of risks described below.\n- (1) General insurance risk on non-life insurance contracts, life insurance risk, third sector insurance risk and insurance risk of Small Amount and Short Term Insurers: risk that insurance claims occur in excess of normal estimates excluding catastrophe risk on non-life insurance contracts.\n- (2) Assumed interest rate risk: risk that invested assets fail to yield assumed interest rates due to factors such as downturn of investment conditions.\n- (3) Minimum guarantee risk on life insurance contracts: risk that value of assets related to the minimum guarantee for benefits of insurance contracts, which are managed as a separate account, fluctuates in excess of normal estimates and falls below the minimum guaranteed benefits when they are to be paid.\n- (4) Asset management risk: risk that the prices of retained securities and other assets fluctuate in excess of normal estimates.",

Subsidiaries that were excluded from the scope of consolidation in preparation of the consolidated financial statements due to immateriality were included within the calculation of the consolidated solvency margin ratio.\n- 5. Solvency of insurance company groups in terms of their capital, reserves, etc. ((A) Total amount of solvency margin) is the total amount of net assets excluding planned outflows, certain reserves (e.g. price fluctuation reserve, contingency reserve, catastrophe loss reserve, etc.) and part of unrealized gains (losses) on land, etc.\n- 6. Solvency margin ratio on a consolidated basis is one of the objective indicators used by the regulatory authority to supervise corporate groups headed by an insurance holdings company. A ratio exceeding 200% indicates sufficient solvency to fulfill payment obligations such as insurance claims.\n\n## Sufficiency of solvency of major domestic subsidiaries to fulfill payment obligations such as insurance claims\n\n## Solvency margin ratio (non-consolidated) for Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.\n\n(Yen in millions)\n\n|                                                                                                                                           | As of March 31, 2023   | As of March 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| (A) Total amount of solvency margin                                                                                                       | 5,287,626              | 5,384,523              |\n| Shareholders' equity less adjusting items                                                                                                 | 1,421,939              | 1,365,291              |\n| Reserve for price fluctuation                                                                                                             | 108,000                | 115,167                |\n| Contingency reserve                                                                                                                       | 9,578                  | 7,546                  |\n| Catastrophe loss reserve                                                                                                                  | 1,081,242              | 1,085,378              |\n| General allowance for doubtful accounts                                                                                                   | 202                    | 183                    |\n| Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and deferred gains (losses) on hedge transactions before tax effect deductions | 1,772,797              | 1,948,640              |\n| Unrealized gains (losses) on land                                                                                                         | 260,134                | 249,460                |\n| Excess of policyholders' contract deposits                                                                                                | -

In addition to reserves to cover claim payments, payments for maturity refunds of saving type insurance policies, etc., it is necessary for insurance companies to maintain sufficient solvency in order to cover risks that exceed normal estimates, e.g. occurrences of a major catastrophe, a significant decline in value of assets held by insurance companies.\n- 2. (C) Solvency margin ratio is the ratio of (A) Total amount of solvency margin (i.e. solvency of insurance companies in terms of their capital, reserves, etc.) to (B) Total amount of risks (i.e. risks that exceed normal estimates), which is calculated in accordance with the Insurance Business Act.\n- 3. \"Risks that exceed normal estimates\" is composed of risks described below.\n- (1) (General) insurance risk, third sector insurance risk: risk that insurance claims occur in excess of normal estimates excluding catastrophe risk.\n- (2) Assumed interest rate risk: risk that invested assets fail to yield assumed interest rates due to factors such as downturn of investment conditions.\n- (3) Minimum guarantee risk: risk that value of assets related to the minimum guarantee for benefits of insurance contracts, which are managed as a separate account, fluctuates in excess of normal estimates and falls below the minimum guaranteed benefits when they are to be paid.\n- (4) Asset management risk: risk that prices of retained securities and other assets fluctuate in excess of normal estimates.\n- (5) Business administration risk: risk that occurs in excess of normal estimates and does not fall under other categories.\n- (6) Catastrophe risk: risk that a major catastrophe in excess of normal estimates which is equivalent to the Great Kanto Earthquake or Isewan typhoon occurs.\n- 4. Solvency of insurance companies in terms of their capital, reserves, etc. ((A) Total amount of solvency margin) is the total amount of net assets excluding planned outflows, certain reserves (e.g. reserve for price fluctuation, contingency reserve, catastrophe loss reserve, etc.) and part of unrealized gains (losses) on land, etc.\n- 5. Solvency margin ratio is one of the objective indicators used by the regulators to supervise insurance companies. A ratio exceeding 200% indicates sufficient solvency to fulfill payment obligations such as insurance claims.",

(TMNL)\n\n## About MCEV\n\nThe current Japanese financial accounting standards focus on conservativeness and have the limitation that the profits generated from life insurance business are generally undervalued shortly after underwriting contracts in terms of the valuation and assessment of performance of life insurance business.\n\nEmbedded values (EV) are calculated as the total of the \"adjusted net worth\" and the \"value of in-force.\" EV is designed to address the limitations of the financial accounting standards in order to facilitate an appropriate evaluation of value and improve performance assessment, considering the actual situation of the business performance.\n\nWhile there have been various methodologies for calculation of EV, the European Insurance CFO Forum released its MCEV Principles, the European Insurance CFO Forum Market Consistent Embedded Value Principles, in June 2008, to enhance the consistency of valuation standards and unify the standards for disclosures. TMNL has been disclosing its EV in compliance with the MCEV Principles to enhance the disclosure since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\n\n## MCEV as of March 31, 2023\n\n## 1. MCEV as of March 31, 2023\n\nMCEV of TMNL as of March 31, 2023, was 1,199.3 billion yen, a decrease of 10.7 billion yen from the previous fiscal year end (March 31, 2022). MCEV consisted of 48.7 billion yen of adjusted net worth and 1,150.6 billion yen of value of in-force.\n\n|                         | (Billions of yen)   | (Billions of yen)   | (Billions of yen)   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                         | FY2022              | FY2021              | FY2020              |\n| Adjusted net worth      | 48.7                | 542.1               | 854.6               |\n| Value of in-force       | 1,150.6             | 667.9               | 322.7               |\n| MCEV at fiscal year-end | 1,199.3             | 1,210.0             | 1,177.3             |\n| New business value      | 75.0                | 69.4                | 55.0                |\n\n## 2. Change in MCEV\n\nDuring FY2022, the change in MCEV (before dividends paid) was 76.5 billion yen, which was a decrease of 2.5 billion yen from the previous fiscal year change in MCEV (FY2021). The reactionary decrease of the actuarial assumption changes and the reactionary increase in economic variances from FY2021 offset each other, and so changes in MCEV year on year were flat overall. (For details on the changes, refer to 'Reconciliation Analysis of MCEV from the End of FY2021.')\n\n|                                                          | (Billions of yen)   | (Billions of yen)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                          | FY2022              | FY2021              |\n| Change in MCEV (Before dividends paid)                   | 76.5                | 79.1                |\n| (Reference) Change in MCEV                               | 86.7                | 125.6               |\n| (Before dividends paid and excluding economic variances) | 86.7                | 125.6               |",

Risk-Free Rates\n\nWe have used government bond yields as of the end of March 2023.\n\nThe Company has made sets to the method of 1-year forward rate of government bonds in the 41st year and thereafter, assuming that adjustments were carried out based on the past yield fluctuations in the 40-year spot rate.We have adjusted and used Bloomberg's government bond yields as our data source.The government bond yields (spot rates) for key terms are shown below.\n\n|          | JPY               | JPY               |\n|----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Term     | End of March 2023 | End of March 2022 |\n| 1 year   | (0.10%)           | (0.08%)           |\n| 5 years  | 0.10%             | 0.03%             |\n| 10 years | 0.45%             | 0.23%             |\n| 20 years | 1.09%             | 0.73%             |\n| 30 years | 1.35%             | 0.95%             |\n| 40 years | 1.36%             | 0.95%             |\n| 50 years | 1.43%             | 1.03%             |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis in P.191 presented the impact of changing the extrapolation of JPY-interest rates beyond the 40th year to use an ultimate forward rate (UFR) method. This UFR method entails setting the JPY ultimate forward rate to 3.8%, extrapolating rates from year 30,and applying the Smith-Wilson method so that forward rates from the 31st year onwards approach to the UFR in 30 years. This method was established with reference to the global Insurance Capital Standard (ICS) currently in development by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). Representative JPY interest rates are as follows:\n\nJPY\n\n| Term     | End of March 2023   |\n|----------|---------------------|\n| 1 year   | (0.10%)             |\n| 5 years  | 0.10%               |\n| 10 years | 0.45%               |\n| 20 years | 1.09%               |\n| 30 years | 1.35%               |\n| 40 years | 1.72%               |\n| 50 years | 2.10%               |\n\nWe have not included a liquidity premium in the risk-free rates given that definitions in the MCEV Principles are not clear and generally accepted practice has not yet been established. Negative interest rates are not floored at zero.\n\n## 2.

The removed one-off cost is 1,580 million yen, which is tied  primarily to costs relating to response, etc. for insurance premiums and incurred claims related to COVID-19  and a portion of system development costs. And with regard to system development costs for policy  acquisition and maintenance, and the information technology device costs for policy maintenance, the average  amount incurred over the past five years is reflected in the corresponding unit costs. An increase due to  inflation is reflected in future maintenance expenses. Corporate administration costs paid to the parent company are reflected in unit costs.

For dividends paid before the stock split, the amount per share equivalent after the stock split is shown (fractions less than 1 yen are rounded to the nearest whole number).\n\n## Capital\n\n| Date           | Equity capital   |\n|----------------|------------------|\n| April 2, 2002  | \u00a5150 billion     |\n| March 31, 2023 | \u00a5150 billion     |",

Figures for and prior to September 2022 have been recalculated based on figures after the split.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## On the publication of Our Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nAs Group CFO (Chief Financial Officer) of Tokio Marine Holdings, I would like to thank you for taking the time to read our Integrated Annual Report 2023 to its conclusion.\n\nWe published our first integrated annual report in fiscal 2015 to provide analysts and institutional investors with a balanced understanding of our sustainable value creation capabilities from both financial and non-financial perspectives. Following this initial publication, we have continued to make improvements each year through a process of trial and error, referring to the opinions of analysts and institutional investors, comments of integrated annual report rating agencies, and various guidelines, and have now published our ninth integrated annual report, focusing on the following three main areas.\n\n## (1) The addition of social issues to address and clarifying value creation:\n\nIn last year's Integrated Annual Report, we adopted promoting climate action (pp. 14-15) and improving disaster resilience (pp. 16-17) as social issues we needed to address. In this year's report, we added supporting healthy and spiritually rich living (healthcare) (pp. 18-19). We aim to further enhance your confidence in our value creation capabilities by demonstrating that we are able to create both 'social value' and 'economic value' through addressing these three important social issues that are currently emerging, and that these two values are not contradictory but mutually enhance each other.\n\n## (2) Strengthening human, intellectual, and social capital and connectivity with the future of Tokio Marine:\n\nThis year, we concluded our Purpose Story with the message that we will continue to expand the scope of value provided by continuing to refine internal capital (human capital and intellectual capital) and co-creating with social capital (various external partners). We have adopted a structure that introduces initiatives such as CORE, a disaster prevention consortium, as an example of strengthening social capital and TdR, the Group's core data function, as an example of strengthening internal capital. We aim to deepen your understanding of 'The Expansion of Tokio Marine's Value Creation Capabilities' (pp. 34-43) by strengthening connectivity between strengthening various types of capital, which are key success factors for our sustainable value creation capabilities and our future potential.\n\nAmong the various types of capital, human capital is the foundation of Tokio Marine's management and the source of all our initiatives. For this reason, we published the Human Capital Report in June 2023, and incorporated the essence of that report into this integrated annual report. In addition, because human capital is the source of all our efforts, in last year's integrated report, the information was provided across multiple sections. In this year's report, however, to make it easier to read, information has been consolidated in the form of comments by the chief officers in charge (pp. 86-93).\n\n## (3) Enhancement of disclosure on corporate governance:\n\nIn addition to enhancing disclosure in areas of high interest to institutional investors and analysts (reduction of business-related equities (pp. 116-117), our information and cybersecurity system (p. 124), etc.), we highlighted the main initiatives recently implemented by Tokio Marine to strengthen governance (accelerating diversity on the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board (p. 107), third-party evaluations on the effectiveness of the Board of Directors (pp. 110-111), etc.). Moreover, for the first time, a dialogue on corporate governance was held between the three top governance executives (Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Nomination Committee, and Chairman of the Compensation Committee) (pp. 100-105). Under the topic of the Board of Directors' discussion on important issues and Tokio Marine's challenges, we introduced the main points of the discussion. In addition, by disclosing the measures taken in light of the COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan (p. 125), which caused significant losses, we aim to demonstrate the increased effectiveness of Tokio Marine's corporate governance and further improve transparency and credibility.\n\nFinally, as the officer responsible for publishing this integrated annual report, I would like to state that it is a clear and accurate representation of our Company's ability to create sustainable value.\n\nTokio Marine is in the middle of a long climb to achieve our Purpose. Sometimes there is rain or fog along the way. Nevertheless, we will still be climbing mountains one hundred years from now, step by step, through the strengthening of human, intellectual, and social capital.\n\nThis is the management sentiment that I most wanted to convey in this integrated annual report, and this sentiment is also included on the cover. (If you look at the cover again, I hope you will understand the thoughts of our editors.)
