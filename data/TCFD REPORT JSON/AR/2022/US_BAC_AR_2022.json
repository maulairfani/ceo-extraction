These tenets have served as the foundation for our strong performance and progress.\n\nWe have seen Responsible Growth work in the relative calm of 2015 to 2019, the pandemic tumult of 2020 and 2021, and the inflationary period of 2022. In each of these periods, our company benefited from our long-term consistency and adherence to the tenets of Responsible Growth.\n\n## Responsible Growth has served us well under varied conditions\n\nThe core tenets of Responsible Growth have served our company and you, our shareholders, well during good times and stress.\n\nResponsible Growth served us well through the period from 2015 to 2019, when the economies of the world settled into normalized growth rates and interest rates rose in the U.S. with the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle.\n\nAs the pandemic hit in early 2020, a major economic crisis ensued and your company performed well once again, even as we met our clients' borrowing demands, built reserves, traded through uncertain markets, and helped our employees, clients and our communities deal with the pandemic and its a/ftermath. Again, Responsible Growth served us well.\n\nDuring 2022, the U.S. and the world continued to face civil tensions from the pandemic and lockdowns, social and racial conflicts, a war in Europe and energy supply disruptions, and inflation.\n\n## Responsible Growth\n\n- 1. Win in the market, no excuses.\n- 2. Grow with a customer-focused strategy.\n- 3. Grow with the right risk principles.\n- 4. Grow in a sustainable manner: Be the best place to work, share our success with our communities and drive Operational Excellence.",

        "page_content": "The strength of our balance sheet, risk management, organic growth, and expense management became a catalyst that drove our financial performance.\n\nLet's take a look at highlights of our performance in each of these periods, beginning with 2015 to 2019 as the U.S. economy set a record for one of the longest periods of economic growth. The Federal Reserve started a tightening cycle in 2016, raising interest rates reflecting the strength of the U.S. economy. Here's how we did:\n\n|                          | YE  2015   | YE 2019   | % change   |\n|--------------------------|------------|-----------|------------|\n| Loans                    | $897 B     | $983 B    | 10%        |\n| Deposits                 | $1.2 T     | $1.4 T    | 20%        |\n| Net interest income      | $39.0 B    | $49.0 B   | 25%        |\n| Expenses                 | $57.6 B    | $54.9 B   | -5%        |\n| Net charge-offs          | $ 4.3 B    | $ 3.6 B   | -16%       |\n| Earnings                 | $15.9 B    | $27.4 B   | 72%        |\n| Headcount                | 216 K      | 208 K     | -4%        |\n| Number of shares         | 10.4 B     | 8.8 B     | -15%       |\n| Book value per share     | $22.53     | $27.32    | 21%        |\n| Active digital customers | 32 MM      | 38 MM     | 21%        |\n| Customer satisfaction    | 74%        | 85%       | 15%        |\n| Employee satisfaction    | 76%*       | 85%       | 12%        |\n\nThen came the pandemic, which brought with it 15% U.S. unemployment, a 30% drop in U.S. GDP annualized growth rate, huge fiscal stimuli, supply chain disruptions, and an instantaneous drop to 0% rates. A/fter the recovery was assured by early 2021, a period of inflation set in resulting in the steepest interest rate increase path we have seen in the U.S. in the past 40 years. Here is how the company performed from 2019 to 2022:\n\n|                          | YE  2019   | YE 2022   | % change   |\n|--------------------------|------------|-----------|------------|\n| Loans                    | $983  B    | $1.0 T    | 6%         |\n| Deposits                 | $1.4 T     | $1.9 T    | 35%        |\n| Net interest income      | $49.0 B    | $52.5 B   | 7%         |\n| Expenses                 | $54.9 B    | $61.4 B   | 12%        |\n| Net charge-offs          | $3.6 B     | $2.2 B    | -40%       |\n| Earnings                 | $27.4 B    | $27.5 B   | 0%         |\n| Headcount                | 208 K      | 217 K     | 4%         |\n| Number of shares         | 8.8 B      | 8.0 B     | -9%        |\n| Book value per share     | $27.32     | $30.61    | 12%        |\n| Active digital customers | 38 MM      | 44 MM     | 15%        |\n| Customer satisfaction    | 85%        | 87%       | 2%         |\n| Employee satisfaction    | 85%        | 85%       | 0%         |\n\nAs a side note, the total cumulative charge-offs at Bank of America from 2015 to 2022, reflecting Responsible Growth, were less than the charge-offs recorded in the single year 2010 despite a recession, a pandemic, unprecedented monetary policy changes, and war occurring in these years.\n\n## 8 consecutive years of more than $15B in net income ($ Billions)\n\n## We are positioned well for the future. In the post-pandemic period we have reestablished our organic growth engine.\n\nFor the entirety of the period from 2015 to 2022, we have seen the stock price double; we have produced $185 billion in a/fter-tax earnings; and we have invested heavily in our franchise to better serve our customers and clients. Responsible Growth worked in all those environments and produced strong results on an enormous scale.\n\nA simple way to think about this is only four U.S. companies have earned more than $15 billion in GAAP a/fter-tax income in each of these eight years. Your company is one of them.\n\nMore importantly, we are positioned well for the future. In the post-pandemic period we have reestablished our organic growth engine. We have delivered revenue growth, while controlling expense, in a highly volatile environment. You will note increased costs for 2019 to 2022 above. First, we had cost increases for special pandemic programs and to take care of our team. Then, inflation added to costs. But in the end, we have just delivered our sixth straight quarter of operating leverage in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nWe have strong credit quality, capital ratios in excess of constantly increased regulatory minimums, a highly-respected brand, high employee satisfaction and loyalty, and incredible customers we are honored to serve. We have built and improved upon digital capabilities across every line of business to serve these customers, which embed the most effective capabilities of a fintech into the strength and stability of a well-regulated company.\n\nWhile we review and learn from the past, we don't live there. What we are excited about is how our proven operating model sets us up for the future. Our team relishes the work ahead to continue to deliver for you. So, as we look forward to the years ahead, we are poised to continue to drive Responsible Growth, no matter what comes at us.\n\n*2014 Employee Engagement Index Score; survey was not conducted in 2015 Source: FactSet and SNL Financial.

You will see more about these leaders on pages 12 and 13.\n\nI especially want to recognize Lead Independent Director Lionel Nowell, who was named as 'Independent Director of the Year' by Corporate Board Member magazine. Lionel shares his perspective on our company on page 11.\n\nWe welcomed Jos\u00e9 (Joe) E. Almeida, who joined your Board in September. We also give our appreciation to David Yost, a director since 2012, who is retiring due to age guidelines and will not stand for reelection at our annual shareholders' meeting. We thank Dave for his leadership, oversight, and prudent stewardship.\n\nThank you as well to my 217,000 teammates who join me every day at our company to fulfill our purpose of making financial lives better. In a year that began with many of us once again working from home, we are pleased to have our teammates back together, collaborating in person to serve our clients and deliver the full breadth of our capabilities, as you'll see highlighted throughout this Annual Report.\n\n## A deeper look at 2022\n\nIn 2022, we earned $27.5 billion a/fter-tax, a decline from our record-level earnings in 2021, primarily due to increases in credit costs due to the absence of reserve releases. We earned $3.19 per diluted share, on $95 billion in revenue. Our pre-tax, pre-provision income, which adjusts for the provision expense, was up 14%* from 2021, driven by organic growth across our lines of business, higher interest rates, and prudent management of expenses. This helped us achieve operating leverage in 2022.\n\nTotal assets declined slightly to $3.05 trillion driven by a decrease in deposits due to withdrawal of monetary accommodation. These deposits remain at a healthy $1.9 trillion level. Deposits in the banking industry are shrinking, the natural and intended outcome of the Federal Reserve's monetary actions to fight inflation.\n\nAt the same time, even as the economy weakened during 2022, loan demand increased as loans grew $67 billion to more than $1.04 trillion. Asset quality remained strong as net charge-offs remained near the historically low range experienced in 2021.\n\nOverall, our balance sheet continued to be supported by high levels of capital and liquidity, enabling us to continue to grow our business with customers, while meeting additional regulatory requirements, and repurchasing shares.\n\nRising inflation also took its toll on the equities market. For the year, our stock price decreased 24%, directionally in line with the S&P 500 and the broader bank index.\n\nThis followed a strong 2021 performance that saw our stock outperform and increase 47%. Book value per share and tangible book value per share both increased in 2022.\n\nWe also addressed increased regulatory changes in our capital requirements. Our common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) grew 5% in 2022 to more than $180 billion, and our CET1 ratio of 11.2% remained well above our new minimum requirements. Even while growing capital, our common dividend per share increased 10% from 2021 and, in the aggregate, in 2022 we returned $13.6 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our first use of our capital generation is to grow our company by supporting our customers' needs and pay our dividend. But in the end, we end up with more than we need for those purposes. Share repurchases allow long-term holders to own more of our company.\n\nIn addition, we continued investments to enhance being a Great Place to Work for teammates. We established a multi-faceted approach to workplace flexibility, provided free lunch for several months to help employees create informal connections and welcome them back fully to work, and continued our competitive pay packages to reward our employees for serving our clients and targeted our efforts at building long careers at Bank of America.\n\nFor our communities and the broader needs of society, we also remain attentive to areas where we can direct the talent, innovation, and resources of our company and its role in capitalism. For example, we are working alongside our clients toward a clean energy, sustainable future. This is also why we invest in partners and programs in our local markets: to help create economic opportunity and prosperity in underserved communities where the needs can be greatest.\n\nEuromoney named Bank of America the World's Best Bank for the second time in five years. We're also pleased to be named America's most 'JUST' Company by JUST Capital.\n\nFor all of this and more, Euromoney named Bank of America the World's Best Bank for the second time in five years. In announcing this prestigious ranking, the publication stated: 'In an increasingly volatile and uncertain environment, Euromoney recognized Bank of America's performance not only in retail banking, loan growth, capital markets trading and wealth management, but also its behavior as a corporate citizen.'\n\nWe're also pleased to be named as America's Most 'JUST' Company by JUST Capital. This ranking evaluates how companies invest in employees, communities, and customers, along with other issues JUST Capital has identified as important to Americans today.",

We once again delivered both profits and purpose-the genius of the AND as we call it-and we did it by delivering on the tenets of Responsible Growth. Throughout this letter, I will share with you examples about how we executed against each. The rest of this report discusses that work in greater detail, and we also make available a clear set of financial and non-financial disclosures so you can see for yourself how we measure our progress and determine where we have more work to do.\n\n## We are capitalists at Bank of America\n\nAt the core of the progress is our conviction that capitalism is embedded in how Responsible Growth delivers opportunity for our clients, our teammates, the communities we serve, and for you, our shareholders. I've sometimes been surprised to be askedincluding at Congressional hearings-'Are you a capitalist?' Your company is one of the most profitable companies in the world, whose purpose is to help our customers and clients live their financial lives, effectively helping them benefit in the capitalist system. Therefore, you might also find the question unusual. Of course, I answered, 'Yes.'\n\nBut I understand the thoughts behind the question. I think the questions and the concerns some may have about capitalism are about opportunity. About whether companies are sharing profits or paying people fairly and equitably. At Bank of America, we look at it in this straightforward way: How can we rely on and help the innovation and energy of capitalism to address the priorities of our communities and society AND benefit our shareholders? Capitalism provides the money, the creativity, and the expertise to solve the needs of society. We enable our customers to drive capitalism. It is what we do.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe once again delivered both profits and purpose-the genius of the AND as we call it-and we did it by delivering on the tenets of Responsible Growth.\n\nThroughout this report we provide details about how we do this: How we help transmit the economy by lending, investing, and working alongside our clients to help them succeed. About all we do to support our teammates and be a Great Place to Work for them. The many ways we partner in local markets to help support community priorities. And, at the same time, How we deliver for you, our shareholders.\n\nAll these activities reflect our view that capitalism creates opportunity-for our customers and clients at every stage of their progress; for our teammates to advance their careers at Bank of America and support their families; for those in our local communities who may need help accessing our economic system to achieve their own goals; and for our millions of investors, a chance to share in our success through their ownership.\n\nTo do this, we align our day-to-day business activities to the work. We bring our $3 trillion balance sheet to the task. We bring our $273 billion in equity. We bring our capital markets and lending capabilities, raising trillions for our clients. We bring the invested assets of our wealth management clients. Of course, we also bring the nearly $360 million of philanthropy we commit. That is how we think of it: capitalism creates opportunity and prosperity, addressing important societal challenges along the way. And we measure our success. See below for how we measure.",

In 2022, we acquired new clients and deepened our relationships with existing ones. The strongest underlying evidence of winning in the marketplace is through market share, as illustrated by organic growth activity with our clients.\n\nWe drive Responsible Growth through our eight lines of business. Our client teams deliver the unique capabilities and offerings of each business to each client. We also focus in each market on bringing the entire company to every customer or client. We track how well we deliver these integrated capabilities by the number of client referrals between our lines of business in our local markets.\n\nIn 2022, we saw more than 7.5 million total referrals among our operating units. I want to thank our 97 market presidents across the U.S. and the nearly 30 country executives around the globe who serve as chief executive for Bank of America in their markets. They lead an integrated team to help us deliver one company for clients, teammates, you, our shareholders, and the broader communities served by your company. In this report on page 32, you will see how that comes to life in just one of these communities through our local leadership.\n\n## In 2022, we saw more than 7.5 million total referrals among our operating units.\n\nIn 2022, we helped consumer clients to open a record one million net new checking accounts. We also opened 465,000 Consumer\n\nInvestment accounts through our online investment platform, Merrill Edge, resulting in $28 billion in net client flows. And we added more than a million new consumer credit card accounts in three of the four quarters in 2022.\n\nPreferred Rewards -our flagship loyalty program that recognizes and rewards clients for doing business with us across all products-recorded another strong year of growth, with 10.2 million total clients enrolled. This represents a 9% year-overyear increase, with the program retaining its best-in-class 99% annualized membership retention rate.\n\nSmall business owners benefi ted from Bank of America's products, scale and expertise at our retail fi nancial centers across the U.S. including Business Advantage specialists in more than 2,600 fi nancial centers, as well as our expansive ATM network, and access to local client professionals available to discuss their business priorities. We also are available to serve our small business clients digitally with the latest videoconferencing, chat and phone technology. Thanks to all of this and more, we continue to maintain our position among the nation's largest small business lenders, ending 2022 with $36 billion in total outstanding loans under $1 million and a 5% increase in Small Business checking accounts. And these small business clients have entrusted us with managing approximately $175 billion of deposits to pay their employees and build their businesses.\n\nOur Merchant Services platform also recorded a strong year supporting fi nancial solutions for merchants, adding new clients and volume while achieving a #1 client experience rating from J.D. Power.\n\nmarkets. The business added nearly 28,000 net new relationships as well as more than 800 wealth advisors in the second half of the year.

And we saw average loan and lease growth of 10% year-over-year-the 51st consecutive quarter of growth as we continue to deliver our full suite of products and services in a way that sets us apart from competitors and meets client needs.\n\nIn our Global Banking business, serving commercial and corporate clients, we added more than 1,110 clients to the company in 2022 and grew average loans and leases 14% year-over-year to $375 billion. We also delivered $10.4 billion in Global Transaction Services revenue, up 38% over 2021. We moved up to #3 in the investment banking fees market share worldwide.\n\nOur Global Markets business once again had a very strong year despite market volatility. The team grew year-over-year sales and trading revenue by 9%, and had the highest full-year tally since 2010. This included investment in our macro trading business, which had revenues that were up 38% for the year. Overall Global Markets average trading-related assets were up 9% and average loans of $117 billion increased 28%.\n\nResponsible Growth means growing with a focus on the customer-and that means that our products and services must evolve in line with our clients' unique financial needs.\n\nGrow with a customer focus. Responsible Growth means growing with a focus on our customers and clients -and that means that our products and services must evolve in line with our clients' unique financial needs. Consumer customers continue to tell us they value our digital capabilities. In 2022, your company:\n\n- \u00b7 Added three million active digital banking users, improving upon a record performance in 2021\n- \u00b7 Had 56 million verified users with 44 million active and engaged in the past 90 days\n- \u00b7 Experienced 11.6 billion digital logins\n- \u00b7 Grew digital sales 22%, representing nearly 50% of overall consumer sales\n\nErica\u00ae, our artificial intelligence (AI)-based virtual financial assistant, also continues to attract increased client engagement as it has proven to be a critical channel to help us deliver important information to clients and address their questions and concerns in real-time. Erica handled roughly 145 million interactions in the fourth quarter and recently passed a billion interactions since its introduction.\n\nAmong the most significant digital-driven changes in banking is how our clients want to send and receive money. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the number of consumer clients who are active Zelle\u00ae\n\nusers increased 15% to 18.2 million. These active users sent and received 273 million transfers worth $81 billion, up 25% and 24% year-over-year, respectively. Zelle-sent transactions exceed checks written by our consumers. This shows our customers' preference for digital convenience. This allows us to see strong customer scores and loyalty, while reducing our costs of operation in our consumer business as a percentage of deposits to 117 basis points.\n\nOur wealth clients also expect digital innovation, and we are providing it. For example:\n\n- \u00b7 In the fourth quarter of 2022, Erica interactions in the Merrill Wealth Management business increased 23% and Zelle transactions by Private Bank clients increased 39%.\n- \u00b7 Merrill clients are 82% digitally active while our Private Bank clients are now 86% digitally active-new highs for both.\n- \u00b7 Digital check deposit rates for Merrill and Private Bank clients stand at 75% and 76%, respectively.\n- \u00b7 Merrill now has 77% of households enrolled in eDelivery, with 223,000 planning reports generated-up 26% from the end of the previous year.\n- \u00b7 Merrill Lynch advisors sent 1.4 million secure messages to our clients in the fourth quarter of 2022 alone.\n\nOur commercial clients also continue to adopt our easy-to-use CashPro app, and along with that use, we're seeing an increasing percentage of credit documents uploaded digitally, saving clients time. As of late 2022, 75% of clients are digitally active on the CashPro and BA360 platforms across commercial, corporate, and business banking. The fourth quarter of 2022 saw record quarterly CashPro App engagement, with active users increasing 25% and sign-ins increasing 50%, in turn driving a record 40% increase in quarterly CashPro App payment approvals with a value of $186 billion. We know we can increase these award-wining capabilities even more, driven by client demand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe case for continued development of our digital platforms is simple: clients tell us they clearly appreciate the value and convenience it provides-so we will continue to provide and expand it.\n\nWe continue to take the steps necessary to fully digitally enable all products to drive growth and maximize the client experience. That's why we invested $3.6 billion in 2022 for new technology initiatives, to build a powerful, more secure, and scalable technology platform with market-leading capabilities. That sum is up from 2021 and is expected to be higher again in 2023. And through continuous investment we have spent more than $30 billion over the past decade on new technology initiatives.",

        "page_content": "At the same time, we also continued to focus on delivering expert support and guidance across our high-touch physical network, opening 58 new financial centers, and renovating 784 more in 2022. We ended the year with 3,900 financial centers and 15,500 ATMs. This network also includes our phone, offices, and chat capabilities. We are pleased by the results in our new markets, where we are growing from no financial centers there to become top 10 or above in deposit market share in just a few years.\n\nTogether, our combined high-tech and high-touch approach to serving clients has led to record-high levels of customer satisfaction for Bank of America in 2022 and, in turn, contributed to our growth. Simply put, more satisfied clients do more business with us.\n\nAnother recent example of our customer-focus is the continued evolution of our overdra/ft services and solutions -work that had been underway for more than a dozen years to reduce clients' reliance on overdra/fts and provide alternatives to help clients manage their deposit accounts and avoid fees. You can see in our Retail Banking update on page 16 that these fees are down over 90% from 2009.\n\nWe believe that these fees are not sustainable for a good customer relationship, and by eliminating them we are able to increase satisfaction and deepen relationships to create a more stable source of revenues, while reducing costs for our company.\n\nThis work benefitted from the important insights and guidance from our National Community Advisory Council (NCAC), a group of external advisors, analysts, and consumer advocates that we established 17 years ago. The NCAC provides important external perspective to help us understand, design, and deliver products to help meet the needs of our communities-particularly those in the low- to moderate-income sphere.\n\nGrow within our risk framework. The third tenet of Responsible Growth is to grow within our well-managed risk framework -a framework that allowed us to be a source of strength to clients during the health crisis and that has continued to allow us to grow during the current volatile market environment.\n\nOur discipline around risk has us well-prepared for a severe economic stress scenario, as illustrated by Bank of America having the lowest stressed credit loss rates among major banks in nine out of the past 10 CCAR exams conducted by the Federal Reserve Board. As we cited earlier, credit quality continues to be better than 2019, which was the last year before the pandemic and represented a very strong year for credit at banks.\n\nIn addition to being effective, our risk management is also agile-when regulatory capital ratio requirements for banks changed with little advance notice in 2022, we made moves so that we had a buffer to those requirements quickly. Importantly, we did that as we continued to support clients, return capital to shareholders, and strengthen our strong balance sheet.\n\n## Continued quarterly operating leverage\u00b9 streak in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: Amounts may not total due to rounding.\n\n- 1 Operating leverage is calculated as the year-over-year percentage change in revenue, net of interest expense, less the percentage change in noninterest expense.",

        "page_content": "Grow in a sustainable manner. Responsible Growth requires us to grow in a sustainable manner. This has three components.\n\nFirst, we drive Operational Excellence (OpEx). This allows us to create savings, which we can then reinvest-in our capabilities, our teammates, our communities and in capital returns to shareholders. Second, we want to be a Great Place to Work for our teammates. This provides us a competitive edge to attract the best new teammates to serve our clients and retain them once they've joined the team. Third, we share our success so we can support the communities in which we work and live and help to address the biggest challenges facing communities today.\n\nDriving Operational Excellence. OpEx is how we create the means to reduce costs by striving to eliminate inefficiencies in our processes across our platform and reinvest savings into the things that are important to us: our team, our capabilities, our client experience, our communities, and our shareholders.\n\nBy pursuing OpEx, we drive continuous improvement, reduce risk, and identify faster, simpler, and more efficient ways of working and serving our clients.\n\nIn 2022, our fourth quarter operating leverage was 6%. Simply put, operating leverage is the percentage growth in revenue minus the percent growth in expenses. By looking for continuous process improvements and savings through OpEx, we have delivered operating leverage for the past six consecutive quarters-picking back up on the 18-quarter streak we had developed prior to the pandemic-driven economic slowdown.\n\nIn Retail Banking, OpEx and a more digitized customer base helped pay for investments that allowed us to improve that business's efficiency ratio to 47% in the most recent quarter, an impressive 600 basis point improvement over the year-ago fourth quarter.\n\nAcross the company, we have implemented more than 12,000 employee-sourced suggestions since 2014 to simplify our work and create greater efficiency. In addition to making it easier to serve our clients, these ideas have resulted in nearly $5 billion in expense savings and 13 million hours of capacity saved. Whatever challenges the future may hold, your company's focus on OpEx will help deliver for clients while investing in the future of our people, communities and driving great returns to you, our shareholders. In 2022, our expenses were $61 billion, which is more than $10 billion lower than a decade ago.\n\nCentral to driving Responsible Growth is being a Great Place to Work for our teammates. In 2022, we continued this long-standing commitment.\n\nMaking our company a Great Place to Work. Central to driving Responsible Growth is being a Great Place to Work for our teammates. In 2022, we continued this long-standing commitment, including delivering a range of some of the best benefits in corporate America, supporting the development of our employees, and maintaining a workplace where every individual can thrive.\n\nOur goal continues to be a company where people want to work today and build a career. The reward for our shareholders is lower turnover costs. You can read more about how we are investing in teammates in our Human Capital Management update on pages 42-57.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Highlights include:\n\n- \u00b7 We increased our U.S. minimum hourly wage to $22 in our next step toward $25 by 2025. This means that any employee who works full-time for our company makes at least ~$46,000 per year as well as some of the most comprehensive benefits available.\n- \u00b7 In addition to normal merit, we delivered a mid-year increase to annual base salaries for all U.S. employees who currently receive annual total compensation below $100,000 and have been employed with the company since 2021 or earlier. The percentage increase for eligible employees ranged from 3% to 7%, increasing with years of service.\n- \u00b7 In recognition of the important achievements made by our employees in 2022, our Management Team, Board of Directors and I once again recognized teammates with our Sharing Success compensation award. This is the sixth time teammates will receive this award, totaling more than $4 billion since its inception. Approximately 96% of our teammates received an award this year, with the vast majority receiving it in the form of Bank of America stock to help them share in our long-term success.\n- \u00b7 We also launched a new sabbatical program for employees celebrating milestones of 15 years or more beginning in 2023, and doubled the number of confidential, face-to-face counseling sessions available through our Employee Assistance Program.\n- \u00b7 We increased our childcare benefits, which provide eligible employees making less than $100,000 per year a reimbursement of up to $275 a month per child for the cost of childcare.\n- \u00b7 We also continued to have no, or below our cost, increases in health benefits for most of our teammates to help them care for their families.",

We know that when our workforce reflects the communities we serve, we can better serve our clients while also creating an environment where people want to perform their best. Our diversity and inclusion (D&I) policies drive transparency, accountability, and continued progress while encouraging all teammates to bring their full and authentic selves to work each day. Third parties validate our equal pay for equal work efforts, and we continue to survey our teammates annually on how we are doing in the D&I space. As in recent years, the 2022 employee survey D&I index scores remained high.\n\nSharing our success. At Bank of America, sharing success includes giving and volunteering, as well as helping to address issues affecting clients and communities. When our communities fare well, we fare well, and our brand reflects it.\n\nIn 2022, we made nearly $360 million in philanthropic investments to strengthen our communities. Our teammates also donated money, as well as their time, to share success. Charitable giving by our teammates in 2022, combined with matching gi/fts from Bank of America, totaled more than $65 million. Our teammates also reported nearly two million volunteer hours for the year. I am proud to share this proof of their commitment to our communities with you.\n\nTo help support health and safety, and address food insecurity in our local markets, we ran two campaigns to encourage employees to get vaccinated and/or boosted against COVID-19 and the flu, donating to hunger relief organizations for each employee who took those actions. Combined, the campaigns donated more than $18 million for hunger organizations across the country. Since 2015 we have donated nearly $184 million toward hunger relief efforts.\n\nWe also create opportunity in our communities through employment. We are in our second commitment to hire 10,000 teammates from low- and moderate-income communities, having completed the first in three years versus the five pledged. Similarly, to recognize our service men and women, we have hired over 15,000 veterans in the last eight years. We work with other companies to expand the principles of skills-based hiring to large companies. This gives an employee a great start with great benefits.\n\nWe continue to help drive sustainability through our work with clients to help them transition to a secure, low-carbon economy. We are committed to helping facilitate that just energy transition, with clean energy that is affordable, sustainable and secure. That's why in 2020 we set a goal to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion by 2030 to advance the sustainable development goals (SDGs) 193 countries agreed to in 2015, with $1 trillion of that focused on helping our clients transition to a low-carbon future. From 2021 through 2022, we mobilized and deployed a cumulative total of $410 billion in sustainable finance, with more than $235 billion of that focused on helping drive affordable clean energy and related priorities. At the same time, we are helping catalyze efforts globally by playing a lead role in multiple global organizations to give private companies from all sectors the opportunity to exchange ideas and consider transactions and investments that can help accelerate the transition.\n\nOur approach to sustainable finance is to help our clients make the transition they seek. It is great business and great for society. For more, see page 38.\n\nWe issued our third Equality Progress Sustainability Bond for $2 billion. The use of proceeds from the bond offering is designed to advance racial and gender equality, economic opportunity, and environmental sustainability.\n\nWe also created additional opportunity for diverse and women entrepreneurs and business owners.\n\nOver the last few years, we have invested in 23 minority depository institutions. We also have helped seed more than 130 private equity funds run by women and diverse private equity entrepreneurs. These private equity funds have funded more than 1,000 operating companies owned by like cohorts. We also recognize the value to our business-and to society-of supply chain diversity. In 2022, approximately $2 billion of our nearly $19 billion in annual spend was with diverse suppliers. You can read more about how we are investing in diverse entrepreneurs on page 36.\n\n## Measuring our positive impact at home and around the world - how  capitalism  delivers\n\nI was asked by a teammate with a college-age daughter how we might be more convincing that capitalism is doing what society wants from it. My response: We don't leave it to interpretation, we disclose what we do for all to see. What we show in the metrics in this report is the progress we are making as well as the alignment to what society wants from capitalism-to produce profits and purpose. That perpetual motion machine of capitalism can continuously invest in progress on the goals described below. Charity is wonderful, but it doesn't provide enough money. Governments are large spenders, but they are short on cash and run huge deficits, so they really don't have the money to drive sustained progress. Government policies shi/ft and therefore long-term change is hard to achieve. Companies around the world, when aligned to the tasks generate activity that dwarfs the efforts of other sectors. It is sustained by the profits, which draw more capital. So the straightforward answer to the teammate was -if we want to be successful at what society wants, we should all cheer capitalism on.",

In the U.S. and globally, companies can track their performance in areas that include equality of opportunity, affordable housing, prosperity, access to clean water, sustainable, clean, secure energy, and other priorities.\n\nWe do so through reporting a set of universal Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics (SCM). The SCMs span the breadth of global industry, giving a consistent framework to measure and disclose how companies are addressing societal priorities and the SDGs through their business activities and operations. Nearly 200 companies around the world have committed to reporting SCMs -and about 140 have already begun to do so. The metrics were developed with the expertise of the global Big Four accounting firms.\n\nYou can find our 2022 Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics on page 60. This is the third consecutive year we have published these metrics in our Annual Report, in addition to our financial disclosures. We believe this provides the most relevant, useful and transparent information. This disclosure is comprehensive and straightforward, allowing you, our shareholders, to assess your company. Many observers express different views on disclosures; for example, there are multiple shareholder proposals in our proxy statement, each\n\nexpressing different views on what is the right disclosure or action. We encourage you to review our SCMs and all the other disclosures we reference in this Annual Report and proxy statement. We don't need to spend more of your money on inconsistent and redundant standards; we need to keep driving our performance.\n\nThe last year has underscored once again that change is constant in our world.

This includes meeting with the Management Team to review and approve the company's strategy, and conducting a year-round strategic assessment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand planning process to provide additional oversight of Bank of America's strategic execution.

Today, more than 5,200 teammates support our clients and communities in the area. Across all our lines of business, we provide solutions through a local network of more than 130 financial centers, 470 ATMs and nearly 15 combined Merrill and The Private Bank offices. We also recently opened our new Bank of America Tower along the Chicago River, the tallest commercial office building completed in the city in the past 30 years.\n\nIn 2022, the team in Chicago worked with clients to help achieve their financial goals, which translated to $448 million in loans to small businesses, $14 billion in loans to commercial businesses, $937 million in home loans and $61 billion in total FDIC deposits.\n\n'What sets us apart in Chicago, and how we are growing organically in the market, is the combination of our local knowledge and global resources to help our clients and partners achieve their goals,' said Rita S. Cook, president of Bank of America Chicago. 'We have incredible integration across the business to bring forward digital tools, personalized solutions and local experts, and to deploy capital to help solve some of Chicagoland's most pressing needs.'\n\nOne example of integrated delivery of the company's capabilities is the recent collaboration between The Private Bank, Global Markets and Global Commercial Banking to provide our Corporate Employee Banking & Investing program to a Chicagobased financial services client. Another example is Merrill, with\n\n$89 billion in client balances in the market at year-end 2022, which connected Small Business Banking to a wealth management client to seamlessly transition banking services for a wholesale manufacturing goods company they had recently purchased.\n\nThe team is deeply embedded in the fabric of Chicagoland. The market directed $13 million in funding to more than 100 area nonprofit organizations working to drive economic opportunity for individuals and families in underserved communities in 2022. Chicago employees also personally support local nonprofits and community needs, including contributing more than 228,000 volunteer hours since 2018 to the causes they care about.\n\nOne partner is the Chicago Community Loan Fund, which provides flexible financing and technical assistance to initiatives for lowand moderate-income neighborhoods, families and individuals. Its president, Calvin Holmes, was also recognized with the Bank of America Neighborhood Builders\u00ae Racial Equality Award for his contributions to breaking racial barriers and creating opportunities for people of color.\n\nThe team also drives positive impact through the Bank of America Chicago Distance Series, including the 8K, half marathon and marathon events.\n\nThe Bank of America Chicago Marathon alone generates more than $386 million in economic impact to Chicagoland annually, while providing the equivalent of more than 2,800 jobs at a time of year when tourism in the city would otherwise experience a seasonal decline.\n\nAdditionally, thousands of runners participate in the race's Charity Program, raising a record-breaking $27.6 million in 2022.\n\nThis commitment to local delivery is replicated in each of our local markets across the country, helping us deliver Responsible Growth for our clients, teammates and communities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The directory is also available in Spanish and builds on ongoing work with partners to connect entrepreneurs to capital, including the Tory Burch and Bank of America Capital Program and the Bank of America Loan Fund for Women Entrepreneurs at Kiva.\n\nDiverse entrepreneurs also need additional resources and opportunities to manage and scale a successful business.

These include the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI), which was launched by His Majesty King Charles III in his former role as His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales. CEO Brian Moynihan, who serves as SMI chair, convened the 200 active CEO members throughout 2022, including at the 27 th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), to help drive collective creativity, innovation and capital mobilization towards a sustainable future.\n\nOur clients, suppliers and partners have their own plans to address the need for energy affordability, sustainability and security. As a global financial institution, we support clients in every industry through these transitions with comprehensive financial solutions, including lending, capital raising, advisory and investment services. We mobilized capital through our asset-based lending, tax equity and placement activities across clean energy sub-sectors like wind, solar, distributed generation and associated infrastructure. And, we are developing tailored financial solutions for emerging clean energy technologies that will augment traditional renewable energy sources and help achieve a clean, secure energy future.\n\nThe transition will require a significant investment: some estimates are as high as $275 trillion over the next 30 years. This is an important business opportunity for Bank of America and for our clients that we expect to lead to job creation, economic activity and technological innovation. Working with our clients in every industry, we've made significant progress on our 2021 target to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030, $1 trillion of which is aligned to the environmental transition and $500 billion to inclusive social development.\n\nWe are also one of the largest U.S. corporate issuers of ESGthemed bonds. In 2022, we issued our third Equality Progress Sustainability Bond for $2 billion, designed to help advance racial and gender equality, economic opportunity and environmental sustainability.\n\nWhile environmental investments are critical, we also have a strong focus on social inclusive development, including investments in affordable housing and community banks.\n\nThrough the SMI and other forums, such as the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, First Movers Coalition and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst , we partner with governments, regional lenders, development finance institutions (DFIs) and philanthropies to bridge the funding gap and mobilize private capital toward sustainable development in emerging markets:\n\n- \u00b7 We're exploring opportunities with DFIs to structure a blended finance loan facility for CrossBoundary Energy to support their development pipeline of solar and wind generation and storage projects in Africa.\n- \u00b7 We're deepening our relationship with InterEnergy by providing a loan facility in partnership with a multilateral development bank to support the construction and operation of eligible renewable energy and clean transportation infrastructure projects located in Small Island Developing States in the Caribbean.\n- \u00b7 We're supporting Just Energy Transition Partnership with both Indonesia and Vietnam as part of a coalition working toward the facilitation and mobilization of public and private financing to help with the transition of each country's power sector toward renewable energy and increase investment in transition-aligned jobs and industries of the future.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Notably:\n\n- \u00b7 The Academy's educational offerings help prepare individuals for a career in any profession through skillspecific learning and training, fostering economic mobility and inspiring career confidence.\n- \u00b7 The Academy also has conducted live sessions with more than 1,200 participants and provided support to more than 1,000 external participants to prepare them for a position at Bank of America or another employer.\n\nWe connect employers and skills-building partners to ultimately support career pathways.\n\nOur approach focuses on the specific workforce requirements of actual employers and delivering the necessary training and programming with partners able to fill that need. This is driven by convening nonprofit organizations and academic institutions, creating tailored solutions to fit each of our local markets, hiring through external community partnerships, and the training and professional development available internally from The Academy, our awardwinning onboarding, education and professional development organization.",

Most awards are in the form of Bank of America common stock that vest over four years, providing the opportunity to further share in our company's long-term success. These awards are in addition to our standard annual compensation and bonus awards.\n\nWe also maintain robust policies and practices that help reinforce equal pay for equal work, including reviews with oversight from our Board and senior leaders. For over 16 years, we have conducted rigorous processes and analyses with outside experts to examine individual employee pay before year-end compensation decisions are finalized, and we adjust compensation where appropriate.\n\nIn 2022, results of this equal pay for equal work review showed that compensation received by women was on average more than 99% of that received by men, and that compensation received by people of color in the U.S. was on average more than 99% of that received by non-people of color employees.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We also partner with many nonprofit organizations to create pathways to employment including Road to Hire, Unidos, Urban Alliance and Year Up. -\n\nIn 2022, we believe we continued to drive progress in the strength and diversity of our employees:\n\n## ENTRY-LEVEL PROGRAMS\n\nWe expanded our outreach and onboarded 1,800 full-time campus hires, with 44% women and 59% people of color.\n\n## EDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\nWe contributed $9.6 million in 2022 to 50 national workforce training partners and nearly $31 million toward programs focused on increasing diverse talent in high-growth areas.\n\n## MILITARY HIRING\n\nWe hired more than 5,100 U.S. teammates with a military background.\n\n## PATHWAYS\n\nWe are making progress on our commitment to hire an additional 10,000 low- and moderate-income (LMI) hires by 2025, bringing the total to 20,000 LMI hires.

We also measure an internal Diversity & Inclusion Index 1 that gives us feedback on how we measure inclusion at the company. It is up 8 percentage points during the same time, and index scores are strong relative to industry benchmarks over time.\n\nThe results of the survey and the process of continuous improvement that ensues is discussed with the Board at least annually. Our efforts reflect our progress in being a great place to work. We believe our employee turnover reflects the strength of our employee engagement results and how our teammates view Bank of America as an employer of choice.\n\nOver the past decade, our turnover rate has been among the lowest in the industry. In that time, we have experienced vastly different labor markets, the pandemic and return to office. With the tight labor market in 2022, we saw a slight increase in turnover in the first half of the year, and in the second half dropped back to pre-pandemic record lows, resulting in a 13% annualized turnover rate -a strong result for a company of our size and scale.\n\nWith our variety of resources and programs that support career growth and development, we're helping teammates have longterm careers with our company. We also continue to enhance our internal mobility practices, which has led to nearly 45% of our open roles being filled by internal candidates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployee Engagement Index Score\n\nTurnover",

The Sustainability Information included in this report may consider disclosure recommendations and broader definitions of materiality used by certain voluntary external frameworks and reporting guidelines that differ from mandatory regulatory reporting, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, any such Sustainability Information may be presented from a different perspective and in more detail than in Bank of America's regulatory reporting, and materiality and any use of the term 'material' in the context of the Sustainability Information may be distinct from such term as defined for SEC reporting purposes. Any inclusion of Sustainability Information in this report is not an indication that the subject or information is material to Bank of America for SEC reporting purposes.\n\nAdditionally, Sustainability Information may be based on current or historic goals, targets, commitments, estimates, assumptions, standards, methodologies and internal control frameworks and currently available data, which continue to evolve and develop, and such statements are not guarantees or promises that any such metrics, aspirations, targets, goals or commitments will be met. The Sustainability Information is as of the date referenced, subject to change without notice and may be regarded as indicative and for illustrative purposes only. The Sustainability Information may vary based on applicable laws, rules and regulations and in different geographic areas. Such Sustainability Information may also include the use of non-financial metrics and other information that are subject to significant measurement uncertainties, which may include the methodology, collection and verification of data, various estimates and assumptions and/or underlying data that is obtained from third parties, some of which we cannot independently verify.\n\nCertain statements contained in this report may constitute 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about our future financial performance and business and Sustainability Information, which may evolve over time. We use words such as 'anticipates,' 'targets,' 'expects,' 'hopes,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'goals,' 'believes,' 'continue' and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as 'will,' 'may,' 'might,' 'should,' 'would' and 'could' to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations, plans or forecasts, are not guarantees of future results or performance, involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and often beyond our control and are inherently uncertain. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by any of these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including global socio-demographic and economic trends, energy prices, technological innovations and advances, climaterelated conditions and weather events, legislative and regulatory changes, public policies, engagement with clients, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders and other unforeseen events or conditions, as well as the uncertainties and risks discussed in Bank of America Corporation's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nBank of America Corporation (the Corporation) and its management  may  make  certain  statements  that  constitute 'forward-looking  statements'  within  the  meaning  of the  Private Securities Litigation  Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be  identified  by  the  fact  that  they  do  not  relate  strictly  to historical  or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words  such  as  'anticipates,'  'targets,'  'expects,'  'hopes,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'goals,' 'believes,' 'continue' and other similar expressions or future  or conditional  verbs  such  as 'will,'  'may,'  'might,'  'should,'  'would'  and  'could.'  Forwardlooking statements represent the Corporation's current expectations,  plans  or forecasts  of its  future  results,  revenues, provision  for credit  losses,  expenses,  efficiency  ratio,  capital measures, strategy and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not  guarantees  of future  results  or performance  and  involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation's control.  Actual  outcomes  and  results  may  differ materially  from those  expressed  in,  or implied  by,  any  of these  forward-looking statements.\n\nYou should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement  and  should  consider the  following  uncertainties  and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K: and in any of the Corporation's subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation's potential judgments, orders, settlements, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory investigations, proceedings and enforcement actions, including as a  result  of our participation  in  and  execution  of government programs  related  to  the  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19) pandemic, such as the processing of unemployment benefits for California  and  certain  other states;  the  possibility  that  the Corporation's  future  liabilities  may  be  in  excess  of its  recorded liability  and  estimated  range  of possible  loss  for litigation,  and regulatory  and  government  actions;  the  possibility  that  the Corporation could face increased claims from one or more parties involved  in  mortgage  securitizations;  the  Corporation's  ability  to resolve  representations  and  warranties  repurchase  and  related claims;  the  risks  related  to  the  discontinuation  of the  London Interbank  Offered  Rate  and  other reference  rates,  including increased  expenses  and  litigation  and  the  effectiveness  of hedging strategies; uncertainties about the financial stability and growth  rates  of non-U.S.  jurisdictions,  the  risk  that  those jurisdictions  may  face  difficulties  servicing  their sovereign  debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and  the  Corporation's  exposures  to  such  risks,  including  direct, indirect  and  operational;  the  impact  of U.S.  and  global  interest rates,  inflation,  currency  exchange  rates,  economic  conditions, trade  policies  and  tensions,  including  tariffs,  and  potential geopolitical instability; the impact of the interest rate,  inflationary and macroeconomic environment on the Corporation's business, financial  condition  and  results  of operations; the possibility  that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes  in  economic  assumptions,  customer behavior,  adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions and  other uncertainties,  including  the  impact  of supply  chain disruptions,  inflationary  pressures  and  labor shortages  on economic conditions and our business; potential losses related to the  Corporation's  concentration  of credit  risk;  the  Corporation's ability to achieve its expense targets and expectations regarding revenue,  net  interest  income,  provision  for credit  losses,  net\n\ncharge-offs,  effective  tax  rate,  loan  growth  or other projections; adverse  changes  to  the  Corporation's  credit  ratings  from  the major credit  rating  agencies;  an  inability  to  access  capital markets or maintain deposits or borrowing costs; estimates of the fair value  and  other accounting  values,  subject  to  impairment assessments, of certain of the Corporation's assets and liabilities; the  estimated  or actual  impact  of changes  in  accounting standards or assumptions in applying those standards; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse changes to total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, stress capital buffer requirements and/or global systemically important bank surcharges;  the  potential  impact  of actions  of the  Board  of Governors  of the  Federal  Reserve  System  on  the  Corporation's capital  plans;  the  effect  of changes  in  or interpretations  of income  tax  laws  and  regulations;  the  impact  of implementation and compliance with U.S. and international laws, regulations and regulatory  interpretations,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  recovery and resolution planning requirements, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  assessments,  the  Volcker Rule,  fiduciary  standards, derivatives  regulations  and  the  Coronavirus  Aid,  Relief,  and Economic  Security  Act  and  any  similar or related  rules  and regulations; a  failure or disruption  in  or breach  of the Corporation's operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those  of third  parties,  including  as  a  result  of cyber-attacks  or campaigns;  the  risks  related  to  the  transition  and  physical impacts of climate change; our ability  to  achieve environmental, social and governance goals and commitments or the impact of any  changes  in  the  Corporation's  sustainability  strategy  or commitments  generally;  the  impact  of any  future  federal government  shutdown  and  uncertainty  regarding  the  federal government's  debt  limit  or changes  in  fiscal,  monetary  or regulatory  policy;  the  emergence  or continuation  of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, including the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on U.S. and/or global  financial  market  conditions  and  our business,  results  of operations,  financial  condition  and  prospects;  the  impact  of natural  disasters,  extreme  weather events,  military  conflict (including the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the possible expansion of such conflict and potential geopolitical consequences), terrorism or other geopolitical events; and other matters.\n\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made,  and  the  Corporation  undertakes  no  obligation  to  update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances  or events  that  arise  after the  date  the  forwardlooking statement was made.\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in  the  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) are incorporated by reference into the MD&A. Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation.

Our retail banking footprint covers all major markets in  the  U.S., and  we  serve  approximately 67  million  consumer and  small  business  clients  with  approximately 3,900  retail financial  centers, approximately 16,000  ATMs, and  leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with approximately 44  million  active  users, including  approximately 35 million active mobile users.

We  are  a  global  leader in  corporate  and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes  serving  corporations, governments, institutions  and individuals around the world.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n## Capital Management\n\nOn February 1, 2023, the Corporation's Board of Directors (the Board) declared  a  quarterly common  stock  dividend  of $0.22 per share, payable  on  March  31, 2023  to  shareholders  of record as of March 3, 2023.\n\nFor more information on our capital  resources, see Capital Management on page 96.\n\n## Changes in U.S. Tax Law\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which  contained  a  number of tax-related provisions. The  tax changes  included  the  extension  and expansion  of renewable  energy tax credit programs, the establishment of a  new  15  percent alternative  minimum tax (AMT) on  adjusted  financial  statement income  for large corporations and a one percent excise tax on stock repurchases. For more  information, see  Financial  Highlights  Income Tax Expense on page 76.\n\n## Russia/Ukraine Conflict\n\nDue to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, there has been significant volatility in  financial  and  commodities  markets, and  multiple jurisdictions have implemented various economic sanctions. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our direct net country exposure to  Russia  was  $443  million  and  $733  million, primarily consisting of outstanding loans and leases totaling $391 million and $686 million, and our net country exposure to Ukraine was not significant. While  the  Corporation's  direct exposure  to Russia is limited, the potential duration, course and impact of the Russia/Ukraine  conflict remain  uncertain  and  could adversely affect macroeconomic and  geopolitical  conditions, which  could  negatively impact the  Corporation's  businesses, results of operations and financial position. For more\n\ninformation on the risks related to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, see  the  Market, Credit and  Geopolitical  sections  in  Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates\n\nAfter December 31, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) ceased  publishing  British  Pound  Sterling  (GBP), Euro, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen (JPY) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings, subject to  the  continued  publication  of certain non-representative LIBOR  settings  based  on  a  modified calculation  (i.e., on  a  'synthetic' basis). The  remaining  USD LIBOR  settings  (i.e., overnight, one  month, three  month, six month and 12 month) will cease or become non-representative immediately after June  30, 2023, although  the  Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued a consultation seeking views on whether to compel publication of the one-month, three-month and six-month USD LIBOR settings on a 'synthetic' basis for a short time  after June  30, 2023  (i.e., through  September 30, 2024). Separately, the  Federal  Reserve, the  Office  of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC) issued  supervisory guidance  encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 2021, subject to certain regulatory-approved exceptions (USD LIBOR Guidance).\n\nAs a result, a major transition has been and continues to be in  progress  in  the  global  financial  markets  with  respect to  the replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs). This has been and continues to be a complex process impacting a variety of our businesses  and  operations. IBORs  have  historically been used  in  many of the  Corporation's  products  and  contracts, including derivatives, consumer and commercial loans, mortgages, floating-rate notes and other adjustable-rate products and financial instruments. In response, the Corporation  established  an  enterprise-wide  IBOR  transition program, with  active  involvement of senior management and regular reports to the Management Risk Committee (MRC) and Enterprise  Risk  Committee  (ERC). The  program continues  to drive  the  Corporation's  industry and  regulatory engagement, client and  financial  contract changes, internal  and  external communications, technology and  operations  modifications, including  updates  to  its  operational  models, systems  and processes, introduction  of new  products, migration  of existing clients, and program strategy and governance.\n\nAs  of December 31, 2021, the  Corporation  transitioned  or otherwise addressed  IBOR-based  products  and  contracts referencing the rates that ceased or became non-representative after December 31, 2021, including  LIBOR-linked  commercial loans, LIBOR-based adjustable-rate consumer mortgages, LIBOR-linked derivatives and interdealer trading  of certain  USD LIBOR  and  other interest rate  swaps, and  related  hedging arrangements. Additionally, in  accordance  with  the  USD  LIBOR Guidance, the  Corporation  has  ceased  entering  into  new contracts  that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate, subject to limited  exceptions, including  those  consistent with  supervisory guidance.\n\nThe  Corporation  launched  capabilities  and  services  to support the  issuance  of and  trading  in  products  indexed  to various  alternative  reference  rates  (ARRs) and  developed employee  training  programs  as  well  as  other internal  and external  sources  of information  on  the  various  challenges  and opportunities that the replacement of IBORs has presented and continues  to  present. The  Corporation  continues  to  monitor a variety of market scenarios  as  part of its  transition  efforts, including  risks  associated  with  insufficient preparation  by",

        "page_content": "individual market participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market participants  to  meet regulatory and  industrywide  recommended  milestones, and  access  and  demand  by clients  and  market participants  to  liquidity in  certain  products, including LIBOR products.\n\nWith respect to the transition of LIBOR products referencing USD LIBOR settings ceasing or becoming non-representative as of June  30, 2023, a  significant majority of the  Corporation's notional contractual exposure to such LIBOR settings, of which the  significant majority is  derivatives  contracts, have  been remediated (i.e., updated to include fallback provisions to ARRs based  on  market-driven  protocols, regulatory guidance  and industry-recommended fallback provisions and related mechanisms), and  the  Corporation  is  continuing  to  remediate the  remaining  USD  LIBOR  exposure. For example, during  the first half of 2023, certain central counterparties (CCPs) expect to  complete  processes  to  convert outstanding  USD  LIBORcleared derivatives to ARR positions. The remaining exposure, a majority of which  is  made  up  of derivatives  and  commercial loans and which represents a small minority of outstanding USD LIBOR notional contractual exposure of the Corporation, requires active  dialogue  with  clients  to  modify the  contracts. For any residual  exposures  after June  2023  that continue  to  have  no fallback  provisions, the  Corporation  continues  to  assess  and plans  to  leverage  relevant contractual  and  statutory solutions, including the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act in the U.S. (as implemented  by the  Federal  Reserve) and  'synthetic' USD LIBOR (if the FCA compels such publication), to transition such exposure.\n\nWhile there remain risks to the Corporation associated with the  transition  from IBORs  (as  discussed  under Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our 2022 Annual Report on  Form 10-K), such risks have been monitored and, where applicable, managed through the Corporation's efforts and dedicated operational resources to date. In  the  Corporation's view, the potential likelihood and/or impact of transition-related  risks  has  lessened  over time, and the Corporation anticipates it has devoted appropriate resources  to  remaining  transition  efforts  and  will  be  able  to continue to appropriately monitor and manage such risks as the transition process continues. The Corporation expects transition-related  risks  to  further diminish  as  certain  market developments occur prior to June 30, 2023.\n\nThe  Corporation  has  implemented  regulatory, tax and accounting  changes  and  continues  to  monitor current and potential  impacts  of the  transition, including  Internal  Revenue Service  tax regulations  and  guidance  and  Financial  Accounting Standards  Board  guidance. In  addition, the  Corporation  has engaged  impacted  clients  in  connection  with  the  transition  by providing education on ARRs and the timing of transition events. The Corporation is also working actively with global regulators, industry working groups and trade associations.\n\nFor more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and  other benchmark  rates, see  Item 1A.

The  decrease  in  net income  was  primarily due  to  an increase in provision for credit losses, lower noninterest income and  higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher net interest income.\n\nFor discussion  and  analysis  of our consolidated  and business segment results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020, see Financial Highlights and Business Segment Operations  sections  in  the MD&A of the  Corporation's  2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Net Interest Income\n\nNet interest income  increased  $9.5  billion to  $52.5  billion in 2022 compared to 2021. Net interest yield  on  a  fully taxableequivalent (FTE) basis increased 30 basis points (bps) to 1.96 percent for 2022. The increase was primarily driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization expense, and loan growth, partially offset by a lower amount of accelerated net capitalized loan fees due to Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan  forgiveness, which  primarily occurred  in 2021.

The following highlights the significant changes.\n\n- \u25cf Service  charges  decreased  $1.1  billion  primarily driven  by the  impact of non-sufficient funds  and  overdraft policy changes as well as lower treasury service charges.\n- \u25cf Investment and brokerage services decreased $789 million primarily driven  by lower market valuations  and  declines  in assets under management (AUM) pricing, partially offset by positive AUM flows.\n- \u25cf Investment banking  fees  decreased  $4.1  billion primarily driven by a decline in demand resulting in lower equity and debt issuance fees and lower advisory fees.\n- \u25cf Market making and similar activities  increased  $3.4  billion primarily driven  by improved  performance  across  macro products in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) and by the impact of higher interest rates on client financing activities in Equities.\n- \u25cf Other income  decreased  $988  million primarily due  to certain valuation adjustments.\n\n## Provision for Credit Losses\n\nThe  provision  for credit losses  increased  $7.1  billion to  $2.5 billion  for 2022  compared  to  2021. The  provision  for credit losses  for 2022  was  primarily driven  by loan  growth  and  a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release  for reduced  COVID-19  pandemic (the pandemic) uncertainties. For the same period in the prior year, the benefit in  the  provision  for credit losses  was  due  to  an  improved macroeconomic outlook. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 120.\n\n## Noninterest Expense\n\n## Table 3 Noninterest Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                     | 2022     | 2021      |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Compensation and benefits                 | $ 36,447 | $  36,140 |\n| Occupancy and equipment                   | 7,071    | 7,138     |\n| Information processing and communications | 6,279    | 5,769     |\n| Product delivery and transaction related  | 3,653    | 3,881     |\n| Marketing                                 | 1,825    | 1,939     |\n| Professional fees                         | 2,142    | 1,775     |\n| Other general operating                   | 4,021    | 3,089     |\n| Total noninterest expense                 | $ 61,438 | $  59,731 |\n\nNoninterest expense increased $1.7 billion to  $61.4  billion in 2022  compared  to  2021. The  increase  was  primarily due  to higher investments in people and technology, expense associated with the settlement of the legacy monoline insurance litigation  and  expense  related  to  certain  regulatory matters, partially offset by lower net COVID-19 related costs.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)      | 2022     | 2021      |\n|----------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Income before income taxes | $ 30,969 | $  33,976 |\n| Income tax expense         | 3,441    | 1,998     |\n| Effective tax rate         | 11.1 %   | 5.9 %     |\n\nIncome  tax expense  was  $3.4  billion  for 2022  compared  to $2.0  billion  in  2021  resulting  in  an  effective  tax rate  of 11.1 percent compared to 5.9 percent.\n\nThe  effective  tax rates  for 2022  and  2021  were  primarily driven by our recurring preference benefits. Also included in the effective tax rate for 2021 was the impact of the 2021 U.K. tax law  change  further discussed  in  this  section. For more information  on  our recurring  tax preference  benefits, see Note 19  -  Income  Taxes to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements. Absent environmental, social and governance (ESG) tax credits and  discrete  tax benefits, the  effective  tax rates  would  have been approximately 25 percent.\n\nOn  August 16, 2022, the  U.S. enacted  the  Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained a number of tax-related provisions, including the extension and expansion of renewable energy tax credit programs. In  particular, partnerships  are  no longer solely limited to an Investment Tax Credit, but can now also  elect a  Production  Tax Credit for solar energy production facilities placed in service after December 31, 2021.\n\nOther notable tax law changes include the establishment of a new 15 percent AMT on adjusted financial statement income for large corporations and a one percent excise tax on net stock repurchases, both  of which  were  effective  for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The tax law changes for the new AMT permit business credits, including those from ESG investments  in  renewable  energy and  affordable  housing, to offset potential AMT liability. The Corporation has assessed the potential impacts of these two U.S. tax law changes and does not expect the changes to have a significant effect on its future effective tax rate.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, the U.K. enacted the 2021 Finance Act, which  increased  the  U.K. corporation  income  tax rate  to  25 percent from 19 percent. This change is effective April 1, 2023 and  unfavorably affects  income  tax expense  on  future  U.K. earnings. As a result, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Corporation recorded  a  positive income  tax adjustment of approximately $2.0  billion  with  a  corresponding write-up  of U.K. net deferred  tax assets, which  reflected  a reversal  of previously recorded write-downs of net deferred tax assets for prior changes in the U.K. corporation income tax rate.",

The decrease in  assets  was  primarily due to  lower debt securities and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in loans and leases, trading account assets and federal funds sold and  securities  borrowed  or purchased  under agreements  to resell.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $118.0 billion  primarily driven by lower deposits and continued loan growth .\n\n## Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell\n\nFederal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a  short-term basis. Securities  borrowed  or purchased  under agreements  to  resell  are  collateralized  lending  transactions utilized  to  accommodate  customer transactions, earn  interest rate  spreads  and  obtain  securities  for settlement and  for collateral. Federal  funds  sold  and  securities  borrowed  or\n\npurchased  under agreements to  resell  increased  $16.9  billion primarily due to client activity within Global Markets .\n\n## Trading Account Assets\n\nTrading  account assets  consist primarily of long  positions  in equity and  fixed-income  securities  including  U.S. government and  agency securities, corporate  securities  and  non-U.S. sovereign debt. Trading account assets increased $49.0 billion primarily due to client activity within Global Markets .\n\n## Debt Securities\n\nDebt securities  primarily include  U.S. Treasury and  agency securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), principally agency MBS, non-U.S. bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use  the  debt securities  portfolio  primarily to  manage  interest rate  and  liquidity risk  and  to  leverage  market conditions  that create  economically attractive  returns  on  these  investments. Debt securities  decreased  $119.8  billion  primarily driven  by lower deposits and continued loan growth.

        "page_content": "## Loans and Leases\n\nLoans  and  leases  increased  $66.6  billion primarily driven  by growth  in  commercial  loans, higher credit card  spending  and higher residential  mortgages  due  to  lower paydowns  and continued  originations. For more  information  on  the  loan portfolio, see Credit Risk Management on page 106.\n\n## Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses increased $295 million primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a  reserve  release  for reduced pandemic uncertainties. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 120.\n\n## All Other Assets\n\nAll  other assets  decreased  $12.5  billion  primarily driven  by a decline in margin loans and loans held-for-sale (LHFS).\n\n## Liabilities\n\nAt December 31, 2022, total liabilities were approximately $2.8 trillion, down $121.3 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower deposits.\n\n## Deposits\n\nDeposits decreased $134.1 billion primarily due to an increase in customer spending and a shift to higher yielding accounts.\n\n## Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\n\nFederal  funds  transactions  involve  borrowing  reserve  balances on  a  short-term basis. Securities  loaned  or sold  under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions  utilized  to  accommodate  customer transactions, earn  interest rate  spreads  and  finance  assets  on  the  balance sheet. Federal  funds  purchased  and  securities  loaned  or sold under agreements to repurchase increased $3.3 billion primarily driven  by an  increase  in  repurchase  agreements  to  support liquidity.\n\n## Trading Account Liabilities\n\nTrading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in equity and  fixed-income  securities  including  U.S. Treasury and agency securities, non-U.S. sovereign  debt and  corporate securities. Trading  account liabilities  decreased  $20.3  billion primarily due  to  lower levels  of short positions  within Global Markets .\n\n## Short-term Borrowings\n\nShort-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term borrowings, notes  payable  and  various  other borrowings  that generally have  maturities  of one  year or less. Short-term borrowings increased $3.2 billion primarily due to an increase in FHLB  advances  and  commercial  paper to  manage  liquidity needs. For more information on short-term borrowings, see Note 10  -  Securities  Financing  Agreements,  Short-term  Borrowings, Collateral  and  Restricted  Cash to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Long-term Debt\n\nLong-term debt decreased  $4.1  billion  primarily due  to maturities, redemptions  and  valuation  adjustments, partially offset by issuances. For more  information  on  long-term debt, see Note  11  -  Long-term  Debt to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## All Other Liabilities\n\nAll  other liabilities  increased  $30.8  billion  primarily driven  by Global Markets client activity.\n\n## Shareholders' Equity\n\nShareholders' equity increased $3.1 billion primarily due to net income and the issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by market value decreases on derivatives and debt securities, and returns  of capital  to  shareholders  through  common  and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases.\n\n## Cash Flows Overview\n\nThe  Corporation's  operating  assets  and  liabilities  support our global  markets  and  lending  activities. We  believe  that cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund  our operating  liquidity needs. Our investing  activities primarily include  the  debt securities  portfolio  and  loans  and leases. Our financing  activities  reflect cash  flows  primarily related to customer deposits, securities financing agreements, long-term debt and  common  and  preferred  stock. For more information on liquidity, see Liquidity Risk on page 101.",

        "page_content": "## Supplemental Financial Data\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn  this  Form 10-K, we  present certain  non-GAAP  financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise  include  components  that differ from the  most directly comparable  measures  calculated  in  accordance  with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance  with  prospective  regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP  financial  measures  and  may not be  defined  or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nWe view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis  with  a  corresponding  increase  in income  tax expense. For purposes  of this  calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state  tax rate. Net interest yield, which  measures  the  basis points  we  earn  over the  cost of funds, utilizes  net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both  taxable  and  tax-exempt sources  and  is  consistent with industry practices.\n\nWe  may present certain  key performance  indicators  and ratios  excluding  certain  items  (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains  (losses)), which  result in non-GAAP  financial measures. We believe  that the  presentation  of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional  information  to  assess  the  underlying  operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize  tangible  equity, a  non-GAAP  financial  measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding  mortgage  servicing  rights  (MSRs)), net of related deferred  tax liabilities ('adjusted' shareholders' equity or common  shareholders' equity). These  measures  are  used  to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and  investment models  use  both  return  on  average  tangible\n\ncommon  shareholders' equity and  return  on  average  tangible shareholders' equity as  key measures  to  support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are:\n\n- \u25cf Return  on  average  tangible  common  shareholders' equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders' equity. The  tangible  common  equity ratio represents  adjusted  ending  common  shareholders' equity divided by total tangible assets.\n- \u25cf Return  on  average  tangible  shareholders' equity measures our net income  as  a  percentage  of adjusted  average  total shareholders' equity. The  tangible  equity ratio  represents adjusted  ending  shareholders' equity divided  by total tangible assets.\n- \u25cf Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending  common  shareholders' equity divided  by ending common shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful  information  because  they present measures  of those assets  that can  generate  income. Tangible  book  value  per common share provides additional useful information about the level  of tangible  assets  in  relation  to  outstanding  shares  of common stock.\n\nThe  aforementioned  supplemental  data  and  performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7.\n\nFor more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures  to  the  corresponding  GAAP  financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 132.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nWe present certain  key financial  and  nonfinancial  performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe  they are  useful  to  investors  because  they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance  and  trends. These  key performance  indicators (KPIs) may not be  defined  or calculated  in  the  same  way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 214.\n\nOur consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 75, Table 6 on page 80 and Table 7 on page 81.\n\nFor information  on  key segment performance  metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 84.",

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. The primary activities, products and businesses of the business segments and All Other are shown below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  periodically review  capital  allocated  to  our businesses and  allocate  capital  annually during  the  strategic and  capital planning  processes. We  utilize  a  methodology that considers the  effect of regulatory capital  requirements  in  addition  to internal  risk-based  capital  models. Our internal  risk-based capital  models  use  a  risk-adjusted  methodology incorporating each  segment's  credit, market, interest rate, business  and operational  risk  components. For more  information  on  the nature  of these  risks, see  Managing  Risk  on  page  93. The capital  allocated  to  the  business  segments  is  referred  to  as allocated  capital. Allocated  equity in  the  reporting  units  is comprised  of allocated  capital  plus  capital  for the  portion  of goodwill  and  intangibles  specifically assigned  to  the  reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note  7  -  Goodwill  and  Intangible  Assets to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFor more  information  on  our presentation  of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on  page  79, and  for reconciliations  to  consolidated  total revenue, net income and year-end total assets, see Note 23 Business  Segment  Information to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nWe present certain  key financial  and  nonfinancial  performance indicators  that management uses  when  evaluating  segment results. We believe  they are  useful  to  investors  because  they provide additional information about our segments' operational performance, customer trends and business growth.",

Deposits  and  Consumer Lending  include  the  net impact of migrating  customers  and  their related  deposit, brokerage asset and loan balances between  Deposits, Consumer Lending and GWIM , as well as other client-managed businesses. Our customers and clients have access to a coastto-coast network including financial centers in 38 states and the District of Columbia. As  of December 31, 2022, our network includes  approximately 3,900 financial  centers, approximately 16,000 ATMs, nationwide  call  centers  and  leading  digital banking  platforms  with  more  than  44 million  active  users, including approximately 35 million active mobile users.\n\n## Consumer Banking Results\n\nNet income  for Consumer Banking increased $625  million to $12.5  billion due  to  higher revenue, partially offset by an increase  in  provision  for credit losses  and  higher noninterest expense. Net interest income  increased $5.1  billion to  $30.0 billion primarily driven by higher interest rates and the benefits of higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by a lower amount of accelerated net capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness, which  primarily occurred  in  2021. Noninterest income decreased $486 million to  $8.6 billion primarily driven by the  impact of non-sufficient funds  and  overdraft policy changes, partially offset by a gain on the sale of an affinity card loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nThe provision for credit losses increased $3.0 billion to $2.0 billion primarily driven  by loan  growth  and  a  dampened\n\nmacroeconomic outlook in 2022, compared to a benefit in 2021 due  to  an  improved  macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $787 million to $20.1 billion primarily driven by continued  investments  for business  growth, including marketing, technology and  people, as  well  as  increased  client activity, partially offset by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization  and  the  contribution  to  the  Bank  of America Foundation in the prior year.\n\nThe  return  on  average  allocated  capital  was  31 percent, unchanged  from 2021. For more  information  on  capital allocated  to  the  business  segments, see  Business  Segment Operations on page 84.\n\n## Deposits\n\nDeposits  includes  the  results  of consumer deposit activities that consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include noninterest-  and  interest-bearing  checking  accounts, money market savings accounts, traditional savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, as well as investment accounts and products. Net interest income is allocated to deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate  sensitivity and  maturity characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as account service fees and ATM fees, as well as  investment and  brokerage  fees  from Consumer Investment accounts. Consumer Investments serves investment client relationships through the Merrill Edge integrated investing and banking service platform, providing  investment advice  and guidance, client brokerage  asset services, self-directed  online investing  and  key banking  capabilities  including  access  to  the",

Noninterest income  decreased $585 million to  $3.1  billion primarily driven  by the  impact of nonsufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, partially offset by higher other service charges due to increased client activity.\n\nThe  provision  for credit losses  increased $324  million to $564 million primarily driven by increased overdraft losses due to  higher payment activity related  to  checking  accounts. The benefit in the prior year was due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $743 million to $12.4 billion primarily driven  by continued  investments  for business growth  and  increased  client activity, partially offset by an impairment charge  for real  estate  rationalization  in  the  prior year.\n\nAverage  deposits  increased $80.7  billion to  $1.1  trillion primarily due  to  net inflows  of $46.8  billion  in  checking  and $34.9 billion in money market savings largely driven by strong organic growth.\n\nThe  table  below  provides  key performance  indicators  for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are  useful  to  investors  because  they provide  additional information  to  evaluate  our deposit profitability and  digital/ mobile trends.\n\n## Key Statistics - Deposits\n\n|                                                        | 2022     | 2021      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Total deposit spreads (excludes noninterest costs) (1) | 1.86%    | 1.69 %    |\n| Year End                                               |          |           |\n| Consumer investment assets (in millions) (2)           | $319,648 | $ 368,831 |\n| Active digital banking users (in thousands) (3)        | 44,054   | 41,365    |\n| Active mobile banking users (in thousands) (4)         | 35,452   | 32,980    |\n| Financial centers                                      | 3,913    | 4,173     |\n| ATMs                                                   | 15,528   | 16,209    |\n\nConsumer investment assets  decreased $49.2  billion to $319.6 billion driven by market performance, partially offset by client flows. Active mobile banking users increased approximately two  million, reflecting  continuing  changes  in  our clients' banking  preferences. We  had  a  net decrease of 260 financial centers and 681 ATMs as we continue to optimize our consumer banking network.\n\n## Consumer Lending\n\nConsumer Lending  offers  products  to  consumers  and  small businesses across the U.S. The products offered include debit and credit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans such as automotive, recreational vehicle and consumer personal loans. In addition to earning net interest spread  revenue  on  its  lending  activities, Consumer Lending  generates  interchange  revenue  from debit and  credit card transactions, late  fees, cash advance fees, annual credit card fees, mortgage banking fee income and other miscellaneous  fees. Consumer Lending  products  are  available to  our customers  through  our retail  network, direct telephone, and online and mobile channels. Consumer Lending results also include the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home\n\nequity loans, including  loans  held  on  the  balance  sheet of Consumer Lending and loans serviced for others.\n\nNet income for Consumer Lending decreased $1.8 billion to $5.4 billion primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses. Net interest income  increased $220  million to  $10.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates and loan balances, largely offset by a lower amount of accelerated net capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness, which primarily occurred in  2021. Noninterest income  increased $99  million to  $5.4 billion primarily driven by a gain on the sale of an affinity card loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nThe provision for credit losses increased $2.7 billion to $1.4 billion primarily driven  by loan  growth  and  a  dampened macroeconomic environment in 2022 compared to a benefit in 2021 due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $44 million to $7.7 billion largely driven by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity, partially offset by the  contribution  to  the  Bank  of America Foundation in the prior year.\n\nAverage  loans  increased $8.6  billion to  $288.2  billion primarily driven  by an  increase  in  credit card  loans  and  first mortgage loans, partially offset by a decline in PPP loans.\n\nThe  table  below  provides  key performance  indicators  for Consumer Lending. Management uses  these  metrics, and  we believe  they are  useful  to  investors  because  they provide additional information about loan growth and profitability.\n\n## Key Statistics - Consumer Lending\n\n| (Dollars in millions)       | 2022     | 2021      |\n|-----------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Total credit card  (1)      |          |           |\n| Gross interest yield  (2)   | 10.42 %  | 10.17 %   |\n| Risk-adjusted margin  (3)   | 10.06    | 10.17     |\n| New accounts (in thousands) | 4,397    | 3,594     |\n| Purchase volumes            | $356,588 | $ 311,571 |\n| Debit card purchase volumes | $503,583 | $ 473,770 |\n\nDuring  2022, the  total  risk-adjusted  margin  decreased  11 bps primarily driven by lower net interest margin and lower fee income, partially offset by lower net credit losses. Total  credit card purchase volumes increased $45.0 billion to $356.6 billion and  debit card  purchase  volumes  increased  $29.8  billion  to $503.6 billion, reflecting higher levels of consumer spending.\n\n## Key Statistics - Loan Production (1)\n\n| (Dollars in millions)   | 2022     | 2021      |\n|-------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Consumer Banking:       |          |           |\n| First mortgage          | $ 20,981 | $  45,976 |\n| Home equity             | 7,988    | 3,996     |\n| Total  (2) :            |          |           |\n| First mortgage          | $ 44,765 | $  79,692 |\n| Home equity             | 9,591    | 4,895     |\n\nFirst mortgage  loan  originations  for Consumer Banking and the total Corporation decreased $25.0 billion and $34.9 billion during 2022 primarily driven by changes in demand.\n\nHome equity production in Consumer Banking and the total Corporation increased $4.0 billion and $4.7 billion during 2022 primarily driven by higher demand.",

Merrill Wealth Management provides tailored solutions to meet clients' needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement products.\n\nBank of America  Private  Bank, together with  Merrill  Wealth Management's Private Wealth Management business, provides comprehensive  wealth  management solutions  targeted  to  high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions  to  meet clients' wealth  structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services.\n\nNet income for GWIM increased $348 million to $4.7 billion driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses  and  noninterest expense. The  operating  margin remained unchanged at 28 percent compared to a year ago.\n\nNet interest income  increased  $1.8  billion  to  $7.5  billion due  to  the  impacts  of higher interest rates, as  well  as  the benefits of higher loan and deposit balances.\n\nNoninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage  services  income, decreased  $802  million to  $14.3 billion  primarily due to the impacts of lower market valuations and  declines  in  AUM pricing, partially offset by the  impact of positive AUM flows.\n\nThe  provision  for credit losses  increased  $307  million primarily due to a dampened macroeconomic outlook and loan growth in the current-year period, compared to a benefit in the prior-year period  due  to  an  improved  macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense  increased  $232  million  to  $15.5  billion primarily due to continued investments in the business, partially offset by lower revenue-related incentives.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital was 27 percent, up from 26 percent, due to higher net income, partially offset by an increase  in  allocated  capital. For more  information  on  capital allocated  to  the  business  segments, see  Business  Segment Operations on page 84.\n\nAverage  loans  increased  $22.9  billion  to  $219.8  billion primarily due  to  residential  mortgage, securities-based  lending and  custom lending. Average  deposits  increased  $11.2  billion to  $351.3  billion  primarily driven  by inflows  from new  and existing accounts.\n\nMerrill Wealth  Management revenue  of $18.1  billion increased four percent primarily driven by the benefits of higher interest rates, as  well  as  higher deposit and  loan  balances, partially offset by the  impact of lower market valuations  and declines in AUM pricing.\n\nBank  of America  Private  Bank  revenue  of $3.6  billion increased nine percent primarily driven by the benefits of higher interest rates, as  well  as  higher deposit and  loan  balances, partially offset by the impact of lower market valuations.",

Fees earned on AUM are calculated as a percentage of clients' AUM balances. The asset management fees charged to clients per year depend on various factors but are commonly driven by the breadth of the client's relationship. The net client AUM flows represent the  net change  in  clients' AUM balances  over a\n\nspecified  period  of time, excluding  market appreciation/ depreciation and other adjustments.\n\nClient balances decreased $453.5 billion, or 12 percent, to $3.4 trillion at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. The decrease in client balances was primarily due to the impact of lower market valuations, partially offset by positive client flows.",

Our treasury solutions business  includes  treasury management, foreign  exchange, short-term investing  options  and  merchant services.

Global Commercial Banking clients generally include middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms and  not-for-profit companies. Business  Banking  clients  include mid-sized  U.S.-based  businesses  requiring  customized  and integrated financial advice and solutions.\n\nNet income  for Global  Banking decreased  $2.0  billion  to $7.8  billion driven  by higher provision  for credit losses  and noninterest expense, partially offset by higher revenue.\n\nNet interest income increased $3.7 billion to  $12.2  billion primarily due to  the  benefits  of higher interest rates  and  loan balances.\n\nNoninterest income decreased $2.3 billion to  $10.0  billion driven by lower investment banking  fees  and  valuation adjustments  on  leveraged  loans, as  well  as  lower treasury service charges.\n\nThe  provision  for credit losses  increased  $3.8  billion  to $641  million  primarily driven  by a  dampened  macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, compared to a benefit in the prior year due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.\n\nNoninterest expense  increased  $334  million  to  $11.0 billion, primarily due to continued investments in the business, including strategic hiring and technology.\n\nThe  return  on  average  allocated  capital  was  18  percent, down  from 23  percent, due  to  lower net income  and  higher allocated  capital. For more  information  on  capital  allocated  to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 84.\n\n## Global  Corporate,  Global  Commercial  and  Business Banking\n\nGlobal  Corporate, Global  Commercial  and  Business  Banking each include Business Lending and Global Transaction Services activities.

Global  Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both  the  primary and  secondary markets. Global  Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and  custody services  globally to  our institutional investor clients  in  support of their investing  and  trading activities. We  also  work  with  our commercial  and  corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and  commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income  and  mortgage-related  products. As  a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be  required  to  manage  risk  in  a  broad  range  of financial products  including  government securities, equity and  equitylinked  securities, high-grade  and  high-yield  corporate  debt securities, syndicated  loans, MBS, commodities  and  assetbacked securities. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global  Banking under an  internal  revenue-sharing arrangement. Global  Banking originates  certain  deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets . For information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 90.\n\nThe  following  explanations  for year-over-year changes  for\n\nGlobal  Markets , including  those  disclosed  under Sales  and Trading  Revenue, are  the  same  for amounts  including  and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial  measure. For more  information  on  net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 79.\n\nNet income  for Global  Markets decreased  $375  million  to $4.2  billion. Net DVA  gains  were  $20  million compared  to losses of $54 million in  2021. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $431 million to $4.2 billion. These decreases were primarily driven  by lower revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.\n\nRevenue  decreased  $1.1  billion  to  $18.1  billion  primarily due to lower investment banking fees, partially offset by higher sales and trading revenue. Sales and trading revenue increased $1.3 billion, and excluding net DVA, sales and trading revenue increased  $1.2  billion. These  increases  were  driven  by higher revenue in both FICC and Equities.\n\nNoninterest expense  decreased  $612  million  to  $12.4 billion  primarily driven  by the  realignment of a  liquidating business activity from Global Markets to All  Other in  the  fourth quarter of 2021 and an acceleration of expenses from incentive compensation award changes in the prior year.\n\nAverage  total  assets  increased  $71.6  billion  to  $857.6 billion  driven  by loan  growth  and  commodities  activity in  FICC. Period-end total assets increased $64.7 billion to $812.5 billion",

Sales  and  trading  revenue  is  segregated  into  fixedincome  (government debt obligations, investment and  noninvestment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed  securities, collateralized loan obligations, interest rate  and  credit derivative  contracts), currencies  (interest rate  and  foreign  exchange  contracts), commodities  (primarily futures, forwards, swaps  and  options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity).

Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments  to  eliminate  the  FTE  treatment of certain  tax credits  recorded  in Global  Banking and Global Markets .\n\n## Managing Risk\n\nRisk  is  inherent in  all  our business  activities. Sound  risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed  well, risk  can  result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to  execute  our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach  to  risk  management with  a  defined  Risk  Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the ERC and the Board.\n\nThe  seven  key types  of risk  faced  by the  Corporation  are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational  and reputational.\n\n- \u25cf Strategic risk  is  the  risk  to  current or projected  financial condition arising from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely manner to  changes  in  the  regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive  environments  in  the  geographic locations  in which we operate.\n- \u25cf Credit risk  is  the  risk  of loss  arising  from the  inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations.\n- \u25cf Market risk  is  the  risk  that changes  in  market conditions adversely impact the  value  of assets  or liabilities or otherwise  negatively impact earnings. Market risk is composed of price risk and interest rate risk.\n- \u25cf Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash  flow  and  collateral  needs  while  continuing  to  support our businesses and customers under a  range  of economic conditions.\n- \u25cf Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material  financial  loss  or damage  to  the  reputation  of the Corporation  arising  from the  failure  of the  Corporation  to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures.\n- \u25cf Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed  internal  processes  or systems, people or external events.\n- \u25cf Reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the Corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations.\n\nThe  following  sections  address  in  more  detail  the  specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk. This  discussion  of managing  risk  focuses  on  the  current Risk Framework that, as part of its annual review process, was approved by the ERC and the Board.\n\nAs  set forth  in  our Risk  Framework, a  culture  of managing risk well is fundamental to our values and our purpose, and how we drive Responsible Growth. It requires us to focus on risk in all activities  and  encourages  the  necessary mindset and behavior to  enable  effective  risk  management and  promote sound risk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to the success  of the  Corporation  and  is  a  clear expectation  of our executive management team and the Board.\n\nOur Risk  Framework  serves  as  the  foundation  for the consistent and  effective  management of risks  facing  the Corporation. The  Risk  Framework  sets  forth  roles  and responsibilities  for the  management of risk  and  provides  a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees  and  executive  officers, establishes  risk  appetite and associated limits for our activities.\n\nExecutive management assesses, with Board oversight, the risk-adjusted  returns  of each  business. Management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well as  the  capital  plan  and  Risk  Appetite  Statement, and recommends  them annually to  the  Board  for approval. Our strategic plan  takes  into  consideration  return  objectives  and financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite. Management sets  financial  objectives  for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital  for each  business. Capital  allocations  and  operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which  we  operate  continue  to  evolve. For more  information regarding capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 84.\n\nThe  Corporation's  risk  appetite  indicates  the  amount of capital, earnings  or liquidity we  are  willing  to  put at risk  to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent with  applicable  regulatory requirements. Our risk  appetite provides a common framework that includes a set of measures to  assist senior management and  the  Board  in  assessing  the Corporation's  risk  profile  against our risk  appetite  and  risk capacity. Our risk  appetite  is  formally articulated  in  the  Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative statements and quantitative limits.\n\nOur overall  capacity to  take  risk  is  limited; therefore, we prioritize  the  risks  we  take  in  order to  maintain  a  strong  and flexible  financial  position  so  we  can  withstand  challenging economic conditions  and  take  advantage  of organic growth opportunities. Therefore, we  set objectives  and  targets  for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate  in  a  safe  and  sound  manner at all  times, including during periods of stress.\n\nOur lines of business operate with risk limits that align with the Corporation's risk appetite. Senior management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to risk appetite limits. The  Board, and  its  committees  when  appropriate, oversee financial  performance, execution  of the  strategic and  financial operating  plans, adherence  to  risk  appetite  limits  and  the adequacy of internal controls.\n\nFor a  more  detailed  discussion  of our risk  management activities, see the discussion below and pages 96 through 129.\n\n## Risk Management Governance\n\nThe Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby the  Board  and  its  committees  may delegate  authority to management-level  committees  or executive  officers. Such delegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval functions, which  may be  evidenced  in  documents  such  as committee  charters, job  descriptions, meeting  minutes  and resolutions.\n\nThe  chart below  illustrates  the  interrelationship  among  the Board, Board  committees  and  management committees  that have  the  majority of risk  oversight responsibilities  for the Corporation.",

The  Board  authorizes  management to  maintain an effective Risk Framework and oversees compliance with safe and  sound  banking  practices. In  addition, the  Board  or its committees  conduct inquiries  of, and  receive  reports  from senior management on, risk-related matters to assess scope or resource limitations that could impede the ability of Global Risk Management (GRM) and/or Corporate  Audit to  execute  its responsibilities. The  Board  committees  discussed  below  have the  principal  responsibility for enterprise-wide  oversight of our risk management activities. Through these activities, the Board and applicable committees are provided with information on our risk  profile  and  oversee  senior management addressing  key risks  we  face. Other Board  committees, as  described  below, provide additional oversight of specific risks.\n\nEach of the committees shown on the above chart regularly reports  to  the  Board  on  risk-related  matters  within  the committee's  responsibilities, which  is  intended  to  collectively provide the Board with integrated insight about our management of enterprise-wide risks.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe  Audit Committee oversees the qualifications, performance and  independence  of the  Independent Registered  Public Accounting  Firm, the  performance  of our corporate  audit function, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our compliance  with  legal  and  regulatory requirements, and makes  inquiries  of senior management or the  Chief Audit Executive  (CAE) to  determine  whether there  are  scope  or resource limitations that impede the ability of Corporate Audit to execute  its  responsibilities. The  Audit Committee  is  also responsible  for overseeing  compliance  risks  pursuant to  the New York Stock Exchange listing standards.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Committee\n\nThe  ERC  oversees  the  Corporation's  Risk  Framework, risk appetite  and  senior management's  responsibilities  for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks facing  the  Corporation. The ERC may consult with  other Board committees on risk-related matters.\n\n## Other Board Committees\n\nOur Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee oversees  our Board's  governance  processes, identifies  and reviews  the  qualifications  of potential  Board  members, leads\n\nBoard and committee succession planning and their formal selfevaluation, and  reviews  our ESG  activities, shareholder input and shareholder engagement process.\n\nOur Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees establishing, maintaining  and  administering  our compensation programs and employee benefit plans, including approving and recommending our Chief Executive Officer's (CEO) compensation to  our Board  for further approval  by all  independent directors; reviewing  and  approving  our executive  officers' compensation, as  well  as  compensation  for non-management directors; and reviewing  certain  other human  capital  management topics, including pay equity and diversity and inclusion.\n\n## Management Committees\n\nManagement committees receive their authority from the Board, a  Board  committee, or another management committee. Our primary management risk  committee  is  the  MRC. Subject to Board  oversight, the  MRC  is  responsible  for management oversight of key risks  facing  the  Corporation, including  an integrated evaluation of risk, earnings, capital and liquidity.\n\n## Lines of Defense\n\nWe have clear ownership  and  accountability for managing risk across three lines of defense: Front Line Units (FLUs), GRM and Corporate Audit. We also have control functions outside of FLUs and GRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human Resources). The three lines  of defense  are  integrated  into  our management-level governance structure. Each of these functional  roles  is  further described in this section.\n\n## Executive Officers\n\nExecutive  officers  lead  various  functions  representing  the functional roles. Authority for functional roles may be delegated to  executive  officers  from the  Board, Board  committees  or management-level committees. Executive  officers, in  turn, may further delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to management-level committees, management routines or individuals. Executive officers review our activities for consistency with  our Risk  Framework, risk  appetite, and applicable  strategic, capital  and  financial  operating  plans, as well as applicable policies and standards. Executive officers and other employees  make  decisions  individually on  a  day-to-day basis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated.

        "page_content": "## Front Line Units\n\nFLUs, which  include  the  lines  of business  as  well  as  Global Technology and Global Operations, are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their activities.\n\nThree  organizational  units  that include  FLU  activities  and control function activities, but are not part of GRM are first, the Chief Financial  Officer Group; second, the  Chief Administrative Officer Group; and  third, Global  Strategy and  Enterprise Platforms.\n\n## Global Risk Management\n\nGRM is  part of our control  functions  and  operates  as  our independent risk  management function. GRM, led by the Chief Risk  Officer (CRO), is  responsible  for independently assessing and  overseeing  risks  within  FLUs  and  other control  functions. GRM establishes  written  enterprise  policies  and  procedures outlining how  aggregate  risks  are  identified, measured, monitored and controlled.\n\nThe CRO has the stature, authority and independence needed to  develop  and  implement a  meaningful  risk  management framework and practices to guide the Corporation in managing risk. The CRO has unrestricted access to the Board and reports directly to  both  the  ERC  and  the  CEO. GRM is  organized  into horizontal risk teams that cover a specific risk area and vertical CRO teams that cover a particular FLU or control function. These teams work collaboratively in executing their respective duties.\n\n## Corporate Audit\n\nCorporate Audit and the CAE maintain their independence from the FLUs, GRM and other control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee. The CAE administratively reports to the CEO. Corporate  Audit provides  independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit includes Credit Review, which provides an independent assessment of credit lending decisions and the effectiveness of credit processes across the Corporation's credit platform through examinations and monitoring.\n\n## Risk Management Processes\n\nThe  Risk  Framework  requires  that strong  risk  management practices  are  integrated  in  key strategic, capital  and  financial planning  processes  and  in  day-to-day business  processes across the Corporation, thereby ensuring risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. We employ an  effective  risk  management process, referred  to  as Identify, Measure, Monitor and  Control, as  part of our daily activities.\n\nIdentify - To be effectively managed, risks must be proactively identified  and  well  understood. Proper risk  identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in  our business  activities  or key risks  that may arise  from external  factors. Each  employee  is  expected  to  identify and escalate  risks  promptly. Risk  identification  is  an  ongoing process  that incorporates  input from FLUs  and  control functions. It is designed to be forward-looking and to capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business.\n\nMeasure -  Once  a  risk  is  identified, it must be prioritized  and accurately measured through a systematic process including qualitative statements  and  quantitative  limits. Risk  is measured at various levels, including, but not limited to, risk type, FLU and legal  entity, and also  on  an  aggregate  basis. This risk measurement process helps to capture changes in our risk  profile  due  to  changes  in  strategic direction,\n\nconcentrations, portfolio  quality and  the  overall  economic environment. Senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios.\n\nMonitor - We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk  appetite, policies  and  standards. We  also  regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures. Through our monitoring, we know our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner. We also know when risk limits  are  breached  and  have  processes  to  appropriately report and escalate exceptions. This includes timely requests for approval to managers and alerts to executive management, management-level  committees  or the  Board (directly or through an appropriate committee).\n\nControl - We establish and communicate risk limits and controls through  policies, standards, procedures  and  processes. The limits and controls can be adjusted by senior management or the Board when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. These limits  may be  absolute  (e.g., loan  amount, trading  volume, operational loss) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk  categories). Our FLUs  are  held  accountable  for performing within the established limits.\n\nThe formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. We instill a strong and comprehensive culture of managing risk well through communications, training, policies, procedures and organizational  roles  and  responsibilities. Establishing  a  culture reflective of our purpose to help make our customers' financial lives better and delivering on Responsible Growth is also critical to effective risk management. We are committed to the highest principles  of ethical  and  professional  conduct. Conduct risk  is the  risk  of improper actions, behaviors  or practices  by the Corporation, its  employees  or representatives  that are  illegal, unethical and/or contrary to our core values that could result in harm to  the  Corporation, our shareholders  or our customers, damage  the  integrity of the  financial  markets, or negatively impact our reputation. We  have  established  protocols  and structures so that conduct risk is governed and reported across the Corporation appropriately. All employees are held accountable  for adhering  to  the  Code  of Conduct, operating within our risk appetite and managing risk in their daily business activities. In addition, our performance  management and compensation  practices  encourage  responsible  risk-taking  that is consistent with our Risk Framework and risk appetite.\n\n## Corporation-wide Stress Testing\n\nIntegral to our Capital Planning, Financial Planning and Strategic Planning  processes, we conduct capital  scenario  management and stress forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance  sheet, earnings  and  capital  sensitivities  to  certain economic and  business  scenarios, including  economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These stress  forecasts  provide  an  understanding  of the  potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key component of our capital  and  risk management practices. The  intent of stress  testing  is  to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on- and  off-balance  sheet risks  at the  Corporation  and  certain subsidiaries  and  how  they impact financial  resiliency, which provides  confidence  to  management, regulators  and  our investors.\n\n## Contingency Planning\n\nWe  have  developed  and  maintain  contingency plans  that are designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of",

        "page_content": "potential  adverse  economic, financial  or market stress. These contingency plans  include  our Capital  Contingency Plan  and Financial Contingency and  Recovery Plan, which  provide monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable us to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk through  consideration  of potential  options  that include  asset sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, and other derisking  strategies. We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit adverse  systemic impacts  that could  be  associated  with  a potential resolution of Bank of America.\n\n## Strategic Risk Management\n\nStrategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk  categories  along  with  credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. This risk results from incorrect assumptions  about external  or internal  factors, inappropriate  business  plans, ineffective  business  strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the  regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive  environments  in the  geographic locations  in  which  we  operate, such  as competitor actions, changing  customer preferences, product obsolescence and technology developments.\n\nAn aspect of strategic risk is the risk that the Corporation's capital  levels  are  not adequate  to  meet minimum regulatory requirements  and  support execution  of business  activities  or absorb  losses  from risks  during  normal  or adverse  economic and  market conditions. As  such, capital  risk  is  managed  in parallel to strategic risk.\n\nWe  manage  strategic risk through  the  Strategic Risk Enterprise  Policy and  integration  into  the  strategic planning process, among other activities. Our strategic plan is consistent with  our risk  appetite, capital  plan  and  liquidity requirements, and  specifically addresses  strategic risks  impacting  each business.\n\nOn  an  annual  basis, the  Board  reviews  and  approves  the strategic plan, capital  plan, financial  operating  plan  and  Risk Appetite  Statement. With  oversight by the  Board, senior management directs  the  lines  of business  to  execute  our strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite. The  executive  management team monitors business  performance  throughout the  year and  provides  the Board  with  regular progress  reports  on  whether strategic objectives  and  timelines  are  being  met, including  reports  on strategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be considered or implemented. The regular executive reviews focus on  assessing  forecasted  earnings  and  returns  on  capital, the current risk  profile, current capital  and  liquidity requirements, staffing  levels  and  changes  required  to  support the  strategic plan, stress  testing  results, and other qualitative  factors  such as market growth rates and peer analysis.\n\nSignificant strategic actions, such  as  capital  actions, material  acquisitions  or divestitures, and  resolution  plans  are reviewed  and  approved  by the  Board. At the  business  level, processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services and other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and approval  where  required. With  oversight by the  Board  and  the ERC, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the  year, and  evaluates  changes  to  the  financial forecast or the  risk, capital  or liquidity positions  as  deemed appropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns  and  maintaining  the  targeted financial strength. Proprietary models are used to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. The allocated capital assigned to each business\n\nis based on its unique risk profile. With oversight by the Board, executive  management assesses  the  risk-adjusted  returns  of each  business  in  approving  strategic and  financial  operating plans. The businesses use allocated capital to define business strategies, and price products and transactions.\n\n## Capital Management\n\nThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is  more  than  adequate  to  support its  business  activities  and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain  ready access  to  financial  markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength  for our subsidiaries, and  satisfy current and  future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a  key consideration  in  the  development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits.\n\nWe  conduct an  Internal  Capital  Adequacy Assessment Process  (ICAAP) on  a  periodic basis. The  ICAAP  is  a  forwardlooking  assessment of our projected  capital  needs  and resources, incorporating  earnings, balance  sheet and  risk forecasts  under baseline  and  adverse  economic and  market conditions. We  utilize  periodic stress  tests  to  assess  the potential  impacts  to  our balance  sheet, earnings, regulatory capital  and  liquidity under a  variety of stress  scenarios. We perform qualitative  risk  assessments  to  identify and  assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital  requirements. Management assesses  ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital  guidelines  and  capital  position  to  the Board or its committees.\n\nWe  periodically review  capital  allocated  to  our businesses and  allocate  capital  annually during  the  strategic and  capital planning  processes. For more  information, see  Business Segment Operations on page 84.\n\n## CCAR and Capital Planning\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital  plan. Based  on  the  results  of our 2022  CCAR stress  test, our stress  capital  buffer (SCB) increased  to  3.4 percent from 2.5  percent, effective  October 1, 2022  through September 30, 2023.\n\nIn  October 2021, the  Board  authorized  the  Corporation's $25 billion common stock repurchase program. Additionally, the Board  authorized  common  stock  repurchases  to  offset shares awarded  under the  Corporation's  equity-based  compensation plans. Pursuant to the Board's authorizations, during 2022, we repurchased $5.1 billion of common stock, including repurchases  to  offset shares  awarded  under equity-based compensation plans.\n\nThe  timing  and  amount of common stock  repurchases  are subject to  various  factors, including  the  Corporation's  capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and  may be  suspended  at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated  transactions, including  repurchase  plans that satisfy the  conditions  of Rule  10b5-1  of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).",

        "page_content": "## Regulatory Capital\n\nAs  a  financial  services  holding  company, we  are  subject to regulatory capital  rules, including  Basel  3, issued  by U.S. banking regulators. Basel 3 established minimum capital ratios and  buffer requirements and  outlined two methods  of calculating risk-weighted assets  (RWA), the Standardized approach  and  the  Advanced  approaches. The  Standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk  weights based on exposure  type, and  the  Advanced  approaches  determine  risk weights based on internal models.\n\nThe Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to  the  Prompt Corrective  Action  (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced  approaches  institutions  under Basel  3  and  are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and RWA under both  the  Standardized  and  Advanced  approaches. The lower of the  capital  ratios  under Standardized  or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements  are  used  to  assess  capital  adequacy, including under the  PCA  framework. As  of December 31, 2022, the common  equity tier 1  (CET1), Tier 1  capital  and  Total  capital ratios under the Standardized approach were the binding ratios.\n\n## Minimum Capital Requirements\n\nIn  order to  avoid  restrictions  on  capital  distributions  and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet riskbased  capital  ratio  requirements  that include a capital conservation  buffer of 2.5  percent (under the  Advanced approaches  only), an  SCB  (under the  Standardized  approach only), plus  any applicable  countercyclical  capital  buffer and  a global  systemically important bank  (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers  and  surcharge  must be  comprised  solely of CET1 capital. For the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, the  Corporation's  minimum CET1  capital  ratio requirement was 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress  test, the  Corporation's  SCB  increased  to  3.4  percent, resulting in a minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement of 10.4 percent under the  Standardized  approach  for the  period  from October 1, 2022 through  September 30, 2023. Our minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement under the Advanced approaches\n\nremains unchanged at 9.5 percent.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on  an  annual  basis  under two  methods  and  is  subject to  the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with  the  approach  prescribed  by the  Basel  Committee's assessment methodology and  is  calculated  using  specified indicators  of systemic importance. Method  2  modifies  the Method  1  approach  by, among  other factors, including  a measure of the Corporation's reliance on short-term wholesale funding. The  Corporation's  G-SIB  surcharge, which  is  higher under Method 2, is  expected  to  increase  to  3.0  percent from 2.5  percent on  January 1, 2024, which  will  increase  our minimum CET1  capital  ratio  requirement. At December 31, 2022, the  Corporation's  CET1  capital  ratio  of 11.2  percent under the  Standardized  approach  exceeded  its  current CET1 capital  ratio  requirement as  well  as  the  minimum requirement expected  to  be  in  place  as  of January 1, 2024  due  to  an anticipated increase in our G-SIB surcharge.\n\nThe  Corporation  is  also  required  to  maintain  a  minimum supplementary leverage  ratio  (SLR) of 3.0  percent plus  a leverage  buffer of 2.0  percent in  order to  avoid  certain restrictions  on  capital  distributions  and  discretionary bonus payments. Our insured  depository institution  subsidiaries  are required  to  maintain  a  minimum 6.0  percent SLR  to  be considered  well  capitalized  under the  PCA  framework. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is  total  leverage  exposure  based  on  the  daily average  of the  sum of on-balance  sheet exposures  less permitted deductions, and applicable temporary exclusions, as well  as  the  simple  average  of certain  off-balance  sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter.\n\n## Capital Composition and Ratios\n\nTable 10 presents Bank of America Corporation's capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized  and  Advanced  approaches  as  measured  at December 31, 2022  and  2021. For the  periods  presented herein, the  Corporation  met the  definition  of well  capitalized under current regulatory requirements.",

RWA  under the  Standardized approach, which  yielded  the  lower CET1  capital  ratio  at December 31, 2022, decreased  $13.0  billion  during  2022  to $1,605 billion primarily due to lower counterparty exposures in Global Markets and a decrease in debt securities in the Treasury portfolio, partially offset by loan growth.

(BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and  Merrill  Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &  Smith Incorporated  (MLPF&S). The  Corporation's  principal  European broker-dealer subsidiaries  are  Merrill  Lynch  International  (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE).\n\nThe  U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries  are  subject to  the  net capital  requirements  of Rule  15c3-1  under the  Exchange  Act. BofAS  computes  its  minimum capital  requirements  as  an alternative  net capital  broker-dealer under Rule  15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to  Commodity Futures Trading  Commission  (CFTC) Regulation  1.17. The  U.S. brokerdealer subsidiaries  are  also  registered  with  the  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to  FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its  reserve  requirement in  addition  to  a  certain  percentage  of securities-based  swap risk  margin. BofAS must also  notify the SEC  in  the  event its  tentative  net capital  is  less  than  $6.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At December 31, 2022, BofAS had tentative net capital of $20.9 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital  of $17.5  billion, which  exceeded  the minimum requirement of $4.1 billion.\n\nMLPCC  is  a  fully-guaranteed  subsidiary of BofAS  and provides  clearing  and  settlement services  as  well  as  prime brokerage  and  arranged  financing  services  for institutional clients. At December 31, 2022, MLPCC's regulatory net capital of $7.5  billion  exceeded  the  minimum requirement of $1.4 billion.\n\nMLPF&S  provides  retail  services. At December 31, 2022, MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $6.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $137 million.\n\nOur European  broker-dealers  are  subject to  requirements from U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is  regulated  by the  Prudential  Regulation  Authority and  the\n\nFinancial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital  requirements. At December 31, 2022, MLI's  capital resources  were  $33.4  billion, which  exceeded  the  minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $11.6 billion.\n\nBofASE is an authorized credit institution with its head office located in France. Previously, BofASE had been authorized as an investment firm, but following the European Union's adoption of the harmonized Investment Firm Directive and Investment Firm Regulation  prudential  regime, it was  required  to  apply for reauthorization  as  a  credit institution. The  application  was approved  in  November 2022  and  became  effective  on December 8, 2022. BofASE is authorized and regulated by the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel et de R\u00e9solution and the Autorit\u00e9 des  March\u00e9s  Financiers, and  supervised  under the  Single Supervisory Mechanism by the  European  Central  Bank. At December 31, 2022, BofASE's  capital  resources  were  $9.0 billion, which  exceeded  the  minimum Pillar 1  requirement of $3.0 billion.\n\nIn addition, MLI and BofASE became conditionally registered with  the  SEC  as  security-based  swap  dealers  in  the  fourth quarter of 2021, and  maintained  net liquid assets  at December 31, 2022 that exceeded  the  applicable  minimum requirements under the Exchange Act.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\n## Funding and Liquidity Risk Management\n\nOur primary liquidity risk  management objective  is  to  meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while  continuing  to  support our businesses  and customers  under a  range  of economic conditions. To  achieve that objective, we  analyze  and  monitor our liquidity risk  under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to  diverse  funding  sources, including  our stable  deposit base, and  seek  to  align  liquidity-related  incentives  and  risks. These liquidity risk management practices  have  allowed  us  to effectively manage  the  market fluctuation  from the  rising interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic environment.\n\nWe  define  liquidity as  readily available  assets, limited  to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can  use  to  meet our contractual  and  contingent financial obligations  as  they arise. We  manage  our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current",

        "page_content": "(including  intraday) basis  under both  expected  and  stressed conditions. We  believe  that a  centralized  approach  to  funding and  liquidity management enhances  our ability to  monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes  access  to  funding  sources, minimizes  borrowing  costs  and  facilitates  timely responses  to liquidity events.\n\nThe Board approves our liquidity risk policy and the Financial Contingency and  Recovery Plan. The  ERC  establishes  our liquidity risk  tolerance  levels. The  MRC  is  responsible  for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures  within  the  established  tolerance  levels. The  MRC reviews  and  monitors  our liquidity position  and  stress  testing results, approves  certain  liquidity risk  limits  and  reviews  the impact of strategic decisions  on  our liquidity. For more information, see  Managing  Risk  on  page  93. Under this governance  framework, we  developed  certain  funding  and liquidity risk  management practices  which  include: maintaining liquidity at Bank of America  Corporation  (Parent) and  selected subsidiaries, including our bank  subsidiaries and  other regulated  entities; determining  what amounts  of liquidity are appropriate  for these  entities  based  on  analysis  of debt maturities  and  other potential  cash  outflows, including  those that we  may experience  during  stressed  market conditions; diversifying  funding  sources, considering  our asset profile  and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning.\n\n## NB Holdings Corporation\n\nThe Parent, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation  (NB  Holdings). We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional Parent assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred  any assets. These  arrangements  support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the  Parent would  be  resolved  under the  U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nIn  consideration  for the  transfer of assets, NB  Holdings issued a subordinated note to the Parent in a principal amount equal  to  the  value  of the  transferred  assets. The  aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future  asset transfers. NB  Holdings  also  provided  the  Parent with  a  committed  line  of credit that allows  the  Parent to  draw funds  necessary to  service  near-term cash  needs. These arrangements  support our preferred  single  point of entry resolution  strategy, under which  only the  Parent would  be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include  provisions  to  terminate  the  line  of credit, forgive  the subordinated  note  and  require  the  Parent to  transfer its remaining  financial  assets  to  NB  Holdings  if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the Parent becomes imminent.\n\n## Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets\n\nWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the Parent and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and highquality, liquid, unencumbered  securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred  to  as  Global  Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of\n\nassets  that are  readily available  to  the  Parent and  selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central  banks  outside  of the  U.S. We  limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and other investment-grade securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can obtain cash for these securities, even  in  stressed  conditions, through  repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow  us  to  meet the  liquidity requirements  of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.\n\nTable 15 presents average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Table 15 Average Global Liquidity Sources\n\nTable  16 presents the composition of average GLS for the three  months  ended  December 31, 2022 and  December 31, 2021.\n\n|                                        | Three Months Ended  December 31   | Three Months Ended  December 31   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in billions)                  | 2022                              | 2021                              |\n| Bank entities                          | $ 694                             | $  1,006                          |\n| Nonbank and other entities  (1)        | 174                               | 152                               |\n| Total Average Global Liquidity Sources | $ 868                             | $  1,158                          |\n\nOur bank subsidiaries' liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank  subsidiaries  can  also  generate  incremental liquidity by pledging  a  range  of unencumbered  loans  and securities  to  certain  FHLBs  and  the  Federal  Reserve  Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this  pool  of specifically-identified  eligible  assets  was  $348 billion and $322 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these  assets, including  regularly monitoring  our total pool  of eligible  loans  and  securities  collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to  change  at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated  by the  bank  subsidiaries  can generally be  used  only to  fund  obligations  within  the  bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the Parent or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.\n\nLiquidity is  also  held  in  nonbank  entities, including  the Parent, NB  Holdings  and  other regulated  entities. The  Parent and  NB  Holdings  liquidity is  typically in  the  form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is  primarily available  to  meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the Parent or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated  entities  also  hold  unencumbered  investment-grade securities  and  equities  that we  believe  could  be  used  to generate additional liquidity.",

However, HQLA  for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion  of excess  liquidity held  at certain  subsidiaries. The LCR  is  calculated  as  the  amount of a  financial  institution's unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the  institution  could  encounter over a  30-day period  of significant liquidity stress, expressed  as  a  percentage. Our average  consolidated  HQLA, on  a  net basis, was  $605  billion and  $617  billion for the  three  months  ended  December 31, 2022  and  2021. For the same  periods, the average consolidated LCR was 120 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.\n\n## Liquidity Stress Analysis\n\nWe utilize  liquidity stress  analysis  to  assist us  in  determining the  appropriate  amounts  of liquidity to  maintain  at the  Parent and  our subsidiaries  to  meet contractual  and  contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. The scenarios we consider and  utilize  incorporate  market-wide  and  Corporation-specific events, including  potential  credit rating  downgrades  for the Parent and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our historical  experience, experience  of distressed  and  failed financial  institutions, regulatory guidance, and  both  expected and unexpected future events.\n\nThe  types  of potential  contractual  and  contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited  to, upcoming  contractual  maturities  of unsecured  debt and  reductions  in  new  debt issuances; diminished  access  to secured  financing  markets; potential  deposit withdrawals; increased  draws  on  loan  commitments, liquidity facilities  and letters  of credit; additional  collateral  that counterparties  could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited  to, credit rating  downgrades, could  negatively impact potential  contractual  and  contingent outflows  and  the  related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results.\n\nWe  consider all  sources  of funds  that we  could  access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available  sources  with  corresponding  liquidity requirements  by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is  a  liquidity requirement for large  banks to maintain a minimum level  of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support\n\nthe  ability of banks  to  lend  to  households  and  businesses  in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The  U.S. NSFR  applies  to  the  Corporation  on  a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with this requirement.\n\n## Diversified Funding Sources\n\nWe  fund  our assets  primarily with  a  mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated  funding  approach  diversified  across  products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.\n\nThe  primary benefits  of our centralized  funding  approach include  greater control, reduced  funding  costs, wider name recognition  by investors  and  greater flexibility to  meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations  make  Parent funding  impractical, certain  other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.\n\nWe  fund  a  substantial  portion  of our lending  activities through our deposits, which were $1.93 trillion and $2.1 trillion at December 31, 2022  and  2021. Deposits  are  primarily generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These  deposits  are  diversified  by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured  by the  FDIC. We consider a  substantial  portion  of our deposits  to  be  a  stable, low-cost and  consistent source  of funding. We  believe  this  deposit funding  is  generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities  may also  be  financed  through  secured  borrowings, including  credit card  securitizations  and  securitizations  with government-sponsored  enterprises  (GSE), the  Federal  Housing Administration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans.\n\nOur trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded  on  a  secured  basis  through  securities  lending  and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and  market conditions. We  believe  funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more costefficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured  financing. Repurchase  agreements  are  generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a  diverse  group  of counterparties, providing  a range  of securities  collateral  and  pursuing  longer durations, when  appropriate. For more  information  on  secured  financing agreements, see Note  10  -  Securities  Financing  Agreements, Short-term  Borrowings,  Collateral  and  Restricted  Cash to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTotal long-term debt decreased $4.1 billion to $276.0 billion during 2022 primarily due to debt maturities, redemptions and valuation  adjustments, partially offset by debt issuances. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various  transactions, depending  on  market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make  markets  in  our debt instruments  to  provide  liquidity for investors.\n\nDuring  2022, we  issued  $66.0  billion  of long-term debt consisting of $44.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all  of which  were  TLAC  compliant,",

During  2021, we  issued  $76.7 billion  of long-term debt consisting  of $56.2  billion  of notes issued  by Bank  of America  Corporation, substantially all  of which were TLAC compliant, $8 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $12.5 billion of other debt.\n\nDuring  2022, we  had  total  long-term debt maturities  and redemptions  in  the  aggregate  of $33.3  billion  consisting  of $19.8 billion  for Bank of America Corporation, $9.9 billion  for Bank  of America, N.A. and  $3.6  billion  of other debt. During 2021, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $46.4 billion consisting of $24.4 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $10.4 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $11.6 billion of other debt.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, Bank  of America  Corporation's senior notes  of $205.9  billion included  $179.1  billion of outstanding  notes  that are  both  TLAC  eligible  and  callable  at least one  year before  their stated  maturities. Of these  senior notes, $16.6 billion will be callable and become TLAC ineligible during 2023, and $21.4 billion, $21.3 billion, $16.0 billion and $24.4  billion  will  do  so  during  each  of 2024  through  2027, respectively, and $79.4 billion thereafter.\n\nWe issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured  funding  may be  negatively impacted  by general market conditions  or by matters  specific to  the  financial services  industry or the  Corporation, we  seek  to  mitigate refinancing  risk  by actively managing  the  amount of our borrowings  that we  anticipate  will  mature  within  any month or quarter. We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes  for client purposes, certain  of which  qualify as  TLACeligible debt. During 2022, we issued $12.5 billion of structured notes, which  are  debt obligations that pay investors  returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on  these  liabilities  with  derivatives  and/or investments  in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the  cost is  similar to  our other unsecured long-term debt. We could  be  required  to  settle  certain  structured  note  obligations for cash  or other securities  prior to  maturity under certain circumstances, which we  consider for liquidity planning purposes. We  believe, however, that a  portion  of such borrowings  will  remain  outstanding  beyond  the  earliest put or redemption date.\n\nSubstantially all of our senior and  subordinated  debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in  changes  to  terms, accelerate  maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in  our credit ratings, financial  ratios, earnings, cash  flows  or stock  price. For more  information  on  long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 - Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe  use  derivative  transactions  to  manage  the  duration, interest rate  and  currency risks  of our borrowings, considering the  characteristics  of the  assets  they are  funding. For more information  on  our ALM activities, see  Interest Rate  Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 126.\n\n## Uninsured Deposits\n\nThe  FDIC  insures  the  Corporation's  U.S. deposits  up  to $250,000  per depositor, per insured  bank  for each  account ownership  category, and  various  country-specific funds  insure non-U.S. deposits up to specified limits. Deposits that exceed\n\ninsurance  limits  are  uninsured. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation's  deposits  totaled  $1.9  trillion, of which  total estimated  uninsured  U.S. and  non-U.S. deposits  were  $617.6 billion and  $102.8  billion. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation's  deposits  totaled  $2.1  trillion, of which  total estimated  uninsured  U.S. and  non-U.S. deposits  were  $701.4 billion and $111.9 billion.\n\nTable 17 presents information about the Corporation's total estimated uninsured time deposits.

These  policies  and  plans  are  based  on  stress  scenarios  and include  potential  funding  strategies  and  communication  and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness.\n\nOur U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries  have  access  to  central  bank  facilities  in  the jurisdictions  in  which  they operate. While  we  do  not rely on these  sources  in  our liquidity modeling, we  maintain  the policies, procedures  and  governance  processes  that would enable us to access these sources if necessary.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to  customers  or counterparties  when  we  compete  in  certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including  over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Thus, it is  our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the major rating agencies.\n\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including  long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including  our own  financial  strength, performance, prospects and  operations  as  well  as  factors  not under our control. The rating  agencies  could  make  adjustments  to  our ratings  at any",

Fitch  also  affirmed  and  withdrew  the  long-term and  short-term ratings on certain subsidiaries, as they are no longer considered relevant to the agency's coverage.\n\nOn January 23, 2023, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) placed  the  long-term rating  of the  Corporation  as  well  as  the long-term rating  of its  rated  subsidiaries, including  BANA, on review  for upgrade. The  agency cited the  Corporation's strengthened  capital  ratios, improved  earnings  profile  and continued commitment to maintaining a restrained risk appetite as  drivers  of the  review. A  review  for upgrade  indicates  that those ratings are under consideration for a change in the near term and  typically concludes  within 90  days. Moody's concurrently affirmed  all  Prime-1  short-term ratings  of the Corporation and rated subsidiaries.\n\nThe current ratings and outlooks for the Corporation and its subsidiaries from Standard & Poor's Global Ratings (S&P) were not the  subject of any rating  actions  during  2022  or through February 22, 2023.\n\nTable 18 presents the Corporation's current long-term/shortterm senior debt ratings  and  outlooks  expressed by the rating agencies.\n\nTable 18 Senior Debt Ratings\n\n|                                                     | Moody's Investors Service   | Moody's Investors Service   | Moody's Investors Service      | Standard & Poor's Global Ratings   | Standard & Poor's Global Ratings   | Standard & Poor's Global Ratings   | Fitch Ratings   | Fitch Ratings   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                                     | Long-term                   | Short-term                  | Outlook                        | Long-term                          | Short-term                         | Outlook                            | Long-term       | Short-term      | Outlook         |\n| Bank of America Corporation                         | A2                          | P-1                         | Review for  Upgrade Review for | A-                                 | A-2                                | Positive                           | AA-             | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Bank of America, N.A.                               | Aa2                         | P-1                         | Upgrade                        | A+                                 | A-1                                | Positive                           | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Bank of America Europe Designated  Activity Company | NR                          | NR                          | NR                             | A+                                 | A-1                                | Positive                           | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith  Incorporated | NR                          | NR                          | NR                             | A+                                 | A-1                                | Positive                           | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| BofA Securities, Inc.                               | NR                          | NR                          | NR                             | A+                                 | A-1                                | Positive                           | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Merrill Lynch International                         | NR                          | NR                          | NR                             | A+                                 | A-1                                | Positive                           | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| BofA Securities Europe SA                           | NR                          | NR                          | NR                             | A+                                 | A-1                                | Positive                           | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n\nNR = not rated\n\nA reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain  asset-backed  securitizations  may have  a  material adverse effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access to credit markets, the  related  cost of funds, our businesses  and  on certain  revenues, particularly in those  businesses  where counterparty creditworthiness  is  critical. In  addition, under the terms  of certain  OTC  derivative  contracts  and  other trading agreements, in  the  event of downgrades  of our or our rated subsidiaries' credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to  sustain  losses  and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings  of our Parent, bank  or broker-dealer subsidiaries  were  downgraded  by one  or more  levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material.\n\nWhile certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the  full  scope  of the  consequences  of a  credit rating downgrade  to  a  financial  institution  is  inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related  factors  and  assumptions, including  whether any downgrade of a company's long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades  to  its  short-term credit ratings, and  assumptions about the  potential  behaviors  of various  customers, investors and counterparties. For more information  on  potential  impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk - Liquidity Stress\n\nAnalysis on page 103.\n\nFor more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain overthe-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements in the event of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 - Derivatives to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  herein  and  Item 1A.

The Corporation guarantees  the  payment of amounts  and  distributions  with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities and Capital Securities if not paid  by the  Trusts, to  the  extent of funds  held  by the Trusts, and this guarantee, together with the Corporation's other obligations  with  respect to  the  Trust Preferred  Securities  and Capital Securities, effectively constitutes a full and unconditional  guarantee  of the  Trusts' payment obligations  on the Trust Preferred Securities or Capital Securities, as applicable. No  other subsidiary of the  Corporation  guarantees the Guaranteed Securities.\n\nBofA Finance and  each  of the Trusts are finance subsidiaries, have  no  independent assets, revenues  or operations and are dependent upon the Corporation and/or the Corporation's  other subsidiaries  to  meet their respective obligations  under the  Guaranteed  Securities  in  the  ordinary course. If holders of the Guaranteed Securities make claims on their Guaranteed  Securities  in  a  bankruptcy, resolution  or similar proceeding, any recoveries  on  those  claims  will  be limited to those available under the applicable guarantee by the Corporation, as described above.\n\nThe Corporation is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries  for liquidity. Applicable  laws  and  regulations  and intercompany arrangements entered into in connection with the Corporation's  resolution  plan  could  restrict the  availability of funds  from subsidiaries  to  the  Corporation, which  could adversely affect the  Corporation's  ability to  make  payments under its  guarantees. In  addition, the  obligations  of the Corporation under the guarantees of the Guaranteed Securities will  be  structurally subordinated  to  all  existing  and  future liabilities of its subsidiaries, and claimants should look only to assets of the Corporation for payments. If the Corporation, as guarantor of the Guaranteed Notes, transfers all or substantially all of its assets to one or more direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiaries, under the  indenture  governing  the  Guaranteed Notes, the  subsidiary or subsidiaries  will  not be  required  to assume the Corporation's obligations under its guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes.\n\nFor more information on factors that may affect payments to holders  of the  Guaranteed  Securities, see  Liquidity Risk  -  NB Holdings  Corporation  in  this  section, Item 1.

Risk Factors of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Representations and Warranties Obligations\n\nFor information on representations and warranties obligations in connection  with  the  sale  of mortgage  loans, see Note  12  Commitments  and  Contingencies to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk can  also  arise  from operational  failures  that result in  an erroneous  advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss  potential  arising  from all  product classifications  including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets heldfor-sale and unfunded lending commitments, which include loan commitments, letters of credit and  financial  guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value, and assets heldfor-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or\n\nfair value. Certain  loans  and  unfunded  commitments  are accounted  for under the  fair value  option. Credit risk  for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as part of the  allowance  for credit losses  but as  part of the  fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk  is  measured  as  the  net cost in  the  event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current fair value  to  represent credit exposure  without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts  take  into  consideration  the  effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. For more  information  on  derivatives  and  credit extension commitments, see Note  3  -  Derivatives and Note  12  Commitments  and  Contingencies to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nWe  manage  credit risk  based  on  the  risk  profile  of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the  nature  of underlying  collateral  and  other support given  current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial  and  monitor credit risk  in  each  as discussed below.\n\nWe  refine  our underwriting  and  credit risk  management practices  as  well  as  credit standards  to  meet the  changing economic environment. To  mitigate  losses  and  enhance customer support in  our consumer businesses, we  have  in place  collection  programs  and  loan  modification  and  customer assistance  infrastructures. We  utilize  a  number of actions  to mitigate losses  in  the  commercial  businesses  including increasing  the  frequency and  intensity of portfolio  monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating  commercial  exposures  to  independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories.\n\nDuring  2022, asset quality generally improved compared to 2021. Our 2022  net charge-off ratio  remained  near historic lows, and  nonperforming  loans  and  commercial  reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased compared to 2021, which was  partially offset by an  increase  in  reservable  criticized exposure  associated  with  our direct exposure  to  Russia  as  a result of the  Russia/Ukraine conflict. While uncertainty around the  pandemic has  diminished, uncertainty remains  regarding broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, rising rates and the current geopolitical situation and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods.\n\nFor information on our credit risk management activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial Portfolio  Credit Risk  Management on  page  111, Non-U.S. Portfolio  on  page  117, Allowance  for Credit Losses on  page 120, and Note 5 - Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Risk  Factors  of our 2022  Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit cycle. Statistical  techniques  in  conjunction  with  experiential judgment are  used  in  all  aspects  of portfolio  management including  underwriting, product pricing, risk  appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using  detailed  behavioral  information  from external",

During  2022, net charge-offs were  $1.9  billion, relatively unchanged  compared  to  2021. During  2022, nonperforming  loans  declined  primarily due  to\n\ndecreases from consumer real estate loan sales, partially offset by increases  from loans  whose  prior-period  deferrals  expired and were modified in troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) during the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased $204 million during 2022 to $7.2 billion.

Of the  nonperforming residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2022, $1.4 billion, or 63  percent, were  current on  contractual  payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $22 million.\n\nNet charge-offs  of $72  million  for 2022  increased  $100 million  compared  to  2021  primarily due  to  loan  sales  that occurred in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nOf the  $218.0  billion  in  total  residential  mortgage  loans outstanding at December 31, 2022, 28 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential  mortgage  loans  that had  entered  the  amortization period was $3.4 billion, or six percent, at December 31, 2022. Residential  mortgage  loans  that have entered the amortization period  generally experience  a  higher rate  of early stage delinquencies  and  nonperforming  status  compared  to  the residential  mortgage  portfolio  as  a  whole. At December 31, 2022, $64 million, or two percent, of outstanding interest-only\n\nresidential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were  accruing  past due  30  days  or more  compared  to  $844 million, or less  than  one  percent, for the  entire  residential mortgage  portfolio. In  addition, at December 31, 2022, $204 million, or six percent, of outstanding  interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $79 million were contractually current. Loans  that have  yet to  enter the  amortization  period  in  our interest-only residential  mortgage  portfolio  are  primarily wellcollateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 96 percent of these loans that have yet to  enter the amortization period  will  not be  required  to  make  a  fully-amortizing  payment until 2025 or later.\n\nTable  22  presents  outstandings, nonperforming  loans  and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential  mortgage  portfolio. The  Los  Angeles-Long  BeachSanta Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented  14  percent and  15  percent of outstandings  at December 31, 2022 and 2021. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent of outstandings at both December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n|                                           | Outstandings (1)   | Outstandings (1)   | Nonperforming  (1)   | Nonperforming  (1)   |                 |                 |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                           | December 31        | December 31        | December 31          | December 31          | Net Charge-offs | Net Charge-offs |\n| (Dollars in millions)                     | 2022               | 2021               | 2022                 | 2021                 | 2022            | 2021            |\n| California                                | $ 80,878           | $  77,819          | $ 656                | $  693               | $ 37            | $  (14)         |\n| New York                                  | 26,228             | 24,975             | 328                  | 358                  | 7               | 3               |\n| Florida                                   | 15,225             | 13,883             | 145                  | 158                  | (2)             | (8)             |\n| Texas                                     | 9,399              | 9,002              | 88                   | 86                   | -               | -               |\n| New Jersey                                | 8,810              | 8,723              | 96                   | 117                  | 3               | -               |\n| Other                                     | 77,436             | 74,857             | 854                  | 872                  | 27              | (9)             |\n| Residential mortgage loans                | $ 217,976          | $  209,259         | $ 2,167              | $  2,284             | $ 72            | $  (28)         |\n| Fully-insured loan portfolio              | 11,694             | 12,704             |                      |                      |                 |                 |\n| Total residential mortgage loan portfolio | $ 229,670          | $  221,963         |                      |                      |                 |                 |\n\n## Home Equity\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the home equity portfolio made up six percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10\n\nyears, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to  15or 20-year amortizing  loans. We  no  longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, 82  percent of the  home  equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , nine percent was in All Other and  the  remainder of the  portfolio  was  primarily in GWIM .",

Of the total home equity portfolio  at December 31, 2022 and 2021, $11.1  billion  and $12.2 billion, or 42 percent and  44  percent, were  in  first-lien positions. At December 31, 2022, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-\n\nlien  position  and  where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $4.5 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio.\n\nUnused  HELOCs  totaled  $42.4  billion  and  $40.5  billion  at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Of the nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2022, $275 million, or 54 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $167 million, or 33 percent, of nonperforming  home equity loans  were  180  days  or more  past due  and  had  been written  down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs  to  sell. Accruing  loans  that were  30  days  or more  past due decreased $61 million in 2022.\n\nNet recoveries decreased $29 million to $90 million in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nOf the $26.6  billion in total home  equity portfolio outstandings at December 31, 2022, as shown in Table 23, 13 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that had reached the end of their draw period and entered the amortization period was $5.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The  HELOCs  that have  entered  the amortization  period  have  experienced  a  higher percentage  of early stage  delinquencies  and  nonperforming  status  when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2022, $53 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that\n\nhad entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at December 31, 2022, $354 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can  infer some  of this  information  through  a  review  of our HELOC  portfolio  that we  service  and  is  still  in  its  revolving period. During  2022, 10  percent of these  customers  with  an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs.\n\nTable 24 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net recoveries  by certain  state  concentrations  for the  home equity portfolio. In  the  New  York  area, the  New  York-Northern New  Jersey-Long  Island  MSA  made  up  12  percent and  13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Outstandings in the credit card portfolio increased $12.0 billion during  2022  to  $93.4  billion  primarily driven  by increased purchase volumes, partially offset by the sale of a $1.6 billion affinity card  loan  portfolio. Net charge-offs  decreased  $389\n\nmillion  to  $1.3  billion in 2022  compared to 2021, as  loss rates  remained  near historic lows. In  addition, the  prior year included  charge-offs  associated  with  deferrals  that expired  in 2020. Credit card  loans  30  days  or more  past due  and  still accruing interest increased $508 million, and 90 days or more past due  and  still  accruing  interest increased  $230  million. Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $370.1 billion",

Net charge-offs  increased  $251  million in  2022  to $521 million, primarily driven by overdraft losses due to higher payment activity related to checking accounts.\n\n## Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity\n\nAt December 31, 2022, $605  million, or 22  percent, of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at December 31, 2022, $1.7 billion, or 61 percent, of nonperforming  consumer loans  were  modified  and are  now  current after successful  trial  periods, or are  current loans  classified  as  nonperforming  loans  in  accordance  with applicable policies.\n\nForeclosed  properties  increased  $20  million  in  2022  to $121  million. Nonperforming  loans  also  include  certain  loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.",

Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer's interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months.\n\nModifications  of credit card  and  other consumer loans  are made  through  programs  utilizing  direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our credit card  and  other consumer TDR  portfolio  was $624 million and $672 million, of which $540 million and $599 million  were  current or less  than  30  days  past due under the modified terms.\n\n## Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an  assessment of the  credit risk  profile  of the  borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its  financial  position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted  to  reflect changes  in  the  financial condition, cash  flow, risk  profile  or outlook  of a  borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits while  also  balancing  these  considerations  with  the  total borrower or counterparty relationship. We use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations\n\nto  measure  and  evaluate  concentrations  within  portfolios. In addition, risk  ratings  are  a  factor in  determining  the  level  of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses.\n\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to  work  with  clients  experiencing  financial  difficulty to  modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. In  situations  where  an  economic concession  has  been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations\n\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations  of credit exposure  continue  to  be  aligned with  our risk  appetite. We  review, measure  and  manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure  and  manage  commercial  real  estate  loans  by geographic location  and  property type. In  addition, within  our non-U.S. portfolio, we  evaluate  exposures  by region  and  by country. Tables 33, 36 and 39 summarize our concentrations. We also  utilize  syndications  of exposure  to  third  parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 36",

        "page_content": "and  Commercial  Portfolio  Credit Risk  Management -  Industry Concentrations on page 115.\n\nWe  account for certain  large  corporate  loans  and  loan commitments, including  issued  but unfunded  letters  of credit which  are  considered  utilized  for credit risk  management purposes, that exceed our single-name credit risk concentration guidelines  under the  fair value  option. Lending  commitments, both funded and  unfunded, are actively managed  and monitored, and  as  appropriate, credit risk  for these  lending relationships  may be  mitigated  through  the  use  of credit derivatives, with  our credit view  and  market perspectives determining  the  size  and  timing  of the  hedging  activity. In addition, we  purchase  credit protection  to  cover the  funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain  other credit exposures. To  lessen  the  cost of obtaining  our desired  credit protection  levels, credit exposure  may be  added  within  an industry, borrower or counterparty group  by selling  protection. These  credit derivatives  do  not meet the  requirements  for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.\n\nIn  addition, we  are  a  member of various  securities  and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, we may be required to pay a prorata share  of the losses  incurred  by some  of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss  scenarios. For more  information, see Note  12  Commitments  and  Contingencies to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Commercial Credit Portfolio\n\nDuring 2022, commercial credit quality improved as charge-offs, nonperforming  commercial  loans  and  reservable  criticized utilized  exposure declined. Due to the ongoing Russia/Ukraine conflict, all  direct exposure  to  Russian  counterparties  was downgraded and reported as reservable criticized exposure, and expected  credit losses  (ECL) have  been  incorporated  into  our estimate  of the  allowance  for credit losses. Outstanding\n\ncommercial  loans  and  leases  increased  $45.9  billion during 2022 due to  growth  in  commercial  and  industrial, primarily in Global Banking . This increase was partially offset by lower U.S. small  business  commercial  loans  due  to  repayments  of PPP loans  by the  Small  Business  Administration  (SBA) under the terms of the program.\n\nCredit quality of commercial real estate borrowers generally improved  from 2021  as  pandemic-impacted  sectors  are recovering. However, many commercial  real  estate  markets, while  improving, are  still  experiencing  disruptions  in  demand, supply chain  challenges, tenant difficulties  and  challenging capital  markets. Demand  for office  space  continues  to  be uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use.\n\nThe  commercial  allowance  for loan  and  lease  losses remained relatively unchanged at $5.4 billion at December 31, 2022, as loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook were offset by asset quality improvement and a reserve release for reduced pandemic uncertainties. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 120.\n\nTotal  commercial  utilized  credit exposure  increased  $51.3 billion  during  2022  to  $704.9  billion  primarily driven by higher loans and leases and derivative assets. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 56 percent at both December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\nTable  29 presents  commercial  credit exposure  by type  for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial  utilized  credit exposure  includes  SBLCs  and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been  issued  and  for which  we  are  legally bound  to  advance funds  under prescribed  conditions  during  a  specified  time period, and  excludes  exposure  related  to  trading  account assets. Although  funds  have  not yet been  advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.\n\nTable 29 Commercial Credit Exposure by Type\n\n|                                                    | Commercial Utilized  (1)   | Commercial Utilized  (1)   | Commercial Unfunded  (2, 3, 4)   | Commercial Unfunded  (2, 3, 4)   | Total Commercial Committed   | Total Commercial Committed   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                                    | December 31                | December 31                | December 31                      | December 31                      | December 31                  | December 31                  |\n| (Dollars in millions)                              | 2022                       | 2021                       | 2022                             | 2021                             | 2022                         | 2021                         |\n| Loans and leases                                   | $ 589,362                  | $  543,420                 | $ 487,772                        | $  454,256                       | $ 1,077,134                  | $  997,676                   |\n| Derivative assets  (5)                             | 48,642                     | 35,344                     | -                                | -                                | 48,642                       | 35,344                       |\n| Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees | 33,376                     | 34,389                     | 1,266                            | 639                              | 34,642                       | 35,028                       |\n| Debt securities and other investments              | 20,195                     | 19,427                     | 2,551                            | 4,638                            | 22,746                       | 24,065                       |\n| Loans held-for-sale                                | 6,112                      | 13,185                     | 3,729                            | 16,581                           | 9,841                        | 29,766                       |\n| Operating leases                                   | 5,509                      | 5,935                      | -                                | -                                | 5,509                        | 5,935                        |\n| Commercial letters of credit                       | 973                        | 1,176                      | 28                               | 247                              | 1,001                        | 1,423                        |\n| Other                                              | 698                        | 652                        | -                                | -                                | 698                          | 652                          |\n| Total                                              | $ 704,867                  | $  653,528                 | $ 495,346                        | $  476,361                       | $ 1,200,213                  | $  1,129,889                 |",

Outstanding  loans  increased  $6.8  billion, or 11 percent, during  2022  to  $69.8  billion  due  to  new  originations outpacing  paydowns  and  increased  utilizations  under existing\n\ncredit facilities. Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $2.4 billion, or 31 percent, primarily driven by Hotels due to improving vacancy rates and reduced travel restrictions.

We  use  a  number of proactive  risk  mitigation  initiatives  to  reduce  adversely rated exposure  in  the  commercial  real  estate  portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures  for management by independent special asset officers  and  the  pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.\n\nTable 33 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.\n\nTable 33 Outstanding Commercial Real Estate Loans\n\n|                                                | December 31   | December 31   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                          | 2022          | 2021          |\n| By Geographic Region                           |               |               |\n| Northeast                                      | $ 15,601      | $  14,318     |\n| California                                     | 13,360        | 13,145        |\n| Southwest                                      | 8,723         | 7,510         |\n| Southeast                                      | 7,713         | 6,758         |\n| Florida                                        | 5,374         | 4,367         |\n| Midwest                                        | 3,419         | 3,221         |\n| Illinois                                       | 3,327         | 2,878         |\n| Midsouth                                       | 2,716         | 2,289         |\n| Northwest                                      | 1,959         | 1,709         |\n| Non-U.S.                                       | 5,518         | 4,760         |\n| Other                                          | 2,056         | 2,054         |\n| Total outstanding commercial real estate loans | $ 69,766      | $  63,009     |\n| By Property Type                               |               |               |\n| Non-residential                                |               |               |\n| Office                                         | $ 18,230      | $  18,309     |\n| Industrial / Warehouse                         | 13,775        | 10,749        |\n| Multi-family rental                            | 10,412        | 8,173         |\n| Shopping centers /Retail                       | 5,830         | 6,502         |\n| Hotel / Motels                                 | 5,696         | 5,932         |\n| Unsecured                                      | 3,195         | 3,178         |\n| Multi-use                                      | 2,403         | 1,835         |\n| Other                                          | 9,046         | 7,238         |\n| Total non-residential                          | 68,587        | 61,916        |\n| Residential                                    | 1,179         | 1,093         |\n| Total outstanding commercial real estate loans | $ 69,766      | $  63,009     |\n\n## U.S. Small Business Commercial\n\nThe U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed  in Consumer Banking, and  included  $1.0  billion  and $4.7  billion  of PPP  loans  outstanding  at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The  increase  in  commercial committed exposure was concentrated in Asset managers and funds, Global  commercial  banks  and  Pharmaceuticals  and biotechnology.\n\n|                                               | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                         | Nonperforming       | Performing          | Total               | Nonperforming       | Performing          | Total               |\n| Commercial and industrial:                    |                     |                     |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| U.S. commercial                               | $ 305               | $ 985               | $ 1,290             | $  359              | $  685              | $  1,044            |\n| Non-U.S. commercial                           | 69                  | 238                 | 307                 | 72                  | 8                   | 80                  |\n| Total commercial and industrial               | 374                 | 1,223               | 1,597               | 431                 | 693                 | 1,124               |\n| Commercial real estate                        | 59                  | 1,131               | 1,190               | 244                 | 437                 | 681                 |\n| Commercial lease financing                    | 3                   | 16                  | 19                  | 50                  | 7                   | 57                  |\n|                                               | 436                 | 2,370               | 2,806               | 725                 | 1,137               | 1,862               |\n| U.S. small business commercial                | -                   | 51                  | 51                  | -                   | 38                  | 38                  |\n| Total commercial troubled debt restructurings | $ 436               | $ 2,421             | $ 2,857             | $  725              | $  1,175            | $  1,900            |\n\n## Industry Concentrations\n\nIndustry limits  are  used  internally to  manage  industry concentrations  and  are  based  on  committed  exposure  that is determined on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring.\n\nAsset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration  with  committed  exposure  of $165.1  billion,\n\nincreased  $28.2  billion, or 21  percent, during  2022  primarily driven by investment-grade exposures.\n\nReal estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $99.7 billion, increased $3.5 billion, or four percent, during  2022. For more  information  on  the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management - Commercial Real Estate on page 114.\n\nCapital  goods, our third  largest industry concentration  with committed exposure of $87.3 billion, increased $3.0 billion, or four percent, during 2022. The increase in committed exposure occurred  primarily as  a  result of increases  in  the  Electrical equipment and  Trading  companies  and  distributors, partially offset by a decrease in Building products.\n\nWhile  the  U.S. and global  economies  have  shown  signs  of relief from the  pandemic, uncertainty remains  as  a  result of",

protection  to  cover the  funded  portion  as well  as  the  unfunded  portion  of certain  credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we  may add  credit exposure  within  an  industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded  and  unfunded  exposures  for which  we  elected  the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $9.0  billion and  $2.6  billion. We  recorded  net losses  of $37 million  in  2022  compared  to  net losses  $91  million  in  2021. The gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option  portfolio  information  in  Table  43.

These  exposures  accounted  for 89 percent of our total  non-U.S. exposure  at both  December 31, 2022 and 2021. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $24.0 billion in 2022 primarily driven by increases in Germany, Japan, Ireland, India  and  Switzerland, partially offset by decreases in China, Belgium, Australia and Singapore.\n\n|                                      | Net Notional  (1)   | Percent of Total   | Net Notional  (1)   | Percent of Total   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n|                                      | December 31         | December 31        | December 31         | December 31        |\n| (Dollars in millions)                | 2022                | 2022               | 2021                | 2021               |\n| Ratings (2, 3)                       |                     |                    |                     |                    |\n| AAA                                  | $ (379)             | 4.0 %              | $  -                | - %                |\n| AA                                   | (867)               | 10.0               | -                   | -                  |\n| A                                    | (3,257)             | 36.0               | (350)               | 13.4               |\n| BBB                                  | (2,476)             | 28.0               | (710)               | 27.1               |\n| BB                                   | (1,049)             | 12.0               | (809)               | 30.9               |\n| B                                    | (676)               | 7.0                | (659)               | 25.2               |\n| CCC and below                        | (93)                | 1.0                | (35)                | 1.3                |\n| NR  (4)                              | (182)               | 2.0                | (55)                | 2.1                |\n| Total net credit  default protection | $ (8,979)           | 100.0 %            | $  (2,618)          | 100.0 %            |\n\nIn  addition  to  our net notional  credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional  or relative  value  changes. We  execute  the majority of our credit derivative  trades  in  the  OTC  market with large, multinational  financial  institutions, including  brokerdealers  and, to  a  lesser degree, with  a  variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to  credit risk  in  the  event that these  counterparties  fail  to perform under the terms of these contracts. In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our purchased  credit default protection. In  most cases, credit derivative  transactions  are  executed  on  a  daily margin  basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate  rating  level, or a  breach  of credit covenants  would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all\n\ntrades. For more  information  on  credit derivatives and counterparty credit risk  valuation  adjustments, see Note  3  Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Non-U.S. Portfolio\n\nOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political  conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes  in government policies. A risk management framework  is  in  place  to  measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk  and  exposures. In  addition  to  the  direct risk  of doing  business  in  a  country, we  also  are  exposed  to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured  financing  transactions  or related  to  client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance.\n\nNon-U.S. exposure  is  presented  on  an  internal  risk management basis  and  includes  sovereign  and  non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S.\n\nFunded  loans  and  loan  equivalents  include  loans, leases, and  other extensions  of credit and  funds, including  letters  of credit and  due  from placements. Unfunded  commitments  are the  undrawn portion  of legally binding  commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the  fair value  of derivatives, including  the  counterparty risk associated  with  credit default swaps  (CDS), and  secured financing  transactions. Securities  and  other investments  are carried  at fair value  and  long  securities  exposures  are  netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. Net country exposure  represents  country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.",

The increase was primarily driven by net counterparty exposure with financial institutions, partially offset by a  reduction  in  deposits  with  the  central  bank. Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure  was  Germany with  net exposure of $45.7 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $11.9 billion from December 31, 2021. The increase was driven by higher deposits with the central bank and increased exposure with financial institutions and corporates.\n\n## Loan and Lease Contractual Maturities",

The  provision  for credit losses  increased  $7.1  billion  to  an expense  of $2.5  billion  during  2022  compared  to  2021. The provision for credit losses in 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a  reserve  release  for reduced  pandemic uncertainties. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded  lending  commitments, increased  $3.2  billion to  an expense  of $2.0  billion  during  2022  compared  to  2021. The\n\nprovision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded  lending  commitments, increased  $3.9  billion to  an expense of $495 million for 2022 compared to 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Market Risk Management\n\nMarket risk  is  the  risk  that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated  with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these  risks  could  have  a  material impact on our results. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 126.\n\nOur traditional  banking  loan  and  deposit products  are  nontrading  positions  and  are  generally reported  at amortized  cost for assets  or the  amount owed  for liabilities  (historical  cost). However, these  positions  are  still  subject to  changes  in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading  positions  arising  from changes  in  interest rates  is managed  through  our ALM activities. We  have  elected  to account for certain  assets  and  liabilities  under the  fair value option.\n\nOur trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected  in  income. Trading  positions  are  subject to  various changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of assets  and  liabilities  could  change  due  to  market liquidity, correlations across  markets  and  expectations  of market volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The key risk management techniques are discussed  in  more  detail  in  the  Trading  Risk  Management section.\n\nGRM is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed. These responsibilities include ownership of market risk  policy, developing  and  maintaining  quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and  monitoring  position  limits  consistent with  risk  appetite, conducting  daily reviews  and  analysis  of trading  inventory, approving  material  risk  exposures  and  fulfilling  regulatory requirements. Market risks  that impact businesses  outside  of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions.\n\nModel  risk  is  the  potential  for adverse  consequences  from decisions  based  on  incorrect or misused  model  outputs  and reports. Given  that models  are  used  across  the  Corporation, model  risk  impacts  all  risk  types  including  credit, market and operational  risks. The  Enterprise  Model  Risk  Policy defines model risk standards, consistent with our Risk Framework and risk  appetite, prevailing  regulatory guidance  and  industry best practice. All  models, including risk management, valuation and regulatory capital models, must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the model, independent model  testing  and  ongoing  monitoring through  outcomes  analysis  and  benchmarking. The  Enterprise Model Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the MRC, oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the Corporation.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nInterest rate  risk  represents  exposures  to  instruments  whose values  vary with  the  level  or volatility of interest rates. These instruments  include, but are  not limited  to, loans, debt\n\nsecurities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used to  mitigate  these  risks  include  derivatives  such  as  options, futures, forwards and swaps.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nForeign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future  cash  flows  in  foreign  currencies  arising  from foreign exchange  transactions, foreign  currency-denominated  debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging  instruments  used  to  mitigate this  risk  include  foreign  exchange  options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, and  foreign  currency-denominated  debt and deposits.\n\n## Mortgage Risk\n\nMortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation  and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several  forms. For example, we  trade  and  engage  in  marketmaking  activities  in  a  variety of mortgage  securities  including whole  loans, pass-through  certificates, commercial  mortgages and  collateralized  mortgage  obligations  including  collateralized debt obligations  using  mortgages  as  underlying  collateral. In addition, we  originate  a  variety of MBS, which  involves  the accumulation  of mortgage-related  loans  in  anticipation  of eventual securitization, and we may hold positions in mortgage securities  and  residential  mortgage  loans  as  part of the  ALM portfolio. We  also  record  MSRs  as  part of our mortgage origination activities. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk  include  derivatives  such  as  options, swaps, futures  and forwards as well as securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. For more  information, see  Mortgage  Banking  Risk Management on page 127.\n\n## Equity Market Risk\n\nEquity market risk  represents  exposures  to  securities  that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and  foreign  common  stock  or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments  that would  lead  to  this  exposure include, but are  not limited  to, the  following: common  stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible  bonds, listed  equity options  (puts  and  calls), OTC equity options, equity total  return  swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions.\n\n## Commodity Risk\n\nCommodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the  petroleum, natural  gas, power and metals markets. These instruments  consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps  and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures  and  swaps  in  the  same  or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions.",

        "page_content": "## Issuer Credit Risk\n\nIssuer credit risk  represents  exposures  to  changes  in  the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be  adversely impacted  by changes  in  the  levels  of credit spreads, by credit migration  or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments.\n\n## Market Liquidity Risk\n\nMarket liquidity risk  represents  the  risk  that the  level  of expected  market activity changes  dramatically and, in  certain cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be  able  to  transact business  and  execute  trades  in  an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations  are  compromised  by disproportionate  demand  or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating  techniques  as  discussed  in  more  detail  in  Trading Risk Management.\n\n## Trading Risk Management\n\nTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and  potential  volatility of revenues  generated  by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and  procedures  are  utilized  to  enable  the  most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in  interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and  hypothetical  market moves, such  as  VaR  and  stress testing. Periods  of extreme  market stress  influence  the reliability of these  techniques  to  varying  degrees. Qualitative evaluations  of market risk  utilize  the  suite  of quantitative  risk measures  while  understanding  each  of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk  managers  independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments.\n\nVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows  the  aggregation  of market risk  factors, including  the effects  of portfolio  diversification. A  VaR  model  simulates  the value  of a  portfolio  under a  range  of scenarios  in  order to generate  a  distribution  of potential  gains  and  losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical  data. We  use  one  VaR  model  consistently across  the  trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is  equivalent to  a  99  percent confidence  level, which  means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses  in  excess  of VaR, on  average, 99  out of 100  trading days.\n\nWithin  any VaR  model, there  are  significant and  numerous assumptions  that will  differ from company to  company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR  model  may require  additional  modeling  assumptions  for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are  not consistently available. For positions  with  insufficient historical  data  for the  VaR  calculation, the  process  for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and\n\nstatistical  analysis  of the  new  product or less  liquid  position. This  analysis  identifies  reasonable  alternatives  that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.\n\nVaR  may not be  indicative  of realized  revenue  volatility as changes  in  market conditions  or in  the  composition  of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical  data  used  for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels  of portfolio  diversification  than  will  be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we  update  the  historical  data  underlying  our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the  model. A  minor portion  of risks  related  to  our trading positions  is  not included  in  VaR. These risks  are  reviewed  as part of our ICAAP. For more  information  regarding  ICAAP, see Capital Management on page 96.\n\nGRM continually reviews, evaluates  and  enhances  our VaR model  so  that it reflects  the  material  risks  in  our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees.\n\nTrading  limits  on  quantitative  risk  measures, including  VaR, are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed  on  a  regular basis  so  that trading  limits  remain relevant and  within  our overall  risk  appetite  for market risks. Trading  limits  are  reviewed  in  the  context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as  well  as  at aggregated portfolios  to  account for correlations among  risk  factors. All  trading  limits  are  approved  at least annually. Approved  trading  limits  are  stored  and  tracked  in  a centralized  limits  management system. Trading  limit excesses are communicated to management for review. Certain quantitative  market risk  measures  and  corresponding  limits have  been  identified  as  critical  in  the  Corporation's  Risk Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the Board.\n\nIn periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership communicates  daily to  discuss  losses, key risk  positions  and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk.\n\nTable  43 presents  the  total  market-based  portfolio  VaR, which  is  the  combination  of the  total  covered  positions  (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered  covered  positions, except for structural  foreign currency positions  that are  excluded  with  prior regulatory approval.\n\nIn addition, Table 43 presents our fair value option portfolio, which  includes  substantially all  of the  funded  and  unfunded exposures  for which  we  elect the  fair value  option, and  their corresponding hedges. Additionally, market risk VaR for trading activities  as  presented  in  Table  43  differs  from VaR  used  for regulatory capital  calculations  due  to  the  holding  period  being",

A  backtesting  excess  occurs  when  a  trading  loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to help confirm that the VaR  methodology accurately represents  those  losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting  excesses  observed  can  differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed  during  the  three  years  of historical  data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nThe  trading  revenue  used  for backtesting  is  defined  by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the  regulatory capital  calculation. This  revenue differs  from total  trading-related  revenue  in  that it excludes revenue  from trading  activities  that either do  not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intra-day trading revenues.\n\nWe  conduct daily backtesting  on  the  VaR  results  used  for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal  entities, regions  and  risk  factors. These  results  are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews  and  evaluates  the  results  of these tests.\n\nDuring 2022, there was one day where this subset of trading revenue  had  losses  that exceeded  our total  covered  portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.\n\n## Total Trading-related Revenue\n\nTotal  trading-related  revenue, excluding  brokerage  fees, and CVA, DVA  and  funding  valuation  adjustment gains  (losses), represents  the  total  amount earned  from trading  positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information on fair value, see Note 20  -  Fair Value Measurements to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.\n\nTrading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, tradingrelated  revenue  is  dependent on  the  volume  and  type  of transactions, the  level  of risk  assumed, and  the  volatility of price  and  rate  movements  at any given  time  within  the  everchanging  market environment. Significant daily revenue  by business  is  monitored  and  the  primary drivers  of these  are reviewed.\n\nThe  following  histogram is  a  graphic depiction  of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2022  and  2021. During  2022, positive  trading-related revenue  was  recorded  for 99  percent of the  trading  days, of which 90 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and  the  largest loss  was  $9  million. This  compares  to  2021 where  positive  trading-related  revenue  was  recorded  for 97 percent of the  trading  days, of which  80 percent were  daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $45 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Trading Portfolio Stress Testing\n\nBecause the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we  also  stress  test our portfolio  using  scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal  market movements.\n\nA  set of scenarios, categorized  as  either historical  or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and  individual  businesses. These  scenarios  include  shocks  to underlying  market risk  factors  that may be  well  beyond  the shocks  found  in  the  historical  data  used  to  calculate  VaR.",

        "page_content": "Historical  scenarios  simulate  the  impact of the  market moves that occurred  during  a  period  of extended  historical  market stress. Generally, a  multi-week  period  representing  the  most severe  point during  a  crisis  is  selected  for each  historical scenario. Hypothetical  scenarios  provide  estimated  portfolio impacts from potential  future  market stress  events. Scenarios are  reviewed  and  updated  in  response  to  changing  positions and new economic or political  information. In  addition, new or ad  hoc scenarios  are  developed  to  address  specific potential market events  or particular vulnerabilities  in  the  portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.\n\nStress  testing  for the  trading  portfolio  is  integrated  with enterprise-wide  stress  testing  and  incorporated  into  the  limits framework. The  macroeconomic scenarios  used  for enterprisewide  stress  testing  purposes  differ from the  typical  trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the  results  are  forecasted  over multiple  periods  for use  in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 93.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book\n\nThe  following  discussion  presents  net interest income  for banking book activities.\n\nInterest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is  measured  as  the  potential  change  in  net interest income caused  by movements  in  market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending  and  deposit-taking, create  interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.\n\nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business  growth, ALM positioning  and  the  future  direction  of interest rate  movements  as  implied  by market-based  forward curves.\n\nWe then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income  forecast is  frequently updated  for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our banking  book  balance  sheet position  in  order to maintain  an  acceptable  level  of exposure  to  interest rate changes.\n\nThe  interest rate  scenarios  that we  analyze  incorporate balance  sheet assumptions  such  as  loan  and  deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. Our overall  goal  is  to  manage  interest rate  risk  so  that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.\n\nTable  45 presents  the  spot and  12-month  forward  rates used  in  developing  the  forward  curve  used  in  our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Table 45 Forward Rates\n\nTable 46 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve Changes\n\n|                        | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                        | Federal Funds       | Three-month LIBOR   | 10-Year Swap        |\n| Spot rates             | 4.50 %              | 4.77 %              | 3.84 %              |\n| 12-month forward rates | 4.75                | 4.78                | 3.62                |\n|                        | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   |\n| Spot rates             | 0.25 %              | 0.21 %              | 1.58 %              |\n| 12-month forward rates | 1.00                | 1.07                | 1.84                |\n\nTable 46 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2022 and 2021  resulting  from instantaneous  parallel  and  non-parallel shocks  to  the  market-based  forward  curve. Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the  context of the  current rate  environment. The  interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at zero. Depending  on  the  level  of interest rates, Down-rate scenarios  may not receive  the  full  impact of the  rate  shock, particularly in low rate environments.\n\nThe  overall  decrease  in  asset sensitivity, as  shown  in  the following  table, to  Up-rate  scenarios  was  primarily due  to  an increase  in  long-end  and  short-end  rates. We  continue  to  be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the  majority of that impact coming  from the  short end  of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the  fair value  of our debt securities  classified  as  available  for sale  and  adversely affect accumulated  OCI and  thus  capital levels  under the  Basel  3  capital  rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital  would  be  reduced  over time  by offsetting  positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities.

As  part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate  and  foreign  exchange  derivatives  in  managing interest rate sensitivity.\n\nThe behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income.

In  higher rate  scenarios, any customer activity resulting  in  the  replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding  deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.\n\n## Interest Rate  and  Foreign  Exchange  Derivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in  our ALM activities  to  manage  our interest rate  and  foreign exchange  risks. Specifically, we  use  those  derivatives  to manage both  the  variability in  cash  flows  and  changes  in  fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps  tied  to  various  benchmark  interest rates  and  foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign  exchange  contracts  include  cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign  currency futures  contracts, foreign  currency forward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM activities  can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk  management derivatives. Designated  accounting  hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book  section  and  are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 46. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in  accounting  hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange  risk  of our foreign  operations, the  Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant.\n\nRisk  management derivatives  are  predominantly used  to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated  assets  and  liabilities  and  eliminate  substantially all foreign  currency exposures  in  the  cash  flows  of the Corporation's non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk  exposures  such  as  cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these  foreign  exchange derivatives, the  market risk  related  to  this  exposure  is  not significant. For more  information  on  the  accounting  for derivatives, see Note  3  -  Derivatives to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Mortgage Banking Risk Management\n\nWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to  credit, liquidity and  interest rate  risks, among  others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks  by selling  or securitizing  a  portion  of the  loans  we originate.\n\nInterest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in\n\ninterest rates  also  impact the  value  of interest rate  lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage LHFS between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. An increase in mortgage interest rates  typically leads  to  a  decrease  in  the  value  of these instruments. Conversely, when there is an increase in interest rates, the  value  of the  MSRs  will  increase  driven  by lower prepayment expectations. Because  the  interest rate  risks  of these  hedged  items  offset, we combine them into  one  overall hedged  item with  one  combined  economic hedge  portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities.\n\nDuring  2022, 2021  and  2020, we  recorded  gains  of $78 million, $39 million and $321 million. For more information on MSRs, see Note  20  -  Fair Value  Measurements to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Compliance and Operational Risk Management\n\nCompliance  risk  is  the  risk  of legal  or regulatory sanctions, material  financial  loss  or damage  to  the  reputation  of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and our internal  policies  and  procedures  (collectively, applicable laws, rules and regulations). We are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws, rules and regulations in the  U.S. and the laws of the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we operate, including  those  related  to  financial  crimes  and  antimoney laundering, market conduct, trading  activities, fair lending, privacy, data protection and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, people or external events, and includes legal risk. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. The Corporation faces a number of key operational  risks  including  third-party risk, model  risk, conduct risk, technology risk, information security risk and data risk. Operational  risk  can  result in financial  losses  and reputational  impacts  and  is  a  component in  the  calculation  of total  RWA  used  in  the  Basel  3  capital  calculation. For more information  on  Basel  3  calculations, see  Capital  Management on page 96.\n\nFLUs and control functions are first and foremost responsible  for managing  all  aspects  of their businesses, including  their compliance  and  operational  risk. FLUs  and control  functions  are  required  to  understand  their business processes  and  related  risks  and  controls, including  third-party dependencies  and  the  related  regulatory requirements, and monitor and  report on  the  effectiveness  of the  control environment. In  order to  actively monitor and  assess  the performance of their processes and controls, they must conduct comprehensive quality assurance  activities  and  identify issues and risks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses. FLUs and control functions must also adhere  to  compliance  and operational  risk  appetite  limits  to  meet strategic, capital  and financial planning objectives. Finally, FLUs and control functions are  responsible  for the  proactive  identification, management and escalation of compliance and operational risks across the Corporation. Collectively, these efforts are important to strengthen their compliance and operational resiliency, which is the ability to deliver critical operations through disruption.\n\nGlobal Compliance and Operational Risk teams independently assess compliance and operational risk, monitor business  activities  and  processes  and  evaluate  FLUs  and control  functions  for adherence  to  applicable  laws, rules  and regulations, including identifying issues and risks, and reporting",

        "page_content": "on  the  state  of the  control  environment. Corporate  Audit provides  an  independent assessment and  validation  through testing  of key compliance  and  operational  risk  processes  and controls across the Corporation.\n\nThe Corporation's Global Compliance - Enterprise Policy and Operational  Risk  Management -  Enterprise  Policy set the requirements  for reporting  compliance  and  operational  risk information  to  executive  management as  well  as  the  Board  or appropriate Board-level committees and reflect Global Compliance and Operational Risk's responsibilities for conducting independent oversight of the Corporation's compliance  and  operational  risk  management activities. The Board  provides  oversight of compliance  risk  through  its  Audit Committee and the ERC, and operational risk through its ERC.\n\nA key operational risk facing the Corporation is information security, which includes cybersecurity. Cybersecurity risk includes  exposure  to  failures  or interruptions  of service  or security breaches resulting from malicious technological attacks that impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our or third  parties' operations, systems  or data. The  Corporation seeks  to  mitigate  information  security risk  and  associated reputational  and  compliance  risk  by employing  a  multi-layered and intelligence-led Global Information Security Program focused on preparing for, preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding to and recovering from cyber threats and incidents and effectively operating the Corporation's processes. Additionally, our business  continuity policy, standards  and  procedures  are designed to maintain the availability of business functions and enable impacted units within the Corporation and third parties to  achieve  strategic objectives  in  the  event of a  cybersecurity incident.\n\nThe  Global  Information  Security Program is  supported  by three  lines  of defense. The  Global  Information  Security Team within the first line of defense is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Global Information Security Program, which includes  defining  policies  and  procedures  to  safeguard  the Corporation's information systems  and  data, conducting vulnerability and  third-party information  security assessments, information  security event management (e.g., responding  to ransomware  and  distributed denial of service attacks), evaluation  of external  cyber intelligence, supporting  industry cybersecurity efforts  and  working  with  governmental  agencies, and developing employee training to support adherence to the Corporation's  policies  and  procedures. As  the  second  line  of defense, Global Compliance and Operational Risk independently assesses, monitors  and  tests  information  security risk  across the  Corporation, as  well  as  the  effectiveness  of the  Global Information  Security Program. Corporate  Audit serves  as  the third line of defense, conducting additional independent review and validation of the first-line processes and functions. As part of our Global  Information  Security Program, we  leverage  both internal  and  external  assessments  and  partnerships  with industry leaders to help approach information security holistically. Additionally the Corporation maintains a comprehensive enterprise-wide program that defines standards for the planning, sourcing, management, and oversight of thirdparty relationships  and  third-party access  to  its  system, facilities, and/or confidential or proprietary data for a business purpose or supervisory function.\n\nThrough established governance structures, we  have processes to help facilitate appropriate and effective oversight of information  security risk. These  routines  enable  our three lines  of defense  and  management to  debate  information security risks  and  monitor control  performance  to  allow  for further escalation to executive management, management and\n\nBoard-level  committees  or to  the  Board, as  appropriate. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of Bank of America's Global  Information  Security Program and  devotes  significant time  and  attention  to  the  oversight of cybersecurity and information security risk. The  Board  regularly discusses cybersecurity and  information  security risks  with  the  Chief Technology and  Information  Officer and  the  Chief Information Security Officer. Additionally, the ERC receives regular reporting, and reviews and approves the Information Security Program and Policy on an annual basis.\n\n## Reputational Risk Management\n\nReputational  risk  is  the  risk  that negative  perception  of the Corporation  may adversely impact profitability or operations. Reputational  risk  may result from many of the  Corporation's activities, including  those  related  to  the  management of our strategic, operational, compliance and credit risks.\n\nThe Corporation manages reputational risk through established  policies  and  controls  embedded  throughout its business  and  risk  management processes. We  proactively monitor and identify potential reputational risk events and have processes established to mitigate reputational risks in a timely manner. If reputational  risk  events  occur, we  focus  on remediating the underlying issue and taking action to minimize damage  to  the  Corporation's  reputation. The  Corporation  has processes  and  procedures  in  place  to  respond  to  events  that give rise to reputational risk, including educating individuals and organizations that influence public opinion, implementing external  communication  strategies  to  mitigate  the  risk, and informing  key stakeholders  of potential  reputational  risks. The Corporation's  organization  and  governance  structure  provides oversight of reputational  risks. Reputational  risk  reporting  is provided  regularly and  directly to  senior management and  the ERC, which  provides  primary oversight of reputational  risk. In addition, each FLU has a committee, which includes representatives from Legal and Risk, that is responsible for the oversight of reputational  risk, including  approval  for business activities that present elevated levels of reputational risks.\n\n## Climate Risk Management\n\nClimate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures  and  sea  levels, and  (2) risks  related  to  the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and  market changes. These  changes and  events  may have  broad  impacts  on  operations, supply chains, distribution  networks, customers and markets and are otherwise  referred  to, respectively, as  physical  risk  and transition  risk. These  risks  may impact both  financial  and nonfinancial  risk  types. Physical  risk  may lead  to  increased credit risk  by diminishing  borrowers' repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral. Physical risk may also increase operational  risk  by impacting  the  Corporation's  facilities, employees, customers or vendors. Transition risks may amplify credit risk  through  the  financial  impacts  of changes  in  policy, technology or the market on the Corporation or its counterparties. Unanticipated  market changes  can  lead  to sudden  price  adjustments  and  give  rise  to  heightened  market risk. In addition, reputational risk may arise, including from our climate-related practices and disclosures and if we do not meet our climate-related commitments.\n\nEffective  management of climate  risk  requires  coordinated governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and well-",

        "page_content": "developed processes to identify, measure, monitor and control risks. As  climate  risk  spans  all  key risk  types, we  have developed  and  continue  to  enhance  processes  to  embed climate  risk  considerations  into  our Risk  Framework  and  risk management programs established for strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational  and  reputational  risks. Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework aligns with our Risk Framework and provides additional clarity and transparency regarding  our approach  to  environmental  and  social  risks, inclusive of climate risk.\n\nOur governance framework establishes oversight of climate risk  practices  and  strategies  by the  Board, supported  by its ERC, as  well  as  the  MRC  and  the  Responsible  Growth Committee, both  of which  are  management-level  committees comprised of senior leaders across every major FLU and control function. The  Responsible  Growth  Committee  is  supported  by the  ESG  Disclosure  sub-committee, which  is  responsible  for reviewing  and  providing  oversight of the  Corporation's  climate and ESG-related public disclosures.\n\nOur climate  risk  management efforts  are  overseen  by an executive  officer who  reports  to  the  CRO. The  Climate  Risk Council, which consists of leaders across risk, FLU and control functions, meets routinely to discuss our approach to managing climate-related risks in line with our Risk Framework.\n\nIn 2021, we publicly announced our commitment to achieve net zero  emissions  in  our financing  activities, operations, and supply chain  before  2050  (Net Zero  Goal) and  set 2030 emissions  targets  for our operations  and  supply chain. In connection  with  our Net Zero  Goal, in  2022, we announced a target to  reduce  emissions  by 2030  associated  with  our financing  activities  related  to  auto  manufacturing, energy and power generation  (2030 Targets). In our September 2022 Task Force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures  Report, we disclosed  our 2019  and  2020  financed  emissions  and emissions intensity metrics for these sectors, with 2019 serving as the baseline for our 2030 Targets.\n\nWe  plan  to  disclose  the  financed  emissions  for additional portions of our business loan portfolio in 2023, and we plan to set financing  activity emission  reduction  targets  for other key sectors by April 2024.\n\nAchieving  our climate--related  goals  and  targets, including our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets, may require technological advances, clearly defined  roadmaps  for industry sectors, new standards and public policies, including those that improve the cost of capital  for the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy and better emissions data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders.\n\nGiven the extended period of these and other climate-related goals we have established, our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on  our results  of operations  or financial position in the relevant periods presented herein.\n\nFor more information about climate-related matters, including how the Corporation manages climate risk, and the Corporation's climate-related goals and commitments, including our plans to achieve our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets and progress on our sustainable finance goals, see the Corporation's  website, including  our 2022  Task  Force  on Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures  Report and  the  2022\n\nAnnual  Report to  shareholders  available  on  the  Investor Relations portion of our website in March 2023. The contents of the Corporation's website  and  2022  Annual  Report to shareholders are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on  Form 10-K. For more  information  on  climate-related risks, see  Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe  foregoing  discussion  and  our discussion  in  the  2022 Annual  Report to shareholders  regarding  our goals  and commitments  with  respect to climate  risk management, including environmental transition considerations, include 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees  of future  results  or performance  and  involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are  difficult to  predict and are often  beyond the  Corporation's  control. Actual  outcomes  and  results  may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements.\n\n## Complex Accounting Estimates\n\nOur significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting  principles  require  complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have  procedures  and  processes  in  place  to  facilitate  making these judgments.\n\nThe  more  judgmental  estimates  are  summarized  in  the following  discussion. We  have  identified  and  described  the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes  that involve  mathematical  models  to  derive  the estimates. In  many cases, there  are  numerous  alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs  to  the  models. Where alternatives  exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in  developing  the  inputs. Actual  performance  that differs  from our estimates of the  key variables  could  materially impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value  of our lending  portfolio  and  market-sensitive  assets  and liabilities  may change  subsequent to  the  balance  sheet date, often  significantly, due  to  the  nature  and  magnitude  of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and  in  unforeseen  ways  and  the  resulting volatility could  have  a  significant, negative  effect on  future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan and  lease  losses  and  the  reserve  for unfunded  lending commitments. Our process  for determining  the  allowance  for credit losses  is  discussed  in Note  1  -  Summary  of Significant Accounting  Principles and Note  5  -  Outstanding  Loans  and Leases  and  Allowance  for Credit  Losses to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe  determination  of the  allowance  for credit losses  is based  on numerous estimates  and assumptions, which require",

        "page_content": "a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. A critical judgment in the process is the weighting of our forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios  that are  incorporated  into  our quantitative models. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation uses  multiple macroeconomic scenarios in its ECL calculation, which have included a baseline scenario  derived  from consensus  estimates, an  adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate  recession, a downside  scenario  reflecting  persistent inflation  and  interest rates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to the  severely adverse  scenario  used  in  stress  testing  and  an upside  scenario  that considers  the  potential  for improvement above  the  baseline  scenario. The  overall  economic outlook  is weighted  95  percent towards  a  recessionary environment in 2023, with  continued  inflationary pressures  leading  to  lower gross  domestic product (GDP) and  higher unemployment rate expectations  as  compared  to  the  prior year. Generally, as  the consensus estimates improve or deteriorate, the allowance for credit losses  will  change  in  a  similar direction. There  are multiple variables that drive the macroeconomic scenarios with the  key variables  including, but not limited  to, U.S. GDP  and unemployment rates. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.2 percent, 4.7 percent and 4.3 percent in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and the  weighted  macroeconomic outlook  for U.S. GDP  was forecasted to grow at 2.1 percent, 1.9 percent and 1.9 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. As  of December 31, 2022, the  latest consensus estimates for the U.S. average unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 3.7 percent and U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow 0.4 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a tighter labor market and  depressed  growth expectations  compared  to  our macroeconomic outlook  as  of December 31, 2021, and were factored into our allowance for credit losses estimate as of December 31, 2022. In  addition, as  of December 31, 2022, the  weighted  macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.6 percent and 5.0 percent in the fourth quarters of 2023 and  2024, and  the  weighted  macroeconomic outlook  for U.S. GDP  was  forecasted  to  contract 0.4  percent and  grow  1.2 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  above  judgments  and  estimates, the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted  by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases or decreases in credit and/or internal risk ratings in our commercial  portfolio, improvement or deterioration  in borrower delinquencies  or credit scores  in  our credit card portfolio and increases or decreases in home prices, which is a primary driver of LTVs, in  our consumer real estate portfolio, all of which  have  some  degree  of uncertainty. The  allowance  for credit losses  increased  to  $14.2  billion  from $13.8  billion  at December 31, 2021, primarily due  to  loan  growth  and  a dampened macroeconomic outlook in 2022.\n\nTo provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the macroeconomic scenarios  and  other assumptions  on  the estimate  of our allowance  for credit losses, the  Corporation compared  the  December 31, 2022  modeled  ECL  from the baseline  scenario  and  our adverse scenario. Relative  to  the baseline scenario, the adverse scenario assumed a peak U.S. unemployment rate  of nearly three  percentage  points  higher than the baseline scenario, a decline in U.S. GDP followed by a prolonged  recovery and  a  lower home  price  outlook  with  a difference  of approximately eight percent at the  trough. This\n\nsensitivity analysis  resulted  in  a  hypothetical  increase  in  the allowance for credit losses of approximately $4 billion.\n\nWhile  the  sensitivity analysis  may be  useful  to  understand how changes in macroeconomic assumptions could impact our modeled ECLs, it is not meant to forecast how our allowance for credit losses is expected to change in a different macroeconomic outlook. Importantly, the  analysis  does  not incorporate  a  variety of factors, including  qualitative  reserves and  the  weighting  of alternate  scenarios, which  could  have offsetting  effects  on  the  estimate. Considering  the  variety of factors contemplated when developing and weighting macroeconomic outlooks  such  as  recent economic events, leading  economic indicators, views  of internal  and  third-party economists and industry trends, in addition to other qualitative factors, the Corporation believes the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 is appropriate.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nUnder applicable  accounting  standards, we  are  required  to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable  inputs  in  measuring  fair value. We  classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based on  the  three-level  fair value  hierarchy in the  accounting standards.\n\nThe  fair values  of assets  and  liabilities  may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations  of products  using  models  or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where  market data  is  available, the  inputs  used  for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to  valuation  models  are  considered  unobservable  if they are supported by little  or no market activity. In  periods  of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value  of assets  and  liabilities, we  have  in  place  various processes and controls that include: a  model  validation  policy that requires  review  and  approval  of quantitative  models  used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk  quantification; a  trading  product valuation  policy that requires  verification  of all  traded  product valuations; and  a periodic review  and  substantiation  of daily profit and  loss reporting  for all  traded  products. Primarily through  validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can  and  do  include  both  market-observable  and  internallymodeled  values  and/or valuation  inputs. Our reliance  on  this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance  applied  to  those  developed  through  their own internal  modeling. For example, broker quotes  in  less  active markets  may only be  indicative  and  therefore  less  reliable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the  business. For more information, see Note  20  -  Fair Value Measurements and Note  21  -  Fair Value  Option to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Level 3 Assets and Liabilities\n\nFinancial  assets  and  liabilities, and  MSRs, where  values  are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable  and  are  significant to  the  overall  fair value measurement are  classified  as  Level  3  under the  fair value hierarchy established  in  applicable  accounting  standards. The fair value  of these  Level  3  financial  assets  and  liabilities  and",

The Level 3 gains and losses recorded  in  earnings  did  not have  a  significant impact on  our liquidity or capital. We  conduct a  review  of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level  3  are  made  if the  significant inputs  used  in  the financial  models  measuring  the  fair values  of the  assets  and liabilities  became  unobservable  or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. For more information on transfers into and out of Level 3 during 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets\n\nAccrued income taxes, reported as a component of either other assets  or accrued  expenses  and  other liabilities  on  the Consolidated  Balance  Sheet, represent the  net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing  jurisdictions  attributable  to  our operations  to  date. We currently file  income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and  consider many factors, including  statutory, judicial  and regulatory guidance, in  estimating  the  appropriate  accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction.\n\nNet deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet, represent the  net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating  loss  (NOL) and  tax credit carryforwards  and\n\nbecause  of future  reversals  of temporary differences  in  the bases  of assets  and  liabilities  as  measured  by tax laws  and their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and  many of these  attributes  can  expire  if not utilized  within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to  reduce  net deferred  tax assets  to  the  amounts  that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized.\n\nConsistent with  the  applicable  accounting  guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities  and  change  our estimates  of accrued  income  taxes  and/or net deferred  tax assets  due  to changes  in  income  tax laws  and  their interpretation  by the courts  and  regulatory authorities. These  revisions  of our estimates, which also may result from our income tax planning and  from the  resolution  of income  tax audit matters, may be material to our operating results for any given period.\n\nSee Note 19 - Income Taxes to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements  for a  table  of significant tax attributes  and additional information. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are  discussed  in Note  1  -  Summary  of Significant  Accounting Principles , and Note  7  -  Goodwill  and  Intangible  Assets to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe  completed  our annual  goodwill  impairment test as  of June 30, 2022. Based on our assessment, we have concluded that goodwill was not impaired.\n\n## Certain Contingent Liabilities\n\nFor more information on the complex judgments associated with certain  contingent liabilities, see Note  12  -  Commitments  and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

The  Corporation's  internal  control  over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to  the  maintenance  of records  that, in  reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as  necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are  being  made  only in  accordance  with  authorizations  of management and directors of the Corporation; and (iii) provide reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporation's  assets  that could  have  a  material  effect on  the financial statements.\n\nBecause  of its  inherent limitations, internal  control  over financial  reporting  may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections  of any evaluation  of effectiveness  to  future periods  are  subject to  the  risk  that controls  may become inadequate  because  of changes  in  conditions, or that the degree  of compliance  with  the  policies  or procedures  may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation's  internal  control  over financial  reporting  as  of December 31, 2022 based on the framework set forth  by the Committee  of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the  Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the  Corporation's  internal  control  over financial reporting is effective.\n\nThe Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public accounting  firm, as  stated  in  their accompanying  report which expresses  an  unqualified  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of the Corporation's  internal  control  over financial  reporting  as  of December 31, 2022.\n\nBrian T.

We also have audited the Corporation's  internal  control  over financial  reporting  as  of December 31, 2022, based  on  criteria  established  in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the  Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the  consolidated  financial  statements referred  to  above  present fairly, in  all  material  respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022  in  conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the  Corporation  maintained, in  all  material  respects, effective internal  control  over financial  reporting  as  of December 31, 2022, based  on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  1  to  the  consolidated  financial statements, the  Corporation  changed  the  manner in  which  it accounts  for credit losses  on  certain  financial  instruments  in 2020.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe  Corporation's  management is responsible  for these consolidated  financial  statements, for maintaining  effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial  reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements and on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with  the  Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board  (United States) (PCAOB) and  are  required  to  be  independent with respect to  the  Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the  PCAOB. Those  standards  require  that we  plan  and perform the  audits  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of material  misstatement, whether due  to  error or fraud, and whether effective  internal  control  over financial  reporting  was maintained  in  all  material  respects. Our audits  of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated  financial  statements, whether due  to  error or\n\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated financial  statements. Our audits  also  included  evaluating  the accounting  principles  used  and  significant estimates  made  by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the  consolidated  financial  statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding  of internal  control  over financial  reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk. Our audits  also included  performing  such  other procedures  as  we  considered necessary in  the  circumstances. We  believe  that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA  company's  internal  control  over financial  reporting  is  a process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding the  reliability of financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of financial  statements  for external  purposes  in  accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control  over financial  reporting  includes  those  policies  and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions  of the  assets  of the  company; (ii) provide reasonable  assurance  that transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to  permit preparation  of financial  statements  in accordance  with  generally accepted  accounting  principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in  accordance  with  authorizations  of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention  or timely detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition  of the  company's  assets  that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause  of its  inherent limitations, internal  control  over financial  reporting  may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections  of any evaluation  of effectiveness  to  future periods  are  subject to  the  risk  that controls  may become inadequate  because  of changes  in  conditions, or that the degree  of compliance  with  the  policies  or procedures  may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe  critical  audit matters  communicated  below  are  matters arising  from the  current period  audit of the  consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated  to  the  audit committee  and  that (i) relate  to accounts  or disclosures  that are  material  to  the  consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters  does  not alter in  any way our opinion  on  the consolidated  financial  statements, taken  as  a  whole, and  we are  not, by communicating  the  critical  audit matters  below, providing  separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance  for Loan and  Lease  Losses -Commercial  and Consumer Card Loans\n\nAs  described  in  Notes  1  and  5  to  the  consolidated  financial statements, the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management's  estimate  of the  expected  credit losses  in  the",

        "page_content": "Corporation's  loan  and  lease  portfolio, excluding  loans  and unfunded  lending  commitments  accounted  for under the  fair value option. As of December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $12.7 billion on total loans and leases of $1,040.0 billion, which excludes loans accounted for under the fair value option. For commercial and consumer card loans, the expected  credit loss  is  typically estimated  using  quantitative methods  that consider a  variety of factors  such  as  historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as  an  economic outlook  over the  life  of the  loan. In  its  loss forecasting  framework, the  Corporation  incorporates  forward looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been  key drivers  of increases  and  decreases  in credit losses. These  variables  include, but are  not limited  to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels  and  corporate  bond  spreads. The  scenarios  that are chosen and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors  including  recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views  of internal  as  well  as  third-party economists and industry trends. Also included in the allowance for loan  and  lease  losses  are  qualitative  reserves  to  cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the  economic assumptions. Factors  that the  Corporation considers  include  changes  in  lending  policies  and  procedures, business  conditions, the  nature  and  size  of the  portfolio, portfolio  concentrations, the  volume  and  severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as  competition, and legal  and  regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in  quantitative  models  that are  built on  historical data.\n\nThe  principal  considerations  for our determination  that performing  procedures  relating  to  the  allowance  for loan  and lease losses for the commercial and consumer card portfolios is a  critical  audit matter are  (i) the  significant judgment and estimation  by management in  developing  lifetime  economic forecast scenarios, related  weightings  to  each  scenario  and certain qualitative reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures  and  in  evaluating  audit evidence  obtained, and  (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing  the  matter involved  performing  procedures  and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements. These procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of controls relating  to  the  allowance  for loan  and  lease  losses, including controls  over the  evaluation  and  approval  of models, forecast scenarios  and  related  weightings, and  qualitative  reserves. These  procedures  also  included, among  others, testing management's  process  for estimating  the  allowance  for loan and lease losses, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the  loss  forecast models  and  methodology, (ii) evaluating  the reasonableness  of certain macroeconomic variables, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management's development, selection and weighting of lifetime economic forecast scenarios used in the loss forecast models, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of data  used  in  the  estimate, and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves made to the\n\nmodel output results to determine the overall allowance for loan and lease losses. The procedures also included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of certain  loss  forecast models, the  reasonableness  of economic forecast scenarios and  related  weightings  and  the  reasonableness  of certain qualitative reserves.\n\n## Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\n\nAs  described  in  Notes  1  and  20  to  the  consolidated  financial statements, the Corporation carries certain financial instruments at fair value, which includes $10.7 billion of assets and  $7.1  billion  of liabilities  classified  as  Level  3  fair value measurements that are  valued  on  a  recurring  basis  and  $3.4 billion of assets classified as Level 3 fair value measurements that are  valued  on  a  nonrecurring  basis, for which  the determination  of fair value  requires  significant management judgment or estimation. The  Corporation  determines  the  fair value  of Level  3  financial  instruments  using  pricing  models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs, such as  volatility or implied  yield, may be  determined  using quantitative-based  extrapolations, pricing models  or other internal methodologies which incorporate management estimates and available market information.\n\nThe  principal  considerations  for our determination  that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain Level 3  financial  instruments  is  a  critical  audit matter are  the significant judgment and  estimation  used  by management to determine the fair value of these financial instruments, which in turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, including  the  involvement of professionals  with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing  the  matter involved  performing  procedures  and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements. These procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of controls relating  to  the  valuation  of financial  instruments, including controls  related  to  valuation  models, significant unobservable inputs, and  data. These  procedures  also  included, among others, the  involvement of professionals with  specialized  skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these certain financial instruments and comparison of management's estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Developing the independent estimate  involved  testing  the  completeness  and accuracy of data  provided  by management and  evaluating  the reasonableness  of management's  significant unobservable inputs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina February 22, 2023\n\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 1958.",

        "page_content": "## Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles\n\nBank  of America  Corporation, a  bank  holding  company and  a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services  and  products  throughout the  U.S. and  in  certain international  markets. The  term 'the  Corporation' as  used herein  may refer to  Bank  of America  Corporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the  Corporation  and  its  majority-owned  subsidiaries  and  those variable  interest entities  (VIEs) where  the  Corporation  is  the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts  and  transactions have  been  eliminated. Results  of operations  of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the  dates  that the  Corporation  became the primary beneficiary. Assets  held  in  an  agency or fiduciary capacity are not included  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence  over operating  and  financing  decisions using  the  equity method  of accounting. These  investments, which include the Corporation's interests in affordable housing and  renewable  energy partnerships, are  recorded  in  other assets. Equity method  investments  are  subject to  impairment testing, and the Corporation's proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United  States  of America  requires  management to  make estimates  and  assumptions  that affect reported  amounts  and disclosures. Actual  results  could  materially differ from those estimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\n## Hedge Accounting\n\nThe  FASB  issued  a  new  accounting  standard  that makes targeted improvements to the application of the fair value hedge accounting  guidance  for closed  portfolios  of financial  assets. The targeted improvements were effective January 1, 2023 on a prospective basis.\n\n## Financial Instruments -Credit Losses\n\nThe FASB amended the accounting and disclosure requirements for expected credit losses (ECL) by removing the recognition and measurement guidance  on  troubled  debt restructurings  (TDRs) and adding disclosures on the financial effect and subsequent performance  of certain types  of modifications  made  to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The effects of these changes  on  the  Corporation's  consolidated  financial  position, results  of operations  or disclosures  in  the  Notes  to  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  not significant. The amendments  were  effective  on  January 1, 2023, which  the Corporation adopted using a modified retrospective approach.\n\n## Significant Accounting Principles\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in the  process  of collection, cash  segregated  under federal  and other brokerage regulations, and amounts due from correspondent banks, the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  and  certain non-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements.\n\n## Securities Financing Agreements\n\nSecurities  borrowed  or purchased  under agreements  to  resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (securities  financing  agreements) are  treated  as  collateralized financing transactions except in instances where the transaction is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase transactions. Generally, these  agreements  are  recorded  at acquisition  or sale  price  plus  accrued  interest. In  instances where  the  interest is  negative, the  Corporation's  policy is  to present negative interest on financial assets as interest income and negative interest on financial liabilities as interest expense. For securities  financing  agreements  that are  accounted  for under the  fair value  option, the  changes  in  the  fair value  of these  securities  financing  agreements are recorded  in market making and similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe  Corporation's  policy is  to  monitor the  market value  of the  principal  amount loaned  under resale  agreements  and obtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to counterparties when appropriate. Securities financing agreements  do  not create  material  credit risk  due  to  these collateral provisions; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not necessary.\n\nIn transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities  lending  agreement and  receives  securities  that can be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the Consolidated  Balance  Sheet at fair value, representing  the securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return those securities.\n\n## Trading Instruments\n\nFinancial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices for the  same  or similar assets  and  liabilities. If these  market prices  are  not available, fair values  are  estimated  based  on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques  where  the  determination of fair value  may require  significant management judgment or estimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a tradedate  basis. Realized  and  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are recognized in market making and similar activities.\n\n## Derivatives and Hedging Activities\n\nDerivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading or to  support risk  management activities. Derivatives  used  in risk  management activities  include  derivatives  that are  both designated  in  qualifying  accounting  hedge  relationships  and derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are not designated  in  qualifying  accounting  hedge  relationships (referred to as other risk management activities). The Corporation manages  interest rate and  foreign currency exchange  rate  sensitivity predominantly through  the  use  of derivatives. Derivatives  utilized  by the  Corporation  include swaps, futures  and  forward  settlement contracts, and  option contracts.",

        "page_content": "All  derivatives  are  recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet at fair value, taking  into  consideration  the  effects  of legally enforceable  master netting  agreements  that allow  the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded  contracts, fair value  is  based  on  quoted market prices  in  active  or inactive  markets  or is  derived  from observable  market-based  pricing  parameters, similar to  those applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value  is  based  on  dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted  cash  flow  methodologies  or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation.\n\nValuations  of derivative  assets  and  liabilities  reflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values  also  take  into  account the  Corporation's  own  credit standing.\n\n## Trading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities\n\nDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets  or derivative  liabilities  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet with changes in fair value included in market making and similar activities.\n\nDerivatives  used  for other risk  management activities  are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives used  in  other risk  management activities  have  not been designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is  reported  at fair value through earnings so that the effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The changes  in  the  fair value  of derivatives  that serve  to  mitigate certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate  lock  commitments  (IRLCs) and first-lien  mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are  recorded  in  other income. Changes  in  the  fair value  of derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency risk  are  included  in  market making  and  similar activities. Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures. The changes  in  the  fair value  of these  derivatives  are  included  in market making and similar activities and other income.\n\n## Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges)\n\nFor accounting hedges, the  Corporation  formally documents at inception  all  relationships  between  hedging  instruments  and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the  inception  of a  hedge  and  for each  reporting  period thereafter to  assess  whether the  derivative  used  in  an accounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective  in  offsetting  changes  in  the  fair value  or cash flows  of a  hedged  item or forecasted  transaction. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined  that a  derivative  is  not expected  to  be  or has ceased  to  be  highly effective  as  a  hedge, and  then  reflects changes  in  fair value  of the  derivative  in  earnings  after termination of the hedge relationship.\n\nFair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value  of the  Corporation's  assets  and  liabilities  that are attributable  to  interest rate  or foreign  exchange  volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value\n\nhedges  are  recorded  in  earnings, together and  in  the  same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the related  hedged  item. If a  derivative  instrument in  a  fair value hedge  is  terminated  or the  hedge  designation  removed, the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as  other components  of the  carrying  value  of that asset or liability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability.\n\nCash  flow  hedges  are  used  primarily to  minimize  the variability in  cash  flows  of assets  and  liabilities  or forecasted transactions  caused  by interest rate  or foreign  exchange  rate fluctuations. The  Corporation  also  uses  cash  flow  hedges  to hedge  the  price  risk  associated  with  deferred  compensation. Changes  in  the  fair value  of derivatives  used  in  cash  flow hedges  are  recorded  in  accumulated  other comprehensive income  (OCI) and  are  reclassified  into  the  line  item in  the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item affects earnings. Components of a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are  recorded  in  the  same  income  statement line  item as  the hedged item.\n\nNet investment hedges  are  used  to  manage  the  foreign exchange  rate  sensitivity arising  from a  net investment in  a foreign operation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are  recorded  as  a  component of accumulated  OCI. The remaining  components  of these  derivatives  are  excluded  in assessing  hedge  effectiveness  and  are  recorded  in  market making and similar activities.\n\n## Securities\n\nDebt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade  date. Their classification  is  dependent on  the purpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt securities purchased  for use  in  the  Corporation's  trading  activities  are reported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized gains  and  losses  included  in  market making  and  similar activities. Substantially all  other debt securities purchased are used in the Corporation's asset and liability management (ALM) activities  and  are  reported  on  the  Consolidated Balance Sheet as  either debt securities  carried  at fair value  or as  held-tomaturity (HTM) debt securities. Debt securities  carried  at fair value are either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in accumulated OCI or carried  at fair value  with  unrealized  gains  and  losses reported  in  market making  and  similar activities. HTM debt securities are debt securities that management has the intent and  ability to  hold  to  maturity and  are  reported  at amortized cost.\n\nThe Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value has declined below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For AFS  debt securities  the  Corporation  intends  to hold, the  Corporation  evaluates  the  debt securities  for ECL, except for debt securities  that are  guaranteed  by the  U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality where  the  Corporation  applies  a  zero  credit loss assumption. For the  remaining  AFS  debt securities, the Corporation  considers  qualitative  parameters  such  as  internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted  cash  flow  analysis  is  used  by the  Corporation  to",

        "page_content": "determine  if a  portion  of the  unrealized  loss  is  a  result of an ECL. The  Corporation  will  then  recognize  either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense in other income for the  amount necessary to  adjust the  debt securities  valuation allowance  to  its  current estimate  of expected  credit losses. Cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected  are  estimated  using  all relevant information  available  such  as  remaining  payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the  credit loss  may exceed  the  total  decline  in  fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset.\n\nThe Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit losses, of which  substantially all  qualify for the zero  loss  assumption. For the  remaining  securities, the Corporation  performs  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  to estimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses.\n\nInterest on  debt securities, including amortization of premiums  and  accretion  of discounts, is  included  in  interest income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method.\n\nEquity securities  with  readily determinable  fair values  that are not held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized  gains  and  losses  included  in  other income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded  at cost less  impairment, if any, plus  or minus qualifying  observable  price  changes. These  securities  are reported in other assets.\n\n## Loans and Leases\n\nLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value  option, are  measured  at historical  cost and  reported  at their outstanding  principal  balances  net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized  deferred  fees  and  costs  on originated loans, and  for purchased  loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain  direct origination  costs  are  deferred  and  recognized  as adjustments  to  interest income  over the  lives  of the  related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums  are amortized  to  interest income  using  a  level  yield  methodology. The  Corporation  elects  to  account for certain  consumer and commercial  loans  under the  fair value  option  with  interest reported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar activities or other income.\n\nUnder applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and, within  each  portfolio  segment, by class  of financing receivable. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which  an  entity develops  and  documents  a  systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class  of financing  receivable  is  defined  as  the  level  of disaggregation  of portfolio  segments  based  on  the  initial measurement attribute, risk  characteristics  and  methods  for assessing risk. The Corporation's three portfolio segments are Consumer Real  Estate, Credit Card  and  Other Consumer, and Commercial. The  classes  within  the  Consumer Real  Estate portfolio  segment are  residential  mortgage  and  home  equity. The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment are  credit card, direct/indirect consumer and  other\n\nconsumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are  U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial, commercial  real estate, commercial  lease  financing  and  U.S. small  business commercial.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through  a  variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing leases  and  sales-type  leases  are  carried  at the  aggregate  of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income  over the  lease  terms  using  methods  that approximate  the  interest method. Operating  lease  income  is recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis. The  Corporation's  lease arrangements generally do not contain non-lease components.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nOn  January 1, 2020, the  Corporation  adopted  the  new accounting  standard  that requires  the  measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, to be based on management's best estimate of the ECL in the Corporation's loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the  fair value  option. Upon  adoption, a  $3.3  billion, or 32 percent, increase  in  the  allowance  for credit losses  was recorded  on  January 1, 2020, which  was  comprised  of a  net increase  of $2.9  billion in  the  allowance  for loan  and  lease losses and a $310 million increase in the reserve for unfunded lending  commitments. The  ECL  on  funded  consumer and commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contraasset to loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The  ECL  for unfunded  lending  commitments, including  home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and  binding  unfunded  loan  commitments  is  reported  on  the Consolidated  Balance  Sheet in  accrued  expenses  and  other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio  and  unfunded lending commitments is reported in  the  Consolidated  Statement of Income  at the  amount necessary to  adjust the  allowance  for credit losses  to  the current estimate of ECL.\n\nFor loans  and  leases, the  ECL  is  typically estimated  using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical  loss  experience, the  current credit quality of the portfolio  as  well  as  an  economic outlook  over the  life  of the loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the  contractual  maturity of the  loan  adjusted  for any expected prepayments. The  contractual  maturity includes  any extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For openended  products  (e.g., lines  of credit), the  ECL  is  determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws  from credit lines  unless  those  lines  of credit are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the Corporation does not record any allowance.\n\nIn its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates  forward-looking  information  through  the  use  of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These  variables  include, but are  not limited  to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels  and  corporate  bond  spreads. As  any one  economic outlook  is  inherently uncertain, the  Corporation  leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter",

        "page_content": "and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors  including  recent economic events, leading  economic indicators, views  of internal  and  third-party economists  and industry trends.\n\nThe estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a loan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-off.\n\nThe  allowance  for loan  and  lease  losses  for TDRs  is measured  based  on  the  present value  of projected  future lifetime  principal  and  interest cash  flows  discounted  at the loan's  original  effective  interest rate, or in  cases  where foreclosure  is  probable  or the  loan  is  collateral  dependent, at the  loan's  collateral  value  or its  observable  market price, if available. The  measurement of ECL  for the  renegotiated consumer credit card  TDR  portfolio  is  based  on  the  present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average TDR portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in  effect prior to  restructuring. Projected  cash  flows  for TDRs use the same economic outlook as discussed above. For purposes  of computing  this  specific loss  component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool.\n\nAlso included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected  in the quantitative methods  or the economic assumptions described  above. For example, factors  that the  Corporation considers  include  changes  in  lending  policies  and  procedures, business  conditions, the  nature  and  size  of the  portfolio, portfolio  concentrations, the  volume  and  severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as  competition, and legal  and  regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in  quantitative  models  that are  built on  historical data.\n\nWith the exception of the Corporation's credit card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable in  the  measurement of the  allowance  for credit losses  as  the Corporation generally classifies consumer loans as nonperforming  at 90  days past due  and  reverses  interest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the Corporation  reserves  for interest and  fees  as  part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line  item where it was originally recorded.\n\nThe  Corporation  has  identified  the  following  three  portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nTo estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential real estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over the  life  of the  existing  portfolio, after factoring  in estimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling methodologies. The  attributes  that are  most significant in estimating the Corporation's ECL include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all  of which  are  further broken  down  by present collection  status  (whether the  loan  is  current, delinquent, in default, or in  bankruptcy). The  estimates  are  based  on  the\n\nCorporation's  historical  experience  with  the  loan  portfolio, adjusted  to  reflect the  economic outlook. The  outlook  on  the unemployment rate  and  consumer real  estate  prices  are  key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The  Corporation  does  not reserve  for credit losses  on  the unpaid  principal  balance  of loans  insured  by the  Federal Housing  Administration  (FHA) and  long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the  undrawn  portion  of the  Corporation's  HELOCs, which  can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above  and  incorporate  utilization  assumptions  at time  of default.\n\nFor loans  that are  more  than  180  days past due  and collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral securing  these  loans  is  generally determined  using  an automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a property by reference  to  market data  including  sales  of comparable  properties  and  price  trends  specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation  utilizes  publicized  indices  or if these  methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price  opinions  to  estimate  the  fair value  of the collateral. While  there  is  inherent imprecision  in  these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are representative of this portfolio in the aggregate.\n\nFor loans  that are  more  than  180  days past due  and collateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the Corporation's fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans  that is  in  excess  of the  estimated  property value  after adjusting  for costs  to  sell  is  charged  off. If the  estimated property value  decreases  in  periods  subsequent to  the  initial charge-off, the  Corporation  will  record  an  additional  charge-off; however, if the  value  increases  in  periods  subsequent to  the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a level above the cumulative chargeoff amount.\n\n## Credit Cards and Other Consumer\n\nCredit cards  are  revolving  lines  of credit without a  defined maturity date. The estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined  by estimating  the  amount and  timing  of expected future payments  (e.g., borrowers  making  full  payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will  take for a  receivable  balance  to  pay off. The  ECL  on  the  future payments  incorporates  the  spending  behavior of a  borrower through  time  using  key borrower-specific factors  and  the economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected  payments  in  accordance  with  the  Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and  Disclosure  Act of 2009  (i.e., paying  down  the  highest interest rate  bucket first). Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance  until  it is  brought to  zero  or an  expected  charge-off amount. Unemployment rate  outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all  key inputs  into  the  credit card  receivable  loss  forecasting  model. Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable.\n\nThe  ECL  for the  consumer vehicle  lending  portfolio  is  also determined  using  quantitative  methods  supplemented  with",

        "page_content": "qualitative  analysis. The  quantitative  model  estimates  ECL giving  consideration  to  key borrower and  loan  characteristics such  as  delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV  ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe ECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate  credit losses  over the  loan's  contractual  life  at an individual  loan  level. The models use the contractual terms to forecast future  principal  cash  flows  while  also  considering expected  prepayments. For open-ended  commitments  such  as revolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower's draw and payment behavior over the remaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source  of repayment, the  loss  forecasting  models consider key loan  and  customer attributes  such  as  LTV  ratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such  as  rent levels  and  vacancy rates, which  impact the  ECL estimate. For all  other commercial loans and leases, the  loss forecasting  model  determines  the  probabilities  of transition  to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower's current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The  severity of loss  is  determined  based  on  the  type  of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower's  industry sector, any guarantors  and  the  geographic market. Assumptions  of expected  loss  are  conditioned  to  the economic outlook, and  the  model  considers  key economic variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, corporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns.\n\nIn  addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation  also  estimates  ECL  related  to  unfunded  lending commitments  such  as  letters  of credit, financial  guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding  commitments  accounted  for under the  fair value option. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using the  same  models  and  methodologies  as  the  funded  exposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments.\n\n## Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies\n\nNonperforming  loans  and  leases  generally include  loans  and leases  that have  been  placed  on  nonaccrual  status. Loans accounted  for under the  fair value  option  and  LHFS  are  not reported as nonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed uncollectible, it is  charged  off against the  allowance  for credit losses. If the charged-off amount is later recovered, the amount is  reversed  through  the  allowance  for credit losses  at the recovery date. Charge-offs  are  reported  net of recoveries  (net charge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than chargeoffs, net charge-offs are reported as a negative amount.\n\nIn accordance with the Corporation's policies, consumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are  generally placed  on  nonaccrual  status  and classified  as  nonperforming  at 90  days  past due  unless repayment of the  loan  is  insured  by the  FHA  or through individually insured  long-term standby agreements  with  Fannie Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not\n\nplaced on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien  home  equity loans  are  placed  on nonaccrual  status  and  classified  as  nonperforming  when  the underlying  first-lien  mortgage  loan  becomes  90  days  past due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real  estate-secured  loans  that is  in  excess  of the  estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within 60  days  of receipt of notification  of filing, with  the  remaining balance classified as nonperforming.\n\nCredit card  and  other unsecured  consumer loans  are charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification  of death  or bankruptcy or upon  confirmation  of fraud. These  loans  continue  to  accrue interest until  they are  charged  off and, therefore, are  not reported  as  nonperforming  loans. Consumer vehicle  loans  are placed  on  nonaccrual  status  when  they become 90 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans are charged off to their collateral values when the loans become 120 days past due, upon repossession of the  collateral, within  60  days after receipt of notification  of bankruptcy or death  or upon confirmation  of fraud. If repossession  of the  collateral  is  not expected, the loans are fully charged off.\n\nCommercial  loans  and  leases, excluding  business  card loans, that are  past due  90  days  or more  as  to  principal  or interest, or where  reasonable  doubt exists  as  to  timely collection, including  loans  that are  individually identified  as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified  as  nonperforming  unless  well-secured  and  in  the process of collection.\n\nBusiness card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.\n\nThe entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received  by the  specified  due  date  on  the  customer's  billing statement. Interest and  fees  continue  to  accrue  on  past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued  interest receivable  is  reversed when  loans  and  leases  are  placed  on  nonaccrual  status. Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income  when  received. Loans  and  leases  may be  restored  to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected.\n\n## Troubled Debt Restructurings\n\nConsumer and commercial loans and leases whose contractual terms  have  been  restructured  in  a  manner that grants  a concession to a borrower experiencing financial  difficulties  are classified  as  TDRs. Concessions  could  include  a  reduction  in the  interest rate  to  a  rate  that is  below  market on  the  loan, payment extensions, forgiveness  of principal, forbearance  or other actions designed to maximize collections. Loans that are carried at fair value and LHFS are not classified as TDRs.\n\nLoans  and  leases  whose  contractual  terms  have  been modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring may remain  on  accrual  status  if there  is  demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the  restructured  terms  is  expected. Otherwise, the  loans  are",

        "page_content": "placed  on  nonaccrual  status  and  reported  as  nonperforming, except for fully-insured consumer real estate loans, until there is sustained  repayment performance  for a  reasonable  period, generally six months. If accruing  TDRs  cease  to  perform in accordance  with  their modified  contractual  terms, they are placed  on  nonaccrual  status  and  reported  as  nonperforming TDRs.\n\nSecured  consumer loans  that have  been  discharged  in Chapter 7  bankruptcy and  have  not been  reaffirmed  by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge. Such loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell no later than at the time  of discharge. If these  loans  are  contractually current, interest collections are generally recorded in interest income on a cash basis. Consumer real  estate-secured loans for which a binding  offer to  restructure  has  been  extended  are  also classified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans that have been renegotiated in a TDR generally remain on accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off, which occurs no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due or, for loans that have been placed on a fixed payment plan, 120 days past due.\n\nA  loan  that had  previously been  modified  in  a  TDR  and  is subsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nLoans  that the  Corporation  intends  to  sell  in  the  foreseeable future, including  residential  mortgages, loan  syndications, and to  a  lesser degree, commercial  real  estate, consumer finance and  other loans, are  reported  as  LHFS  and  are  carried  at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on  nonaccrual  status  and  are  reported  as  nonperforming, as defined  in  the  policy herein, are  reported  separately from nonperforming loans and leases.\n\n## Premises and Equipment\n\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation  and  amortization. Depreciation  and  amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture  and  equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements .\n\n## Other Assets\n\nFor the  Corporation's  financial  assets  that are  measured  at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates  these  assets  for ECL  using  various  techniques. For assets  that are  subject to  collateral  maintenance  provisions, including  federal  funds  sold  and  securities  borrowed  or purchased  under agreements  to  resell, where  the  collateral consists  of daily margining  of liquid  and  marketable  assets where  the  margining  is  expected  to  be  maintained  into  the foreseeable  future, the  expected  losses  are  assumed  to  be zero. For all  other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative analyses, including  consideration  of historical  losses  and current economic conditions, to  estimate  any ECL  which  are\n\nthen  included  in  a  valuation  account that is  recorded  as  a contra-asset against the  amortized  cost basis  of the  financial asset.\n\n## Lessee Arrangements\n\nSubstantially all  of the  Corporation's  lessee  arrangements  are operating  leases. Under these  arrangements, the  Corporation records  right-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities  at lease commencement. Right-of-use  assets  are  reported  in  other assets  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet, and  the  related lease  liabilities  are  reported  in  accrued  expenses  and  other liabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which  the  Corporation  made  the  short-term lease  election. Lease  expense  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over the lease  term and  is  recorded  in  occupancy and  equipment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe  Corporation  made  an  accounting  policy election  not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases. As such, lease  payments  represent payments  on  both  lease  and non-lease components. At lease commencement, lease liabilities  are  recognized  based  on  the  present value  of the remaining lease payments and discounted using the Corporation's  incremental  borrowing  rate. Right-of-use  assets initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made  prior to  lease  commencement and  for any lease incentives.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill  is  the  purchase  premium after adjusting  for the  fair value  of net assets acquired. Goodwill is  not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting  unit level. A  reporting  unit is  a  business  segment or one level below a business segment.\n\nThe  Corporation  assesses  the  fair value  of each  reporting unit against its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the  Corporation  utilizes  allocated  equity as  a  proxy for the carrying  value  of its  reporting  units. Allocated  equity in  the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill  and  intangibles  specifically assigned to the reporting unit.\n\nIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation  first assesses  qualitative  factors  to  determine whether it is  more  likely than  not that the  fair value  of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors include, among  other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and  market considerations, financial  performance  of the  respective  reporting  unit and  other relevant entity-  and reporting-unit specific considerations.\n\nIf the  Corporation  concludes  it is  more  likely than  not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is  performed. The Corporation has an unconditional  option  to  bypass  the  qualitative  assessment for any reporting  unit in  any period  and  proceed  directly to performing  the  quantitative  goodwill  impairment test. The Corporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.\n\nWhen  performing  the  quantitative  assessment, if the  fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the  reporting  unit would  not be  considered  impaired. If the carrying  value  of the  reporting  unit exceeds  its  fair value, a goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by",

        "page_content": "which the reporting unit's allocated equity exceeds its fair value. An  impairment loss  recognized  cannot exceed  the  amount of goodwill  assigned  to  a  reporting  unit. An  impairment loss establishes  a  new  basis  in  the  goodwill, and  subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance.\n\nFor intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the  asset. Intangible  assets  deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nA  VIE  is  an  entity that lacks  equity investors  or whose  equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The Corporation consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and  an  obligation  to  absorb  losses  or the  right to  receive benefits  that could  potentially be  significant to  the  VIE. On  a quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its involvement with the  VIE  and  evaluates  the  impact of changes  in  governing documents  and  its  financial  interests  in  the  VIE. The consolidation  status  of the  VIEs  with  which  the  Corporation  is involved may change as a result of such reassessments.\n\nThe  Corporation  primarily uses  VIEs  for its  securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is the  servicer of whole  loans  held  in  a  securitization  trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation generally does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holds substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The  power to  direct the  most significant activities  of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special  servicer or by the  party holding  specific subordinate securities which embody certain controlling rights. The Corporation  consolidates  a  whole-loan  securitization  trust if it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds  securities  issued  by the  trust or has  other contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.\n\nThe Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and  AFS  securities  into  municipal  bond  or resecuritization trusts. The  Corporation  consolidates  a  municipal  bond  or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust's liabilities or, if there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design of the  trust, including  the  identification  of securities  to  be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also  retains  securities  or has  liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one  or a  limited  number of third-party investors  share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant activities  of the  trust through  liquidation  or other substantive rights.\n\nOther VIEs  used  by the  Corporation  include  collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf of customers  and  other investment vehicles. The  Corporation does  not routinely serve  as  collateral  manager for CDOs and, therefore, does  not typically have  the  power to  direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a  CDO  and  acquires  the  power to  manage  its  assets, the Corporation consolidates the CDO.\n\nThe Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the  vehicle, derivative  contracts  or other arrangements. The Corporation  does  not consolidate  an  investment vehicle  if a single  investor controlled  the  initial  design  of the  vehicle  or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle.\n\nRetained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair value. In  addition, the  Corporation  may invest in  debt securities  issued  by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets. Generally, quoted market prices  for retained  residual  interests are  not available; therefore, the  Corporation  estimates  fair values based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nThe  Corporation  measures  the  fair values  of its  assets  and liabilities, where  applicable, in  accordance  with  accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price. Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable  inputs  and  minimize  the  use  of unobservable inputs  in  measuring  fair value. Under applicable  accounting standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets  and  the  lowest priority given  to  unobservable  inputs. The  Corporation  categorizes  its  fair value  measurements  of financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy.\n\nLevel 1 Unadjusted  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for identical  assets  or liabilities. Level  1  assets  and liabilities include  debt and  equity securities  and derivative  contracts  that are  traded  in  an  active exchange  market, as  well  as  certain  U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in OTC markets.\n\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted  prices  for similar assets  or liabilities, quoted prices  in  markets  that are  not active, or other inputs that are  observable  or can  be  corroborated  by observable market data for substantially the  full  term of the  assets  or liabilities. Level  2  assets  and liabilities  include  debt securities  with  quoted  prices that are  traded  less  frequently than  exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes  U.S. government and",

Level  3  assets and  liabilities  include  financial  instruments  for which the  determination  of fair value  requires  significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value for such  assets  and  liabilities  is  generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  that incorporate the  assumptions  a  market participant would  use  in pricing  the  asset or liability. This  category generally includes  retained  residual  interests  in  securitizations, consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated  derivative  contracts, certain loans  and  LHFS, IRLCs  and  certain  CDOs  where independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThere are two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results  from changes  in  deferred  tax assets  and  liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the  future  because  of future  reversals  of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws  and  their bases  as  reported  in  the  financial statements. Deferred  tax assets  are  also  recognized  for tax attributes  such  as  net operating  loss  carryforwards  and  tax credit carryforwards. Valuation  allowances  are  recorded  to reduce  deferred  tax assets  to  the  amounts  management concludes are more likely than not to be realized.\n\nIncome  tax benefits  are  recognized  and  measured  based upon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than not to  be  sustained  upon  settlement. The  difference  between the  benefit recognized  and  the  tax benefit claimed  on  a  tax return  is  referred  to  as  an  unrecognized  tax benefit. The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe following summarizes the Corporation's revenue recognition accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities.\n\n## Card Income\n\nCard income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as interchange, cash  advances  and  other miscellaneous  items from credit and  debit card  transactions  and  from processing card transactions for merchants. Card income is presented net of direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the  credit and  debit card  payment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit cards and  fixed rates for debit cards based  on  the corresponding  payment network's  rates. Substantially all  card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12  months. Fees  charged  to  cardholders  and  merchants  that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance\n\nfor loan  and  lease  losses. Included in  direct cost are  rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders are  related  to  points  earned  by the  cardholder that can  be redeemed  for a  broad  range  of rewards  including  cash, travel and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on  past redemption  behavior, card  product type, account transaction  activity and  other historical  card  performance. The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part of the  revenue-sharing  agreements, the  credit card  partner provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card  partner's  members  or customers  on  behalf of the Corporation.\n\n## Service Charges\n\nService  charges  include  deposit and  lending-related  fees. Deposit-related  fees  consist of fees  earned  on  consumer and commercial deposit activities and are generally recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer fees  are  earned  on  consumer deposit accounts  for account maintenance  and  various  transaction-based  services, such  as ATM transactions, wire  transfer activities, check  and  money order processing  and  insufficient funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial  deposit-related  fees  are  from the  Corporation's Global Transaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit and  treasury management services, including  account maintenance  and  other services, such  as  payroll, sweep account and other cash management services. Lending-related fees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs.\n\n## Investment and Brokerage Services\n\nInvestment and brokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are earned  from the  management of client assets  under advisory agreements or the full  discretion  of the Corporation's financial advisors (collectively referred  to  as  assets  under management (AUM)). Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of the client's AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps) to 150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain a client's investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\n\nBrokerage  fees  include  income  earned  from transactionbased  services  that are  performed  as  part of investment management services and are based on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees also  include  distribution  fees  and  sales  commissions  that are primarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in the Global  Markets segment, brokerage  fees  are  earned  when  the Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial products  or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles  and  clears transactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate  clearing  broker. Certain  customers  pay brokerage, clearing  and/or exchange  fees  imposed  by relevant regulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These fees are recorded net and are not reflected  in  the  transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\n\n## Investment Banking Income\n\nInvestment banking  income  includes  underwriting  income  and financial advisory services income. Underwriting consists of fees",

The  revenue  is  generally earned  based  on  a percentage  of the  fixed  number of shares  or principal  placed. Once  the  number of shares  or notes  is  determined  and  the service is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs, in  performing  these  services. These  expenses  are recovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the customer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication fees  represent fees  earned  as  the  agent or lead  lender responsible for structuring, arranging  and  administering  a  loan syndication.\n\nFinancial  advisory services  consist of fees  earned  for assisting  clients  with  transactions  related  to  mergers  and acquisitions and  financial restructurings. Revenue  varies depending on the size of the transaction and scope of services performed and is generally contingent on successful completion of the  transaction. Revenue  is  typically recognized  once  the transaction is completed and all services have been rendered. Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the client.\n\n## Other Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies\n\nThe  Corporation  did  not disclose  the  value  of any open performance  obligations  at December 31, 2022, as  its contracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less than one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is less than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to recognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice.\n\n## Earnings Per Common Share\n\nEarnings per common share (EPS) is  computed by dividing net income  allocated  to  common  shareholders  by the  weightedaverage  common  shares  outstanding, excluding  unvested\n\ncommon  shares  subject to  repurchase  or cancellation. Net income  allocated  to  common  shareholders  is  net income adjusted  for preferred  stock  dividends  including  dividends declared, accretion  of discounts  on  preferred  stock  including accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income  allocated  to  common  shareholders  plus  dividends  on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be  tendered  to  exercise  warrants, by the  weighted-average common  shares  outstanding  plus  amounts  representing  the dilutive  effect of stock  options  outstanding, restricted  stock, restricted  stock  units  (RSUs), outstanding  warrants  and  the dilution  resulting  from the  conversion  of convertible  preferred stock, if applicable.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nAssets, liabilities  and  operations  of foreign  branches  and subsidiaries  are  recorded  based  on  the  functional  currency of each entity. When the functional currency of a foreign operation is  the  local  currency, the assets, liabilities  and  operations  are translated, for consolidation  purposes, from the  local  currency to  the  U.S. dollar reporting  currency at period-end  rates  for assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations. The  resulting  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are reported as a component of accumulated OCI, net-of-tax. When the  foreign  entity's  functional  currency is  the  U.S. dollar, the resulting  remeasurement gains  or losses  on  foreign  currencydenominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings.",

(ISDA) master netting  agreements  or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation's derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to  liquidate  securities  held  as  collateral and  to  offset receivables  and  payables  with  the  same counterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation offsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement.\n\nThe following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\n\nSheet at December 31, 2022 and 2021 by primary risk  (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross  basis, prior to  the  application  of counterparty and  cash collateral  netting. Total  gross  derivative  assets  and  liabilities are  adjusted  on  an  aggregate  basis  to  take  into  consideration the  effects  of legally enforceable  master netting  agreements, which include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.\n\nFor more  information  on  offsetting  of securities  financing agreements, see Note  10  -  Securities  Financing  Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash .",

Interest rate, foreign  exchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts  are  utilized  in  the  Corporation's  ALM and risk management activities.\n\nThe Corporation  maintains  an  overall  interest rate  risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which  are  generally non-leveraged  generic interest rate  and  basis  swaps, options, futures  and  forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest rate  fluctuations, hedged  fixed-rate  assets  and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on  the  derivative  instruments  that are  linked  to  the  hedged fixed-rate  assets  and  liabilities  are  expected  to  substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.\n\nMarket risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business is the  risk  that values  of mortgage  assets  or revenues  will  be adversely affected  by changes  in  market conditions  such  as interest rate  movements. To  mitigate  the  interest rate  risk  in mortgage  banking  production  income, the  Corporation  utilizes\n\nforward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments, including  purchased  options, and  certain  debt securities. The  Corporation  also  utilizes  derivatives  such  as interest rate  options, interest rate  swaps, forward  settlement contracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks of MSRs.\n\nThe Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the  foreign  exchange  risk  associated  with  certain  foreign currency-denominated  assets  and  liabilities, as  well  as  the Corporation's investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure to loss  on  these  contracts  will  increase  or decrease  over their respective  lives  as  currency exchange  and  interest rates fluctuate.\n\nThe  Corporation  purchases  credit derivatives  to  manage credit risk  related  to  certain  funded  and  unfunded  credit exposures. Credit derivatives  include  credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.\n\n## Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges\n\nThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value  of its  assets  and  liabilities  due  to  fluctuations  in interest rates  and  foreign  exchange  rates  (fair value  hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts  to  protect against changes in the cash flows of its  assets and liabilities,",

These  net losses  reclassified  into  earnings  are  expected\n\nto  primarily decrease  net interest income  related  to  the respective  hedged  items. For open  cash  flow  hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the forecasted transactions will be recognized in interest income is approximately five years, with  the  aggregated  amount beyond  this  time  period  being insignificant.\n\n## Gains and Losses on Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges\n\n|                                                     | Gains (Losses)

The  table  below  presents  gains (losses) on these derivatives for 2022, 2021 and 2020. These gains  (losses) are  largely offset by the  income  or expense recorded on the hedged item.\n\n## Gains and Losses on Other Risk Management Derivatives\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                                      | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Interest rate risk on mortgage activities  (1, 2)                                          | $ (326) | $  (18) | $  611  |\n| Credit risk on loans  (2)                                                                  | (37)    | (25)    | (68)    |\n| Interest rate and foreign currency risk on  asset and liability management activities  (3) | 4,713   | 1,757   | (2,971) |\n| Price risk on certain compensation plans  (4)                                              | (1,073) | 917     | 700     |\n\n## Transfers  of  Financial  Assets  with  Risk  Retained through Derivatives\n\nThe  Corporation  enters  into  certain  transactions  involving  the transfer of financial  assets  that are  accounted  for as  sales where  substantially all of the  economic exposure  to  the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had transferred $4.8 billion of nonU.S. government-guaranteed  mortgage-backed  securities  to  a third-party trust and  retained  economic exposure  to  the transferred  assets  through  derivative  contracts. In  connection with  these  transfers, the  Corporation  received  gross  cash proceeds of $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion at the transfer dates. At December 31, 2022 and  2021, the  fair value  of the transferred securities was $4.7 billion and $5.0 billion.\n\n## Sales and Trading Revenue\n\nThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets  and  liabilities. It is  the  Corporation's  policy to include  these  derivative  instruments  in  its  trading  activities, which  include  derivatives  and  non-derivative  cash  instruments. The  resulting  risk  from these  derivatives  is  managed  on  a portfolio  basis  as  part of the  Corporation's Global  Markets business  segment. The  related  sales  and  trading  revenue generated within Global Markets is  recorded  in  various  income statement line  items, including  market making  and  similar activities  and  net interest income  as  well  as  other revenue categories.\n\nSales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which  the  trading  desk  can  execute  the  trade  in  the  dealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the 'Other' column in the Sales and Trading  Revenue  table. Changes  in  the  fair value  of these securities are included in market making and similar activities. For debt securities, revenue, with  the  exception  of interest associated  with  the  debt securities, is  typically included  in market making  and  similar activities. Unlike  commissions  for equity securities, the  initial  revenue  related  to  broker-dealer\n\nservices for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this  revenue  is  recorded  in  market making and similar activities  as  part of the  initial  mark  to  fair value. For derivatives, the  majority of revenue  is  included  in market making and similar activities. In transactions where the Corporation  acts  as  agent, which  include  exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income.\n\nThe  table  below, which  includes  both  derivatives  and  nonderivative  cash  instruments, identifies  the  amounts in  the respective  income  statement line  items  attributable  to  the Corporation's  sales  and  trading  revenue  in Global  Markets , categorized  by primary risk, for 2022, 2021  and  2020.

Credit derivatives  derive  value  based  on  an underlying  third-party referenced  obligation  or a  portfolio  of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the  seller of credit protection, to  make  payments  to  a  buyer upon  the  occurrence  of a  predefined  credit event. Such credit events  generally include  bankruptcy of the  referenced  credit entity and  failure  to  pay under the  obligation, as  well  as acceleration  of indebtedness  and  payment repudiation  or moratorium. For credit derivatives  based  on  a  portfolio  of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has",

However, the  Corporation  does  not monitor its exposure  to  credit derivatives  based  solely on  the  notional  amount because  this measure  does  not take  into  consideration  the  probability of occurrence. As  such, the  notional  amount is  not a  reliable\n\nindicator of the  Corporation's  exposure  to  these  contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish  limits  so  that certain  credit risk-related  losses  occur within acceptable, predefined limits.\n\nCredit-related notes in the preceding table include investments  in  securities  issued  by CDO, collateralized  loan",

        "page_content": "obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments  are  primarily classified  as  trading  securities. The carrying  value  of these  instruments  equals  the  Corporation's maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make  any payments  to  the  entities  under the  terms  of the securities owned.\n\n## Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral\n\nThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of non-financial  companies. A  significant majority of the derivative  transactions  are  executed  on  a  daily margin  basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on  the  ultimate  rating  level) or a  breach  of credit covenants would  typically require  an  increase  in  the  amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation  to  take  additional  protective  measures  such  as early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed on  page  152, the  Corporation  enters  into  legally enforceable master netting  agreements  that reduce  risk  by permitting closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\nCertain  of the  Corporation's  derivative  contracts  contain credit risk-related  contingent features, primarily in  the  form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation  that enhance  the  creditworthiness  of these instruments  compared  to  other obligations  of the  respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well  as  its  counterparties  with  respect to  changes  in  the Corporation's creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the  derivative  transactions. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the  Corporation  held  cash  and  securities  collateral  of $101.3 billion and $91.4 billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $81.2 billion and $79.3 billion in the normal course of business  under derivative  agreements, excluding  crossproduct margining  agreements  where  clients  are  permitted  to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements.\n\nIn connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional  collateral  or to  terminate  transactions  with  certain counterparties in the event of a  downgrade of the  senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional  collateral  required  depends  on  the  contract and  is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had  not yet posted  to  counterparties  was  $3.2  billion, including $1.6 billion for Bank of America, National Association (BANA).\n\nSome  counterparties  are  currently able  to  unilaterally terminate  certain  contracts, or the  Corporation  or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable  replacement or obtain  a  guarantee. At December 31, 2022  and  2021, the  liability recorded  for these  derivative contracts was not significant.\n\nThe  following  table  presents  the  amount of additional collateral that would  have  been  contractually required  by\n\nderivative contracts and other trading agreements at December 31, 2022 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings  for the  Corporation  or certain subsidiaries  by one  incremental  notch  and  by an  additional second  incremental  notch. The  table  also  presents  derivative liabilities  that would  be  subject to  unilateral  termination  by counterparties  upon  downgrade of the  Corporation's  or certain subsidiaries' long-term senior debt ratings.\n\n## Additional Collateral Required to be Posted and Derivative Liabilities Subject to Unilateral Termination Upon Downgrade at December 31, 2022\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                    | One Incremental  Notch   | Second Incremental  Notch   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Additional collateral required to be posted  upon downgrade              |                          |                             |\n| Bank of America Corporation                                              | $  230                   | $  913                      |\n| Bank of America, N.A. and subsidiaries  (1)                              | 66                       | 668                         |\n| Derivative liabilities subject to unilateral  termination upon downgrade |                          |                             |\n| Derivative liabilities                                                   | $  92                    | $  1,073                    |\n| Collateral posted                                                        | 77                       | 300                         |\n\n## Valuation Adjustments on Derivatives\n\nThe Corporation  records  credit risk  valuation  adjustments  on derivatives  in  order to  properly reflect the  credit quality of the counterparties  and  its  own  credit quality. The  Corporation calculates  valuation  adjustments  on  derivatives  based  on  a modeled  expected  exposure  that incorporates  current market risk  factors. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as enforceable master netting  agreements and collateral. CDS  spread  data  is  used  to  estimate  the  default probabilities  and  severities  that are  applied  to  the  exposures. Where  no  observable  credit default data  is  available  for counterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and other market data to estimate default probabilities and severity.\n\nThe table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives (excluding the effect of any related  hedge  activities), which  are  recorded  in  market making and similar activities, for 2022, 2021 and 2020. CVA gains  reduce  the  cumulative  CVA  thereby increasing  the derivative  assets  balance. DVA  gains  increase  the  cumulative DVA  thereby decreasing  the  derivative  liabilities  balance. CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the  derivative  assets  balance. FVA  gains  related  to  derivative liabilities  increase  the  cumulative  FVA  thereby decreasing  the derivative  liabilities  balance. FVA  losses  have  the  opposite impact.\n\n## Valuation Adjustments Gains (Losses) on Derivatives (1)\n\n| (Dollars in millions)               | 2022   | 2021   | 2020     |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Derivative assets (CVA)             | $ (80) | $  208 | $  (118) |\n| Derivative assets/liabilities (FVA) | 125    | (2)    | (24)     |\n| Derivative liabilities (DVA)        | 194    | 3      | 24       |",

December 31, 2022 and 2021, providing full credit protection on residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All  of these loans are individually insured, and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans.\n\n## Nonperforming Loans and Leases\n\nCommercial  nonperforming  loans  decreased  to  $1.1  billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.6 billion at December 31, 2021, as paydowns and returns to performing status more than offset new downgrades to nonaccrual status. Consumer nonperforming loans  decreased  to  $2.8  billion  at December 31, 2022  from\n\n$3.0 billion at December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases from consumer real  estate  loan  sales, partially offset by increases  from loans  whose  prior-period  deferrals  expired  and were modified in TDRs during the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe following table presents the Corporation's nonperforming loans  and  leases, including  nonperforming  TDRs, and  loans accruing past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Nonperforming  LHFS  are  excluded  from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value.

For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 Summary  of Significant Accounting  Principles. Within the Consumer Real  Estate  portfolio  segment, the  primary credit quality indicators  are  refreshed  LTV  and  refreshed  Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing  the  loan, refreshed  quarterly. Home equity loans  are evaluated using CLTV, which measures the carrying value of the Corporation's loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO  score  measures  the  creditworthiness  of the  borrower based  on  the  financial  obligations  of the  borrower and  the borrower's  credit history. FICO  scores  are  typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have  their FICO  scores  updated. FICO  scores  are  also  a\n\nprimary credit quality indicator for the  Credit Card  and  Other Consumer portfolio  segment and  the  business  card  portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio  segment, loans  are  evaluated  using  the  internal classifications  of pass  rated  or reservable  criticized  as  the primary credit quality indicators. The  term reservable  criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed  by the  Corporation  as  Special  Mention, Substandard  or Doubtful, which  are  asset quality categories  defined  by regulatory authorities. These  assets  have  an  elevated  level  of risk  and  may have  a  high  probability of default or total  loss. Pass  rated  refers  to  all  loans  not considered  reservable criticized. In  addition  to  these  primary credit quality indicators, the  Corporation  uses  other credit quality indicators  for certain types of loans.\n\nThe following tables present certain credit quality indicators and  gross  charge-offs  for the  Corporation's  Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card  and  Other Consumer, and  Commercial portfolio  segments  by year of origination, except for revolving loans  and  revolving  loans  that were  modified  into  term loans, which are shown on an aggregate basis at December 31, 2022.",

        "page_content": "During 2022, commercial credit quality showed some signs of stabilization. Commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure  decreased  to  $19.3  billion at December 31, 2022 from $22.4 billion (to 3.12 percent from 3.91 percent of total commercial  reservable  utilized  exposure) at December 31, 2021, which was broad-based across industries.\n\n## Troubled Debt Restructurings\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nModifications  of consumer real  estate  loans  are  classified  as TDRs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a  concession  has  been  granted. Concessions  may include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal  and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal  and/or interest forgiveness, or combinations  thereof. Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into  trial  modifications  with  certain  borrowers  under both government and  proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally represent a  three-  to  four-month  period  during  which the  borrower makes  monthly payments  under the  anticipated modified  payment terms. Upon  successful  completion  of the trial  period, the  Corporation  and  the  borrower enter into  a permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.\n\nConsumer real estate loans of $211 million that have been discharged  in  Chapter 7  bankruptcy with  no  change  in\n\nrepayment terms  and  not reaffirmed  by the  borrower were included in TDRs at December 31, 2022, of which $53 million were  classified  as  nonperforming  and  $33  million were  loans fully insured.\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, remaining commitments to  lend  additional  funds  to  debtors  whose  terms  have  been modified  in  a  consumer real  estate  TDR  were  not significant. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $121 million and  $101  million at December 31, 2022 and  2021. The carrying  value  of consumer real  estate  loans, including  fullyinsured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process  at December 31, 2022  and  2021  was  $871  million and  $1.1  billion. During  2022  and  2021, the  Corporation reclassified  $190  million  and  $64  million  of consumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon  foreclosure  of certain government-guaranteed  loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The reclassifications  represent non-cash  investing  activities  and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nThe  table  below  presents  the  December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates of consumer real estate loans that were modified in TDRs during 2022, 2021 and 2020. The  following  Consumer Real  Estate  portfolio  segment tables include  loans  that were  initially classified  as  TDRs  during  the period  and  also  loans  that had  previously been  classified  as TDRs and were modified again during the period.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate - TDRs Entered into During 2022, 2021 and 2020\n\n|                       | Unpaid  Principal  Balance   | Carrying  Value   | Pre- Modification  Interest Rate   | Post- Modification  Interest Rate (1)   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions) | December 31, 2022            | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022                  | December 31, 2022                       |\n| Residential mortgage  | $ 1,144                      | $ 1,015           | 3.52 %                             | 3.40 %                                  |\n| Home equity           | 238                          | 191               | 4.61                               | 4.65                                    |\n| Total                 | $ 1,382                      | $ 1,206           | 3.71                               | 3.62                                    |\n|                       | December 31, 2021            | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2021                  | December 31, 2021                       |\n| Residential mortgage  | $  891                       | $  788            | 3.48 %                             | 3.38 %                                  |\n| Home equity           | 107                          | 77                | 3.60                               | 3.59                                    |\n| Total                 | $  998                       | $  865            | 3.49                               | 3.41                                    |\n|                       | December 31, 2020            | December 31, 2020 | December 31, 2020                  | December 31, 2020                       |\n| Residential mortgage  | $  732                       | $  646            | 3.66 %                             | 3.59 %                                  |\n| Home equity           | 87                           | 69                | 3.67                               | 3.61                                    |\n| Total                 | $  819                       | $  715            | 3.66                               | 3.59                                    |\n\nThe table below presents the December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 carrying value for consumer real  estate  loans  that were modified in a TDR during 2022, 2021 and 2020, by type of modification.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate - Modification Programs\n\n|                                              | TDRs Entered into During   | TDRs Entered into During   | TDRs Entered into During   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                        | 2022                       | 2021                       | 2020                       |\n| Modifications under government programs      | $ 2                        | $  4                       | $  13                      |\n| Modifications under proprietary programs     | 1,100                      | 774                        | 570                        |\n| Loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (1) | 14                         | 33                         | 53                         |\n| Trial modifications                          | 90                         | 54                         | 79                         |\n| Total modifications                          | $ 1,206                    | $  865                     | $  715                     |\n\nThe following table presents the carrying value of consumer real estate loans that entered into payment default during 2022, 2021 and 2020 that were modified in a TDR during the 12 months preceding payment default.

Credit card  and  other consumer loan  modifications  generally involve  reducing  the  interest rate  on  the  account, placing  the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the customer's available line of credit, all of which are considered  TDRs. The  Corporation  makes  loan  modifications directly with  borrowers  for debt held  only by the  Corporation (internal  programs). Additionally, the  Corporation  makes  loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation\n\nagencies that provide solutions to customers' entire unsecured debt structures (external  programs). The Corporation classifies other secured  consumer loans  that have  been  discharged  in Chapter 7  bankruptcy as  TDRs, which  are  written  down  to collateral  value  and  placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge.\n\nThe  table  below  provides  information  on  the  Corporation's Credit Card  and  Other Consumer TDR  portfolio  including  the December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 unpaid principal balance, carrying  value, and average pre-  and  post-modification  interest rates  of loans that were modified in TDRs during 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Credit Card and Other Consumer - TDRs Entered into During 2022, 2021 and 2020\n\n|                          | Unpaid  Principal  Balance   | Carrying  Value (1)   | Pre- Modification  Interest Rate   | Post- Modification  Interest Rate   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)    | December 31, 2022            | December 31, 2022     | December 31, 2022                  | December 31, 2022                   |\n| Credit card              | $ 284                        | $ 293                 | 22.34 %                            | 3.89 %                              |\n| Direct/Indirect consumer | 6                            | 5                     | 5.51                               | 5.50                                |\n| Total                    | $ 290                        | $ 298                 | 22.06                              | 3.92                                |\n|                          | December 31, 2021            | December 31, 2021     | December 31, 2021                  | December 31, 2021                   |\n| Credit card              | $  237                       | $  248                | 18.45 %                            | 4.09 %                              |\n| Direct/Indirect consumer | 23                           | 16                    | 5.88                               | 5.88                                |\n| Total                    | $  260                       | $  264                | 17.68                              | 4.20                                |\n|                          | December 31, 2020            | December 31, 2020     | December 31, 2020                  | December 31, 2020                   |\n| Credit card              | $  269                       | $  277                | 18.16 %                            | 5.63 %                              |\n| Direct/Indirect consumer | 52                           | 37                    | 5.83                               | 5.83                                |\n| Total                    | $  321                       | $  314                | 16.70                              | 5.65                                |\n\nThe table below presents the December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 carrying value for Credit Card and Other Consumer loans that were modified in a TDR during 2022, 2021 and 2020 by program type.\n\n## Credit Card and Other Consumer - TDRs by Program Type at December 31 (1)\n\n| (Dollars in millions)   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Internal programs       | $ 251  | $  214 | $  225 |\n| External programs       | 44     | 44     | 73     |\n| Other                   | 3      | 6      | 16     |\n| Total                   | $ 298  | $  264 | $  314 |\n\nCredit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer. Based on historical experience, the  Corporation  estimates  that 15  percent of new  credit card TDRs and 15 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification.\n\n## Commercial Loans\n\nModifications  of loans  to  commercial  borrowers  that are experiencing  financial  difficulty are  designed  to  reduce  the Corporation's loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure  or bankruptcy. Each  modification  is  unique  and reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications  that result in  a  TDR  may include  extensions  of maturity at a  concessionary (below  market) rate  of interest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the borrower while  mitigating  the  Corporation's  risk  exposure.",

        "page_content": "Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are  typically increased, although  the  increased  rate  may not represent a  market rate  of interest. Infrequently, concessions may also  include  principal  forgiveness  in  connection  with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan.\n\nAt the  time  of restructuring, the  loans  are  remeasured  to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the  modified  terms. If a  portion  of the  loan  is  deemed  to  be uncollectible, a  charge-off may be  recorded  at the  time  of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification.\n\nDuring  2022, the  carrying  value  of the  Corporation's commercial loans that were modified as TDRs was $1.9 billion compared to $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion for 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2022, 2021 and  2020, the  Corporation  had commitments  to  lend  $358  million, $283  million and  $402 million to commercial borrowers whose loans were classified as TDRs. The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was $105 million, $262 million and $218 million at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nThe Corporation had LHFS of $6.9 billion  and  $15.6  billion  at December 31, 2022 and  2021. Cash  and  non-cash  proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS were  $32.0  billion, $43.6  billion and  $20.1  billion for 2022, 2021 and  2020, respectively. Cash  used  for originations  and purchases  of LHFS  totaled  $24.9  billion, $37.3  billion and $19.7  billion for 2022, 2021 and  2020, respectively. Also included were non-cash net transfers into LHFS of $1.9 billion during  2022, primarily driven  by the  transfer of a  $1.6  billion affinity card  loan  portfolio  to  held  for sale  that was  sold  in October 2022, and $808 million during 2021.\n\n## Accrued Interest Receivable\n\nAccrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans heldfor-sale at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $3.8 billion and $2.2 billion and is reported in customer and other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nOutstanding  credit card  loan  balances  include  unpaid principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not classified as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within  60  days  after receipt of notification  of death  or bankruptcy, or upon  confirmation  of fraud. During  2022  and 2021, the Corporation reversed $332 million and $446 million of interest and  fee  income  against the  income  statement line item in  which  it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan.\n\nFor the  outstanding  residential  mortgage, home  equity, direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances classified as nonperforming during 2022 and 2021, interest and fee  income  reversed  at the  time  the  loans  were  classified  as nonperforming was not significant. For more information on the Corporation's  nonperforming  loan  policies, see Note  1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as  historical  loss  experience, the  current credit quality of the portfolio  and  an  economic outlook  over the  life  of the  loan. Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected  in\n\nthe  quantitative  methods  or the  economic assumptions. The Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use  of several  macroeconomic scenarios  in  determining  the weighted  economic outlook  over the  forecasted  life  of the assets. These scenarios include  key macroeconomic variables such  as  gross  domestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are  chosen  each  quarter and  the  weighting  given  to  each scenario  depend  on  a  variety of factors  including  recent economic events, leading  economic indicators, internal  and third-party economist views, and  industry trends. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles .\n\nThe  December 31, 2022  estimate  for allowance  for credit losses  was  based  on  various  economic scenarios, including  a baseline  scenario  derived  from consensus  estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside  scenario  reflecting  persistent inflation  and  interest rates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to the  severely adverse  scenario  used  in  stress  testing  and  an upside  scenario  that considers  the  potential  for improvement above  the  baseline  scenario. The  overall  economic outlook  is weighted  95  percent towards  a  recessionary environment in 2023, with  continued  inflationary pressures  leading  to  lower GDP and higher unemployment rate expectations as compared to the prior year. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the  U.S. average  unemployment rate  will  be  above  five  and  a half percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 and will slowly decline to five percent by the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, in this economic outlook, U.S. gross domestic product is forecasted to contract at 0.4 percent and grow at 1.2 percent year-over-year in the  fourth  quarters  of 2023 and 2024. For comparison, as of December 31, 2021, the  weighted  economic outlook  for the U.S. average  unemployment rate  was  forecasted  to  be  just above  five  percent by the  fourth  quarter of 2022  and  slowly decline to just under five percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 and U.S. gross domestic product was forecasted at 2.1 percent and  1.9  percent year-over-year in  the  fourth  quarters  of 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 was $14.2  billion, an  increase  of $379  million  compared  to December 31, 2021. The  increase  in  the  allowance  for credit losses  was  primarily driven  by loan  growth  and  a  dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced  pandemic uncertainties. The  change  in  the  allowance for credit losses  was  comprised  of a  net increase  of $295 million  in  the  allowance  for loan  and  lease  losses  and  an increase  of $84  million  in  the  reserve  for unfunded  lending commitments. The  increase  in  the  allowance  for credit losses was  attributed  to  increases  in  the  credit card  and  other consumer portfolios of $341 million, and commercial portfolio of $177 million, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer real estate portfolio of $139 million. The provision for credit losses increased  $7.1  billion  to  an  expense  of $2.5  billion  in  2022 compared to a benefit of $4.6 billion in 2021 and an expense of $11.3 billion  in  2020. The increase in the provision  for credit losses  in  2022  was  primarily driven  by loan  growth  and  a dampened  macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by reduced pandemic uncertainties. The benefit in 2021 was primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.\n\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the  fair value  option  increased  $68.7  billion  in  2022 primarily driven  by commercial  loans, which  increased  $47.7 billion, driven by broad-based growth, and consumer loans which",

The  Corporation  routinely securitizes  loans  and  debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other securitization  vehicle  such  that the  assets  are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available  to  satisfy its  obligations. These  assets  can  only be used  to  settle  obligations  of the  trust or other securitization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in  other VIEs  including  CDOs, investment vehicles  and  other entities. For more information on the Corporation's use of VIEs, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.\n\nThe tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated  and  unconsolidated  VIEs  at December 31, 2022 and  2021  in  situations  where  the  Corporation  has  continuing involvement with  transferred  assets  or if the  Corporation otherwise  has  a  variable  interest in  the  VIE. The  tables  also\n\npresent the Corporation's maximum loss exposure at December 31, 2022 and  2021  resulting  from its  involvement with  consolidated  VIEs  and  unconsolidated  VIEs  in  which  the Corporation  holds  a  variable  interest. The  Corporation's maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of the  assets  in  the  VIEs  become  worthless  and  incorporates not only potential  losses  associated  with  assets  recorded  on the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet but also  potential  losses associated  with  off-balance  sheet commitments, such  as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets.\n\nThe  Corporation  invests  in  ABS  issued  by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into certain commercial  lending  arrangements  that may also incorporate  the  use  of VIEs, for example  to  hold  collateral. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 - Securities or Note 5 - Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses. In addition, the Corporation has used VIEs in connection with its funding activities.",

Securitization  usually occurs  in conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation  may also  securitize  loans  held  in  its  residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to  time, securitize  commercial  mortgages  it originates  or purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the  loans  it securitizes. Further, the  Corporation  may retain beneficial  interests  in  the  securitization  trusts  including  senior and  subordinate  securities  and  equity tranches  issued  by the trusts. Except as  described  in Note  12  -  Commitments  and Contingencies , the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse  to  the  securitization  trusts  other than  standard representations and warranties.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  select information  related  to first-lien mortgage securitizations for 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## First-lien Mortgage Securitizations\n\n|                                             | Residential Mortgage - Agency   | Residential Mortgage - Agency   | Residential Mortgage - Agency   | Commercial Mortgage   | Commercial Mortgage   | Commercial Mortgage   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                       | 2022                            | 2021                            | 2020                            | 2022                  | 2021                  | 2020                  |\n| Proceeds from loan sales  (1)               | $ 8,084                         | $  6,664                        | $  15,823                       | $ 5,853               | $  10,874             | $  5,084              |\n| Gains on securitizations  (2)               | 8                               | 9                               | 728                             | 46                    | 156                   | 61                    |\n| Repurchases from securitization trusts  (3) | 53                              | 756                             | 436                             | -                     | -                     | -                     |\n\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization  of consumer real  estate  loans. The  unpaid principal  balance  of loans  serviced  for investors, including residential  mortgage  and  home  equity loans, totaled  $100.1 billion  and  $115.4  billion at December 31, 2022 and  2021. Servicing  fee  and  ancillary fee  income  on  serviced  loans  was $274 million, $392 million and $474 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including loans  serviced  for others  and  loans  held  for investment, were $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion  at  December 31, 2022 and 2021. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements .\n\nDuring 2022, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential  mortgage  securitization  trusts  with  total  assets  of $784 million, with no significant deconsolidations in 2021.\n\nDuring  2020, the  Corporation  completed  the  sale  of $9.3 billion  of consumer real  estate  loans  through  GNMA  loan securitizations. As  part of the  securitizations, the  Corporation retained  $8.4  billion  of MBS, which  are  classified  as  debt securities  carried  at fair value  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet. Total gains on loan sales of $704 million were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe following table summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at December 31, 2022 and 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Home Equity Loans\n\nThe Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity securitization  trusts  to  which  it transferred  home equity loans. In  addition, the  Corporation  may be  obligated  to provide  subordinate  funding  to  the  trusts  during  a  rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss  exposure  in  the  preceding  table. The  charges  that will ultimately be  recorded  as  a  result of the  rapid  amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows.\n\n## Credit Card Securitizations\n\nThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The  Corporation's  continuing  involvement with  the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller's  interest) in  the  receivables, and holding certain retained interests, including subordinate interests  in  accrued  interest and  fees  on  the  securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts.\n\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation issued new senior debt securities  to  third-party investors  from the  credit card  securitization  trust totaling  $2.3  billion, $1.0  billion, and $1.0 billion, respectively.\n\nAt December 31, 2022  and  2021, the  Corporation  held subordinate  securities  issued  by the  credit card  securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $6.7 billion and $6.5 billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero  percent. During  2022, 2021  and  2020, the  credit card securitization trust issued $363 million, $161 million and $161 million, respectively, of these subordinate securities.\n\n## Resecuritization Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation  transfers  securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization  VIEs  generally at the  request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization  trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.\n\nThe  Corporation  resecuritized  $21.8  billion, $28.9  billion and  $39.0  billion  of securities  during  2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Securities  transferred  into  resecuritization  VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to the resecuritization  and, accordingly, no  gain  or loss  on  sale  was recorded. Securities received from the resecuritization VIEs were recognized  at their fair value  of $2.4  billion, $2.2  billion  and $6.1 billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the securities were classified as trading  account assets. All  of the  securities  received  as resecuritization proceeds during 2020 were classified as trading account assets. Of the  securities  received  as  resecuritization proceeds during 2020, $2.4 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion were  classified  as  trading  account assets, debt securities carried at fair value and  HTM securities, respectively. Substantially all of the trading account securities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Municipal Bond Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation  administers  municipal  bond  trusts  that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate  municipal  bonds. The  trusts obtain  financing  by issuing  floating-rate  trust certificates  that reprice  on  a  weekly or other short-term basis  to  third-party investors.\n\nThe  Corporation's  liquidity commitments  to  unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was  transferor, totaled  $2.5  billion and  $4.1  billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at December 31, 2022 was 8.7 years. There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Other Variable Interest Entities\n\nThe table below summarizes select information related to other VIEs  in  which  the  Corporation  held  a  variable  interest at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Other VIEs\n\n|                                       | Consolidated      | Unconsolidated    | Total             | Consolidated      | Unconsolidated    | Total             |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2021 |\n| Maximum loss exposure                 | $ 2,286           | $ 31,405          | $ 33,691          | $  4,819          | $  27,790         | $  32,609         |\n| On-balance sheet assets               |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Trading account assets                | $ 353             | $ 638             | $ 991             | $  2,552          | $  626            | $  3,178          |\n| Debt securities carried at fair value | -                 | 5                 | 5                 | -                 | 7                 | 7                 |\n| Loans and leases                      | 2,086             | 90                | 2,176             | 2,503             | 47                | 2,550             |\n| Allowance for loan and lease losses   | (1)               | (12)              | (13)              | (2)               | (12)              | (14)              |\n| All other assets                      | 46                | 30,221            | 30,267            | 28                | 26,628            | 26,656            |\n| Total                                 | $ 2,484           | $ 30,942          | $ 33,426          | $  5,081          | $  27,296         | $  32,377         |\n| On-balance sheet liabilities          |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Short-term borrowings                 | $ 42              | $ -               | $ 42              | $  51             | $  -              | $  51             |\n| Long-term debt                        | 156               | -                 | 156               | 211               | -                 | 211               |\n| All other liabilities                 | -                 | 7,318             | 7,318             | -                 | 6,548             | 6,548             |\n| Total                                 | $ 198             | $ 7,318           | $ 7,516           | $  262            | $  6,548          | $  6,810          |\n| Total assets of VIEs                  | $ 2,484           | $ 101,271         | $ 103,755         | $  5,081          | $  92,249         | $  97,330         |",

        "page_content": "## Customer VIEs\n\nCustomer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked  note  VIEs, repackaging  VIEs  and  asset acquisition  VIEs, which  are  typically created  on  behalf of customers  who  wish  to  obtain  market or credit exposure  to  a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument.\n\nThe  Corporation's  maximum loss  exposure  to  consolidated and  unconsolidated  customer VIEs  totaled  $914  million  and $2.9  billion  at December 31, 2022  and  2021, including  the notional  amount of derivatives  to  which  the  Corporation  is  a counterparty, net of losses  previously recorded, and  the Corporation's  investment, if any, in  securities  issued  by the VIEs.\n\n## Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs\n\nThe  Corporation  receives  fees  for structuring  CDO  VIEs, which hold  diversified  pools  of fixed-income  securities, typically corporate  debt or ABS, which  the  CDO  VIEs  fund  by issuing multiple  tranches  of debt and  equity securities. CDOs  are generally managed  by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation  typically transfers  assets  to  these  CDOs, holds securities  issued  by the  CDOs  and  may be  a  derivative counterparty to  the  CDOs. The  Corporation's  maximum loss exposure  to  consolidated  and  unconsolidated  CDOs  totaled $197  million and  $235  million at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Investment VIEs\n\nThe  Corporation  sponsors, invests  in  or provides  financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired  investment profile  to  investors  or the  Corporation. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation's consolidated investment VIEs  had  total  assets  of $854  million  and  $1.0 billion. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs  with  total  assets  of $12.2  billion  and  $7.1  billion  at December 31, 2022  and  2021. The  Corporation's  maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated  investment VIEs  totaled  $2.4  billion  and  $2.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.\n\n## Leveraged Lease Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation's  net investment in  consolidated  leveraged lease trusts totaled $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and  2021. The  trusts  hold  long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the  trusts  and  holds  a  significant residual  interest. The  net investment represents the Corporation's maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease  investments  become  worthless. Debt issued  by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.\n\n## Tax Credit VIEs\n\nThe  Corporation  holds  investments  in  unconsolidated  limited partnerships  and  similar entities  that construct, own  and operate  affordable  housing, wind  and  solar projects. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. As an investor, tax credits  associated  with  the  investments  in these entities are allocated to the Corporation, as provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and related regulations, and are recognized  as  income  tax benefits  in  the  Corporation's Consolidated Statement of Income in the year they are earned,\n\nwhich varies based on the type of investments. Tax credits from environmental, social  and  governance  (ESG) investments  in affordable housing are recognized ratably over a term of up to 10  years, and  tax credits  from wind  and  solar energy investments are recognized either at inception for transactions electing Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) or as energy is produced for transactions electing Production Tax Credits (PTCs), which is generally up to a 10-year time period. The volume and types of investments held by the Corporation will influence the amount of tax credits recognized each period. The maximum loss exposure included  in  the  Other VIEs  table  was  $28.8  billion  and  $25.7 billion  at December 31, 2022 and  2021. In  addition  to  that amount, the Corporation had unfunded capital contributions for renewable energy investments of $1.9 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2022  and  2021. The  capital  contributions  are contingent on various conditions precedent to funding over the next two  years. The  Corporation's  risk  of loss  is  generally mitigated  by policies  requiring  that the  project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment.\n\nThe Corporation's investments in affordable housing partnerships, which  are  reported  in  other assets  on  the Consolidated  Balance  Sheet, totaled  $14.1  billion  and  $12.6 billion, including  unfunded  commitments  to  provide  capital contributions of $6.6 billion and $5.8 billion, at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The  unfunded  commitments  are  expected  to be paid over the next five years. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits of $1.5  billion, $1.3  billion  and  $1.2  billion  and  reported  pretax losses  in  other income  of $1.2  billion, $1.1  billion  and  $1.0 billion. These  tax credits  are  recognized  as  part of the Corporation's  annual  effective  tax rate  used  to  determine  tax expense in  a  given  quarter. The  Corporation  may be  asked  to invest additional  amounts  to  support a  troubled  affordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.\n\n## NOTE 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe  table  below  presents  goodwill  balances  by business segment at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The reporting units utilized  for goodwill  impairment testing  are  the  operating segments or one level below.\n\n## Goodwill\n\n|                                       | December 31   | December 31   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                 | 2022          | 2021          |\n| Consumer Banking                      | $ 30,137      | $  30,137     |\n| Global Wealth & Investment Management | 9,677         | 9,677         |\n| Global Banking                        | 24,026        | 24,026        |\n| Global Markets                        | 5,182         | 5,182         |\n| Total goodwill                        | $ 69,022      | $  69,022     |\n\nDuring  2022, the  Corporation  completed  its  annual  goodwill impairment test as  of June  30, 2022  using  qualitative assessments  for all  applicable  reporting  units. Based  on  the results of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Corporation determined there was no impairment. For more information on the use of qualitative assessments, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles .\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nAt December 31, 2022  and  2021, the  net carrying  value  of intangible  assets  was  $2.1  billion  and  $2.2  billion. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, intangible assets included $1.6",

Generally, these  options  do  not impact the  lease  term because  the  Corporation  is  not reasonably certain that it will exercise the options.\n\nThe  following  table  provides  information  on  the  right-of-use assets, lease  liabilities  and  weighted-average  discount rates and lease terms at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Supplemental Information for Lessee Arrangements\n\n|                                                                                                    | December 31   | December 31   |          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                                              | 2022          | 2021          |          |\n| Right-of-use asset                                                                                 | $ 9,755       | $  10,233     |          |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                                  | 10,359        | 10,858        |          |\n| Weighted-average discount rate  used to calculate present value  of future minimum lease  payments | 3.25 %        | 2.91 %        |          |\n| Weighted-average lease term (in  years)                                                            | 8.6           | 9.0           |          |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities  (1)                  | $ 824         | $  1,713      |          |\n|                                                                                                    | 2022          | 2021          | 2020     |\n| Operating cash flows from operating leases  (2)                                                    | $ 1,986       | $  1,964      | $  2,039 |\n| Lease Cost and Supplemental Information:                                                           |               |               |          |\n| Operating lease cost                                                                               | $ 2,008       | $  2,025      | $  2,149 |\n| Variable lease cost (3)                                                                            | 464           | 462           | 474      |\n| Total lease cost  (4)                                                                              | $ 2,472       | $  2,487      | $  2,623 |\n\n## Maturity Analysis\n\nThe maturities of lessor and lessee arrangements outstanding at December 31, 2022 are presented in the table below based on undiscounted cash flows.\n\n## Maturities of Lessor and Lessee Arrangements\n\n|                                        | Lessor            | Lessor                                       | Lessee (1)        |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                        | Operating  Leases | Sales-type and  Direct Financing  Leases (2) | Operating  Leases |\n| (Dollars in millions)                  | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022                            | December 31, 2022 |\n| 2023                                   | $  819            | $  4,932                                     | $  1,998          |\n| 2024                                   | 682               | 4,399                                        | 1,850             |\n| 2025                                   | 509               | 2,539                                        | 1,567             |\n| 2026                                   | 368               | 1,993                                        | 1,354             |\n| 2027                                   | 289               | 990                                          | 1,131             |\n| Thereafter                             | 664               | 1,635                                        | 4,189             |\n| Total undiscounted  cash flows         | $  3,331          | 16,488                                       | 12,089            |\n| Less: Net present value adjustment (3) |                   | 1,365                                        | 1,730             |\n| Total                                  |                   | $ 15,123                                     | $ 10,359          |",

These  financing  agreements  (also referred to as 'matched-book transactions') are to accommodate  customers, obtain  securities  to  cover short positions  and  finance  inventory positions. The  Corporation elects  to  account for certain  securities  financing  agreements under the  fair value  option. For more  information  on  the  fair value option, see Note 21 - Fair Value Option .\n\n## Offsetting of Securities Financing Agreements\n\nSubstantially all of the  Corporation's  securities  financing activities  are  transacted  under legally enforceable  master\n\nrepurchase agreements or legally enforceable master securities lending  agreements  that give  the  Corporation, in  the  event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held and  to  offset receivables  and  payables  with  the  same counterparty. The  Corporation  offsets  securities  financing transactions  with  the  same  counterparty on  the  Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date.\n\nThe Securities Financing Agreements table presents securities  financing  agreements  included  on  the  Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased  under agreements  to  resell, and  in  federal  funds purchased and securities  loaned  or sold  under agreements to repurchase  at December 31, 2022  and  2021. Balances  are presented  on  a  gross  basis, prior to  the  application  of counterparty netting. Gross  assets  and  liabilities  are  adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable  master netting  agreements.

For securities  loaned  transactions, the Corporation receives collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other securities. To  determine  whether the  market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily, and the Corporation may be required to deposit additional  collateral  or may receive  or return  collateral pledged when  appropriate. Repurchase agreements and securities  loaned  transactions  are  generally either overnight, continuous (i.e., no stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages liquidity risks related to these agreements by sourcing funding  from a  diverse  group  of counterparties, providing  a range  of securities  collateral  and  pursuing  longer durations, when appropriate.\n\n## Short-term Bank Notes\n\nBank of America, N.A. maintains a global program to offer up to a  maximum of $75.0  billion  outstanding  at any one  time, of bank notes with fixed or floating rates and maturities of at least seven  days  from the  date  of issue. Short-term bank  notes outstanding  under this  program totaled  $6.2  billion  and  $1.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. These short-term bank notes, along  with  Federal  Home  Loan  Bank  advances, U.S.\n\nTreasury tax and loan notes, and term federal funds purchased, are  included  in  short-term borrowings  on  the  Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that it is  permitted  by contract or practice  to  sell  or repledge. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of this collateral was $827.6 billion and $854.8 billion, of which $764.1 billion and $782.7 billion were sold or repledged. The primary source of this  collateral  is  securities  borrowed  or purchased  under agreements to resell.\n\nThe Corporation also pledges company-owned securities and loans  as  collateral  in  transactions  that include  repurchase agreements, securities  loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and  loan  notes, and  short-term borrowings. This collateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the counterparties  to  the  transactions, is  parenthetically disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn  certain  cases, the Corporation has transferred assets to consolidated  VIEs  where  those  restricted  assets  serve  as collateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are included  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet in  Assets  of Consolidated VIEs.",

        "page_content": "In addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection with  its  derivative  contracts. Required  collateral  levels  vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty. Generally, the  Corporation  accepts  collateral  in  the  form of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Based  on  provisions  contained  in  master netting  agreements, the Corporation nets cash collateral received against derivative assets.

During 2021, the Corporation issued $76.7 billion of long-term debt consisting of $56.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, $8.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $12.5 billion of other debt.\n\nDuring  2022, the  Corporation  had  total  long-term debt maturities  and  redemptions  in  the  aggregate  of $33.3  billion consisting  of $19.8  billion  for Bank  of America  Corporation, $9.9 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $3.6 billion of other debt. During  2021, the  Corporation  had  total  long-term debt maturities  and  redemptions  in  the  aggregate  of $46.4  billion consisting  of $24.4  billion  for Bank  of America  Corporation, $10.4  billion  for Bank  of America, N.A. and  $11.6  billion  of other debt.\n\nBank  of America  Corporation  and  Bank  of America, N.A. maintain various U.S. and non-U.S. debt programs to offer both senior and subordinated notes. The notes may be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the  amount of foreign currency-denominated  debt translated into U.S. dollars included in total long-term debt was $46.7 billion and $53.1 billion. Foreign currency contracts may be  used  to  convert certain  foreign  currency-denominated  debt into U.S. dollars.\n\nThe  weighted-average  effective  interest rates  for total  longterm debt (excluding  senior structured  notes), total  fixed-rate debt and  total  floating-rate  debt were  3.27  percent, 3.23 percent and 4.14 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2022, and 2.83 percent, 3.08 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2021.

Included in the table are certain structured notes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions whereby the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put\n\noptions) at specified  dates  prior to  maturity. Other structured notes  have  coupon  or repayment terms  linked  to  the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the value  of a  referenced  index or security. In  both  cases, the Corporation  or a  subsidiary may be  required  to  settle  the obligation  for cash  or other securities  prior to  the  contractual maturity date.

These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk  and  are  subject to  the  same  credit and  market risk limitation  reviews  as  those  instruments  recorded  on  the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Credit Extension Commitments\n\nThe Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to  meet the  financing  needs  of its  customers. The  following table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments  net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated  or participated) to  other financial  institutions. The distributed  amounts  were  $10.4  billion  and  $10.7  billion  at December 31, 2022  and  2021. The  carrying  value  of the Corporation's  credit extension  commitments  at December 31, 2022  and  2021, excluding  commitments  accounted  for under\n\nthe  fair value  option, was  $1.6  billion and  $1.5  billion, which predominantly related  to  the  reserve  for unfunded  lending commitments. The  carrying  value  of these  commitments  is classified  in  accrued  expenses  and  other liabilities  on  the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nLegally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified  rates  and  maturities. Certain  of these  commitments have  adverse  change  clauses  that help  to  protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower's ability to pay.\n\nThe  following  table  includes  the  notional  amount of commitments of $3.0 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2022  and  2021  that are  accounted  for under the  fair value option. However, the  table  excludes  the  cumulative  net fair value for these commitments of $110 million and $97 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, which is classified  in  accrued expenses  and  other liabilities. For more  information  regarding the  Corporation's  loan  commitments  accounted  for under the fair value option, see Note 21 - Fair Value Option.",

These  commitments  generally expire within the next 12 months.\n\nAt December 31, 2022  and  2021, the  Corporation  had  a commitment to  originate  or purchase  up  to  $3.7  billion  and $4.0  billion  on  a  rolling  12-month  basis, of auto  loans  and leases  from a  strategic partner. This  commitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice.\n\nAt December 31, 2022  and  2021, the  Corporation  had unfunded equity investment commitments of $571 million and $395 million.\n\n## Other Guarantees\n\n## Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection\n\nThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to  insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At December 31, 2022  and 2021, the  notional  amount of these  guarantees  totaled  $4.3\n\nbillion and $6.3 billion. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation's  maximum exposure  related  to  these  guarantees totaled $632 million and $928 million, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into various  agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax indemnifications, whereupon  payment may become  due  if certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The indemnification  clauses  are  often  standard  contractual  terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These agreements  typically contain  an  early termination  clause  that permits  the  Corporation  to  exit the  agreement upon  these events. The maximum potential future payment under indemnification  agreements  is  difficult to  assess  for several reasons, including  the  occurrence  of an  external  event, the inability to  predict future  changes  in  tax and  other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract language  and  the  timing  of any early termination clauses. Historically, any payments made  under these guarantees  have  been  de  minimis. The  Corporation  has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote.\n\n## Merchant Services\n\nThe Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that cannot be  collected  from the  merchants, due to, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either the  merchants  or merchant acquirers, the  Corporation may be  held  liable  for these  reversed  charges. The  ability to reverse  a  charge  is  primarily governed  by the  applicable",

        "page_content": "payment network rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited  to, the  type  of charge, type  of payment used  and time limits. The total amount of transactions subject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations processed for the preceding  six-month  period, which  was  approximately $501 billion, is  an  estimate  of the  Corporation's  maximum potential exposure as of December 31, 2022. The Corporation's risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has  purchased  goods  or services  for future  delivery. The Corporation  mitigates  this  risk  by requiring  cash  deposits, guarantees, letters  of credit or other types  of collateral  from certain  merchants. The  Corporation's  reserves  for contingent losses  and  the  losses  incurred  related  to  the  merchant processing activity were not significant.\n\n## Exchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees\n\nThe Corporation is a member of various securities and derivative exchanges  and  clearinghouses, both  in  the  U.S. and  other countries. As a member, the Corporation may be required to pay a  pro-rata  share  of the  losses  incurred  by some  of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss  scenarios. The  Corporation's  potential  obligations may be limited to its membership interests in such exchanges and  clearinghouses, to  the  amount (or multiple) of the Corporation's  contribution  to  the  guarantee  fund  or, in  limited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after applying  the  guarantee  fund. The  Corporation's  maximum potential  exposure  under these  membership  agreements  is difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has assessed the probability of making any such payments as remote.\n\n## Prime Brokerage and Securities Clearing Services\n\nIn connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the  Corporation  performs  securities  clearance  and  settlement services  with  other brokerage  firms  and  clearinghouses  on behalf of its clients. Under these arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect to securities transactions. The Corporation's obligations in this respect are secured by the assets in the clients' accounts and the  accounts  of their customers  as  well  as  by any proceeds received  from the  transactions  cleared  and  settled  by the Corporation  on  behalf of clients  or their customers. The Corporation's maximum potential exposure under these arrangements is difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the  Corporation  to  incur material  losses  pursuant to  these arrangements is remote.\n\n## Fixed  Income Clearing Corporation  Sponsored  Member Repo Program\n\nThe  Corporation  acts  as  a  sponsoring  member in  a  repo program whereby the  Corporation  clears  certain  eligible  resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division  of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients  that are  sponsored  members  in  accordance  with  the Fixed  Income  Clearing  Corporation's  rules. As  part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance  of its  sponsored  members  to  the  Fixed  Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation's guarantee obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the  potential  for the  Corporation  to  incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation's maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related collateral, was $59.6 billion and $42.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Other Guarantees\n\nIn  the  normal  course  of business, the  Corporation  periodically guarantees  the  obligations  of its  affiliates  in  a  variety of transactions  including  ISDA-related  transactions  and  non-ISDA related  transactions  such  as  commodities  trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.\n\n## Guarantees of Certain Long-term Debt\n\nThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees  the  securities  issued  by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and unconditional  guarantee  of trust securities  issued  by certain statutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation.\n\n## Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees\n\nThe Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in  the  form of RMBS guaranteed  by the  GSEs  or by GNMA  in  the  case  of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed  and  Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In  addition, in  prior years, legacy companies  and  certain subsidiaries  sold  pools  of first-lien  residential  mortgage  loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation  or certain  of its  subsidiaries  or legacy companies make and have made various representations  and  warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage  loans  or to  otherwise  make  whole  or provide indemnification  or other remedies  to  sponsors, investors, securitization  trusts, guarantors, insurers  or other parties (collectively, repurchases).\n\n## Unresolved Repurchase Claims\n\nUnresolved  representations  and  warranties  repurchase  claims represent the  notional  amount of repurchase  claims  made  by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In  the  case  of first-lien  mortgages, the  claim amount is  often  significantly greater than  the  expected  loss  amount due  to  the  benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments.\n\nThe  notional  amount of unresolved  repurchase  claims  at December 31, 2022  and  2021  was  $5.5  billion  and  $8.4 billion. These balances included $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022  and  2021 of claims  related  to  loans  in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities or will  otherwise  realize  the  benefit of any repurchase  claims paid.\n\nDuring  2022, the  Corporation  received  $82  million  in  new repurchase claims that were not time-barred. During 2022, $3.0 billion in claims were resolved.\n\n## Reserve and Related Provision\n\nThe reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate  guarantees  was  $612  million  and  $1.2  billion  at December 31, 2022 and  2021  and  is  included  in  accrued expenses  and  other liabilities  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet, and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties  reserve  represents  the  Corporation's  best estimate",

        "page_content": "of probable  incurred  losses, is  based  on  its  experience  in previous negotiations, and is subject to  judgment, a  variety of assumptions, and  known  or unknown  uncertainties. Future representations and warranties losses may occur in  excess  of the  amounts  recorded  for these  exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range of possible  loss  in  excess  of the  reserve  for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.\n\n## Litigation and Regulatory Matters\n\nIn  the  ordinary course  of business, the  Corporation  and  its subsidiaries  are  routinely defendants  in  or parties  to  many pending  and  threatened  legal, regulatory and  governmental actions  and  proceedings. In  view  of the  inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants  seek  very large  or indeterminate  damages  or where the  matters  present novel  legal  theories  or involve  a  large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.\n\nAs  a  matter develops, the  Corporation, in  conjunction  with any outside  counsel  handling  the  matter, evaluates  whether such matter presents  a  loss  contingency that is  probable  and estimable, and, for the matters below, whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record  a  corresponding  amount of expense. The  Corporation continues  to  monitor the  matter for further developments that could  affect the  amount of the  accrued  liability that has been previously established. Excluding  expenses  of internal  and external legal service providers, litigation and  regulatory investigation-related  expense  of $1.2  billion and  $164  million was recognized in 2022 and 2021.\n\nFor any matter disclosed  in  this  Note  for which  a  loss  in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in excess  of an  accrued  liability or where  there  is  no  accrued liability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the Corporation's  estimated  range  of possible  loss  is  $0  to  $0.8 billion in excess  of the  accrued  liability, if any, as  of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe  accrued  liability and  estimated  range  of possible  loss are  based  upon  currently available  information  and  subject to significant judgment, a  variety of assumptions and known and unknown  uncertainties. The  matters  underlying  the  accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the  current estimate  and  accrual. The estimated  range  of possible  loss  does  not represent the Corporation's maximum loss exposure.\n\nInformation  is  provided  below  regarding  the  nature  of the litigation  and, where  specified, associated  claimed  damages. Based on current knowledge, and  taking  into  account accrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising  from pending  matters, including  the  matters  described below, will  have  a  material  adverse  effect on the consolidated financial  condition  or liquidity of the  Corporation. However, in light of the  significant judgment, variety of assumptions  and uncertainties  involved  in  those  matters, some  of which  are beyond  the  Corporation's  control, and  the  very large  or indeterminate  damages  sought in  some  of those  matters, an adverse  outcome  in  one  or more  of those  matters  could  be\n\nmaterial to the Corporation's business or results of operations for any particular reporting period, or cause  significant reputational harm.\n\n## Deposit Insurance Assessment\n\nOn January 9, 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) filed suit against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia  ('District Court') alleging  failure  to  pay a December 15, 2016  invoice  for additional  deposit insurance assessments and interest in the amount of $542 million for the quarters ending June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014.\n\nOn April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a claim for additional  deposit insurance  and  interest in  the amount of $583 million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based on  BANA's  alleged  underreporting  of counterparty exposures that resulted  in  underpayment of assessments  for those quarters, and  its  Enforcement Section  is  also  conducting  a parallel investigation related to the same alleged reporting error. BANA disagrees with the FDIC's interpretation of the regulations as they existed during the relevant time period and is defending itself against the FDIC's claims. Pending final resolution, BANA has  pledged  security satisfactory to  the  FDIC  related  to  the disputed additional assessment amounts. On March 27, 2018, the  District Court denied  BANA's  partial  motion  to  dismiss certain  of the  FDIC's  claims. On  January 24, 2023, the magistrate  judge  assigned  to  the  matter by the  District Court judge held oral argument on the parties' motions for summary judgment and took the motions under advisement.\n\n## LIBOR\n\nThe  Corporation, BANA and certain  Merrill  Lynch  entities  have been named as defendants along with most of the other LIBOR panel banks in a number of individual and putative class actions by persons alleging they sustained losses on U.S. dollar LIBORbased  financial  instruments  as  a  result of collusion  or manipulation by defendants regarding the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plaintiffs  assert a  variety of claims, including  antitrust, Commodity Exchange  Act, Racketeer Influenced  and  Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud and breach of contract claims, and seek compensatory, treble  and  punitive  damages, and  injunctive relief. All  but one of the cases naming the Corporation and its affiliates  relating  to  U.S. dollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S. District Court for the  Southern  District of New  York  ('District Court'). The District Court has dismissed all RICO claims, and dismissed  all  manipulation  claims  against Bank  of America entities based on alleged trader conduct. The District Court has also  substantially limited  the  scope  of antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act and various other claims, including by dismissing in  their entirety certain  individual  and  putative  class  plaintiffs' antitrust claims  for lack  of standing. On December 30, 2021, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the  Second  Circuit affirmed  the dismissal of these antitrust claims for lack of standing. Certain individual and putative class actions remain pending against the Corporation, BANA  and  certain  Merrill  Lynch  entities. On February 28, 2018, the District Court granted certification of a class  of persons  that purchased  OTC  swaps  and  notes  that referenced U.S. dollar LIBOR from one of the U.S. dollar LIBOR panel banks, limited to claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.",

The  holders  of the  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  and Series  1  through  5  Preferred  Stock  have  general  voting  rights and vote  together with  the  common  stock. The  holders  of the other series included in the table have no general voting rights. All outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation have preference over the Corporation's common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Corporation's assets  in  the  event of a  liquidation  or dissolution. With  the exception  of the  Series  B, F and  G  Preferred  Stock, if any dividend payable on these series is in arrears for three or more semi-annual  or six or more  quarterly dividend  periods, as applicable  (whether consecutive  or not), the  holders  of these series and any other class or series of preferred stock ranking equally as to payment of dividends and upon which equivalent voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting as a  single  class) will  be  entitled  to  vote  for the  election  of two additional  directors. These  voting  rights  terminate  when  the Corporation  has  paid  in  full  dividends  on  these  series  for at least two  semi-annual  or four quarterly dividend  periods, as applicable, following the dividend arrearage.\n\nThe  7.25%  Non-Cumulative  Perpetual  Convertible  Preferred Stock, Series L (Series L Preferred Stock) does not have early redemption/call  rights. Each  share  of the  Series  L  Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 20 shares of the Corporation's common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Corporation may cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for 20 trading days during any period of 30 consecutive trading days, the closing price of common  stock  exceeds  130  percent of the  then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock. If a conversion of Series L Preferred Stock occurs at the option of the holder, subsequent to a dividend record date but prior to the dividend payment date, the  Corporation  will  still  pay any accrued dividends payable.",

As a financial holding company, the Corporation is subject to  capital  adequacy rules  issued  by the Federal Reserve. The Corporation's banking entity affiliates are subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC.\n\nThe  Corporation  and  its  primary banking  entity affiliate, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. As Advanced  approaches  institutions, the  Corporation  and  its\n\nbanking  entity affiliates  are  required  to  report regulatory riskbased  capital  ratios  and  risk-weighted  assets  under both  the Standardized  and  Advanced  approaches. The  approach  that yields  the  lower ratio  is  used  to  assess  capital  adequacy, including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework.\n\nThe  Corporation  is  required  to  maintain  a  minimum supplementary leverage  ratio  (SLR) of 3.0  percent plus  a leverage  buffer of 2.0  percent in  order to  avoid  certain restrictions  on  capital  distributions  and  discretionary bonus payments. The  Corporation's  insured  depository institution subsidiaries  are  required  to  maintain  a  minimum 6.0  percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.\n\nThe  table  below  presents  capital  ratios  and  related information  in  accordance  with  Basel  3  Standardized  and Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the Corporation and BANA.\n\n## Regulatory Capital under Basel 3\n\n|                                                                       | Bank of America Corporation   | Bank of America Corporation   | Bank of

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates were well capitalized.\n\n## Other Regulatory Matters\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and  2021, the  Corporation  had  cash and  cash  equivalents  in  the  amount of $5.6  billion  and  $4.0 billion, and  securities  with  a  fair value  of $16.6  billion  and $10.6 billion that were segregated in compliance with securities regulations. Cash and cash equivalents segregated in compliance  with  securities  regulations  are  a  component of restricted cash. For more information, see Note 10 - Securities Financing  Agreements,  Short-term  Borrowings,  Collateral  and Restricted Cash . In addition, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had cash deposited with clearing organizations of $20.7  billion  and  $28.6  billion  primarily recorded  in  other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Bank Subsidiary Distributions\n\nThe  primary sources  of funds  for cash  distributions  by the Corporation to its shareholders are capital distributions received from its bank  subsidiaries, BANA  and  Bank  of America California, N.A. In  2022, the Corporation received dividends of $22.0 billion from BANA and $250 million from Bank of America California, N.A.\n\nThe amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank may declare in a calendar year without OCC approval is the subsidiary bank's net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net income less dividends declared during the period. In  2023, BANA  can  declare  and  pay dividends  of approximately $16.1 billion to the Corporation plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2023 up to the date of any such  dividend  declaration. Bank  of America  California, N.A. can  pay dividends  of $173  million  in  2023  plus  an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2023 up to the date of any such dividend declaration.\n\n## NOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plans\n\nThe  Corporation  sponsors  a  qualified  noncontributory trusteed pension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number of noncontributory nonqualified  pension  plans  and  postretirement health  and  life  plans  that cover eligible  employees. Non-U.S.\n\npension plans sponsored by the Corporation vary based on the country and local practices.\n\nThe Qualified Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for account balances  with  participant-selected  investments, applied  at the  time  a  benefit payment is  made  from the  plan that effectively provides  principal  protection  for participant balances  transferred  and  certain  compensation  credits. The Corporation  is  responsible  for funding  any shortfall  on  the guarantee feature.\n\nBenefits earned under the Qualified Pension Plan have been frozen. Thereafter, the cash balance accounts continue to earn investment credits  or interest credits  in  accordance  with  the terms of the plan document.\n\nThe Corporation has an annuity contract that guarantees the payment of benefits  vested  under a  terminated  U.S. pension plan (Other Pension Plan). The Corporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be responsible for or benefit from actual  experience  and  investment performance  of the  annuity assets. The  Corporation  made  no  contribution  under this agreement in  2022 or 2021. Contributions may be required in the future under this agreement.\n\nThe  Corporation's  noncontributory, nonqualified  pension plans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain eligible employees.\n\nIn  addition  to  retirement pension  benefits, certain  benefitseligible employees may become eligible to continue participation as retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored by the  Corporation. These  plans  are  referred  to  as  the Postretirement Health and Life Plans.\n\nThe Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the changes  in  the  fair value  of plan  assets, changes  in  the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the accumulated  benefit obligation  (ABO) and  the  PBO, and  the weighted-average  assumptions  used  to  determine  benefit obligations  for the  pension  plans  and  postretirement plans  at December 31, 2022  and  2021. The  estimate  of the Corporation's  PBO  associated  with  these  plans  considers various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions  for mortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique that utilizes  rates  that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of the  plans. The  increases  in  the  weighted-average  discount rates in 2022 resulted in a decrease to the PBO of $5.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The increases in the weighted-average discount rates  in  2021  resulted  in  a  decrease  to  the  PBO  of approximately $895 million at December 31, 2021. Significant gains and losses related to changes in the PBO for 2022 and 2021 primarily resulted from changes in the discount rate.",

Net periodic postretirement health  and  life  expense  was determined using the 'projected  unit credit' actuarial  method. For the Postretirement Health and Life Plans, 50 percent of the unrecognized  gain  or loss  at the  beginning  of the  year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is  recognized  on  a  level  basis during the year.\n\nAssumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement benefit obligation  and  benefit cost reported  for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The assumed health care  cost trend  rate  used  to  measure  the  expected  cost of benefits covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans is 6.50  percent for 2023, reducing  in  steps  to  5.00  percent in 2028 and later years.\n\nThe Corporation's net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized  for the  plans  is  sensitive  to  the  discount rate  and expected return on plan assets. For the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and  Postretirement Health  and  Life  Plans, a  25  bp  decline  in discount rates  and  expected  return  on  assets  would  not have had  a  significant impact on  the  net periodic benefit cost for 2022.\n\n## Pretax Amounts included in Accumulated OCI and OCI\n\n|                                                               | Qualified Pension Plan   | Qualified Pension Plan   | Non-U.S. Pension Plans   | Non-U.S. Pension Plans   | Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans   | Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans   | Postretirement Health and Life Plans   | Postretirement Health and Life Plans   | Total   | Total    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                         | 2022                     | 2021                     | 2022                     | 2021                     | 2022                                   | 2021                                   | 2022                                   | 2021                                   | 2022    | 2021     |\n| Net actuarial loss (gain)                                     | $ 4,775                  | $ 3,425                  | $ 312                    | $  456                   | $ 796                                  | $  945                                 | $ (187)                                | $  4                                   | $ 5,696 | $ 4,830  |\n| Prior service cost (credits)                                  | -                        | -                        | 43                       | 17                       | -                                      | -                                      | (1)                                    | (3)                                    | 42      | 14       |\n| Amounts recognized in accumulated OCI                         | $ 4,775                  | $ 3,425                  | $ 355                    | $  473                   | $ 796                                  | $  945                                 | $ (188)                                | $  1                                   | $ 5,738 | $ 4,844  |\n| Current year actuarial loss (gain)                            | $ 1,490                  | $  (294)                 | $ (107)                  | $  (154)                 | $ (95)                                 | $  21                                  | $ (198)                                | $  (41)                                | $ 1,090 | $  (468) |\n| Amortization of actuarial gain (loss) and  prior service cost | (140)                    | (193)                    | (14)                     | (19)                     | (54)                                   | (63)                                   | 9                                      | (20)                                   | (199)   | (295)    |\n| Current year prior service cost (credit)                      | -                        | -                        | 3                        | -                        | -                                      | -                                      | -                                      | -                                      | 3       | -        |\n| Amounts recognized in OCI                                     | $ 1,350                  | $  (487)                 | $ (118)                  | $  (173)                 | $ (149)                                | $  (42)                                | $ (189)                                | $  (61)                                | $ 894   | $  (763) |",

The  Corporation's  policy is  to  invest the  trust assets  in  a  prudent manner for the  exclusive  purpose  of providing  benefits  to  participants  and  defraying  reasonable expenses  of administration. The  Corporation's  investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases  the  ratio  of assets  to  liabilities. The  strategy attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying with  ERISA  and  any applicable  regulations  and  laws. The investment strategy utilizes  asset allocation  as  a  principal determinant for establishing  the  risk/return  profile  of the assets. Asset allocation  ranges  are  established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes matching  the  exposure  of participant-selected investment measures.\n\nThe  assets  of the  Non-U.S. Pension  Plans  are  primarily attributable  to  a  U.K. pension  plan. This  U.K. pension  plan's assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to members  are  provided  with  consideration  given  to  the  nature and  the  duration  of the  plans' liabilities. The  selected  asset\n\nallocation strategy is  designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy.\n\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed  through  analysis  of historical market returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations, current market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds' past experience and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined using  the  calculated  market-related  value  for the  Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The  expected  return  on  plan  assets  assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the assets  in  the  Qualified  Pension  Plan, the  Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the  Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health  and Life Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension Plan is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities  structured  such  that asset maturities  match  the duration of the plan's obligations.\n\nThe  target allocations  for 2023  by asset category for the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans are presented in the table below. Equity securities  for the  Qualified  Pension  Plan  include common  stock  of the  Corporation  in  the  amounts  of $296 million  (1.72  percent of total  plan  assets) and  $398  million (1.80 percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## 2023 Target Allocation\n\n|                   | Percentage             | Percentage             | Percentage                           |\n|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Asset Category    | Qualified Pension Plan | Non-U.S. Pension Plans | Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans |\n| Equity securities | 15 - 50%               | 0 - 20%                | 0 - 5%                               |\n| Debt securities   | 45 - 80%               | 40 - 75%               | 95 - 100%                            |\n| Real estate       | 0 - 10%                | 0 - 15%                | 0 - 5%                               |\n| Other             | 0 - 5%                 | 10 - 40%               | 0 - 5%                               |\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nFor more information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the Corporation, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements .

        "page_content": "## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nThe  Corporation  maintains  qualified  and  non-qualified  defined contribution retirement plans. The Corporation recorded expense of $1.2 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020 related to the qualified defined contribution plans. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, 179  million and  173  million  shares  of the  Corporation's common stock were held by these plans. Payments to the plans for dividends on common stock were $153 million, $139 million and $138 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nCertain  non-U.S. employees  are  covered  under defined contribution  pension  plans  that are  separately administered in accordance with local laws.\n\n## NOTE 18 Stock-based Compensation Plans\n\nThe Corporation administers a number of equity compensation plans, with awards being granted predominantly from the Bank of America  Corporation  Equity Plan  (BACEP). Under this  plan, 715  million  shares  of the  Corporation's  common  stock  are authorized to be used for grants of awards.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Corporation granted 102 million and  99  million  RSU  awards  to  certain  employees  under the BACEP. These RSUs were authorized to settle predominantly in shares of common stock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs will be settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject these  awards  to  variable  accounting  whereby compensation expense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share price of the Corporation's common stock up to the settlement date. The  RSUs  granted  in  2022  will  generally vest over four years. Of the  RSUs  granted  in  2021, 81  million  will  generally vest over four years  and  18  million  will  vest over three  years. The four-year awards vest primarily in one-fourth increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date while the three-year awards vest primarily in one-third increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the  vesting  period, net of estimated  forfeitures, for nonretirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. Of the RSUs granted in 2022 and 2021 that vest over four years, 39  million  and  27  million  do  not include retirement eligibility. For all  other RSUs granted  to  employees who are retirement eligible, they are  deemed authorized as of the  beginning  of the  year preceding  the  grant date  when  the incentive award plans are generally approved. As a result, the estimated value is expensed ratably over the year preceding the grant date. The  compensation  cost for the  stock-based  plans was $2.9 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.1 billion, and the related income  tax benefit was  $697  million, $723 million and  $505 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, there  was  an  estimated  $3.6  billion of total  unrecognized compensation cost related to certain sharebased compensation awards that is expected to be recognized over a period of up to four years, with a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.\n\n## Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\n\nThe total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $3.4 billion, $2.3 billion and  $2.3  billion, respectively. The  table  below  presents  the status  at December 31, 2022 of the  share-settled  restricted stock and restricted stock units and changes during 2022.\n\n## Stock-settled Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\n\n|                                  | Shares/Units   | Weighted- average Grant  Date Fair Value   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Outstanding at January 1, 2022   | 185,050,842    | $  31.54                                   |\n| Granted                          | 100,108,395    | 46.10                                      |\n| Vested                           | (73,288,792)   | 30.85                                      |\n| Canceled                         | (9,310,647)    | 39.80                                      |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2022 | 202,559,798    | 38.60                                      |\n\n## NOTE 19 Income Taxes\n\nThe  components  of income  tax expense  for 2022, 2021  and 2020 are presented in the table below.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)       | 2022    | 2021     | 2020     |\n|-----------------------------|---------|----------|----------|\n| Current income tax expense  |         |          |          |\n| U.S. federal                | $ 1,157 | $  1,076 | $  1,092 |\n| U.S. state and local        | 389     | 775      | 1,076    |\n| Non-U.S.                    | 1,156   | 985      | 670      |\n| Total current expense       | 2,702   | 2,836    | 2,838    |\n| Deferred income tax expense |         |          |          |\n| U.S. federal                | 110     | 962      | (799)    |\n| U.S. state and local        | 254     | 491      | (233)    |\n| Non-U.S.                    | 375     | (2,291)  | (705)    |\n| Total deferred expense      | 739     | (838)    | (1,737)  |\n| Total income tax expense    | $ 3,441 | $  1,998 | $  1,101 |\n\nTotal income tax expense does not reflect the tax effects of items  that are  included  in  OCI each  period. For more information, see Note  14  -  Accumulated  Other Comprehensive Income  (Loss) . Other tax effects  included  in  OCI each  period resulted in a benefit of $4.9 billion and $877 million in 2022 and 2021 and an expense of $1.5 billion in 2020.\n\nIncome tax expense for 2022, 2021 and 2020 varied from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate to  income  before  income  taxes. The  Corporation's  federal statutory tax rate was 21 percent for 2022, 2021 and 2020. A reconciliation of the expected U.S. federal income tax expense, calculated  by applying  the  federal  statutory tax rate, to  the Corporation's actual income tax expense, and the effective tax rates for 2022, 2021 and 2020 are presented in the following table.",

The  U.K. net deferred  tax assets  are  primarily net operating losses (NOLs), incurred by the Corporation's U.K. broker-dealer entity in  historical  periods, which do not expire  under U.K. tax law  and  are  assessed  regularly for impairment. If further U.K. tax law  changes  are  enacted, a  corresponding  income  tax adjustment will be made based on the amount of available net deferred tax assets and applicable tax rate changes.\n\nTax credits  originate  from ESG  investments  in  affordable housing and renewable energy partnerships and similar entities. Significant increases in the tax credits recognized over the last three  annual  periods  have  been  primarily driven  by the Corporation's continued growth in the volume of investments in wind and solar energy production facilities, consistent with the Corporation's commitment to  support the  transition  to  a  lower carbon  economy. For additional  information, see Note  6  Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities .\n\nThe reconciliation of the beginning unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) balance to the ending balance is presented in the table below.\n\n## Reconciliation of the Change in Unrecognized Tax Benefits\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                         | 2022    | 2021     | 2020     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|----------|\n| Balance, January 1                                            | $ 1,322 | $  1,340 | $  1,175 |\n| Increases related to positions taken  during the current year | 121     | 208      | 238      |\n| Increases related to positions taken  during prior years (1)  | 167     | 265      | 99       |\n| Decreases related to positions  taken during prior years  (1) | (289)   | (413)    | (172)    |\n| Settlements                                                   | (99)    | (23)     | -        |\n| Expiration of statute of limitations                          | (166)   | (55)     | -        |\n| Balance, December 31                                          | $ 1,056 | $  1,322 | $  1,340 |\n\nAt December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the balance of the Corporation's  UTBs  which  would, if recognized, affect the Corporation's effective tax rate was $709 million, $959 million and $976 million, respectively. Included in the UTB balance are some  items  the  recognition  of which  would  not affect the effective  tax rate, such  as  the  tax effect of certain  temporary differences, the portion of gross state UTBs that would be offset by the tax benefit of the associated federal deduction and the portion  of gross  non-U.S. UTBs  that would  be  offset by tax reductions in other jurisdictions.\n\nIt is reasonably possible that the UTB balance may decrease by as much as $375 million during the next 12 months, since resolved items will be removed from the balance whether their resolution results in payment or recognition.\n\nThe Corporation recognized an interest benefit of $50 million in 2022 and interest expense of $32 million and $9 million  in 2021  and  2020. At December 31, 2022  and  2021, the Corporation's accrual for interest and penalties that related to income taxes, net of taxes and remittances, was $107 million and $167 million.\n\nThe  Corporation  files  income  tax returns  in  more  than  100 state  and  non-U.S. jurisdictions  each  year. The  IRS  and  other tax authorities in countries and states in which the Corporation has  significant business  operations  examine  tax returns periodically (continuously in some jurisdictions). The table below summarizes the status of examinations by major jurisdiction for the  Corporation  and  various  subsidiaries  at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Tax Examination Status\n\n|                    | Years under Examination  (1)   | Status at  December 31 2022   |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| United States      | 2017-2021                      | Field Examination             |\n| California         | 2012-2014                      | Appeals                       |\n| California         | 2015-2017                      | Field Examination             |\n| California         | 2018-2020                      | To begin in 2023              |\n| New York           | 2019-2021                      | To begin in 2023              |\n| United Kingdom (2) | 2019-2020                      | Field Examination             |\n\nSignificant components of the Corporation's net deferred tax assets  and  liabilities  at December 31, 2022  and  2021  are presented in the following table.",

The majority of the Corporation's U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years. Management's conclusion is supported by financial results, profit forecasts for the  relevant entities  and  the  indefinite  period  to  carry forward NOLs. However, a  material  change  in  those  estimates  could lead  management to reassess  such  valuation  allowance conclusions.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, U.S. federal  income  taxes  had  not been  provided  on  approximately $5.0  billion  of temporary differences associated with investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries  that are  essentially permanent in  duration. If the Corporation were to record the associated deferred tax liability, the amount would be approximately $1.0 billion.\n\n## NOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements\n\nUnder applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to  transfer a  liability (an  exit price) in  the  principal  or most advantageous  market for the  asset or liability in  an  orderly transaction  between  market participants  on  the  measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used  in  the  financial  models  measuring  the  fair values  of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. For more  information  regarding  the  fair value  hierarchy and  how  the  Corporation  measures  fair value, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 21 - Fair Value Option.\n\n## Valuation Techniques\n\nThe  following  sections  outline  the  valuation  methodologies  for the  Corporation's  assets  and  liabilities. While  the  Corporation believes  its  valuation  methods  are  appropriate  and  consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies  or assumptions  to  determine  the  fair value  of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n\nDuring 2022, there were no significant changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material  impact on  the  Corporation's  consolidated  financial position or results of operations.\n\n## Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities\n\nThe  fair values  of trading  account assets  and  liabilities  are primarily based  on  actively traded  markets  where  prices  are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor in  the  determination  of the  fair values  of trading  account assets  and  liabilities  and  debt securities. Market price  quotes  may not be  readily available  for some positions  such  as  positions  within  a  market sector where trading  activity has  slowed  significantly or ceased. Some  of these  instruments  are  valued  using  a  discounted  cash  flow model, which  estimates  the  fair value  of the  securities  using internal  credit risk, and  interest rate  and  prepayment risk models that incorporate management's best estimate of current key assumptions  such  as  default rates, loss  severity and prepayment rates. Principal  and  interest cash  flows  are discounted  using  an  observable  discount rate  for similar instruments  with  adjustments  that management believes  a market participant would consider in  determining  fair value  for the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net asset value  approach  which  considers  the  value  of the underlying  securities. Underlying  assets  are  valued  using external  pricing  services, where  available, or matrix pricing based  on  the  vintages  and  ratings. Situations  of illiquidity generally are  triggered  by the  market's  perception  of credit uncertainty regarding  a  single  company or a  specific market sector. In  these  instances, fair value  is  determined  based  on limited available market information and other factors,",

        "page_content": "principally from reviewing the issuer's financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.\n\n## Derivative Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC  market are  determined  using  quantitative  models  that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices  to  generate  continuous  yield  or pricing  curves  and volatility factors  to  value  the  position. The  majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including  brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods  and  assumptions  are  reviewed  by the  Corporation. Estimation  risk  is  greater for derivative  asset and  liability positions  that are  either option-based  or have  longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations  of rate, price  or index scenarios  are  used  in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities  include  adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and  other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value  measurements  of OTC  derivatives  a  valuation adjustment to  reflect the  credit risk  associated  with  the  net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the  fair value  for net short exposures  is  adjusted  for the Corporation's own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on  uncollateralized  derivatives  and  derivatives  where  the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.\n\n## Loans and Loan Commitments\n\nThe  fair values  of loans  and  loan  commitments  are  based  on market prices, where  available, or discounted  cash  flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments  or credit derivatives  of the  specific borrower or comparable  borrowers. Results  of discounted  cash  flow analyses  may be  adjusted, as  appropriate, to  reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.\n\n## Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\nThe  fair values  of MSRs  are  primarily determined  using  an option-adjusted  spread  valuation  approach, which  factors  in prepayment risk  to  determine  the  fair value  of MSRs. This approach  consists  of projecting  servicing  cash  flows  under multiple  interest rate  scenarios  and  discounting  these  cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nThe  fair values  of LHFS  are  based  on  quoted  market prices, where  available, or are  determined  by discounting  estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation's current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The  borrower-specific credit risk is embedded  within  the  quoted  market prices  or is  implied  by considering loan performance when selecting comparables.\n\n## Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\n\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, interest rates, indices, currencies  or commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative  models  for the  combined  derivative  and  debt portions  of the  notes. These  models  incorporate  observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate  yield  curves, option  volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. The  Corporation  also  considers  the  impact of its  own  credit spread  in  determining  the  discount rate  used  to  value  these liabilities. The  credit spread  is  determined  by reference  to observable spreads in the secondary bond market.\n\n## Securities Financing Agreements\n\nThe  fair values  of certain  reverse  repurchase  agreements, repurchase  agreements  and  securities  borrowed  transactions are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including  interest rates  and  spreads  to  generate  continuous yield  or pricing  curves, and  volatility factors. The  majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external  sources, including  brokers, market transactions  and third-party pricing services.\n\n## Deposits\n\nThe  fair values  of deposits  are  determined  using  quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use  of multiple  market inputs  including  interest rates  and spreads  to  generate  continuous  yield  or pricing  curves, and volatility factors. The  majority of market inputs  are  actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions  and  third-party pricing  services. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference  to  observable  credit spreads  in  the  secondary cash market.\n\n## Asset-backed Secured Financings\n\nThe fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external  broker bids, where  available, or are  determined  by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating  the  Corporation's  current origination  rates  for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.",

        "page_content": "In  the  previous  tables, instruments  backed  by residential and commercial real estate assets include RMBS, commercial MBS, whole loans and mortgage CDOs. Commercial loans, debt securities  and  other include  corporate  CLOs  and  CDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real estate  assets. Structured  liabilities  primarily include  equitylinked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option.\n\nThe Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing certain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For a  given  product, such  as  corporate  debt securities, market comparables  may be used to estimate some  of the unobservable  inputs, and  then  these  inputs  are  incorporated into  a  discounted  cash  flow  model. Therefore, the  balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques.\n\nThe  levels  of aggregation  and  diversity within  the  products disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being wide  and  unevenly distributed  across  asset and  liability categories.\n\n## Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements  from Unobservable Inputs\n\n## Loans and Securities\n\nA  significant increase  in  market yields, default rates, loss severities or duration would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value  for long  positions. Short positions  would  have  been impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments  can  be  reinvested. A  significant increase  in  price  would  have  resulted  in  a  significantly higher fair value  for long  positions, and  short positions  would  have been impacted in a directionally opposite way.\n\n## Structured Liabilities and Derivatives\n\nFor credit derivatives, a  significant increase  in  market yield, upfront points  (i.e., a  single  upfront payment made  by a\n\n## Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\n\n|                               | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)         | Level 2             | Level 3             | Level 2             | Level 3             |\n| Assets                        |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Loans held-for-sale           | $ 1,979             | $ 3,079             | $  634              | $  24               |\n| Loans and leases  (1)         | -                   | 166                 | -                   | 213                 |\n| Foreclosed properties  (2, 3) | -                   | 7                   | -                   | 5                   |\n| Other assets                  | 88                  | 165                 | 256                 | 2,046               |\n\n|                       | Gains (Losses)   | Gains (Losses)   | Gains (Losses)   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                       | 2022             | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Assets                |                  |                  |                  |\n| Loans held-for-sale   | $ (387)          | $  (44)          | $  (79)          |\n| Loans and leases  (1) | (48)             | (60)             | (73)             |\n| Foreclosed properties | (6)              | (2)              | (6)              |\n| Other assets          | (91)             | (492)            | (98)             |\n\nprotection  buyer at inception), credit spreads, default rates  or loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for protection  sellers  and  higher fair value for protection buyers. The  impact of changes  in  prepayment speeds  would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument.\n\nStructured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio  that underlies  a  credit derivative  instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the level  of subordination  of the  tranche. For senior tranches  that are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default correlation  would  have  resulted  in  a  significantly higher fair value. Net short protection positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way.\n\nFor equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives  and  structured  liabilities, a  significant change  in long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (i.e., the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index, between  two  different commodities, between  two  different interest rates, or between interest rates  and  foreign  exchange rates) would  have  resulted  in  a  significant impact to  the  fair value; however, the  magnitude  and  direction  of the  impact depend  on  whether the  Corporation  is  long  or short the exposure. For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value.\n\n## Nonrecurring Fair Value\n\nThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value  only in  certain  situations  (e.g., the  impairment of an asset), and  these  measurements  are  referred  to  herein  as nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as of the  reporting  date  for which  a  nonrecurring  fair value adjustment was recorded during 2022, 2021, and 2020.",

Lending commitments are actively managed and, as appropriate, credit risk  for these  lending  relationships  may be mitigated  through  the  use  of credit derivatives, with  the Corporation's  public side  credit view  and  market perspectives determining  the  size  and  timing  of the  hedging  activity. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation as  accounting  hedges  and  are  carried  at fair value. The  fair value  option  allows  the  Corporation  to  carry these  loans  and loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with management's  view  of the  underlying  economics  and  the manner in  which  they are  managed. In  addition, the  fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would  otherwise  result from the  asymmetry created  by accounting  for the  financial  instruments  at historical  cost and the credit derivatives at fair value.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nThe  Corporation  elects  to  account for residential  mortgage LHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and certain other LHFS under the  fair value  option. These  loans  are  actively managed  and monitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans may be  mitigated  through  the  use  of derivatives. The Corporation  has  elected  not to  designate  the  derivatives  as qualifying  accounting  hedges, and therefore, they are carried at\n\nfair value. The  changes  in  fair value  of the  loans  are  largely offset by changes in  the  fair value  of the  derivatives. The  fair value  option  allows  the  Corporation  to  reduce  the  accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost or fair value  and  the  derivatives  at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to account for certain other LHFS under the fair value  option  primarily because  these  loans  are  floating-rate loans that are not hedged using derivative instruments.\n\n## Loans Reported as Trading Account Assets\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain loans that are held for the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a fair value basis under the fair value option.\n\n## Other Assets\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate margin  loans  that are  hedged  with  derivatives  under the  fair value  option. Election  of the  fair value  option  allows  the Corporation  to  reduce  the  accounting  volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at fair value.\n\n## Securities Financing Agreements\n\nThe  Corporation  elects  to  account for certain  securities financing agreements, including resale and repurchase agreements, under the fair value option. These elections include certain  agreements  collateralized  by the  U.S. government and its agencies, which are generally short-dated and have minimal interest rate risk.",

Election of the fair value option allows  the  Corporation  to  reduce  the  accounting  volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting  for the  financial  instruments  at historical  cost and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-term deposits at fair value because they are not hedged using derivatives.\n\n## Short-term Borrowings\n\nThe  Corporation  elects  to  account for certain  short-term borrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities, under the fair value  option  because  this  debt is  risk-managed  on  a  fair value basis.\n\nThe  Corporation  also  elects  to  account for certain  assetbacked  secured  financings, which  are  also  classified  in  shortterm borrowings, under the fair value option. Election of the fair value  option  allows  the  Corporation  to  reduce  the  accounting\n\nvolatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting  for the  asset-backed  secured  financings  at historical  cost and  the  corresponding  mortgage  LHFS  securing these financings at fair value.\n\n## Long-term Debt\n\nThe  Corporation  elects  to  account for certain  long-term debt, primarily structured  liabilities, under the  fair value  option. This long-term debt is  either risk-managed  on  a  fair value  basis  or the related hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting.\n\n## Fair Value Option Elections\n\nThe  following  tables  provide  information  about the  fair value carrying  amount and  the  contractual  principal  outstanding  of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and information about where changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for under the  fair value  option  are  included  in  the  Consolidated Statement of Income for 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Fair Value Option Elections\n\n|                                                                                       | December 31, 2022          | December 31, 2022                   | December 31, 2022                                 | December 31, 2021            | December 31, 2021                 | December 31, 2021                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                                 | Fair Value Carrying Amount | Contractual  Principal  Outstanding | Fair Value Carrying  Amount Less Unpaid Principal | Fair Value  Carrying  Amount | Contractual Principal Outstanding | Fair Value  Carrying Amount Less Unpaid Principal |\n| Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell    | $ 146,999                  | $ 147,158                           | $ (159)                                           | $  150,665                   | $  150,677                        | $  (12)                                           |\n| Loans reported as trading account assets  (1)                                         | 10,143                     | 17,682                              | (7,539)                                           | 10,864                       | 18,895                            | (8,031)                                           |\n| Trading inventory -

Certain  loans, deposits, long-term debt, unfunded lending commitments and other financial instruments are  accounted  for under the  fair value  option. For more information, see Note  21  -  Fair Value  Option . The  following disclosures include financial instruments that are not carried at fair value or only a portion of the ending balance is carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Short-term Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including cash  and  cash  equivalents, certain  time  deposits  placed  and other short-term investments, federal funds sold and purchased, certain  resale  and  repurchase  agreements  and  short-term\n\nborrowings, approximates  the  fair value  of these  instruments. These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have shortterm maturities  and  carry interest rates  that approximate market. The  Corporation  accounts  for certain  resale  and repurchase agreements under the fair value option.\n\nUnder the  fair value  hierarchy, cash  and  cash  equivalents are classified as Level 1. Time deposits placed and other shortterm investments, such  as  U.S. government securities  and short-term commercial paper, are classified as Level 1 or Level 2. Federal funds sold and purchased are classified as Level 2. Resale  and  repurchase  agreements  are  classified  as  Level  2 because  they are  generally short-dated  and/or variable-rate instruments  collateralized  by U.S. government or agency securities. Short-term borrowings are classified as Level 2.",

Consumer Banking product offerings include traditional  savings  accounts, money market savings  accounts, CDs and IRAs, checking accounts, and investment accounts and products, as  well  as  credit and  debit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans to  consumers  and  small  businesses  in  the  U.S. Consumer Banking includes the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans.\n\n## Global Wealth & Investment Management\n\nGWIM provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total  investable  assets, including  tailored  solutions  to  meet clients' needs  through  a  full  set of investment management, brokerage, banking  and  retirement products. GWIM also provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to  high  net worth  and  ultra  high  net worth  clients, as  well  as customized  solutions  to  meet clients' wealth  structuring, investment management, trust and  banking  needs, including specialty asset management services.\n\n## Global Banking\n\nGlobal Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and  services, integrated  working  capital  management and treasury solutions, and  underwriting  and  advisory services through  the  Corporation's  network  of offices and  client relationship  teams. Global  Banking also  provides  investment banking  products  to  clients. The  economics  of certain investment banking  and  underwriting  activities  are  shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal  revenue-sharing  arrangement. Global  Banking clients generally include  middle-market companies, commercial  real estate firms, not-for-profit companies, large global corporations, financial  institutions, leasing  clients, and mid-sized U.S.-based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and solutions.\n\n## Global Markets\n\nGlobal  Markets offers  sales  and  trading  services  and  research services  to  institutional  clients  across  fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and  equity businesses. Global  Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. Global Markets product coverage  includes  securities  and  derivative products  in  both  the  primary and  secondary markets. Global Markets also  works  with  commercial  and  corporate  clients  to provide  risk  management products. As  a  result of marketmaking  activities, Global  Markets may be  required  to  manage risk  in  a  broad  range  of financial  products. In  addition, the economics  of certain  investment banking  and  underwriting activities  are  shared  primarily between Global  Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement.\n\n## All Other\n\nAll Other primarily consists  of ALM activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all  of the  results  are  allocated  to  the  business segments.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe  management accounting  and  reporting  process  derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies  for revenue  and  expense. The  net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.\n\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income  on  an  FTE  basis  and  noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding  increase  in  income  tax expense. The  segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are  utilized  to  determine  net income. The  net interest income  of the  businesses  includes  the  results  of a  funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate  sensitivity and  maturity characteristics. In segments  where  the  total  of liabilities  and  equity exceeds assets, which  are  generally deposit-taking  segments, the Corporation  allocates  assets  to  match  liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income  generated  by certain  of the  Corporation's ALM activities.\n\nThe Corporation's ALM activities  include  an  overall  interest rate  risk  management strategy that incorporates  the  use  of",

The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so  that movements  in  interest rates  do  not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of a  majority of the  Corporation's  ALM activities  are  allocated  to the business segments and fluctuate based on the performance of the  ALM activities. ALM activities  include  external  product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporation's internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.\n\nCertain  expenses  not directly attributable  to  a  specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The costs of certain  centralized  or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization.\n\nEffective  October 1, 2021, a  business  activity previously\n\nincluded in the Global Markets segment is being reported as a liquidating business in All  Other , consistent with a realignment in  performance  reporting  to  senior management. While  this activity was not material to Global Markets' results of operations and  historical  results  have  not been  restated, this  activity's noninterest expense of $309 million  and  $473  million  for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021 was  elevated  and  would  have  been  excluded  from Global Markets' results of operations for those periods under the new

The  non-U.S. business activities are largely conducted in Europe, the Middle East and  Africa  and  in  Asia. The  Corporation  identifies  its geographic performance  based  on  the  business  unit structure used to manage the capital or expense deployed in the region\n\nas  applicable. This  requires  certain  judgments  related  to  the allocation  of revenue  so  that revenue  can  be  appropriately matched  with  the  related  capital  or expense  deployed  in  the region. Certain  asset, liability, income  and  expense  amounts have been allocated to arrive at total assets, total revenue, net of interest expense, income  before  income  taxes  and  net income by geographic area as presented below.\n\n| (Dollars in millions)           |      | Total Assets at  Year End (1)   | Total Revenue, N et of Interest  Expense (2)   | Income Before Income Taxes   | Net Income   |\n|---------------------------------|------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|\n| U.S. (3)                        | 2022 | $ 2,631,815                     | $ 82,890                                       | $ 28,135                     | $ 25,607     |\n|                                 | 2021 | 2,789,862                       | 78,012                                         | 31,392                       | 27,781       |\n|                                 | 2020 |                                 | 75,576                                         | 18,247                       | 16,692       |\n| Asia                            | 2022 | 127,399                         | 4,597                                          | 1,144                        | 865          |\n|                                 | 2021 | 117,085                         | 4,439                                          | 988                          | 733          |\n|                                 | 2020 |                                 | 4,232                                          | 1,051                        | 788          |\n| Europe, Middle East and Africa  | 2022 | 262,856                         | 6,044                                          | 1,121                        | 689          |\n|                                 | 2021 | 233,356                         | 5,423                                          | 1,097                        | 3,134        |\n|                                 | 2020 |                                 | 4,491                                          | (596)                        | 264          |\n| Latin America and the Caribbean | 2022 | 29,305                          | 1,419                                          | 569                          | 367          |\n|                                 | 2021 | 29,192                          | 1,239                                          | 499                          | 330          |\n|                                 | 2020 |                                 | 1,229                                          | 293                          | 150          |\n| Total Non-U.S.                  | 2022 | 419,560                         | 12,060                                         | 2,834                        | 1,921        |\n|                                 | 2021 | 379,633                         | 11,101                                         | 2,584                        | 4,197        |\n|                                 | 2020 |                                 | 9,952                                          | 748                          | 1,202        |\n| Total Consolidated              | 2022 | $ 3,051,375                     | $ 94,950                                       | $ 30,969                     | $ 27,528     |\n|                                 | 2021 | 3,169,495                       | 89,113                                         | 33,976                       | 31,978       |\n|                                 | 2020 |                                 | 85,528                                         | 18,995                       | 17,894       |\n\n- (2) There were no material intercompany revenues between geographic regions for any of the periods presented.\n- (3) Substantially reflects the U.S.",

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\nAlt-A  Mortgage -A  type  of U.S. mortgage  that is  considered riskier than A-paper, or 'prime,' and less risky than 'subprime,' the riskiest category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized  by borrowers  with  less  than  full  documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.\n\nAssets  Under  Management  (AUM) -  The  total  market value  of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the  assets' market values. AUM reflects  assets  that are generally managed  for institutional, high  net worth  and  retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.\n\nBanking  Book -  All onand  off-balance  sheet financial instruments of the  Corporation  except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.\n\nBrokerage  and  Other  Assets -  Non-discretionary client assets which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping.\n\nCommitted Credit Exposure - Any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound  to  advance  funds  during  a  specified  period  under prescribed conditions.\n\nCredit Derivatives -Contractual  agreements  that provide protection  against a  specified  credit event on  one  or more referenced obligations.\n\nCredit  Valuation  Adjustment  (CVA) -  A  portfolio  adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments.\n\nDebit  Valuation  Adjustment  (DVA) -  A  portfolio  adjustment required  to  properly reflect the  Corporation's  own  credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/ or structured liabilities.\n\nFunding  Valuation  Adjustment  (FVA) -  A  portfolio  adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives  where  the  Corporation  is  not permitted  to  use the collateral it receives.\n\nInterest  Rate  Lock  Commitment  (IRLC) -  Commitment with  a loan  applicant in  which  the  loan  terms  are  guaranteed  for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.\n\nLetter of Credit - A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer's credit for that of the customer.\n\nLoan-to-value (LTV) - A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is  calculated  as  the  outstanding  carrying  value  of the  loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan.\n\nMacro Products -  Include  currencies, interest rates  and commodities products.\n\nMargin Receivable -An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.\n\nMatched  Book -  Repurchase  and  resale  agreements  or securities  borrowed  and  loaned  transactions  where  the  overall asset and  liability position  is  similar in  size  and/or maturity. Generally, these  are  entered  into  to  accommodate  customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.\n\nMortgage  Servicing  Rights  (MSR) -  The  right to  service  a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments  from borrowers  and  accounting  for and  remitting principal and interest payments to investors.\n\nNonperforming Loans and Leases -  Includes  loans  and  leases that have  been  placed  on  nonaccrual  status, including nonaccruing loans whose  contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA) - A framework established by the U.S. banking  regulators  requiring  banks  to  maintain  certain levels  of regulatory capital  ratios, comprised of five  categories of capitalization: 'well  capitalized,' 'adequately capitalized,' 'undercapitalized,' 'significantly undercapitalized' and 'critically undercapitalized.' Insured depository institutions that fail  to  meet certain  of these  capital  levels  are  subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to  make  capital  distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions.\n\nSubprime  Loans -  Although  a  standard  industry definition  for subprime  loans  (including  subprime  mortgage  loans) does  not exist, the  Corporation  defines  subprime  loans  as  specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) - Loans whose contractual terms  have  been  restructured  in  a  manner that grants  a concession  to  a  borrower experiencing  financial  difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs.\n\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) - VaR is a model that simulates the value of a  portfolio  under a  range  of hypothetical  scenarios  in  order to generate  a  distribution  of potential  gains  and  losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.",

Customers can sign up to receive online statements through their Bank of America or Merrill Lynch Wealth Management account website. In 2012, we adopted the SEC's Notice and Access rule, which allows certain issuers to inform shareholders of the electronic availability of Proxy materials, including the Annual Report, which significantly reduced the number of printed copies we produce and mail to shareholders. Shareholders still receiving printed copies can join our efforts by electing to receive an electronic copy of the Annual Report and Proxy materials. If you have an account maintained in your name at Computershare Investor Services, you may sign up for this service at www.computershare.com/bac. If your shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, you may elect to receive an electronic copy of the Proxy materials online at www.proxyvote.com, or contact your broker.",
