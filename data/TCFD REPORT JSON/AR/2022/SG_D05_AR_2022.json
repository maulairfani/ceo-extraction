        "page_content": "## Letter from\n\n## the Chairman & CEO\n\nDBS' decade-long structural transformation continues to pay o \u038d . In a challenging year for the global economy, the bank turned in a solid performance.\n\nThe global economy faced multiple threats in 2022 - escalating geopolitical tensions, stubbornly high in \u0235 ation, stalling growth and roiling \u0234 nancial markets.\n\nSupply chain disruptions - an issue amid the Covid pandemic of the last two years - were further exacerbated by the Ukraine war. This contributed to rising food, commodities and energy prices.\n\nTo \u0234 ght decades-high in \u0235 ation, the US Federal Reserve embarked on its most aggressive monetary tightening since the early 1980s. Altogether, it hiked rates seven times in 2022, raising short-term borrowing costs by 425 basis points to 4.25-4.50%, the highest level in 15 years. Many major central banks around the world similarly followed suit. These moves had a chilling e \u038d ect on equity and bond markets.\n\nDBS' key markets Singapore and Hong Kong being small, open economies - were impacted by slowing external demand. Singapore's economy grew 3.6% in 2022, from 8.9% the year before. Hong Kong's economy shrank by 3.5%. With its strict zero-Covid policy and property market slump, China remained in the doldrums.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we had yet another excellent year, with solid \u0234 nancial performance and continued delivery against key scorecard goals.\n\nDBS also continued to cement its global standing, being named by Global Finance as \"World's Best Bank\". This made it the \u0234 fth consecutive year we had been lauded as the best in the world.\n\n## A banner year\n\nFor the year, DBS delivered record total income of SGD 16.5 billion. Net pro \u0234 t rose 20% to an all-time high of SGD 8.19 billion. Return on equity (ROE), at 15%, was not just a record, but also signi \u0234 cantly higher when compared to previous highs around the 12-13% range.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEarnings were propelled by tailwinds from a rising interest rate environment, with net interest margin increasing after three years of decline. Notwithstanding the rise in borrowing costs for corporates and individuals, loans grew 4% in constant-currency terms to SGD 415 billion. Overall, net interest income rose 30% to SGD 10.9 billion.\n\nNon-interest income, however, was a drag, declining 3% to SGD 5.56 billion. While card fees increased 20% with travel spending gradually returning to pre-pandemic levels, this was more than o \u038d set by lower wealth management and investment banking fees amid the uncertain market environment.\n\nDBS' solid \u0234 nancial performance re \u0235 ects structural shifts made to our franchise in the last decade, whether the buildout of higherreturn business lines or the pervasive digital transformation we embarked on starting 2014, and which carry through till today.\n\nConsumer Banking/ Wealth Management had a solid year, with total income up 25% to a record SGD 6.65 billion. Wealth Management\n\n## SGD 16.5 BILLION\n\nTotal income\n\nTotal income crossed SGD 16 billion for the \u0234 rst time.\n\n'2022 was a breakout year for DBS, with ROE signi \u0234 cantly surpassing previous records. This was the result of structural changes made over the years to transform the franchise. We have demonstrated over the past decade a track record of solid performance. In an increasingly fractured and unpredictable world, DBS will continue to be a di \u038d erent kind of bank - one that is trusted, purpose-driven and innovationled so our customers can Live more, Bank less. '\n\ncustomer segment income rose 20% as higher interest rates bene \u0234 tted deposit income, more than o \u038d setting a decline in investment product sales. Assets under management increased by 3% in constant currency terms to SGD 297 billion, boosted by a doubling of net new monies to SGD 24 billion. Our consumer banking franchise also did well.\n\nInstitutional Banking, which saw income rise 28% to a record SGD 7.69 billion, was buoyed by corporate lending, cash management and treasury customer sales. Growth in non-trade loans was broad-based across industries and geographies. Our early investment in digital transactional capabilities continued to pay o \u038d , as we won over 800 cash management mandates in 2022. Corporate operating\n\n## SGD 8.19 BILLION\n\n## Net pro \u0234 t\n\nNet pro \u0234 t rose 20% to a record SGD 8.19 billion, as we bene \u0234 tted from higher interest rates and reaped the rewards of structural changes made over the years.\n\nbalances also rose signi \u0234 cantly. Income from Treasury Markets normalised from the previous year's exceptional levels to SGD 1.17 billion.\n\nAcross the franchise, asset quality remained resilient, with the non-performing loan ratio at 1.1%, from 1.3% previously. During the year, we did a range of stress tests under conservative assumptions. These included stress-testing oil at USD 200 a barrel, interest rates at 6-7% for our SME portfolio and a deep recession impacting the cash \u0235 ow of our customers by 30%. Across most of these situations, we are con \u0234 dent that asset quality is robust.\n\nIn a turbulent time for the global economy, DBS continued to be recognised for our safety,\n\n## SGD 2.00\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board proposed a \u0234 nal dividend of 42 cents per share, and a special dividend of 50 cents per share, bringing the full-year dividend to SGD 2.00 per share.\n\n## 15.0%\n\nReturn on equity Return on equity climbed from 12.5% to a new high of 15.0%.\n\nand liquidity was healthy. Underlining the solidity of our franchise, DBS was named by Global Finance as \"Safest Bank in Asia\" for the 14th consecutive year.\n\n## Cementing our Asia franchise\n\nAs an Asia-centric bank, in the long term, DBS needs to be more deeply embedded in one or more of our four markets outside of Singapore and Hong Kong, which include China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan.\n\nIn 2022, notwithstanding the China-US trade tensions and China's zero-Covid policy, DBS continued to make headway in growing its Greater Bay Area (GBA) franchise. Since launching our GBA strategy in 2018, our large-corporate business targeting companies in China's strategic industries including high-end manufacturing, technology and the new economy, has seen robust growth. Our SME business in the GBA region has also performed well. In the wealth space, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) now provides investment products and solutions to customers from DBS China, Postal Savings Bank of China and Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank. This makes DBS the only bank with three Southbound Wealth Management Connect partners.\n\nFollowing the amalgamation of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) with DBS India in late 2020, all e \u038d orts have been focused on integrating both franchises smoothly. In 2022, this involved optimising the combined DBS/ LVB branch network, rebranding the LVB branches, and migrating all former LVB customers to DBS technology systems and operating platforms. With our enlarged presence of over 520 branches across 350 locations, 2.5 million retail customers and 15,000 corporate customers, we now have a strong platform from which to accelerate growth. Strategic partnerships including those with Bajaj Finserv to launch our \u0234 rst-ever credit card in India and with ODeX to provide straight-through credit solutions to freight forwarders, continued to scale well. These initiatives helped deliver stronger consumer and SME assets growth, as well as higher income and pro \u0234 tability.\n\nIn Taiwan, where DBS agreed to acquire Citi's consumer banking business, we are on track to complete and integrate the acquisition by August 2023. The acquisition will accelerate DBS Taiwan's growth by at least 10 years, making it Taiwan's largest foreign bank by assets. Material synergies will be realised from the combined entity's enlarged scale.",

        "page_content": "In November, DBS opened a representative o \u025d ce in Bangladesh, bringing the bank's international presence to 19 markets globally. Bangladesh is an attractive investment destination for companies in various sectors, such as power, energy, and transport and logistics. The establishment of DBS Dhaka will provide further impetus to the bank's activities and enable greater market connectivity to DBS' customers globally.\n\n## A new way of working\n\nWhile DBS was ahead of the curve in transforming digitally, we recognise that digitalisation has become table stakes at most banks. However, there are three areas in which we have invested that continue to be di \u038d erentiating.\n\nThe \u0234 rst is the industrialisation of arti \u0234 cial intelligence (AI)/ machine learning (ML) and data analytics usage across the bank. Our 260 use cases span customer-facing businesses such as consumer and SME banking, and support functions including Legal and Compliance, and Human Resources. For example, DBS sends 45 million hyperpersonalised nudges each month to customers across the region with suggestions on how to make their money work harder. In the SME space, AI/ ML is used to provide businesses with early warning signals of potential credit stress. In 2022, the revenue uplift from our AI/ ML initiatives was about SGD 150 million, more than double that from the previous year.\n\nThe second is our ecosystem strategy, which has allowed us to scale up our business in the large Asian markets without high customer acquisition costs. DBS nearly doubled our ecosystem-led consumer \u0234 nance lending in 2022. This was made possible through our partnerships with companies such as ByteDance, Ctrip, Home Credit and Kredivo in markets like China and Indonesia. In institutional banking, we also had good traction in onboarding large platform companies, and through our API suite, \u0234 nancing their extensive supply chains digitally.\n\nThe third is in the way we manage. While technology is an enabler, companies need to focus on the customer and speed to market to win. This requires a workforce that is agile, nimble, experimental, learning and willing to take risks. A big focus at DBS has been on enabling this internally.\n\nPreviously, we had programmed change within the organisation such that our employees are trained to put the customer at the heart of all we do. In the past two years, we took this up a notch with the introduction of a new operating model 'Managing through Journeys' (MtJs). With MtJ, we re-architected our most important\n\ncustomer processes - such as those around credit cards, wealth management, consumer \u0234 nance, transactional foreign exchange and SMEs - horizontally. Through the formation of cross-functional squads which are guided by data-driven control towers, we have become more agile in delivering new products, and responding to customer pain points and needs. This has translated to improved customer satisfaction, faster turnaround times and positive revenue impact.\n\n## Our sustainability commitments\n\nOur conviction has always been that our netzero commitment, made in October 2021, must be supported by a clear and detailed roadmap and plan.\n\nIn September 2022, DBS unveiled this plan,\n\nwhich is one of the most comprehensive\n\nin scope in the global banking industry. Speci \u0234 cally, we set 2030 interim decarbonisation targets - that are aligned with science-informed decarbonisation glidepaths - for seven sectors. These are power, oil and gas, automotive, aviation, shipping, steel and real estate. Data coverage targets were also set for two sectors, food and agribusiness, and chemicals. The nine sectors represent the most carbon-intensive institutional banking segments \u0234 nanced by DBS and constitute the vast majority of the Institutional Banking Group's (IBG's) \u0234 nanced emissions.\n\nAs part of the implementation roadmap, DBS will proactively partner our customers with advisory and \u0234 nancial solutions to accelerate their transition to a lower-carbon future. We are con \u0234 dent that many will be willing to come along with us on the journey. This con \u0234 dence is borne out by our fast-growing sustainable \u0234 nance book. We had originally set a target to do SGD 50 billion in sustainable \u0234 nance\n\nloans by 2024. As at end-2022, our sustainable \u0234 nance portfolio was SGD 61 billion, exceeding our target well ahead of 2024.\n\nIn line with e \u038d orts to embed sustainability in our business practices and operations, we refurbished an old o \u025d ce in Newton into Singapore's \u0234 rst net-zero building by a bank. We also launched an in-house caf\u00e9 at our headquarters that minimises the bank's carbon footprint and gives new life to food waste. These e \u038d orts contributed towards DBS achieving carbon neutrality in our operations as at end-2022.\n\nOn the social agenda, the new Community Impact chapter of DBS Foundation aims to foster a more equitable and inclusive society. A total of SGD 5.6 million was committed towards 10 inaugural programmes across our core markets of Singapore, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia and Taiwan.\n\nOne such programme is in partnership with Haqdarshak Empowerment Solutions, which will provide digital and \u0234 nancial literacy courses, and access to social welfare schemes, to 200,000 marginalised individuals in India.\n\nFor DBS' commitment to sustainability, the bank was recognised by Global Finance as the global winner for 'Financial Leadership in Sustaining Communities'. DBS was also named to the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index and the FTSE4Good Developed Index for the sixth consecutive year.\n\n## Board and management changes\n\nWe would like to express our gratitude to Ho Tian Yee, who is stepping down as a board member in March 2023, for his invaluable contributions. Since joining the DBS Board in 2011, Tian Yee has served in several capacities including as Lead Independent Director and\n\nDBS is the only bank with three Southbound Wealth Management Connect partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDBS CEO Piyush Gupta (second from left) announcing the bank's decarbonisation targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman of the Nominating Committee. We have bene \u0234 tted greatly from his wisdom and insights through the years.\n\nUnderscoring our deep bench strength, we are pleased that we were able to \u0234 ll two Country Head roles from our slate of internal candidates when the incumbents retired.\n\nVeteran banker Ginger Cheng succeeded Neil Ge when he retired as Country CEO of DBS China. A Chinese citizen, Ginger has had a distinguished 20-year career in DBS spanning Hong Kong and China. Under her leadership, DBS' IBG business in China had grown exponentially, with increased connectivity across the region.\n\nLim Chu Chong, a career DBS banker, took over as President Director of PT Bank DBS Indonesia, succeeding Paulus Sutisna. A seasoned corporate banker, Chu Chong had held various roles in DBS including Regional Head of SME Banking, Head of IBG in China and Chief Operating O \u025d cer of IBG. Between 2011 and 2016, he was also non-Independent Commissioner of DBS Indonesia.\n\n## Dividends\n\nGiven the record pro \u0234 t and strong capital base, the Board has proposed a \u0234 nal dividend of 42 cents per share and a special dividend of 50 cents a share, bringing the full-year dividend to SGD 2.00 per share. Barring unforeseen\n\ncircumstances, the annualised dividend going forward will be SGD 1.68 per share.\n\n## Going forward\n\nWhile uncertainties remain, macroeconomic conditions are improving. Global in \u0235 ation is expected to decline this year. China's reopening paves the way for a rebound in economic activity. The IMF recently upgraded its growth forecast for 2023 from 2.7% to 2.9%, though this is still below 3.4% in 2022.\n\nAlthough we remain watchful, we take heart that our loan pipeline looks healthy. If animal spirits return to markets, we should also see some upside to fee income. Barring any unexpected shocks to the global economy, DBS' ROE will comfortably be above 15%.\n\nDespite the collapse in market and \u0234 ntech valuations, our ambition to become more like a technology company also remains intact. This re \u0235 ects a belief that the future of \u0234 nance will be underpinned by technology. As we look ahead, we will continue to cement our digital banking leadership, while strategically placing our bets in emerging technologies. It is also imperative that we remain focused on advancing the sustainability agenda and executing on our net-zero commitments.\n\n2022 was a breakout year for DBS, with ROE signi \u0234 cantly surpassing previous records. This was the result of structural changes made\n\nover the years to transform the franchise. We have demonstrated over the past decade a track record of solid performance. In an increasingly fractured and unpredictable world, DBS will continue to be a di \u038d erent kind of bank - one that is trusted, purpose-driven and innovation-led so our customers can Live more, Bank less .\n\nPeter Seah Chairman DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPiyush Gupta Chief Executive O \u025d cer DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->",

More recently, we took this up a notch and reorganised the way we work by Managing through Journeys (MtJs). MtJs enable the bank to function as a Horizontal Organisation, with cross-functional teams across the bank collaborating to deliver value and enhanced customer experiences. These e  orts have resulted in improved customer satisfaction in consumer and SME banking. Employee engagement has also risen, with DBS continuing to be Kincentric's Best Employer in Singapore and across Asia-Paci  c.\n\n## Industrialising innovation\n\nWe seek to industrialise innovation throughout the organisation. Through a proprietary Innovation Pyramid framework, we explore and exploit\n\npropositions that are new to bank, new to industry and new to the world. For instance, to be future-ready, we take bets on technologies that may mature only in a few years. Highpro  le new businesses such as DBS Digital Exchange and Partior are examples of such bets. We challenge business teams to conceptualise innovations, or 'moonshot solutions', that do not currently exist. Product teams are also tasked with elevating existing propositions to exceed customer expectations. Finally, to awaken the innovation DNA in all employees, we often run internal campaigns to crowdsource the best ideas from the bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCultivating a futureready workforce through training and development Recognising that our people are the driving force behind DBS' transformation, we place signi  cant focus on training and development. DBS' Tech Academy builds technical expertise through in-house curriculums developed by subject matter experts. Since 2021, over 9,000 employees have taken upskilling courses in data and arti  cial intelligence, while 7,000 have attended site reliability engineering training. We also launched our DBS Sustainability Learning Campus to provide learning opportunities for all employees on sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diversifying our tech workforce\n\nWe incorporated an innovation triangle - comprising three technological hubs - in Singapore, India and China, to grow our own timber. Our technology hubs in Singapore sit under DBS Tech Singapore, while DBS Asia Hub 2 in Hyderabad has been rebranded as DBS Tech India. DBS Tech China will be launched in Guangzhou in mid-2024. These hubs will facilitate continual innovation, provide diversity, and hone our talents as they learn from each other.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransforming our workspaces for optimal hybrid working With hybrid work practices, DBS employees now spend three days in the o   ce and two days working from home. To ensure that their time in the o   ce is conducive to ideation, collaboration and social connections, we continue to experiment with design of spaces. We have done a series of experiments to drive creative thinking with   exible furniture, immersive lighting and writable surfaces. The insights gathered from employee feedback are being used to design and curate productive workspaces for the future.",

        "page_content": "## CEO re \u0235 ections\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Piyush Gupta shares his views on key issues driving the coming year's performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What is the outlook for the coming year? Q1\n\nIt is clear the global economy is slowing because of the aggressive tightening by the US Fed, which has occurred alongside ongoing geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions. The IMF has projected 2023 global economic growth to be at 2.9%, which would be lower than the 3.4% for 2022.\n\nI expect US interest rates to increase to around 5% and stay there in 2023. The latest core Personal Consumption Expenditures price index of more than 4% is still above the Fed's target. At the same time, job creation in the US remains strong, with the unemployment rate of 3.4% in January 2023, the lowest since 1969.\n\nBut several green shoots are emerging.\n\nFirst, in \u0235 ation is moderating. Energy prices have declined due to a warmer northern winter and the availability of replacements for Russian oil and gas. At the same time, supply chain constraints have eased signi \u0234 cantly as port backlogs are cleared. With interest rates already in restrictive territory, \u0234 nancial markets have started to price in the end of the rate upcycle. If in \u0235 ation continues to ease and a mild recession ensues in the developed economies, we will end up with a soft landing.\n\nSecond, China's reopening will provide a substantial boost to economic activity, particularly in Asia. We have seen how other countries' reopening in the past year created a resurgence in travel and tourism, which are major economic sectors. China is bigger than other countries in the region. I expect consumption to substantially increase and energies unleashed across the region in the coming year now that the short-term pain from China's reopening appears to have passed.\n\nDomestically, China has also corrected course on policies that clamped down on what it saw as excesses in key sectors. In the property sector, it has now provided liquidity support, including for the weakest companies. I do not foresee any property crisis there. In the technology sector, it has allowed major companies to release new games, sign up new customers and carry out new fundraising.\n\nThird, geopolitical tensions have started to ease, although spats could occur from time to time. The tone has softened since Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping met in Bali in November. China has subsequently appointed its ambassador to the US, who customarily spoke in more measured tones than his wolf warrior foreign ministry colleagues, as foreign minister. High-level exchanges with the US have resumed, with both sides' foreign\n\nand \u0234 nance ministers meeting in recent months. Relations with Australia have similarly improved with the resumption of senior government exchanges as well as the easing of trade bans, including for coal, a major export.\n\nOne consequence of these improvements will be the return of animal spirits to \u0234 nancial markets - well before their e \u038d ects are felt in the real economy. Since the start of the year, \u0234 nancial assets led by equities and bonds globally have clawed back some of the losses incurred in 2022. I believe Asian markets, having underperformed US markets over the past two years, will lead the upturn.\n\nThe macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop bodes well for our operating outlook in the coming year. A sustained level of high interest rates is bene \u0234 cial to our established Casa deposit franchise. Our latest net interest margin is now running at more than 2%, which is the highest in more than a decade. The higher rates, together with structural improvements from transformation initiatives, will enable us to sustain a ROE of more than 15% in the foreseeable future. At the same time, the restored con \u0234 dence in \u0234 nancial markets will lead to a signi \u0234 cant recovery in our wealth management fee income, which was the major drag on our performance in 2022. These factors will more than make up for any potential increase in credit costs. Although idiosyncratic risks cannot be ruled out, our ongoing stress tests indicate that asset quality will remain benign in the coming year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Can ROE be sustained above 15%?\n\nOur ROE reached a new high of 17% in the second half of 2022. Higher interest rates were a big tailwind, but the record pro \u0234 tability was also driven by signi \u0234 cant improvements we made to the franchise.\n\nIf we look back to 2006-2007, when interest rates (and allowance charges) were at similar levels to the second half of 2022, our ROE was 12-13%. So there has been a four percentage point structural improvement in ROE.\n\nThe key to the improvement has been our digital transformation. In 2017, we laid out our thesis that digitalisation would enable us to increase wallet share with lower marginal costs.\n\nIn the consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong, where the bene \u0234 ts of digitalisation are most visible, we grew the proportion of digitally-engaged customers from 42% in 2017 to 60% in 2022. Over the past \u0234 ve years, these customers brought in more than twice the income on average than non-digital customers. They were also more cost e \u025d cient to serve. As a result, the\n\nROE they generated was a signi \u0234 cant 15 percentage points more than non-digital ones. The growing proportion of digital customers enabled operating pro \u0234 t of the consumer and SME businesses in these locations to grow at a compounded annual rate of 7% with ROE rising from 23% to 37%.\n\nWe also extended the digital transformation to other parts of the bank. In private banking, it enabled relationship managers to deliver hyper-personalised services to customers, resulting in more customer transactions. In corporate banking, the integration of our services directly into customers' supply chains and networks using application programming interface software (or APIs) resulted in higher volumes at lower costs. In Treasury Markets, the full business process - from distribution to structuring to risk warehousing - was digitalised, enabling us to handle higher volumes with greater speed.\n\nThe results are clear. Our assets under management grew at an 8% compounded annual rate since 2017, outpacing the market in Asia. Transaction services fees also increased at an 8% compounded annual rate, while GTS deposits rose almost 40%. Treasury Markets income growth and returns for the past \u0234 ve years surpassed the performance of global peers that we track. Wealth management, transaction services and treasury customer sales - which are low-capital-usage and high-return businesses - now make up a greater proportion of income compared to \u0234 ve years ago, resulting in higher ROE for the group.\n\nWe have also improved credit processes through the use of data and arti \u0234 cial intelligence for underwriting, early warning and portfolio management, which we expect to drive lower cost of credit going forward. In our key growth markets, we are scaling up organically and through acquisitions.\n\nThe announced increase in quarterly dividend payout to 42 cents per share and special dividend of 50 cents per share are part of our ongoing e \u038d orts to bring our CET1 ratio closer to the target and bene \u0234 t ROE.\n\nTo be sure, there will be a cyclical impact to ROE from changes in interest rates. If interest rates peak in the coming year, part of the ROE improvement so far will come o \u038d , but the structural gains will remain. We expect that as our digital transformation becomes more pervasive, an ROE of 15% is sustainable if interest rates do not return to the unusually low levels seen during most of the past decade.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Will the collapse of technology valuations and crypto asset prices in particular have any bearing on your strategy? Q3\n\n2022 saw a major sell-o \u038d in the market, particularly of technology stocks and crypto assets. However, this has little bearing on technology as a continued driver of the global economy. The dot.com crash at the turn of the century testi \u0234 es to that. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell by more than 75%. Twenty years on, more than 60% of the global population are Internet users. Social media is a cultural phenomenon. Mobile and online technology have fundamentally reshaped business models.\n\nThe fact is that valuations are not necessarily the best indicator of the underlying promise of a technology. Indeed, some technologies we see today have the potential to be truly game-changing.\n\nFor example, digital technology is here to stay because it has fundamentally altered the way we live, work and play.\n\nAs for arti \u0234 cial intelligence (AI)/ machine learning (ML), it is already a big part of our lives today. We use conversational AI through our interactions with Siri or Alexa, and AI-powered recommendation engines in our Spotify and Net \u0235 ix selections. With ChatGPT taking the world by storm recently, 2023 is set to be a year of generative AI.\n\nBlockchain/ distributed ledger technology allows us to reimagine work \u0235 ows, such as those pertaining to clearing and settlements. This could dramatically change backo \u025d ce operations by reducing costs and boosting overall e \u025d ciency and e \u038d ectiveness. Tokenisation and digital monies will also be a part of our future.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, our fundamental thesis is that DBS needs to be a technology leader. We have been building our technological prowess over the years, and will continue to do so in two ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Internally, DBS has more than 10,000 technologists, as well as two tech centres in Singapore and India today. A third centre will be established in China in mid-2024, giving us access to new tech talent even as we continue to train thousands of our people in AI/ ML and other new technologies. We will continue to invest in strengthening our technological muscle in areas such as cloud computing and site reliability engineering so as to improve scalability, automation and speed to market, while enhancing system resiliency at reduced costs. We will also build on our AI/ ML capabilities, adding to the 260 use cases\n\nwe have to improve productivity, streamline work processes and o \u038d er hyper-personalised insights and nudges to customers.\n\n- \u00b7 Externally, the bank has sponsored several new businesses, such as Partior and Climate Impact X (CIX). Leveraging blockchain technology, Partior seeks to streamline ine \u025d ciencies in cross-border clearing and settlement, while CIX enables the trading of high-quality carbon credits. We have also established DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx) and FIX Marketplace. DDEx is a bank-backed crypto trading exchange, while FIX Marketplace is Asia's \u0234 rst fully digital and automated \u0234 xed income execution platform. These initiatives not only provide valuable insights into emerging technologies but are also medium-term bets on the future of \u0234 nance.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to trial new initiatives. In 2022, DBS collaborated with the Monetary Authority of Singapore on two applications. The \u0234 rst involved using programmable money and retail central bank digital currencies to distribute purpose-bound vouchers. The second experimented with the trading of tokenised assets. Both pilots allowed us to test new capabilities including the use of smart contracts and the integration of traditional \u0234 nance with decentralised \u0234 nance.\n\nIn an ironic way, the collapse in valuations is also helpful to us as it reduces unsustainable market competition. With cheap money \u0235 ooding markets in recent years, a lot of tech companies had been competing irrationally. The latest correction makes for a more rational marketplace. We may also \u0234 nd that as tech valuations become more reasonable, there may be opportunities to enhance our capabilities.\n\nThe \u0234 nancial services industry is on the cusp of being reshaped by technology, and we must continue to be at the forefront of change for the bene \u0234 t of customers and society-at-large.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPiyush Gupta Chief Executive O \u025d cer DBS Group Holdings",

        "page_content": "## CFO statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe achieved another record performance, with ROE climbing to 15%. The results re \u0235 ected the pervasive digital transformation we have been making for more than a decade.\n\n## Record performance amidst macroeconomic uncertainty and \u0234 nancial market volatility re \u0235 ects fruits of pervasive transformation\n\nWe achieved another record performance in 2022 as net pro \u0234 t rose 20% from a year ago to SGD 8.19 billion. Return on equity climbed to 15%, pulling away from previous highs clustered around 12-13%. The results were driven by a 16% increase in total income to SGD 16.5 billion, which passed the SGD 16 billion mark for the \u0234 rst time.\n\nUnderpinning the growth was a 30% increase in net interest income to SGD 10.9 billion, boosted by a higher net interest margin as interest rates rose, as well as loan growth. Non-interest income was 3% lower than the previous year's record due to \u0234 nancial market volatility. Lower wealth management and investment banking fees as well as gains on investment securities were o \u038d set by growth in other fee income activities and net trading income.\n\nThe signi \u0234 cant jump in our results re \u0235 ected the pervasive digital transformation we have been making to our franchise for more than\n\na decade. Average interest rates for the year were closer to the years before they were cut to near-zero over the previous two years, enabling the results of the transformation to become more apparent.\n\nOur digital transformation has become more entrenched since we \u0234 rst spoke about it in 2017. For wealth management and retail customers, we have been enhancing our digital platforms and increasingly using data and arti \u0234 cial intelligence to provide them with the tools and insights to manage wealth on their own. We have also made it more convenient for them to carry out payments for everyday activities. For corporates, which already use our cash management platforms for collections and payments, we have employed application programming interfaces (APIs) to embed ourselves into customer \u0235 ows and scale up supply chain \u0234 nancing. In Treasury Markets, digitalisation has enabled us to handle higher volumes with faster turnaround times, improve trading e \u025d ciency and strengthen risk management.\n\nThe upshot of all this has been even stickier and deeper customer relationships, greater income per customer and lower unit cost of serving them. A few speci \u0234 c outcomes of the transformation were pertinent to the year's performance.\n\nFirst, by cementing our status as customers' primary bank, we were able to attract - and, crucially, retain - low-cost current and savings account (Casa) deposits. During the period of quantitative easing in 2020-21, our Casa deposits had risen by 60% or SGD 143 billion to SGD 381 billion, a signi \u0234 cantly higher percentage growth than peers despite starting from a much larger base. While Casa deposits did \u0235 ow out in the second half as expected as interest rates rose, half of the earlier in \u0235 ows did stay with us, and we ended 2022 with Casa deposits of SGD 318 billion. The expanded Casa base enabled us to enjoy higher leverage to rising rates than in prior years, which contributed to the strong total income growth.\n\nSecond, several fee income activities were structurally larger. Credit and debit card billings rose by double-digit percentage terms for a second consecutive year, reaching new highs as our consumer payments platforms captured the post-pandemic spending recovery. Transaction service fees were propelled by higher domestic and cross-border payment volumes as well as new customer mandates. Compared to 2017, fee income from cards and from transaction services were around 50% bigger. Even wealth management fees, which declined 26% in 2022 due to \u0234 nancial market volatility, remained two\u0234 fths larger than \u0234 ve years ago. The cumulative \u0234 ve-year growth rates of these fee income activities were above peers.\n\nThird, the Treasury Markets business delivered both strong growth and higher returns over the past \u0234 ve years. Income from trading and customer sales was two\u0234 fths larger than in 2017.\n\nThe digitalisation of our business also meant greater operating leverage as an incremental dollar of income could be generated with lower incremental unit cost. The full-year cost-income ratio improved three percentage points from a year ago to 43%. The second-half underlying ratio was 41%, in line with the longer-term target of around 40% that we had indicated several years ago.\n\n## Sustained business momentum augmented by higher net interest margin in 2022\n\nDuring the year, net interest income and net interest margin increased at an accelerated pace as the year progressed. Net interest income grew 11% in the \u0234 rst half and 48% in the second half compared to the year-ago period, resulting in a full-year increase of 30% to SGD 10.9 billion.\n\nNet interest margin rose 30 basis points to 1.75%, with majority of the increase occurring in the second half when the impact of interest rate increases was more fully felt. The biggest\n\nquarterly increase in net interest margin occurred in the third quarter as cumulative Casa out \u0235 ows and higher deposit costs moderated the increase in the fourth quarter. The deposit beta - or the increase in overall deposit costs relative to market interest rates - rose progressively during the year to 32% by year-end. Still, net interest margin was 2.05% in the fourth quarter, signi \u0234 cantly above the 1.75% for the full year.\n\nThe reported net interest income and net interest margin were a \u038d ected by a drag from Treasury Markets due to higher funding costs for non-interest-bearing and marked-tomarket assets as well as net interest margin compression for \u0234 xed-income instruments. (The drag is neutralised by gains in other non-interest income and so does not a \u038d ect its overall income and earnings.) Net interest income for the Commercial book, which excludes Treasury Markets, rose 40% while its net interest margin increased 48 basis points to 2.11%, with its fourth-quarter net interest margin signi \u0234 cantly higher at 2.61%. In addition, net interest income and net interest margin did not bene \u0234 t yet from the repricing of SGD 180 billion of \u0234 xed-rate assets, which will take place in the coming years.\n\nLoans grew 4% in constant-currency terms during the year to SGD 415 billion. Growth in the \u0234 rst nine months was moderated by a slight decline in the fourth quarter. While underlying demand continued to be healthy in the last three months, some corporates shifted their borrowing to cheaper \u0234 nancing options or repaid opportunistic borrowing, and wealth management customers reduced margin loans.\n\nNon-trade corporate loans rose 5% or SGD 13 billion to SGD 248 billion. Like the previous year, the growth was diversi \u0234 ed across countries and sectors. By region, Singapore and Hong Kong accounted for half the growth, with the rest from elsewhere in the region and from our international centres. By industry, the growth was led by real estate, energy, and technology, media and telecoms. We carried out 156 sustainable loan transactions with a disbursement amount of SGD 20 billion, comparable to the previous year.\n\nTrade loans rose 4% or SGD 2 billion to SGD 44 billion, with an increase in the \u0234 rst half partially o \u038d set by a decline in the second half due to unattractive pricing.\n\nHousing loans rose 4% or SGD 3 billion to SGD 81 billion. While bookings were below the previous year's record in line with the lower number of market transactions, they were still healthy for new launches, resale activity and re \u0234 nancing.\n\nOther consumer loans fell 7% or SGD 3 billion to SGD 43 billion as wealth management loans declined with lower risk appetite amidst volatile \u0234 nancial markets.\n\nDeposits grew 7% or SGD 33 billion in constantcurrency terms to SGD 527 billion. In contrast to the previous two years, all of the growth was in \u0234 xed deposits, mostly in foreign currencies. These deposits were used to fund foreigncurrency loan growth, replace more expensive commercial paper, and replace Casa out \u0235 ows. Growing foreign-currency \u0234 xed deposits enabled us to maintain our surplus Singapore Casa deposits, whose returns progressively rose with interest rates. The ample liquidity resulted in a liquidity coverage ratio of 140% and net stable funding ratio of 117%, well above regulatory requirements.\n\nNet fee income declined 12% to SGD 3.09 billion. Wealth management fees fell 26% to SGD 1.33 billion as market volatility resulted in lower investment product sales. Bancassurance sales were moderately lower. The weaker market conditions also a \u038d ected investment banking fees, which fell 44% to SGD 121 million.\n\nOther fee activities continued to grow. Card fees rose 20% to SGD 858 million. The increase picked up as the year progressed and card fees surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the second half. Overall annual card spending rose to a second consecutive record with travel spending continuing to recover towards pre-pandemic levels. Transaction service fees were stable at SGD 929 million as growth led by cash management was moderated by lower brokerage commissions from institutions. Loanrelated fees rose 11% to SGD 459 million.\n\nOther non-interest income grew 11% to SGD 2.47 billion. Increases in Treasury Markets non-interest income as well as treasury customer sales to both corporate and wealth management customers were moderated by lower investment gains.\n\nBy business unit, Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management income rose 25% to SGD 6.65 billion as higher interest rates more than o \u038d set the impact of lower wealth management investment product sales. Wealth Management customer segment income increased 20% as higher interest rates more than o \u038d set lower fee income from investment sales. Assets under management grew 3% in constantcurrency terms to a new high of SGD 297 billion, underpinned by record net new money in \u0235 ows of SGD 24 billion. Institutional Banking income rose 28% to SGD 7.69 billion. The growth was led by a more than doubling of cash management income as a result of higher interest rates. Income from treasury customer sales was also higher. These gains were moderated by weaker capital markets activity. Treasury Markets income declined 22% from the previous year's exceptional levels to a more normalised SGD 1.17 billion.\n\nBy region, Singapore income rose 20% to SGD 10.6 billion from higher interest rates and loan growth. Net interest margin increased as loans\n\nrepriced in line with higher interest rates. Partially o \u038d setting the higher net interest income was lower fee income from wealth management and investment banking fees. Hong Kong income rose 16% in constantcurrency terms to SGD 2.92 billion from higher interest rates and higher trading gains, which were partially o \u038d set by lower fee income. Rest of Greater China income was stable at SGD 1.16 billion as higher net interest income and trading income were o \u038d set by lower fee income. South and Southeast Asia income rose 5% to SGD 1.18 billion from higher net interest income.\n\nExpenses rose 10% to SGD 7.09 billion, led by higher sta \u038d costs. The positive jaw of six percentage points resulted in a three percentage-point improvement in the costincome ratio to 43%. Pro \u0234 t before allowances rose to a new high of SGD 9.41 billion.\n\n## Balance sheet remains strong\n\nAsset quality was resilient throughout the year. Non-performing assets fell 12% to SGD 5.13 billion while the NPL ratio improved from 1.3% to 1.1%. New non-performing asset formation remained low and was o \u038d set by repayments and write-o \u038d s. Speci \u0234 c allowances amounted to eight basis points of loans or SGD 335 million, moderately below the 12 basis points a year ago.\n\nGeneral allowances of SGD 98 million were written back during the year due to transfers to NPA, upgrades and repayments. Total allowance reserves amounted to SGD 6.24 billion, comprising general allowance reserves of SGD 3.74 billion and speci \u0234 c allowance reserves of SGD 2.51 billion. Allowance coverage was at 122% and at 215% when collateral was considered.\n\nOur Common Equity Tier 1 ratio rose to 14.6%. The leverage ratio of 6.4% was more than twice the regulatory requirement of 3%.\n\n## Total shareholder returns\n\nWe delivered total shareholder returns of 8%, comprising share price gains of 4% and the dividend paid out during the calendar year of SGD 1.44 per share (comprising the \u0234 nal 2021 dividend and the dividends for the \u0234 rst three quarters of 2022, each of which was 36 cents per share).\n\n## Increase in quarterly dividend and a special dividend\n\nThe Board proposed a \u0234 nal dividend of 42 cents per share, an increase of six cents from the previous payout, and a special dividend of 50 cents per share.

Together with the ordinary dividends of 36 cents per share for each of the \u0234 rst three quarters, the total dividend payout for the \u0234 nancial year rose to SGD 2.00 per share, a 67% increase from the SGD 1.20 per share for \u0234 nancial year 2021.\n\nBarring unforeseen circumstances, the annualised dividend will rise to SGD 1.68 per share.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAt time of writing, macroeconomic conditions are improving. In \u0235 ation, while still high, is moderating. China's reopening will boost con \u0234 dence and\n\n## (A) Digitalisation\n\nWe continued to make signi \u0234 cant progress in our digital transformation for the Consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong. Our drive for deeper digital engagement resulted in the number of digital customers more than doubling from 1.9 million in 2015, when we \u0234 rst tracked customers' digital adoption, to 4.1 million in 2022. The proportion of digital customers rose by 27 percentage points over the seven years to 60%, delivering on our targets.\n\nThe share of income from digital customers rose 33 percentage points over the seven years to 82% in 2022. The digital segment continued to be more valuable due to stickier, deeper and broader customer relationships. With more diverse product holdings and number of transactions, digital customers consistently generated more than twice the income on average than traditional ones.\n\nThe reported cost-income ratio of the overall business improved by 11 percentage points from the previous year to 40% on the back of higher rates and volumes. On an underlying basis, which normalises for changes in net interest margin, the cost-income ratio was 44%, an improvement of one percentage point from the previous year. The underlying cost-income ratio improved \u0234 ve percentage points since 2015 even as we continued to invest to sustain our advantage over peers.\n\nThe ROE for the overall business in 2022 was 37%, with the digital segment at 39% compared to 24% for the traditional segment.\n\neconomic activity in the region. The IMF recently upgraded its global growth forecast for 2023 from 2.7% to 2.9%, although it would still be below the 3.4% in 2022.\n\nThe better environment will support business momentum in the coming year. We expect loans to grow by mid-single-digit percentage terms. Fee income should grow by double digits as the return of animal spirits to \u0234 nancial markets enables wealth management to recover from the declines in 2022, and as travel resumption boosts card spending further.\n\nOur full-year net interest margin will be signi \u0234 cantly higher due to base e \u038d ects as well as net bene \u0234 ts from further interest rate increases at least in the \u0234 rst few months of the year.\n\n## 2022 income\n\nOur current stress tests indicate that asset quality will remain benign, with speci \u0234 c allowance charges likely to be below our through-the-cycle average of around 20 basis points.\n\nIf these forecasts hold for the year, we expect to deliver another record performance in 2023.\n\ncer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChng Sok Hui Chief Financial O \u025d DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The overall consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong contributed 41% of Group income compared to 35% a year ago, boosted by higher rates and volumes.

Net interest income rose 68% to SGD 4.27 billion from a higher net interest margin and growth in loan and deposit volumes. Non-interest income fell 14% to SGD 2.38 billion on lower fee income from investment product sales and bancassurance. Expenses increased 13% to SGD 3.80 billion. Total allowances increased by SGD 112 million to SGD 158 million due mainly to higher general allowances. Pro \u0234 t before tax increased by 40% to SGD 2.69 billion.\n\nInstitutional Banking total income rose 28% to SGD 7.69 billion from higher net interest income, increased loan-related activities and stronger treasury customer \u0235 ows, o \u038d set by lower capital market activities. Expenses increased 8% to SGD 2.25 billion. Total allowances declined by SGD 345 million to a write-back of SGD 204 million. Pro \u0234 t before tax rose 50% to SGD 5.64 billion.\n\nTreasury Markets total income normalised to SGD 1.17 billion mainly due to lower contributions from equity derivatives and interest rate activities, partially o \u038d set by foreign exchange and credit activities. Expenses fell 4% to SGD 619 million from lower operating costs partially o \u038d set by higher sta \u038d costs. Pro \u0234 t before tax fell 34% to SGD 569 million.\n\nThe Others segment encompasses the results of corporate decisions that are not attributed to business segments. It includes earnings on capital deployed into high quality assets, earnings from non-core asset sales and certain other head o \u025d ce items such as centrally raised allowances. DBS Vickers is also included in this segment.\n\n|                                                      | Commercial book                       | Commercial book        | Commercial book   |                   |        |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|\n| (SGD million)                                        | Consumer  Banking/ Wealth  Management | Institutional  Banking | Others            | Treasury  Markets | Total  |\n| Year 2022                                            |                                       |                        |                   |                   |        |\n| Net interest income                                  | 4,270                                 | 5,569                  | 880               | 222               | 10,941 |\n| Net fee and commission     income                    | 1,783                                 | 1,293                  | 15                | -                 | 3,091  |\n| Other non-interest     income                        | 601                                   | 826                    | 91                | 952               | 2,470  |\n| Total income                                         | 6,654                                 | 7,688                  | 986               | 1,174             | 16,502 |\n| Expenses                                             | 3,803                                 | 2,254                  | 414               | 619               | 7,090  |\n| Total allowances                                     | 158                                   | (204)                  | 293               | (10)              | 237    |\n| Share of pro \u0234  ts/ losses     of associates and JVs | -                                     | -                      | 203               | 4                 | 207    |\n| Pro \u0234   t before tax                                 | 2,693                                 | 5,638                  | 482               | 569               | 9,382  |\n| Year 202 \u0382                                           |                                       |                        |                   |                   |        |\n| Net interest income                                  | 2,548                                 | 3,999                  | 1,110             | 783               | 8,440  |\n| Net fee and commission     income                    | 2,186                                 | 1,282                  | 56                | -                 | 3,524  |\n| Other non-interest     income                        | 588                                   | 703                    | 207               | 726               | 2,224  |\n| Total income                                         | 5,322                                 | 5,984                  | 1,373             | 1,509             | 14,188 |\n| Expenses  ( \u0382 )                                      | 3,353                                 | 2,086                  | 383               | 647               | 6,469  |\n| Total allowances                                     | 46                                    | 141                    | (130)             | (5)               | 52     |\n| Share of pro \u0234  ts/ losses    of associates and JVs  | -                                     | -                      | 109               | -                 | 109    |\n| Pro \u0234   t before tax                                 | 1,923                                 | 3,757                  | 1,229             | 867               | 7,776  |\n\n- (1) Excluding one-time items",

Its full-year NIM rose 48 basis points to 2.11% from higher interest rates. The fourthquarter NIM was signi \u0234 cantly higher at 2.61%, having risen 100 basis points from fourthquarter 2021.\n\nThe increase in Commercial book net interest income was o \u038d set by a 72% decline in Treasury Markets net interest income to SGD 222 million due to higher funding costs for its operations. The drag in its net interest income is generally o \u038d set by gains in the non-interest income line.\n\nAs a result, overall net interest income grew 30% to SGD 10.9 billion.\n\nGross loans grew 4% or SGD 14 billion in constant-currency terms to SGD 420 billion. Non-trade corporate loans increased 5% or SGD 13 billion from broad-based growth across countries and sectors. Trade loans rose 4% or SGD 2 billion, with an increase in the \u0234 rst half partially o \u038d set by a decline in the second half due to unattractive pricing. Housing loans grew 4% or SGD 3 billion, with the majority of the growth occurring in the second half. Other consumer loans fell 7% or SGD 3 billion as wealth management loans declined.\n\nDeposits rose 7% or SGD 33 billion in constantcurrency terms to SGD 527 billion as \u0234 xed deposit growth more than o \u038d set current and savings account out \u0235 ows. Our market share of Singapore savings deposits rose 0.7 percentage points during the year to slightly more than 53%.\n\n## (D) Non-interest income\n\nNet fee income fell 12% to SGD 3.09 billion. Wealth management fees declined 26% to SGD 1.33 billion as weaker market conditions led to lower investment product sales. Investment banking fees were also lower, by 44% to SGD 121 million, as capital market activities slowed.\n\n- (1) Includes trade & remittances, guarantees and deposit-related fees\n- (2) Net of interchange fees paid\n\n## Net interest margin (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Deposits (SGD billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                      | 2022   | 202 \u0382   |\n|----------------------|--------|---------|\n| Ratios (%)           |        |         |\n| Casa/ total deposits | 60     | 76      |\n| LDR                  | 79     | 81      |\n| LCR                  | 140    | 135     |\n| NSFR                 | 117    | 123     |\n\n## Fee income\n\n| (SGD million)                       | 2022   | 202 \u0382   | YoY%   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Investment banking                  | 121    | 218     | (44)   |\n| Transaction services ( \u0382 )          | 929    | 925     | 0      |\n| Loan-related                        | 459    | 413     | 11     |\n| Cards                               | 858    | 715     | 20     |\n| Wealth management (2)               | 1,330  | 1,786   | (26)   |\n| Fee and commission income           | 3,697  | 4,057   | (9)    |\n| Less: Fee and commission expense    | 606    | 533     | 14     |\n| Total net fee and commission income | 3,091  | 3,524   | (12)   |\n\nOther fee activities continued to grow.

Transaction service fees were stable at SGD 929 million as higher cash management and trade fees were o \u038d set by lower brokerage commissions from institutional clients.\n\nOther non-interest income rose 11% to SGD 2.47 billion, which was due mainly to Treasury Markets activities.\n\n## (E) Expenses\n\nExpenses rose 10% to SGD 7.09 billion. The increase was led by a 13% increase in sta \u038d costs. Other costs also increased due to higher computerisation expenses.\n\n## (F) Asset quality\n\nNon-performing assets fell 12% to SGD 5.13 billion.

There was a general write-back of SGD 98 million from transfers to NPA, upgrades and repayments.\n\nAllowance reserves continued to be high.

Business and technology teams have been aligned with MtJs, ensuring common technology prioritisation across units.\n\nBy implementing a framework to align performance management of the cross-functional teams under MtJs, we provided clarity and accountability over key drivers and business and customer outcomes. As a result, we have seen signi \u0234 cant positive impact from the new way of managing our businesses.\n\nWe made good progress in our Consumer Banking journeys.\n\nIn our Cards and Consumer Finance businesses, we developed new capabilities, strengthened customer value propositions, and optimised application journeys through customer immersions, use of AI/ ML, and experimentation. In our Consumer Finance business, we onboarded new ecosystem partners and transformed the unsecured lending experience across the region through data and digital capabilities. These initiatives resulted in high customer service scores in Singapore, Hong Kong and India.\n\nIn our Treasures business, we expanded the use of AI/ ML-driven contextual nudges to relationship managers (RMs) as well as to customers through digital channels. This led to increased customer engagement by 27% through RMs and 10% through digital channels. Our e \u038d orts to continuously identify and resolve customer pain points led to improvements in service response time in most markets. Beyond our Cards, Consumer Finance and Treasures businesses, we also scaled journey thinking across the rest of our consumer banking product and retail segments.\n\nOur digital acquisition channel shares for Cards and Treasures remained \u0235 at, while that for Consumer Finance saw an increase led by growth in Singapore and India. In both these countries, almost all loan origination is now fully digital.\n\n| Digital Acquisition Channel Share    | 2021   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Credit Card                          | 88%    | 87%    |\n| Consumer Finance (Unsecured lending) | 76%    | 83%    |\n| Treasures                            | 57%    | 56%    |\n\nWe enhanced and expanded our Institutional Banking journeys by working in horizontal teams and using AI/ ML and experimentation.\n\nIn our global supply chain business, we improved the transaction journey for suppliers and distributors. This resulted in strong growth in the number of suppliers and distributors to almost 6,500. We also saw signi \u0234 cant growth in assets (57%) and revenue (23%) as well as a strong customer satisfaction score of 4.51 out of 5.\n\nIn our SME business, our new way of working led to strong revenue growth as well as improvements in customer service scores in Singapore and Hong Kong. Embedding data-driven decisions into the daily fabric of our businesses helped drive Singapore SME CASA market share and reduced Hong Kong servicing call volumes by 20%.\n\nOur transactional foreign exchange (FX) business saw our Treasury Markets, Global Transaction Services, and technology teams working horizontally, enabling greater nimbleness in responding to customers' needs and innovating with new products, services and experiences. We also used AI/ ML to enable continuous engagement with customers based on their activities and market movements. Our FX business saw a 15% growth in revenues and a customer satisfaction score of 4.47 out of 5.\n\nRead more about this in the Letter from the Chairman and CEO on page 8.\n\nTransforming toward managing through journeys\n\nDesign improvement in journey architecture for managing through journeys (MtJs)\n\nDeliver di \u038d erentiated customer experiences and superior outcomes",

We stayed vigilant and our portfolios remained resilient and asset quality stable.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to identify and monitor top and emerging risks across various areas, including (i) credit and portfolio management, (ii) environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, (iii) market and liquidity risks, (iv) new business risks, (v) technology risk, (vi) \u0234 nancial crime risk, (vii) data governance risk, and (viii) cyber security and data protection.\n\nOur robust risk management e \u038d orts were recognised when DBS was awarded the 'Best Risk Management' award at the 2022 Singapore Corporate Awards.\n\n## Credit risk and portfolio management\n\nIn 2022, the Russia-Ukraine con \u0235 ict resulted in a slowdown of economic growth and increased in \u0235 ationary pressures across the commodities complex, including oil, gas, and food. Portfolio reviews were conducted in light of these developments. Many sectors, especially for industries with inelastic demand, were able to pass on the higher costs to their customers. While there were no immediate concerns, DBS continued to monitor for potential downstream e \u038d ects.\n\nAs in \u0235 ationary pressures persisted, central banks began raising interest rates in response. We evaluated our portfolios taking into account the potential impacts of higher interest rates, slower economic growth, and depreciation of multiple currencies against the USD. While the SMEs were assessed to be the most vulnerable, our SME portfolio had been well-tested in previous years and was mostly on a secured basis. Notwithstanding these headwinds, DBS' overall consumer credit quality remained stable. Residential mortgages, which were primarily in Singapore and Hong Kong, were mainly for owner-occupation and well-secured\n\nwith low loan-to-value ratios. Unsecured consumer credit loans represented less than 2% of the bank's total loan exposure.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by China's zeroCovid policy and liquidity issues in the Chinese real estate market, our portfolio remained resilient as our corporate exposure was mainly to top industry players, and consumer exposure was limited. Our Chinese real estate exposures were mainly to larger and investment-grade names, with the remaining exposure generally well-secured. As contagion risks stayed elevated, we remained cautious and closely monitored our exposures.\n\nWe saw heightened US-China tensions with increasing military activity, trade restrictions, and the US chip ban. While there was no immediate impact to our portfolio, we continued to closely monitor the situation as it evolved.\n\nWe closely monitored our portfolios in Indonesia and India, which primarily consisted of lending to large corporates, to ensure that there was no deterioration in the portfolio amid rising interest rates and currency depreciation.\n\nAs headwinds in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment are expected to persist, we will maintain a prudent approach in client selection and credit underwriting criteria to mitigate potential challenges.\n\nTo improve the quality of our risk management, we also made investments in our internal tools, such as the credit risk data infrastructure and work \u0235 ow management system for our Institutional Banking business. This has brought our relationship and risk managers together on a common platform, allowing us to continue to re \u0234 ne and streamline our end-to-end credit processes.\n\nWe also used arti \u0234 cial intelligence (AI)/ machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance our credit underwriting and early warning capabilities for our consumer and SME businesses. This was achieved by training and deploying our credit models, emphasising increasing e \u025d ciency and speed, and incorporating external data from our partnerships. By doing so, we were able to expand our customer base, improve customer experience and increase model predictiveness to drive business success and strengthen risk management.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks\n\nWe recognise that climate change has risk implications on our portfolio and lending to high-risk sectors will in turn have an impact on the pace of climate change. Enhancing ESG risk capabilities and in particular integrating climate\n\nrisk into our risk identi \u0234 cation, assessment and management therefore continues to be a top priority.\n\nIn 2022, we incorporated environmental risk into our Risk Appetite Statement, focusing on managing portfolio exposures to material climate transition and physical risks, and decarbonisation strategies. To further strengthen our ESG risk management, we developed (i) quantitative methodologies to assess climate-related transition and physical risks for our Institutional Banking Group lending portfolio, and (ii) a counterparty ESG risk scoring mechanism which forms part of our credit risk management framework.\n\nAdditionally, we launched comprehensive training programmes with climate risk speci \u0234 c modules to build bank-wide expertise and deepen knowledge in the \u0234 eld.\n\nRead more about 'Responsible \u0234 nancing' in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Market and liquidity risks amidst market volatility\n\n2022 was a year of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility. We actively adjusted our market risk exposures and rebalanced hedges during the year. Regular and adhoc stress tests were conducted to evaluate the potential implications to our portfolios in the face of elevated interest rates.\n\nAs interest rates rose to levels not seen in the past decade, customer funds shifted from our current and savings accounts to \u0234 xed deposits and other investments, including government securities. We took measures to maintain our deposit base and continued to do so through active re-pricing and customer engagement. Our liquidity pro \u0234 le remains healthy and welldiversi \u0234 ed, with multiple avenues to access further wholesale funding whenever necessary.\n\n## New business risks\n\nIn January 2022, DBS announced the acquisition of Citi's consumer banking business in Taiwan. The integration process is in progress and is expected to be completed in 2023. We do not anticipate any signi \u0234 cant impact on the consumer banking portfolio with the acquisition.\n\nThe integration of Lakshmi Vilas Bank has proceeded as expected. To e \u038d ectively manage the risks associated with the new products and expanded network, we have deepened the expertise of our risk management team. We have also strengthened processes for existing products to ensure e \u038d ective management over a larger footprint. The \u0234 nal stage of system integration into DBS India Limited was successfully completed in December 2022.\n\n## Technology risk\n\nOur technology risk management framework is based on a three-pronged approach of risk evaluation, response and governance. As part of risk evaluation, we identify and analyse the risks, de \u0234 ne the risk metrics and monitor the issues, risk events and key risk indicators. Responses are made through risk-based decisions taking into account risk control and mitigation measures. Updates on our technology risk pro \u0234 les are provided regularly to the various risk committees. Following an independent review on the November 2021 digital disruption in Singapore, we have taken remedial measures to improve the resilience of our services and incident response.\n\nAs the bank continues with the pace of technology advancement, we instituted initiatives and measures with focus on change management.\n\nRead more about how we balance resiliency with technology innovation in the 'CIO statement' on page 34.\n\n## Financial crime risk\n\nAs part of our ongoing e \u038d orts to combat \u0234 nancial crime, we have enhanced our risk mitigation programme by utilising technology and data analytics. We implemented a variety of AI/ ML tools to enhance our surveillance capabilities at the transaction, customer, and country level. Our customer due diligence process was further re \u0234 ned with dynamic analytical reviews based on changes in static data or transactional behaviour. We continued to place strong emphasis on public-private sector collaboration, actively participating in initiatives between \u0234 nancial institutions and law enforcement agencies, including the planned Project COSMIC (Collaborative Sharing of Money Laundering / Terrorism Financing Information & Cases) to be launched in Singapore.\n\nIn 2022, we intensi \u0234 ed our e \u038d orts to address the risks posed by geopolitical developments, particularly those related to sanctions and attempts to evade them. We also enhanced controls to combat digital payment scams, which have been successful in protecting potential victims. In addition, we have been deploying new capabilities to detect money laundering and sanctions risks related to digital assets, such as blockchain-based tokens. Such capabilities allow us to better identify and mitigate risks across a wider range of digital assets.\n\n## Data governance risk\n\nWe recognise that responsible practices around data governance are key for customer and stakeholder trust. Our data governance\n\nframework was developed along the following three prisms: (i) a baseline prism encompassing data security, data quality, and legal and regulatory compliance, (ii) an ethical prism PURE (Purposeful, Unsurprising, Respectful and Explainable) - for the responsible use of data, and (iii) a model governance prism, covering regulated and AI models and their performance over time.\n\n## Cyber security and data protection\n\nWe faced a deteriorating cyber threat environment as geopolitical tensions escalated and cyber criminals and threat actors sought to target our customers and sta \u038d . To combat these threats, we strengthened our control environment to protect our people, information, network, equipment and applications. We stepped up security awareness campaigns and alerted our customers to emerging frauds and scams through timely security advisories. Despite these threats, we made signi \u0234 cant progress in addressing phishing scams in partnership with the regulators and authorities. Amid rising geopolitical tensions, we will remain vigilant and continue to enhance our control environment to stay ahead of the cyber threat curve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSoh Kian Tong Chief Risk O \u025d cer DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2023 FOCUS AREAS\n\n- \u00b7 Further streamline end-to-end credit processes and controls across all markets\n- \u00b7 Undertake proactive risk monitoring on emerging economic challenges and continue to strengthen portfolio management capabilities\n- \u00b7 Enhance climate risk management and stress testing capabilities\n- \u00b7 Mitigate \u0234 nancial crime risk through controls, systems and analytics\n- \u00b7 Continue to strengthen multi-layered cyber security defence\n- \u00b7 Enhance IT resilience and technology change management",

Our rallying call is to optimise our technology stack, scale outputs, and provide all-rounded customer and employee experiences that transform business outcomes.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAmid growing geopolitical uncertainty and an increasingly challenging business climate, DBS continued focusing on innovation to retain our competitive advantage. We adopted a barbell strategy that spurs innovation and experimentation with new technologies on one end, while keeping a vigilant eye on resilience and risks on the other.\n\n## Driving innovation\n\nDigitalisation has become table stakes for \u0234 nancial institutions, and many digital initiatives we embarked on over the past few years are now par for the course. To retain our lead and widen the gap between us and our competitors, we must continue creating di \u038d erentiated technology innovations.\n\nOur arti \u0234 cial intelligence (AI)/ machine learning (ML) business use cases increased by seven times to 260, enabling us to achieve about SGD 150 million in revenue in 2022. We aspire to achieve SGD 1 billion in the next \u0234 ve years.\n\nOur AI deployments made it possible to deliver tailored customer experiences. About 3 million customers from NAV Planner, our intuitive digital advisory tool, bene \u0234 tted from hyperpersonalised nudges.\n\nThese capabilities are enabled by our in-house designed solutions including ADA, a data analytics platform, ALAN, an award-winning AI knowledge management hub, and our hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure. ADA and ALAN shorten the time required to build and deploy AI models, improving our operations and decision-making.\n\nEvolve PavedCloud, our DBS designed public cloud solution, enables public cloud adoption, and allows developers to deploy and manage applications securely and consistently. Public cloud adoption has increased over 17 times in the last four years. CloudOps, a self-service technology marketplace, automates and enhances the e \u025d ciency of private cloud operations, and o \u038d ers platform visualisation.\n\nEvolve PavedCloud and CloudOps have garnered strong market interest, especially\n\namong \u0234 nancial institutions and government bodies embarking on their own cloud transformation journeys.\n\nFIX Marketplace, Asia's \u0234 rst digital and automated \u0234 xed-income execution platform, directly connects issuers with investors. This promotes synergy, democratises capital allocation, and results in cost bene \u0234 ts and time e \u025d ciencies. Over 80 trades, amounting to SGD 16 billion of issuances in various currencies have been executed.\n\nRiding on the successes of our blockchainbased businesses DBS Digital Exchange, Climate Impact X and Partior, we are developing commercial use cases with new \u0234 nancial engagement models and distributed ledger technology. Project Orchid, in collaboration with Open Government Products, uses tokenised SGD to facilitate live transactions with selected merchants, while Project Guardian tests the feasibility of Decentralised Finance (DeFi) trading for tokenised securities against tokenised cash. In Project Dunbar, we are exploring a common platform for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to enable greater e \u025d ciency for wholesale cross-border payments.\n\nWe are continuously exploring metaverse use cases to provide value-added services to our customers. DBS is the \u0234 rst bank in Singapore to partner The Sandbox - one of the largest metaverses on the Ethereum blockchain and launch DBS BetterWorld, where we will demonstrate how technology can be used as a force for good. Technology & Operations (T&O) was also the \u0234 rst in the bank to hold our townhall in the metaverse, setting the stage for further metaverse experiments across the bank.\n\n## Balancing innovation with resilience\n\nEven as we innovate, we continue being vigilant in building resilience and identifying potential technology threats. The evolving risk landscape makes Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) more vital than ever.\n\nThese changes occur against a backdrop of cutbacks in technology companies which enabled us to opportunistically acquire technology talents. We have doubled our e \u038d orts to diversify our technology workforce as we maintain continuity and tribal knowledge within technology teams.\n\nDBS was one of the \u0234 rst banks in Asia to set up an SRE practice. This enabled a secure acceleration of our release cadence, which increased by 50 times to 64,000 releases a month. Our Centre of Excellence creates software development toolkits which are embedded with SRE principles and will be plugged into our development process to increase resilience.\n\nOur multi-year application transformation programme to modernise the bank's applications not only increases customer con \u0234 dence in DBS' systems, but also reduces employee toil. Through it, we have achieved faster time to market, sustainable e \u025d ciency, and automated recovery.\n\nWith a hybrid-work future, cybersecurity e \u038d orts must be strengthened to address the larger attack surface and potential gaps in work processes. Our multi-layered defence includes micro-segmentation of our networks, and multi-factor authentication.\n\nTo safeguard customers from fraud, we deployed AI technology to detect and take prompt actions against phishing or scam attempts, with real-time pre-transaction blocking. We worked with the authorities and partners to implement new solutions, such as registering with the SMS Sender ID Registry to provide a secure banking experience.\n\nWe are growing our own timber and deepening our innovation DNA across three technological hubs in Asia. Our technology hubs in Singapore sit under DBS Tech Singapore, while DBS Asia Hub 2 has been rebranded as DBS Tech India. DBS Tech China, our third technological hub will open in Guangzhou in mid-2024 and entrench our expanded presence in the Greater Bay Area. These hubs will facilitate continuous innovation, provide diversity, and hone our talents as they learn from each other.\n\nWhile we innovate at scale, it must be done in a safe and reliable manner. Our multiyear e \u038d ort to re-engineer operations has resulted in a uni \u0234 ed data-driven control tower, integrated work \u0235 ows and workbenches. We have eliminated manual work and improved connectivity, e \u025d ciency and resiliency, and are able to manage operational risks with greater control, and provide insights for pre-emptive actions. Supporting this journey are our reusable digital assets, and automation, which have elevated customer and employee experiences.\n\n## Cultivating a diverse, future-ready workforce\n\nWe reorganised the way we work through Managing through Journeys, where Technology, Business, Operations, and Support Units work together in crossfunctional teams and share technology prioritisation, goals and KPIs. This drives alignment, accelerates the cross-pollination of knowledge and skills, and leads to greater business impact.\n\nApart from redesigning the way we work, we recognise that our people are the driving force behind DBS' transformation, and have\n\nimplemented initiatives to foster a culture of innovation, growth, and customer centricity through life-long learning. Tech Academy further builds technical expertise through in-house curriculums developed by our subject matter experts. Since 2021, employees have completed 178,000 sessions across 82 modules. The Distinguished Engineers (DE) Programme o \u038d ers an alternative career path to the management track, and sees conferred engineers sharing their deep tech expertise with fellow colleagues. Separately, over 9,000 employees have taken data and AI upskilling courses, while 7,000 have attended our SRE Training Programme. Our Operations team is equally zealous in their e \u038d orts, with more than 4,400 of them learning to re-engineer our operations.\n\nEqual emphasis is placed on leadership skills. Through Transformational Leadership Circle sessions, over 90 T&O leaders learned how to provide psychological safety, and push for a growth mindset, collaboration, feedback, and courageous conversations. They are on track to impact 1,200 more employees.\n\nWe are actively nurturing the next generation of talents. The DBS Fintech Apprenticeship Programme prepares polytechnic students for technology roles in the bank through masterclasses and mentorship by the DE engineers. We have groomed nearly 700 graduates with less than two years of work experience to become technologists through the Skill Enhancement Education and Development (SEED) programme. In addition, we helped over 300 mid-career Singaporeans build lasting \u0234 ntech careers through the Technology in Finance Immersion Programme.\n\n## Banking sustainably for a better world\n\nWe continue delivering positive impact towards a more sustainable future. We achieved our net-zero operational carbon emissions goal across the markets we operate in, and are on track for our operations in Singapore to solely rely on renewable energy by 2030. DBS Newton Green, Singapore's \u0234 rst net-zero building by a bank, achieved net zero within three months of its opening.\n\nTo educate customers about their carbon footprint, we launched a Carbon Calculator in digibank. This industry\u0234 rst initiative in Singapore enables customers to monitor and o \u038d set their carbon footprint, which is calculated through tracking their credit and debit card purchases. Carbon Calculator impacted 430,000 unique customers within the \u0234 rst eight months of its launch, and has o \u038d set 740 tonnes of carbon.\n\n## In closing\n\nOur digital transformation investments over the last decade have equipped us well for the journey ahead. We are strongly positioned with multiple world-class digital platforms, a capacity for continuous innovation, and a future-ready workforce that entrenches us as a di \u038d erent kind of bank.\n\nWe continue experimenting with new technologies such as human-like conversational AI, digital twins, and 5G, which could revolutionise banking. We are also keeping a pulse on the next wave of breakthroughs in areas such as human/ machine interfaces, and augmented and virtual reality technologies.\n\nWe expect these technologies to converge and bring forth extraordinary use cases. As we further tune our digital operations for greater agility, and deploy cutting-edge technologies in our o \u038d erings, we remain steadfast in our focus on our customers. We are strengthening an exceptional banking ecosystem that they trust and rely on, while delivering truly di \u038d erentiated customer experiences that set us apart from the rest. tom he rest.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJimmy Ng Chief Information O \u025d cer DBS Group Holdings immy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2023 FOCUS AREAS\n\n- \u00b7 Strengthen our technology infrastructure to maintain our lead\n- \u00b7 Dial up on technology architecture, and building internal expertise for thirdparty software and services, systems recovery, and incident management\n- \u00b7 Drive improved developer journeys to enhance technology productivity\n- \u00b7 Build operational resilience by re-engineering operations through technology and dial up on workbenches and work \u0235 ows\n- \u00b7 Transition to an AI-fuelled Bank to achieve SGD 1 billion in revenue\n- \u00b7 Innovate in blockchain and design additional Distributed Ledger Technology use cases\n- \u00b7 Continue experimenting with new technologies and seek opportunities through DeFi, Web 3.0 and beyond",

We also saw large and rapid interest rate rises from rock-bottom rates.\n\nDespite this, the Institutional Banking Group (IBG) business executed to strategy and deepened client relationships. It reported solid \u0234 nancial performance, boosted by higher net interest margin, as well as higher loan growth from increased client activities and demand. Through credit vigilance and consistent proactive monitoring of our portfolio, allowances remained low. The digital acceleration at the start of the pandemic in 2020 continued, and our pervasive digital transformation yielded stickier and deeper customer relationships as we embedded our solutions into customer and industry ecosystems.\n\n## Robust \u0234 nancials despite macro challenges\n\nIBG's total income rose 28% to a record SGD 7.69 billion. Net interest income grew 39% from improved net interest margin as interest rates rose, as well as from increased client activities and loan demand.\n\nNon-interest income grew 7% to a record high of SGD 2.12 billion. Our focus on cementing our position as customers' primary operating bank, coupled with cash mandates won, resulted in strong cash management performance. Growth in fees from cash management and loan-related activities o \u038d set declines in investment banking income. Treasury customer income rose 15% as customers took advantage of market volatility opportunities.\n\nAllowances fell below pre-pandemic levels to a net writeback of SGD 204 million. Pro \u0234 t before tax grew 50% to SGD 5.64 billion, driven by a higher interest rate environment, increased productivity and a lower cost-income ratio of 29% compared to 35% in FY2021.\n\n## Broad-based growth across industries and markets\n\nThere was broad-based growth across industry segments from our focus around Energy Renewables and Infrastructure (ERI), Financial Institutions (FI), Real Estate and Telecoms, Media and Technology.\n\nThe ERI industry group saw growth momentum in the renewables sector with investments in energy security and diversi \u0234 cation into alternative energy sources driving advisory and \u0234 nancing opportunities. Demonstrating our leadership position in the APAC renewables arena, DBS was sole \u0234 nancial advisor to Taiya Renewable Energy, in forming a joint venture with EDF Renewables to bid for the development of a 440 megawatt o \u038d shore wind farm in Taiwan.\n\nWe grew our FI key accounts and participated in their increased deal \u0235 ows in Asia. Revenues from the FI group grew 45% with deposit income strengthened by new cash application programming interface (API) mandates, as we capitalised on the private capital \u0235 ows to Asia.\n\nWe continued to execute well across our various key markets. Our business in India saw good momentum as revenues grew 22%. This was bolstered by our expanded network across India with the integration of Lakshmi Vilas Bank which gave us the foundation to expand and deepen relationships with corporate customers. In Southeast Asia, Vietnam led the growth in our international markets with a 64% increase in revenue.\n\nIn Greater China, customers saw the value of our cash management and treasury and market solutions. Our Greater Bay Area strategy continued to capture business \u0235 ows, resulting in a 24% increase in income.\n\n## Harnessing digital capabilities to deliver on ecosystem strategy and Global Transaction Services\n\nOur Global Transaction Services (GTS) business continues to be a strategic priority and a strong contributor to IBG, delivering over 40% of wholesale banking revenue. Our Trade & Supply Chain business continued to deliver strong asset growth, particularly with an increase of 13% in supply chain \u0234 nance assets. GTS also saw a 28% increase in payment volumes and over 800 new Cash Management mandate wins.\n\nWe executed on key ecosystem partnerships, embedding sustainability and supply chain \u0234 nancing solutions into our clients' ecosystems. As a result, our Open Account Trade revenues rose to new highs, growing 15%. Through our innovative partnerships with customers like Cainiao, we leveraged alternative data and API connectivity to create seamless \u0234 nancing journeys for our small and medium enterprise\n\n| SGD million                | 2022   | 2021   | YoY%   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total income               | 7,688  | 5,984  | 28     |\n| \u00b7  Corporate               | 5,638  | 4,595  | 23     |\n| \u00b7  SME                     | 2,050  | 1,389  | 48     |\n| Expenses                   | 2,254  | 2,086  | 8      |\n| Pro \u0234  t before allowances | 5,434  | 3,898  | 39     |\n| Allowances                 | (204)  | 141    | NM     |\n| Pro \u0234  t before tax        | 5,638  | 3,757  | 50     |\n\n(SME) customers, while also ful \u0234 lling working capital needs. Across the various ecosystem partnerships, we saw a 30% increase in customers.\n\nOur API calls more than tripled year-on-year, as customers put our digital solutions to business use.\n\n## Deepening engagement of mid-cap clients through industry expertise; rolling out AI/ ML solutions at scale for small enterprises\n\nWe applied our industry expertise across di \u038d erent sectors to deepen engagement and support for our mid-sized corporate clients. This proved successful as revenues from the segment increased by 27%, with non-interest income growing at a robust 15%.\n\nRevenues from SME banking grew a record 48%. Our leading digital capabilities enabled us to serve micro and small SME customers with speed and scale, while emerging technologies were used to help micro and small enterprises manage their credit risk.\n\nTo help SMEs navigate the in \u0235 ationary environment and rising interest rates, we rolled out 'DBS Quick Finance' in Singapore, enabling almost instant access to \u0234 nancing of up to SGD 300,000. Through arti \u0234 cial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and data analytics, the lending process has been reduced to just a minute to apply, a second to approve and in some instances, instant disbursement.\n\nDBS has been proactively engaging SMEs identi \u0234 ed by our AI/ ML models at the earliest signs of trouble. Over 80% of identi \u0234 ed at-risk borrowers averted risk.\n\nOverall, digital engagement with SME clients tripled year-on-year.\n\nAll this earned the SME Banking business two global accolades - \"World's Best Bank for SMEs\" by Euromoney and \"Best SME Bank\" by Global Finance.\n\n## Leading the industry in sustainable \u0234 nancing and solutions\n\nDBS is the \u0234 rst bank in Southeast Asia to announce sectoral targets that are aligned with\n\nscience-based decarbonisation glidepaths in our report - ' Our Path to Net Zero - Supporting Asia's Transition to a Low-carbon Economy '.\n\nDBS' commitment is one of the most comprehensive among global banks and our solutions span products and services, from loans, trade \u0234 nancing, capital markets to strategic advisory. Transition \u0234 nancing and structured solutions to help our clients execute their decarbonisation plans form key parts of what we have to o \u038d er.\n\nWe introduced green renovation loans to support SMEs looking to retro \u0234 t their commercial or industrial premises to more energy e \u025d cient \u0234 ttings; rolled out campaigns and special pricing packages to \u0234 nance commercial electric vehicle \u0235 eets; and worked with DBS Foundation on the SME Kickstarter Grant to promote sustsainable business practices.\n\nOur sustainability portfolio grew to SGD 61 billion, exceeding our SGD 50 billion target well ahead of 2024.\n\n## Leading Asian bond and equity markets\n\nTo facilitate the development of Asian bond markets at a faster and more cost-e \u025d cient pace, DBS continued to gain momentum on its fully digital and automated \u0234 xed income execution platform, FIX Marketplace. It was awarded \"Global Financial Innovation of the Year 2022\" by Euromoney. DBS also continued to dominate the SGD bond market in pole position with more than 30% market share.\n\nAs the leading equity house in the region, we took pride in spearheading the market development and introduction of the Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPACs) framework in the Singapore market.\n\nDuring the consideration period, DBS listed Singapore's \u0234 rst SPAC backed by Temasek Vertex Technology Acquisition Corporation Ltd. It also managed the Novo Tellus Alpha Acquisition initial public o \u038d ering listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange.\n\n## New way of working: Managing through Journeys\n\nIn recent years, the comprehensive digitalisation of work \u0235 ows has given us the\n\nopportunity to dial up client centricity e \u038d orts. We started using design thinking, analytics, AI/ ML and b agile practices to introduce a new way of working called 'Managing through Journeys' (MtJs). Through MtJs, we are redesigning our processes, constantly experimenting and working horizontally with subject matter competencies to deepen client engagement and produce better business outcomes.\n\nWe have seen success in the form of increased foreign exchange transaction volumes, total product holdings per client and customer satisfaction scores.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWe enter the coming year with leverage from rising interest rates and good business momentum. We plan to build on our leadership in sustainability and redirect capital towards more sustainable outcomes.\n\nWe will also capitalise on more supply chain resiliency investments as we see outbound investments looking towards alternative supply sources and production bases in South and Southeast Asia.\n\nWe are optimistic that these initiatives will bode well for our business and will continue to focus on serving clients through our regional connectivity capabilities and industry expertise.\n\nWhilst there will be continued geopolitical and in \u0235 ationary risks leading to volatile markets, we plan to mitigate these through combining the use of predictive analytic tools with robust processes, to continue being proactive and vigilant in our risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTan Su Shan Institutional Banking DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2023 FOCUS AREAS\n\n- \u00b7 Di \u038d erentiate DBS as a leader in sustainable \u0234 nance\n- \u00b7 Through deeper investments in our GTS solutions and technology, capture more cross-border trade \u0235 ows and deepen ecosystem relationships\n- \u00b7 Continue to lead in digital leadership from API, connectivity, and ecosystems solutions\n- \u00b7 Enhance credit vigilance, know-yourcustomer and anti-money laundering and credit processes",

        "page_content": "## Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDigitalisation is now the baseline. The real test for the bank is how we leverage our scale, assets, digital capabilities and people to create innovative solutions that help our customers grow and protect their wealth.\n\n## 2022 overview\n\nAmid a volatile macro environment, Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management achieved a robust set of results and maintained a healthy balance sheet. We bene \u0234 tted from the tailwinds that came through higher interest rates, although growth was moderated by market uncertainty which impacted wealth management fee activities. Business momentum was sustained by record-high net new money \u0235 ows into the region and the expansion of our consumer \u0234 nance business. We further bolstered our e \u038d orts to use arti \u0234 cial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities to deepen customer engagement, which also yielded good results. We will continue to expand our business footprint and advance our digital solutions to deliver seamless and di \u038d erentiated customer experiences.\n\n## Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management: Strong interest income growth cushions macro impact\n\nWe delivered solid earnings, driven by higher interest income. Our total income rose 25%\n\nto SGD 6.65 billion, due to substantial net interest margin expansion and growth in loan and deposit volumes. With an improved costincome ratio, net pro \u0234 t before tax grew 40% to SGD 2.69 billion.\n\nNet interest income rose 68% to SGD 4.27 billion, driven by Fed rate hikes, stronger deposit earnings, and loan volume growth in most of our markets. This was partially o \u038d set by intensifying competition and accelerated re \u0234 nancing of home loans. Nonetheless, we maintained our market share lead in Casa deposits and the mortgage loan space in Singapore.\n\nNon-interest income fell 14% to SGD 2.38 billion as investments and bancassurance faced headwinds from market uncertainty. These declines were however o \u038d set by growth in card and loan-related fees. Card fees rose 20% to SGD 858 million, as travel spending returned to pre-pandemic levels in most markets. Despite soft consumer demand, the bancassurance business maintained its lead in Singapore for new business market share.\n\n## Wealth Management: Sustained growth buoyed by net new money\n\nOur wealth franchise continued its strong performance, with total wealth management income increasing 20% to SGD 3.27 billion. Net new money in \u0235 ows more than doubled to a record SGD 24 billion, with assets under management (AUM) climbing 3% in constantcurrency terms to SGD 297 billion.\n\nGrowing client interest in succession planning and wealth preservation fuelled the growth of our Family O \u025d ce business. Of the 700 Single Family O \u025d ces set up in Singapore, DBS Private Bank onboarded more than one-third of them. Our Family O \u025d ce AUM more than doubled in the last two years. For the third consecutive year, DBS Trustee saw record fund in \u0235 ows in excess of SGD 1 billion.\n\nMore clients shifted to sustainable investments that have MSCI ESG ratings of BBB and above. Today, they make up more than 60% of our AUM. With DBS Foundation and private equity \u0234 rm Heritas Capital, we launched the Asia Impact First Fund to drive impact\u0234 rst investing and support promising social enterprises.\n\nWe rolled out self-directed crypto trading via DBS digibank, enabling accredited investors to trade cryptocurrencies on DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx), one of the world's \u0234 rst bank-backed digital exchanges. Today, nine in 10 trades are executed digitally.\n\nThe wealth management business continued to be recognised globally. We clinched the top honour of 'Asia's Best Bank for Wealth Management' from Euromoney and were once again named 'Most Innovative Private Bank in the World' by Global Finance. We were also accorded 'Best Wealth Manager Asia' by The Asset for the sixth consecutive year. DBS digibank (Wealth), our digital wealth management platform, was also named 'Best Digital Portal for Wealth Clients' by Cutter Research for the \u0234 fth year running.\n\n## Consumer Banking: Leveraging AL/ ML and ecosystem partnerships to deepen engagement\n\nOne of our biggest di \u038d erentiators is how we use data analytics and AI/ ML to better serve our customers. Every month, we leverage our AI/ ML models to generate 45 million hyperpersonalised nudges that are sent to some \u0234 ve million customers across the region to guide them towards better investment and \u0234 nancial planning decisions.\n\nSome one million nudges have also been delivered to our bankers so they can provide more informed and personalised advisory. DBS NAV Planner, our AI-powered digital\n\n| SGD million                | 2022   | 2021   | YoY%   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total income               | 6,654  | 5,322  | 25     |\n| \u00b7  Retail                  | 3,382  | 2,593  | 30     |\n| \u00b7  Wealth Management       | 3,272  | 2,729  | 20     |\n| Expenses                   | 3,803  | 3,353  | 13     |\n| Pro \u0234  t before allowances | 2,851  | 1,969  | 45     |\n| Allowances                 | 158    | 46     | > 100  |\n| Pro \u0234  t before tax        | 2,693  | 1,923  | 40     |\n\n\u0234 nancial planning tool, has improved our customers' \u0234 nancial health. The average AUM of DBS NAV Planner users is 59% higher than non-users. Of the three million NAV Planner users, more than one-third are active users every month.\n\nDBS PayLah! usage continues to grow with more than 25 million logins a month, where users book tickets and rides, pay bills, and scan and pay at more than 180,000 points in Singapore. Every month, we record more than one million scan-to-pay transactions at some 12,000 hawker stalls - six times the number in 2019. We also partnered UnionPay and PromptPay so customers can use DBS Paylah! beyond Singapore in 45 markets.\n\nTo help customers better manage their \u0234 nances, DBS partnered Mastercard and Pine Labs to o \u038d er a 'Buy Now Pay Later' option to some two million DBS/ POSB credit cardholders in Singapore, Indonesia and Hong Kong. This enables them to enjoy interest-free instalments with \u0235 exible repayment periods in physical and e-commerce stores.\n\nWe strengthened our presence overseas by scaling our ecosystem partnerships. In markets where we do not have a large physical distribution network, we were able to expand our consumer \u0234 nance business by working with nine ecosystem partners such as ByteDance and Ctrip (China), Home Credit and CRED (India) and Kredivo (Indonesia) to o \u038d er lending solutions to their customers.\n\nThe volume of loans DBS disbursed across these markets grew 30 times between 2019 and 2022 to SGD 1.7 billion. These partnerships enabled us to acquire customers digitally, leverage data to augment our AI/ ML models, and increase customer engagement. In India, we partnered an India-based \u0234 nance and investment services \u0234 rm, IIFL, to scale the gold loans business. We grew this portfolio by 33% year-on-year and gold loan gains contributed about 40% of DBS' sales volume growth in India in 2022.\n\nThe amalgamation of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) into DBS Bank India Limited has enabled us to accelerate our growth. Consumer banking revenue in India has grown by 50% between 2021 and 2022. We partnered Bajaj Finance to launch our \u0234 rst co-branded credit card in some 120 cities in India.\n\nWe are deepening our footprint in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) through the Wealth Management Connect (WMC) scheme. DBS Bank (Hong Kong)'s \u0234 rst two partnerships were with the Postal Savings Bank of China, one of the largest retail banks in China, and with DBS Bank (China). We recently announced in May our third partnership with the Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank, making DBS Bank (Hong Kong) the only bank with three WMC Southbound service partnering banks.\n\nWe are on track to complete the integration of Citi Taiwan's consumer banking business into DBS Taiwan in August 2023. When completed, the transaction will accelerate DBS Taiwan's growth by at least 10 years to become the market's biggest foreign bank.\n\n## Bolstering agility to better serve customers\n\nWe have expedited our transformation to a data-driven, agile organisation that puts our customers at the heart of everything we do. This new way of working, what we call Managing through Journeys (MtJs), galvanises technologists, relationship managers and business teams to leverage our data and digital capabilities to deliver new o \u038d erings more quickly. Across our markets, we operationalised MtJs performance cells in key consumer \u0234 nance products and customer segments. We made good progress, launching features such as a new online client onboarding process for personal loans in Taiwan and smart fee waivers in Singapore.\n\n## Helping our customers live sustainably and \u0234 ght in \u0235 ation\n\nWe continued to encourage customers to adopt sustainable living habits with our green o \u038d erings.\n\nDBS LiveBetter, a one-stop digital sustainability platform in DBS digibank, is now available in Singapore and Hong Kong. To date, more than one million customers engaged with the platform such as accessing eco-friendly tips; tracking and o \u038d setting their carbon footprint with the industry's \u0234 rst autonomous carbon calculator. Some 1,000 tonnes of carbon\n\nemissions have been o \u038d set. DBS LiveBetter users have also invested some SGD 8 million in green funds and donated over SGD 700,000 towards environmental and social causes.\n\nAmid persistently high in \u0235 ation and rising cost of living, we were the \u0234 rst bank in Singapore to launch a 'Fight In \u0235 ation' package last August, equipping those earning less than SGD 2,500 a month with solutions to stretch their dollar. They included rebates and cashback o \u038d ers on their everyday spend. We were also the only bank that o \u038d ered a competitive HDB loan that is on par with HDB's concessionary loan rate.\n\nAs a small gesture of encouragement to the community amid in \u0235 ationary times, DBS launched an initiative to subsidise \u0234 ve million hawker meals over 12 months in Singapore.\n\n## What we look forward to\n\nWe believe that digitalisation has become the baseline, and the real litmus test for the bank will be how we leverage data and technology to create innovative solutions that can help our customers protect and grow their wealth, and secure their \u0234 nancial wellness. It is now more critical than ever to help customers navigate these uncertain times with con \u0234 dence. Our scale, assets, digital capabilities and people will be the essential levers of positive impact that can foster a more equitable and inclusive society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSim S Lim Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2023 FOCUS AREAS\n\n- \u00b7 Continue to bolster our 'phygital' strategy by expanding AI/ ML capabilities and transforming our physical touchpoints to better engage with customers\n- \u00b7 Sustain the wealth business growth momentum by capturing in \u0235 ows and delivering sustainable fee income stream from the region, including the GBA\n- \u00b7 Accelerate our consumer \u0234 nance business overseas by onboarding new ecosystem partners\n- \u00b7 Further entrench our MtJs transformation to empower more people to embrace agile journey thinking and deliver better customer outcomes",

While our neighbourhoods and lifestyles have changed with the times, we stayed true to our mission of being the 'People's Bank' that provides pioneering\n\nsolutions that cater to the evolving needs of all segments of the population. They include children, young adults, families, seniors and the community at large. By widening our reach in the community through various initiatives, we remain committed to bringing value to Singaporeans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For children and families\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## POSB Smart Buddy Programme\n\nWe continued to expand the world's \u0234 rst integrated in-school savings and payments programme to more schools. The POSB Smart Buddy programme, which was launched in 2017, creates a contactless payments ecosystem within the school environment to help cultivate sensible savings and spending habits among young students in an interactive, engaging manner. These students are then better equipped to achieve \u0234 nancial wellness when they transition to the next stage of their lives.\n\nWe were the \u0234 rst bank to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to install a digital payment infrastructure in more than 330 primary, secondary schools, junior colleges/ Millennia Institute and special education (SPED) schools within three years. Under the partnership, we will also provide up to 400,000 students with smartwatches and cards for payments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For seniors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## POSB digital literacy workshops\n\nWe stepped up our digital literacy programmes for seniors, which included a newly created anti-scam and cybersecurity workshop that was co-developed with the Singapore Police Force, National Crime Prevention Council and Cyber Security Agency of Singapore. In 2022, we organised more than 130 virtual and physical workshops, engaging some 5,300 seniors.\n\nBesides deepening collaborations with agencies such as the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the Council for Third Age and PA, we worked with new partners such as TOUCH Community Services to empower more seniors. We were a key partner of IMDA's inaugural Digital for Life Festival, which involved more than 65,000 participants and visitors.\n\nToday, some 70,000 students in more than 100 schools are using Smart Buddy smartwatches and cards for digital payments. The programme also supports needy students under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme. To date, about 60 Smart Buddy schools are administering meal subsidies to some 5,000 students via POSB Smart Buddy.\n\n## POSB PAssion Run for Kids\n\nSingapore's largest charity kids run organised a hybrid race, which included a virtual race and onsite sustainability-themed activities. Our beach clean-up and tree planting activity entered the Singapore Book of Records as the Largest Mass Plogging event and raised over SGD 930,000 .\n\nTo date, we have raised SGD 11.6 million , with more than 790,000 children bene \u0234 tting from 198 programmes. One of the marquee programmes included a 'EcoHeroes@Home' programme to encourage children and their families to reduce energy consumption at home.\n\n## Financial literacy workshops for kids and working adults\n\nWe partnered community partners, SPED schools and social service agencies to organise 70 \u0234 nancial literacy workshops for more than 2,600 kids and those with special needs. These sessions included bank branch visits to familiarise participants with banking services.\n\nTogether with the Singapore Stock Exchange and People's Association (PA), we organised over 13 virtual and physical workshops for more than 3,000 working adults to raise their awareness of retirement, estate planning and investment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For the\n\n## community\n\nThe DBS Foundation contributed SGD 1 million , which includes the government's dollar-for-dollar matching, to the Digital for Life movement and stepped up our volunteer participation to bolster digital inclusion e \u038d orts in Singapore. The broad-based support, through our strategic collaboration with IMDA, includes jointly launching community programmes and organising workshops to raise digital and \u0234 nancial literacy. Through our People of Purpose movement, our employees in Singapore will run the workshops. We aim to reach 100,000 Singaporeans and residents across various community segments, such as youths, persons with disabilities, seniors and hawkers over the next two years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group Secretary facilitates communication between the Board, its committees and management, and generally assists Directors in the discharge of their duties. The Group Secretary helps with the induction of new Directors. The appointment and removal of the Group Secretary require the approval of the Board.\n\n## Annual Board strategy o \u038d site\n\nEach year, the Board and our senior executives attend a strategy o \u038d site held in one of our markets, which allows them to:\n\n- \u00b7 focus on DBS' long-term strategy apart from the regular agenda at the quarterly Board meetings;\n- \u00b7 engage in dynamic and in-depth strategic discussions to promote deeper understanding of our business environment and our operations, and re \u0234 ne our strategy; and\n- \u00b7 engage with our stakeholders in the host country (such as regulators, media, customers including CEOs and CFOs of our corporate clients and sta \u038d in the local franchise).\n\nThe 2022 Board strategy o \u038d site was held in the third week of September 2022. Please refer to the Board highlights - 2022 section on page 49 for more information on the discussions during the 2022 Board strategy o \u038d site.\n\n## Frequent and e \u038d ective engagement\n\nDirectors have ongoing interactions across various levels, functions and countries within DBS. In addition, some Directors also sit on the boards of our overseas subsidiaries; this arrangement gives the Board access to \u0234 rst-hand insight on the activities of these subsidiaries. The CFO provides the Board with detailed \u0234 nancial performance reports monthly.\n\nDirectors also have various opportunities to interact with members of the Group Management Committee (GMC) (for instance, at quarterly Board-hosted dinners and during the annual board strategy o \u038d site).\n\n## Delegation by the Board to the Board committees\n\nThe Board has delegated authority to various Board committees to enable them to oversee certain speci \u0234 c responsibilities based on their terms of reference. The terms of reference of each Board committee set out the responsibilities of the Board committee, conduct of meetings including quorum, voting requirements and quali \u0234 cations for Board committee membership. All our Board committees (other than the BSC) comprise non-executive Directors only. Any change to the terms of reference for any Board committee requires Board approval. The minutes of Board committee meetings, which records the key deliberations and decisions taken during these meetings, are circulated to all Board members for their information.\n\n- \u00b7 Regularly reviews the composition of the Board and Board committees, and independence of Directors;\n- \u00b7 Identi \u0234 es, reviews and recommends Board appointments for approval by the Board, taking into account the industry knowledge, skills, background, experience, professional quali \u0234 cations, age and gender of the candidate and the needs of the Board;\n- \u00b7 Conducts an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, the Board committees and the Directors;\n- \u00b7 Implements the Board Diversity Policy and reviews its e \u038d ectiveness;\n- \u00b7 Exercises oversight of the induction programme and continuous development programme for Directors, and ensures that \u0234 rst-time directors with no prior experience as a director of a listed company in Singapore undergo relevant training;\n- \u00b7 Reviews and recommends to the Board the re-appointment of each Director having regard to his/ her performance, commitment and ability to contribute to the Board as well as his/ her age and skillset;\n- \u00b7 Assesses annually whether each Director has su \u025d cient time to discharge his/ her responsibilities;

(ii) accelerating growth in various Asian markets; (iii) increasing and entrenching our market-leading sustainability e \u038d orts; and (iv) formulating a strategy for entrenching our Singapore market leadership by leveraging on digitalisation and technology. During the annual Board strategy o \u038d site (which was held in September 2022), the Board actively deliberated on, inter alia :\n\n- \u00b7 geopolitical developments on global supply chains and Asian businesses, and macroeconomics;\n- \u00b7 our Greater China strategy;\n- \u00b7 evolution and future landscape of the digital \u0234 nance space and our competitive advantage;\n- \u00b7 view and current expectations of traditional, institutional and venture-capitalist/ growth investors as well as our communication outreach; and\n- \u00b7 sustainability issues.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Technology, Risks and Resiliency Improvement Plan\n\nThe Board had an in-depth discussion on the independent technology review remediation conducted by KPMG and our Resiliency Improvement Plan updates. In particular, the KPMG independent technology review provided important observations and recommended opportunities for improvement in key areas surrounding DBS' digital banking processes. The updates on our Resiliency Improvement Plan are organised into several pillars to address key technology risks and included uplifting of certain critical applications and runtimes, focusing on technology architecture, third party software and services and system recovery. It also enhances the governance and structure for incident and crisis management. In addition, the Board was updated on the establishment of a resiliency project steering committee, tasked with the objectives of heightening resiliency, reducing incident occurrence, mitigating incident impact and improving recovery speed.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) issues were a signi \u0234 cant focus area for the Board during 2022. The Board engaged with external subject matter experts and leading business leaders on various matters, including (i) the impact of the current energy crisis, views of the path to Net Zero by 2050 and the future of energy, (ii) key learnings about the energy situation over the last 20-30 years, (iii) industry best practices on sustainability matters where there is currently no consensus on the data capture or metrics to be used, and (iv) the role of intermediaries such as banks, in helping companies manage trade-o \u038d s and facilitating a just transition.\n\n## People and Culture\n\nPeople and culture were another area of focus for the Board in 2022. The CEO updated the Board on the 2022 employee survey, 'MyVoice' and noted that (i) the Group saw an improvement in the MyVoice engagement score, with improvements across most dimensions (including enabling productivity, wellbeing and hybrid working), and (ii) most of our core markets recorded an increase in employee engagement and outperformed the respective country \u0234 nancial services industry scores.\n\nThe Board discussed people and leadership matters, including the need to focus on employee and to provide clear career paths for employees and to drive gender, intergenerational and foreign talent diversity and inclusion. The Board was also updated on (i) feedback from overseas business units, in particular the positive feedback received\n\nfrom the employees and union of the Citi's Taiwan consumer banking business, (ii) e \u038d orts relating to culture and employee experience and integration of the workforce of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB), and (iii) the Group's focus on continuously refreshing leaders, and promoting internal successors with strong innovative, collaborative and growth mindsets.\n\n## Pursuing inorganic acquisitions and new business initiatives\n\nThe Board reviewed and deliberated on several inorganic acquisitions and new business initiatives, including the (i) establishment of an o \u038d shore technology development centre and the setting up of a proprietary development hub in China, to expand our technology capabilities; (ii) establishment of certain variable capital companies to support and expand DBS' wealth management initiatives and product suites; and (iii) commencement of a software business to o \u038d er solutions to support enterprises' digital transformation. The Board closely monitored the progress of the (i) acquisition of Citi's Taiwan consumer banking business in the course of 2022; and (ii) progress of the continuing integration process of LVB's business with DBS Bank India (DBIL). The Board also deliberated on the risks arising from new business initiatives and ensured that appropriate risk management and governance policies and procedures were put in place to manage these risks.\n\n## Board Renewal\n\nBoard renewal is a key focus for us. In 2022, the Nominating Committee (NC) continued the search for potential candidates who could be lined up for appointment as Directors of DBS Group Holdings Ltd (DBSH) and DBS Bank Ltd (DBS Bank). New Directors will be introduced gradually so that the Board and Board committees have a smooth transition period.\n\nDiversity in, inter alia , gender and skillsets were one of the key considerations in the board renewal process to ensure that (i) the Board is appropriately balanced to support the long-term success of DBS and (ii) the skillsets of the retiring Directors are replaced and/ or the collective skillsets of the Directors is supplemented, and di \u038d erent perspectives are brought to the Board. Other key considerations included (i) whether the candidate would \u0234 t in with our Board's culture and diversity; (ii) the independence status of the candidate; and (iii) whether the candidate would be able to commit su \u025d cient time to ful \u0234 l the duties of a Director. A skills matrix is used to assess if the skills and experience of a candidate complement those of the existing Board members. Potential candidates are informed of the level of contribution and commitment expected of a DBS Director.\n\nAs part of the Board renewal process:\n\n- \u00b7 Mr Ho Tian Yee will be stepping down from the Board at the conclusion of our forthcoming Annual General Meeting (2023 AGM), having served on the Board for more than 11 years. The Board and Management of DBS would like to express their gratitude to Mr Ho for his invaluable contributions to the DBS Group over the years.\n- \u00b7 With Mr Ho's impending retirement and the proposed appointment of an Independent Director: (i) the Board is expected to remain at 10 members; (ii) the proportion of Independent Directors is expected to increase from 6 to 7; and (iii) DBS will bene \u0234 t from the proposed Independent Director's experience in China, being one of DBS' core market.\n- \u00b7 The Board has also taken steps in FY2023 to: (i) e \u038d ect the appointment of said Independent Director that possesses the relevant experience in the \u0234 nancial industry and in jurisdictions including China and the United States; and (ii) obtain regulatory approval for this appointment.\n\n## CEO Updates to the Board\n\nIn 2022, the CEO updated the Board on, inter alia ,\n\n- (i) the entrenchment of our Singapore market leadership;\n- (ii) the progress and impact of our digitalisation e \u038d orts in Singapore;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (iii) bringing our Singapore business to the next level with ecosystem partnerships and data and Arti \u0234 cial Intelligence (AI)/ Machine Learning (ML);\n- (iv) DBIL's performance and 2023 outlook, as well as the integration of the business of LVB with DBIL;\n- (v) the acquisition of Citi's Taiwan consumer banking businesss;\n- (vi) progress on the Group scorecard and performance;\n- (vii)  the employee engagement survey results and focus areas;\n- (viii)  the continuation of our transformation journey, by re-architecturing the construct of our support units in 2022 to make them more horizontally driven;\n- (ix) updates on the Group's business strategy in the Greater Bay Area, India and Indonesia;\n- (x) driving future growth of our business;\n- (xi) macro-overview of our core markets;\n- (xii)  various new business initiatives; and (xiii)  2023 key priorities.\n\n## Nominating Committee (NC)\n\n'The NC continued its e \u03ac ort to enhance the diversity, gender mix, skills, and experience of the Board. In this respect, we have revised our Board Diversity Policy to adopt a 30% female representation target by 2030 and identi \u03ad ed an excellent independent director candidate, who is expected to join our Board after our AGM in 2023, and would complement the existing skillsets and experience of the Board.\n\nThe NC also appointed an internationallyrecognised sustainable \u03ad nance expert, Dr Ben Caldecott, as a non-director member to the Board Sustainability Committee, who adds valuable expertise and fresh perspectives to the BSC.'\n\nTham Sai Choy, NC Chairman\n\n## Highlights of NC's activities in 2022\n\n## Board renewal process\n\nPlease refer to the Board highlights - 2022 section on pages 49 to 50.\n\n## Selection criteria and nomination process for Directors\n\nBefore a new Director is appointed, suitable candidates are identi \u0234 ed from various sources. Thereafter, the NC conducts an assessment to:\n\n- \u00b7 review the candidate (including quali \u0234 cations, attributes, capabilities, skills, age, past experience) to determine whether the candidate is \u0234 t and proper in accordance with the \u0234 t and proper guidelines issued by the MAS; and\n- \u00b7 ascertain whether the candidate is independent from DBSH's substantial shareholder and/ or from management and business relationships with DBS.\n\nThe NC then interviews the short-listed candidates and makes its recommendations to the Board. All Board appointments are based on merit, taking into account the contributions the candidates can bring to the Board to enhance its e \u038d ectiveness. Upon the appointment of a new Director, the NC will recommend to the Board his or her appointment to the appropriate Board committee(s) after matching the Director's skillset to the needs of each Board committee.\n\n## Induction and Training for Directors\n\nThe NC oversees the onboarding of new Directors. All new Directors go through our induction programme, which covers the duties and obligations of a Director and the responsibilities of and work carried out by the Board committees. We provide a Director's pack, which acts as an aide memoire for the information covered by\n\nthe induction programme. We have brie \u0234 ng sessions for Directors given by members of senior management on the various businesses of DBS and its supporting functions. The NC is also responsible for ensuring that new Directors with no prior experience as a director of a listed company in Singapore undergo training in the roles and responsibilities of a director of a listed company.\n\nTo equip Directors with the relevant sustainability knowledge, all Directors have completed their mandatory sustainability training in 2022 by attending the sustainability course, 'Environmental, Social and Governance Essentials' conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors.\n\n## Annual review of Directors' independence\n\nThe NC reviews and determines annually whether each Director is independent in accordance with the stringent standards required of \u0234 nancial institutions prescribed under the Regulations. Under the Regulations, an 'independent director' is de \u0234 ned to mean a Director who is:\n\n- \u00b7 independent from any management and business relationship with DBS;\n- \u00b7 independent from any substantial shareholder of DBS; and\n- \u00b7 has not served on the Board of DBS for a continuous period of nine years or longer.\n\nThe NC assessed and concluded that (i) all Directors are considered to be independent from business relationships with DBS; (ii) with the exception of Mr Piyush Gupta, all Directors are considered to be independent from management relationships with DBS; (iii) with the exception of Mr Chng Kai Fong, all Directors are considered to be independent from DBSH's substantial shareholder, Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (Temasek). Mr Chng, who is the Second Permanent Secretary for The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group, Prime Minister's O \u025d ce (PMO), Singapore, and concurrently the Second Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Communications and Information and Cybersecurity, PMO, is considered not independent of Temasek as the Singapore government is its ultimate owner; and (iv) Mr Peter Seah and Mr Ho Tian Yee are NonIndependent directors as they have served on the Board for more than nine years. Based on the NC's assessment, the Independent Directors are Dr Bonghan Cho, Ms Punita Lal, Ms Judy Lee, Mr Olivier Lim, Mr Anthony Lim and Mr Tham Sai Choy.\n\nAlthough Mr Piyush Gupta, Mr Ho Tian Yee, Ms Judy Lee, Mr Olivier Lim, Mr Anthony Lim, Mr Peter Seah and Mr Tham Sai Choy are on the boards of companies that have business relationships with DBS, and\n\nare also directors of companies in which Temasek has investments (Temasek portfolio companies), the NC considers these Directors (i) independent of business relationships as the revenues arising from such relationships are not material; and (ii) independent of Temasek as their appointments on the boards of Temasek portfolio companies are nonexecutive in nature and they are not involved in the day-to-day conduct of the businesses of the Temasek portfolio companies. In addition, none of these Directors sit on any of the boards of the Temasek portfolio companies as a representative of Temasek and they do not take instructions from Temasek in acting as Directors.\n\n## Board performance and evaluation\n\nThe NC makes an assessment at least once a year to determine whether the Board and Board committees are performing e \u038d ectively and identi \u0234 es steps for improvement. The NC believes that it is important to obtain an independent perspective on the Board's performance periodically, and to gain insights on the Board's performance against peer boards and best practices. An external evaluator was last engaged to conduct the Board performance evaluation for the \u0234 nancial year ended 2021.\n\nIn 2022, the NC considered the results and key action items from the 2021 Board evaluation and decided to use substantially the same evaluation questionnaire for 2021 for benchmarking purposes. The questionnaire included questions on Board composition, Board information, Board processes/ culture, Board accountability, Capital/ risk, Management, Standards of Conduct, Board relationships and e \u038d ectiveness of Board committees. Each Director was asked to complete the questionnaire and submit it directly to the Group Secretary who collated the responses and produced a summary report for the NC. The NC analysed the report and submitted its \u0234 ndings to the Board. The Board noted the \u0234 ndings of the evaluation and discussed the comments received from several directors.\n\nIn addition to the annual Board evaluation exercise, the NC also conducts an annual review of each Director to determine whether each Director remains quali \u0234 ed for o \u025d ce. In making its determination, the NC will take into account (i) the Director's age, track record, experience, skills and capabilities; (ii) whether each Director is able to and has been adequately carrying out his/ her duties as a Director, including the contributions and performance of each Director; and (iii) whether each Director has committed su \u025d cient time to his/ her duties as a director of DBS. The Board is satis \u0234 ed that each Director has diligently discharged his or her duties as a Director of DBS and has contributed meaningfully to DBS.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' time commitment\n\nThe meeting attendance records of all Directors as well as a list of their directorships of listed companies and their principal commitments are fully disclosed in our Annual Report. The NC assesses each Director's ability to commit time to DBS' a \u038d airs in accordance with internal guidelines which take into account the number of other board and committee memberships a Director holds, as well as the size and complexity of the companies in which he/ she is a board member. Additionally, each Director is required to complete an annual selfassessment of his/ her time commitments.\n\nWhile the Board has not set a maximum number of listed company board representations a Director may hold, all Directors appreciate the high level of commitment required of a Director. All Directors have met the requirements under the NC's guidelines. Based on the recent individual Director self-assessment for FY2022, and attendance of Board and Board Committee meetings during the year, the NC was satis \u0234 ed that where a Director had other listed company board representations, and/ or other principal commitments, the Director was able and had been adequately carrying out his/ her duties as a director of DBS.\n\n## Directors' tenure\n\nThe NC members believe that it is in the interests of DBS for the Board to be comprised of some Directors with long tenure who have a deep understanding of the banking industry, as well as Directors with shorter tenures who can bring fresh ideas and perspectives. There are currently three Directors who have served for more than 11 years, and this is balanced by the progressive refreshing of the Board where six long-serving Directors have stepped down and seven new Directors have been appointed since November 2017 (when we commenced the refreshing process). In addition, one of the long-serving Director (being Mr Ho Tian Yee) will step down after the conclusion of the 2023 AGM.\n\nThe NC speci \u0234 cally considered the skillsets and contributions of two long-serving Directors who will be remaining on the Board (being Mr Peter Seah and Mr Piyush Gupta). The NC deliberated and agreed that it is in DBS' interests for these Directors to continue serving on the Board of DBS for the following reasons:\n\n- i) it is important that Mr Peter Seah remains as the Board Chairman to provide leadership and continuity. Mr Seah is a veteran former banker with wide industry experience, and he has been instrumental in the growth and transformation of DBS\n\nover the past 13 years. From a strategic perspective, the next few years continue to be critical as DBS continues to execute on its digital transformation, growth and sustainability strategies (especially with the prevailing macro-economic and geo-political headwinds and enhance its franchise in the Greater Bay Area, China, Taiwan, India and Indonesia; and\n\n- ii) as CEO, Mr Piyush Gupta should remain as a Director to provide the Board with insights into the business.\n\n## Re-election of Directors\n\nUnder the Constitution of DBSH, one-third of Directors who are longest-serving since their last re-election are required to retire from o \u025d ce and, if eligible, stand for re-election at each AGM. Based on this rotation process, each Director is required to submit himself or herself for re-election by shareholders at least once every three years. In addition, new Directors (who are appointed in between AGMs) are required under DBSH's Constitution to stand for re-election at the \u0234 rst AGM after their appointment. The NC reviews and recommends to the Board the rotation and reelection of Directors at the AGM.\n\nPrior to each AGM, Group Secretariat informs the NC which Directors are required to retire at that AGM. The NC will then review the composition of the Board and decide whether to recommend to the Board the re-election of these Directors, after taking into account factors such as their attendance, participation, contribution, expertise and competing time commitments.\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, Mr Peter Seah, Mr Ho Tian Yee, Ms Punita Lal and Mr Anthony Lim will be retiring by rotation. At the recommendation of the NC and as approved by the Board, Mr Peter Seah, Ms Punita Lal and Mr Anthony Lim will be standing for re-election at the 2023 AGM, while Mr Ho Tian Yee (who has served on the Board for more than 11 years) will be retiring at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM.\n\n## Review of composition of Board Committees\n\nThe NC regularly reviewed the size and composition of the Board committees in 2022 to ensure that all independence requirements continue to be met, and that the Board committees are of an appropriate size and comprise the appropriate balance of skills, knowledge and experience, as well as diversity of nationality, age and gender.\n\n## Continuous development programme for all Directors\n\nThe NC monitors the frequency and quality of the Board training sessions, which are conducted either by external professionals or by management. The NC selects topics which are relevant to the Group's activities. Board members also contribute by highlighting areas of interests and possible topics.\n\nThe topics presented to the Board in 2022 as part of the continuous development programme included: (i) training sessions on DBS' country risk management and fundamental review of the trading book, (ii) insights from external experts on (a) climate risk management, as well as (b) managing ransomware and supply chain cyber risks from the regulators' perspective.\n\n## Board diversity\n\nWe recognise that diversity is not merely limited to gender or any other personal attributes. We adopted a Board Diversity Policy which recognises the importance of having an e \u038d ective and diverse Board, and states that the NC is responsible for setting the relevant objectives that promote and achieve diversity on the Board. In discharging its duties, the NC shall give due regard to the bene \u0234 ts of all aspects of diversity and strive to ensure that the Board is appropriately balanced to support the long-term success of DBS.\n\nThe main objective of the Board Diversity Policy is to continue to maintain the appropriate balance of perspectives, skills and experience on the Board to support the long-term success of DBS. The Board Diversity Policy provides that the NC shall endeavour to ensure that female candidates are included for consideration when identifying candidates to be appointed as new directors, with the aim of having not less than two female directors on the Board, and will target to achieve 30% female Board representation by 2030. Currently, two out of 10 directors on the Board (20% of the Board) are female.\n\nThe NC is responsible for developing a framework to identify the skills that the Board collectively needs in order to discharge the Board's responsibilities e \u038d ectively, taking into account the complexity of DBS' existing risk pro \u0234 le, business operations and future business strategy. The NC has put in place a skills matrix which classi \u0234 es skills, experience and knowledge of Directors into the following broad categories (i) Industry knowledge and experience; (ii) Financial and commercial acumen; (iii) Governance; (iv) Leadership; (v) Digital Transformation; and (vi) Sustainability.\n\nThe NC believes that there is an appropriate balance of industry knowledge, skills, background, experience, professional quali \u0234 cations, age and gender on the Board, and is satis \u0234 ed that the objectives of the Board Diversity Policy continue to be met.\n\n## Board Executive Committee (EXCO)\n\n'In 2022, the Board EXCO continued to serve as a sounding board to Management on signi \u03ad cant issues, including potential acquisitions and divestments, large transactions and material initiatives, and large credit and country limit reviews in markets that the Group has a presence in.'\n\n## Peter Seah\n\nChairman, Board EXCO\n\n## Highlights of EXCO's activities in 2022\n\n- \u00b7 The EXCO assists the Board to enhance the business strategies and strengthen core competencies of DBS. The EXCO meets frequently (12 meetings in 2022) and is able to o \u038d er greater responsiveness in the decision-making process of DBS.\n- \u00b7 In addition to its quarterly review of weak credit cases, matters discussed and/ or endorsed at the EXCO meetings in 2022 included (i) Russia-Ukraine war and energy price impact on DBS' portfolio; (ii) renewal of the credit programmes in Singapore and Hong Kong for SMEs; (iii) annual reviews of country (transfer risk) limits; (iv) the expansion of the Group's wealth management business and product suites with the establishment of several variable capital companies catering to retail customers, private banking and Treasures private clients; (v) the establishment of a software business leveraging on the Group's expertise in technology; (vi) additional investment in our Climate Impact X joint venture with Temasek Holdings, SGX and Stanchart; and (vii) various acquisition and investment/ divestment opportunities.\n\n## Audit Committee (AC)\n\n'In 2022, the AC focused on key audit matters highlighted by the external auditors as well as areas where management has applied judgement in the preparation of the Group's \u03ad nancial statements.\n\nIt also conducted a thorough review of reports from Group Audit and Legal and Compliance, as part of its assessment of the adequacy and e \u03ac ectiveness of the Group's internal controls, and determined that the Group's internal controls remain adequate and e \u03ac ective.\n\nThe AC reviewed forthcoming developments that may impact the Bank, including the Base Erosion and Pro \u03ad t Shifting Project, as well as new business and accounting initiatives. To ensure we continue to maintain high levels of compliance with sustainability reporting standards and industry best practices, the AC will continue to monitor developments in this area as the industry \u03ad nalises the relevant standards.'\n\n## Tham Sai Choy Chairman, AC\n\n## Highlights of AC's activities in 2022\n\n## Oversight of \u0234 nancial reporting and disclosure matters\n\nIn response to the risk-based approach to quarterly reporting that was adopted by the Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) from 7 February 2020, the Group transitioned to a semi-annual reporting regime that is complemented by trading updates between the half-yearly \u0234 nancial reports. The trading updates, which comprise the pro \u0234 t and loss account, key balance sheet items, \u0234 nancial ratios and business commentary, are intended to provide investors with continued line of sight on the Group's ongoing performance.\n\nThe AC reviewed the Group's trading updates and half-yearly \u0234 nancial statements, and recommended these to the Board for approval. The AC also took into account the assurances provided by the CEO and CFO that the \u0234 nancial statements are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Banking Act, Singapore Companies Act and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)), and that the Group's \u0234 nancial risk management and internal control systems are adequate and e \u038d ective.\n\nThe AC members were kept updated on changes to accounting standards and signi \u0234 cant accounting matters involving the exercise of judgement. During the course of the \u0234 nancial year, the AC reviewed the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Asset quality and the adequacy of provisions in light of the ongoing RussiaUkraine war as well as recession concerns amid high in \u0235 ation and interest rate environment, giving due consideration to the application of the SFRS(I) ECL requirements as well as guidance provided by international regulators and the MAS;\n- \u00b7 Valuation matters, including assessing the adequacy of valuation reserves and the carrying value of goodwill;\n- \u00b7 Impact of the Base Erosion and Pro \u0234 t Shifting (BEPS) Project on DBS Group and our engagement with the authorities with respect to BEPS; and\n- \u00b7 Accounting issues and developments on integration of Citi's Taiwan consumer banking business.\n\nThe AC reviewed the Group's audited consolidated \u0234 nancial statements for FY2022 and discussed with management and the external auditor the signi \u0234 cant matters which involved management judgement.\n\n## Please refer to the table on page 54 for further information on these signi \u0234 cant matters. These matters are also discussed in the independent auditor's report on pages 116 to 121.\n\nThe AC is of the view that the Group's consolidated \u0234 nancial statements for FY2022 are fairly presented in conformity with the relevant SFRS(I) in all material aspects. The Board has been noti \u0234 ed that the Group's external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), has read and considered the other information (i.e. other than the \u0234 nancial statements and auditor's report thereon) in the annual report, whether \u0234 nancial or non\u0234 nancial, in accordance with the Singapore Standard on Auditing 720. For the \u0234 nancial year ended 31 December 2022: (i) no material inconsistencies between the other information, the \u0234 nancial statements and PwC's knowledge obtained in the audit; and (ii) no material misstatements of the other information, have been reported.",

The AC noted that major weak credits are reviewed by the Board Executive Committee quarterly and presented to  the AC. The AC was apprised of the external auditor's work over credit, which included sampling across performing,  watch-list and non-performing portfolios to assess the appropriateness of the loan ratings and classi \u0234  cation, as well  as the adequacy of speci \u0234  c allowances where applicable. Additionally, the AC considered the results from Group  Audit's independent assessment of the Group's credit portfolios across key markets and credit risk management  process. The AC is of the view that the speci \u0234  c allowances that have been set aside for non-performing credit  exposures are appropriate. |\n| General allowances  for credit losses          | The AC reviewed the governance arrangements, including the matters considered by the Expected Credit Loss  (ECL) Review Committee, as well as the key drivers of the quarterly movements in Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL (General  Allowances). These included the changes in portfolio asset quality, prevailing economic and geopolitical conditions,  as well as modelled overlays to re \u0235  ect management's assessment of these factors. The AC noted that ECL models  are validated by the Model Validation Team, which also monitors the models' performance, and approved by the  Group Credit Risk Models Committee. The AC took into account the external auditor's observations, which included a  review of selected portfolios by credit specialists, along with assessments of the Group's methodologies (including the  reasonableness of certain forward-looking economic inputs), processes and controls. The AC, on the back of these                           |\n| Goodwill                                       | The AC reviewed the methodology and key assumptions driving the cash  \u0235  ow projections that are used in the  determination of the value-in-use of the DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd's franchise, including the macroeconomic  outlook. It assesses the sensitivities of the value-in-use to reasonably possible changes in the valuation parameters.  The AC was apprised of the external auditor's observations from its review of management's goodwill impairment  assessment, and concurs that there is no impairment as at 31 December 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Valuation matters                              | The AC reviewed the governance arrangements, including the deliberations of the Group Valuation Committee,  as well as the fair value hierarchy of  \u0234  nancial instruments held at fair value, the quarterly movements in valuation  reserves, the appropriateness of the Group's valuation methodology in light of industry developments, and  the overall adequacy of valuation reserves. The AC was apprised of the external auditor's observations from its  assessment of the Group's controls over the valuation process, as well as its conclusion, based on the result of its  independent estimates, that the valuation of  \u0234  nancial instruments held at fair value was within a reasonable range of  outcomes. The AC considers the valuation process, policies and estimates as adopted and disclosed in the  \u0234  nancial  statements to be appropriate.                                                                                                        |\n\n## Oversight of Group Audit\n\nThe AC has direct oversight of Group Audit. The AC receives reports from Group Audit at each quarterly AC meeting, which provide the AC with an update on (i) the overall control environment (based on the results of the audit reviews in the preceding quarter); (ii) the key \u0234 ndings from audit reviews and the remediation actions which have been, or will be, taken to address these \u0234 ndings; (iii) an overview of the audit issues (including re-aged and past due issues) and audit reports issued during the preceding quarter; and (iv) any changes to the audit plan for AC approval.\n\n## Please refer to page 59 for details on Group Audit's key responsibilities and processes.\n\nIn addition to the \u0234 ndings from the routine audits conducted by Group Audit in 2022, the AC was also apprised of the \u0234 ndings from other reviews initiated by Group Audit. These reviews covered new businesses such as the Digital Asset Ecosystem and the variable capital companies established to support and expand DBS' wealth management initiatives\n\nand product suites. The AC was also updated on the audits that focused on the Bank's IT cybersecurity and resiliency that includes the results of the cyber red team simulation conducted to assess DBS' cyber security posture across all locations which covered external attack scenarios, insider threats and IT systems hosted in the cloud.\n\nThe AC assessed the adequacy, e \u038d ectiveness and independence of Group Audit, and is of the view that Group Audit is independent, e \u038d ective and adequately resourced. Group Audit understands the risks that the Group faces and has aligned its work to review these risks.\n\nThere is at least one scheduled private session annually for the Head of Group Audit to meet the AC. The Chair of the AC meets the Head of Group Audit regularly to discuss the audit plans, current work, key \u0234 ndings and other signi \u0234 cant matters of Group Audit regularly to discuss the audit plans, current work, key \u0234 ndings and other signi \u0234 cant matters.\n\n## Reviewing performance, objectivity and independence of the external auditor\n\nThe AC has unfettered access to the external auditor. Separate sessions were held during each of the four quarterly AC meetings in 2022 for the AC to meet with the external auditor without the presence of management to discuss matters that might have to be raised privately. The planned transition of the PwC partner in charge of the audit from Antony Eldridge to Yura Mahindroo was smooth.\n\nThe AC monitors the performance, objectivity and independence of the external auditor. For this purpose, the AC takes into account the Audit Quality Indicators Disclosure Framework issued by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA); the guidance provided in Practice Guidance 10 of the 2018 Code, as well as the principles outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in its document 'The External Audits of Banks'.\n\nThe total fees due to PwC for the \u0234 nancial year ended 31 December 2022 and the breakdown of the fees for audit and non-audit services, are set out in the table below. The AC reviewed the non-audit services provided by the external auditor during the \u0234 nancial year and the associated fees. The AC is satis \u0234 ed that the independence and objectivity of the external auditor have not been impaired by the provision of those services.\n\n| Fees relating to PwC  services for FY2022   |   SGD  (million) |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| For audit and audit-related  services       |             10.3 |\n| For non-audit services                      |              1.1 |\n| Total                                       |             11.4 |\n\nThe AC considered the following matters in its review of the external auditor's performance and when formulating its recommendation on the re-appointment of the external auditor:\n\n- \u00b7 the performance of the external auditor against industry and regulatory standards;\n- \u00b7 the scope of the audit plan and areas of audit focus as agreed with the external auditor;\n- \u00b7 the quality of audit services rendered, and reports and \u0234 ndings presented, by the external auditor during the year;\n- \u00b7 feedback received from various functions/ geographical locations, through an annual structured internal survey, on the adequacy and quality of the audit team's resources, the level of independence and scepticism exercised in carrying out its work, and its overall e \u025d ciency and e \u038d ectiveness;\n- \u00b7 the Audit Quality Indicators data of the external auditor; and\n- \u00b7 the external auditor's self-assessment, including the con \u0234 rmation of its independence, to the AC.\n\nBased on these considerations, the AC has recommended, and the Board has endorsed, the re-appointment of PwC for shareholders' approval at the 2023 AGM. The Group has complied with Rule 712 and Rule 715 of the SGX Listing Manual in relation to its external auditor.\n\n## Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC)\n\n'In 2022, the BRMC continued to oversee DBS' risk governance approach and monitor all key risk areas. In addition to our ongoing risk management e \u03ac orts, the BRMC also considered the impact of the rapidly changing macro environment on our portfolio.\n\nDuring the year, we reviewed many areas, including cybersecurity, scams, integration risk of our acquisitions, \u03ad nancial crimes e \u03ac orts, as well as initiatives to improve our technology resiliency.\n\nSetting the tone from the top to embed a strong risk culture is critical to DBS' success and remains a focus for the BRMC.'\n\nOlivier Lim\n\nChairman, BRMC\n\n## Highlights of BRMC's activities in 2022\n\nThe BRMC's approach continued to be underpinned by a philosophy that risk management in complex and large organisations is best served by holistically integrating governance, culture, talent, structure and processes.\n\nThe BRMC convened at least quarterly to review the bank's risk pro \u0234 le, risk dashboards and other reports through a structured and consistent agenda format. The BRMC monitored global political and economic events, the impact of interest rate hikes, and other factors that might have material consequences for our business.\n\nIn 2022, the BRMC discussed the \u0234 ndings and the impact arising from scenario analyses and portfolio reviews conducted on certain countries and speci \u0234 c sectors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 In \u0235 ationary pressures prompting signi \u0234 cant rate hikes by central banks resulting in slower economic growth/ recession\n- \u00b7 Russia-Ukraine con \u0235 ict and the impact on supply chain, commodity/ energy prices and key exports from the two countries\n- \u00b7 Defaults of major Chinese real estate developers triggering a property sector downturn in China and other contagion e \u038d ect\n\nThe scenario analyses are in addition to the reviews of various regulatory and internal stress testing exercises.\n\nThe BRMC also reviewed management's assessment of the impact arising from the following events:\n\n- \u00b7 Elevated US-China-Taiwan tensions, in particular, areas such as capital market restrictions, export bans and trade tari \u038d s\n- \u00b7 Slowdown in China's economy, including weak domestic consumption and RMB depreciation\n- \u00b7 Strong USD against the developing/ emerging markets currencies (e.g., INR and IDR).\n\nThe BRMC was updated on the liquidity risk pro \u0234 le and discussed the impact of customer funds switching out from current/ savings accounts to \u0234 xed deposits. It was kept informed of the utilisation of market risk (for both banking and trading books) and liquidity risk (in all major currencies and legal entities) limits, as well as the key operational risk pro \u0234 les of the Group.\n\nThe BRMC endorsed the incorporation of environmental risk in the Group's risk appetite statement, with a focus on managing exposures with material climate transition and physical risks. The BRMC was updated on the risk and controls of new businesses (e.g., Digital Asset Ecosystem) as well as the integration progress of LVB and Citi's Taiwan consumer banking business. It was also regularly updated on the initiatives to improve our technology resiliency in the course of 2022.\n\nThe BRMC was advised on the key operational risk pro \u0234 les of the Group and the continued focus on global trends on \u0234 nancial crime (such as anti-money laundering, countering the \u0234 nancing of terrorism, and digital scams), fair dealing and conduct risks as well as the cyber security environment. In view of the worsening geopolitical tensions, the BRMC was updated on the increased e \u038d orts taken to address the risks arising from sanctions evasion and cyber security.\n\nThe BRMC reviewed and approved the risk models governance framework, which covers the development, approval and ongoing performance monitoring. The BRMC received regular updates on risk appetite and economic capital utilisation, and was apprised of regulatory feedback and developments (such as approaches for risk models and capital computation) and Basel requirements. In addition, the BRMC was updated on the action plans following the internal group-wide risk and control culture survey conducted in 2021.\n\nPlease refer to the section on 'Risk Management' in this Annual Report for more information on the BRMC's activities.",

In 2022, 99.6% of our employees have undergone training, with 8,339 employees in the process of going through upskilling and reskilling.\n\nThe CMDC also ensured that the Group's remuneration remained competitive with the right compensation benchmarks being considered, in the context of the Bank's performance, productivity and market conditions.'\n\nAnthony Lim Chairman, CMDC\n\n## Highlights of CMDC's activities in 2022\n\n## Group remuneration policy and annual variable pay pool\n\nPlease refer to the Remuneration Report on pages 63 to 67 for details on the remuneration of the CEO and DBS' remuneration strategy.\n\nThe CMDC reviews and approves DBS' remuneration policy and the annual variable pay pool, which are also endorsed by the Board. The CMDC provides oversight of the remuneration principles of the CEO, senior executives and control functions to ensure that they are in line with the Financial Stability Board's guidelines. As part of the review of the annual variable pay pool as well as the remuneration of the CEO and senior executives, the CMDC appraises how well DBS has performed against the balanced scorecard for each year.\n\nDuring the year, the CMDC reviews market trends to ensure that the Group's remuneration remains competitive in the context of our performance and productivity.\n\nThe following changes were also reviewed for implementation e \u038d ective for grants from 2023:\n\n(i) increase deferral rates to at least 40% for Material Risk Personnel to be in line with the Additional Guidelines on Code of Corporate Governance, (ii) vest deferred awards for bonus eligible employees equally over 4 years in line with market practice, and (iii) change vesting of Special Award from 4 years to 3 years to enhance talent retention.\n\nDBS also has a robust disciplinary framework linked to individual compensation. The CMDC was apprised of the impact of disciplinary actions on individuals' compensation when approving the annual variable compensation pool and noted that (i) the Group's risk management and internal control systems are adequate and e \u038d ective, and (ii) the 2022 Risk & Culture score from the Kincentric My Voice survey increased to 92%. DBS' score is better than the APAC Financial Services Industry and APAC Best Employer benchmarks by 8% and 1% respectively.\n\n## Talent Review and Succession Planning\n\nThe CMDC reviews the state of talent and the strength of the human capital in DBS in support of its business. This includes a review of the business strategy of the business, the target operating model, and talent bench strength required to drive our business outcomes. b\n\nThe CMDC also reviews the succession plans for CEO and GMC members. Succession\n\nPlanning is a rigorous process in DBS which includes inputs from the respective Country and Group Functional Heads, followed by detailed reviews with the CEO. The CMDC evaluates the succession plans of CEO and the GMC members based on DBS' proprietary 'Key Success Factors' framework, which comprises four dimensions of a DBS senior leader success pro \u0234 le: (i) domain knowledge, (ii) critical experiences, (iii) leadership competencies and (iv) leadership traits. Potential successors for GMC are evaluated against these four dimensions to assess their readiness, and development plans to address their leadership gaps are put in place to prepare them for succession. b\n\nIn reviewing our talent bench strength, the CMDC evaluates how our High Potentials (HIPOs) have been identi \u0234 ed, developed, compensated and progressed in their career with the Bank. We follow a robust HIPO identi \u0234 cation process based on the '3P framework', namely Performance, PRIDE! and Potential. The assessment of potential is based on one's ability, aspiration and engagement. Identi \u0234 ed HIPOs are developed through a comprehensive 'Triple-E Development Framework' which focuses on actionable development activities around education (conferences and leadership programs), exposure (mentoring, coaching and networking) and experience (new or stretched\n\n## Non-executive directors' fee structure for FY2022 (unchanged from FY2021)\n\n| Basic annual retainer fees                                                                       | SGD       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Board                                                                                            | 100,000   |\n| Lead Independent Director                                                                        | 75,000    |\n| Additional Chairman fees for:                                                                    |           |\n| Board                                                                                            | 1,450,000 |\n| Audit Committee                                                                                  | 90,000    |\n| Board Risk Management Committee                                                                  | 90,000    |\n| Board Sustainability Committee                                                                   | 65,000    |\n| Compensation and Management Development Committee                                                | 65,000    |\n| Executive Committee                                                                              | 75,000    |\n| Nominating Committee                                                                             | 45,000    |\n| Additional committee member fees for: (Note: Board committee chairpersons do not get these fees) |           |\n| Audit Committee                                                                                  | 60,000    |\n| Board Risk Management Committee                                                                  | 60,000    |\n| Board Sustainability Committee                                                                   | 42,000    |\n| Compensation and Management Development Committee                                                | 35,000    |\n| Executive Committee                                                                              | 60,000    |\n| Nominating Committee                                                                             | 30,000    |\n\nroles, cross country and cross function assignments), all designed to accelerate their growth and groom them for potential succession to key leadership roles in the future. b This disciplined process ensures that the Bank builds a robust succession pipeline deeper down the organisation for resilience. b\n\n## Learning and Leadership\n\nDBS places heavy investment in the development of our people as guided by our Triple-E Development Framework. Areas of learning focus are determined by reviewing market trends and relevant skills needed to drive our business. Campaigns are launched to promote a strong learning culture, and the introduction of bite-sized e-learning modules promotes accessibility to learning for our employees. We have seen an increase in learning consumption during the pandemic years. In 2022, we launched an AI-powered personalised career companion (iGrow) to help every DBS employee identify future career aspirations, skills required to reach these goals and provide relevant learning and role exposure opportunities.\n\nThe CMDC is kept apprised on our yearon-year learning metrics including average learning places per employee, average learning hours per employee and training expenses as a percentage of budget. It also reviews how we ensure our employees receive learning in relevant skills for the business.\n\nIn 2022, 35,943 active employees (99.6% of total headcount) have undergone training and the average learning places per employee was 40.5. We also identi \u0234 ed 8,339 employees for upskilling and reskilling, of which 87.3% have completed or are in-progress with their learning roadmaps.\n\nOur DBS Transformational Leadership Plan continues to gain traction. Through our internally-designed and facilitated leadership workshops such as our T-Sprints and T-Circles, and also our signature leadership development programmes such as Building Great Managers and Making Great Decisions, we work to embed our DBS Transformational Leadership attributes into our leaders and our leadership teams. Our average Manager E \u038d ectiveness score has improved to 91%.\n\n## Recruitment\n\nThe CMDC reviews the recruitment trends, such as the year-on-year hiring numbers, job families or roles which the Bank hires for.\n\nIn 2022, we experienced a surge in hiring, mainly into technology and revenue generating roles.\n\nIn 2023, we expect the hiring pace to slow down in line with the macro environment.\n\nThe CMDC also reviews the e \u025d cacy of our recruitment strategy including how sourcing is done through various channels such as campus recruitment, career sites, social media, internal mobility, sta \u038d referrals etc, and how candidates are assessed and selected using a combination of tools including AI, assessments tests and interviews.\n\nIt is kept apprised of the data-driven approach in which the recruitment team uses to drive and track business outcomes such as productivity of recruiters, speed to hire, quality of hires, hiring managers' and candidates' satisfaction level etc.\n\n## Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors\n\nPlease refer to pages 43 to 44 for details of remuneration of each Non-Executive Director (including the Chairman) for FY2022.\n\nThe CMDC reviews and recommends a framework to the Board for determining the remuneration of all non-executive Directors. The remuneration of non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, has been benchmarked against global and local \u0234 nancial institutions. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, non-executive Directors receive 70% of their fees in cash and the remaining 30% in share awards.\n\nThe share awards are not subject to a vesting period, but are subject to a selling moratorium whereby each non-executive Director is required to hold the equivalent of one year's basic retainer fees for his or her tenure as a Director and for one year after the date he or she steps down. The fair value of share grants to the non-executive Directors are based on the volume-weighted average price of the ordinary shares of DBSH over the 10 trading days immediately prior to (and excluding) the date of the AGM. The actual number of ordinary shares to be awarded are rounded down to the nearest share, and any residual balance is paid in cash. Other than these share awards, the non-executive Directors do not receive any other share incentives or securities under the DBSH Share Plan.\n\nThe table on page 56 sets out the annual fee structure for the non-executive Directors for FY2022. There is no change to the annual fee structure from FY2021. Non-executive Directors are also paid attendance fees for attending Board and Board committee meetings. Shareholders are entitled to vote on the remuneration of non-executive Directors at the 2023 AGM.\n\nAlthough the non-executive Directors' fee structure for FY2022 remains unchanged from the previous year, the amount of nonexecutive Directors' remuneration for FY2022 is approximately 8.2% higher than that for FY2021. The higher remuneration for FY2022 is mainly attributable to the following reasons: (i) Higher attendance fees due to the increased number of physical meetings in 2022 (as opposed to virtual); (ii) the establishment of the BSC; and (iii) an increase in the number of AC members.\n\nIn addition, Mr Peter Seah (who is also the Chairman of DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited) received director's fees of HKD 1,096,000 for FY2022, and Mr Tham Sai Choy (who sits on the board of DBS Bank (China) Limited) received director's fees of CNY 540,000 in FY2022.\n\nNone of the Group's employees was an immediate family member of a Director with remuneration exceeding SGD 100,000 in 2022.\n\n## Board Sustainability Committee (BSC)\n\n'In 2022, we established the BSC to build on our sustainability agenda and net-zero commitment. This underscores the growing importance of sustainability as a strategic imperative for us and the additional Boardlevel oversight it warrants.\n\nThe BSC provides additional governance and oversight of material ESG matters in respect of our three sustainability pillars, including climate-related matters and our annual sustainability disclosures.\n\nWe also welcomed Dr Ben Caldecott to the BSC in June 2022, where his expertise in sustainable \u03ad nance is a valuable asset to the BSC and the Group.\n\nThe BSC will continue to oversee the complex and extensive work done in driving the transition to net zero, as we further weave ESG into the fabric of our business in 2023.'\n\nPiyush Gupta, Chairman, BSC",

He is an internationallyrecognised sustainable \u0234 nance expert who is the founding Director of the Oxford Sustainable Finance Group at the University of Oxford Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. At the University of Oxford, he is the inaugural Lombard Odier Associate Professor of Sustainable Finance, the \u0234 rst ever endowed professorship of sustainable \u0234 nance. In addition, he serves on the Adaptation Committee of the UK Climate Change Committee and is co-head of the Transition Plan Taskforce established by HM Treasury in 2022 to advise on net zero transition plans.\n\n## Oversight of sustainability reporting and climate-related disclosure matters\n\nIn response to tracking our disclosures following our public commitment to join the Net Zero Banking Alliance, the BSC reviewed and approved the publication of a set of targets for our Scope 3 \u0234 nanced emissions that will guide us on strategically channeling \u0234 nancing away from high-emitting activities towards low-carbon alternatives.\n\nIn addition, in order to elevate our commitments and enhance our disclosures on the social agenda, the BSC reviewed and approved the publication of policies relating to human rights and diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as enhanced disclosures related to our approach to human rights due diligence.\n\n## Oversight of Group Sustainability Council\n\nThe BSC has direct oversight of the Group Sustainability Council, which is chaired by the Chief Sustainability O \u025d cer and comprises senior members from key business and support units across DBS. The BSC received reports from the Chief Sustainability O \u025d cer, who chairs the Group Sustainability Council, which provided the BSC with an update on all material sustainability e \u038d orts such as progress on the operationalisation of our net zero commitments, and enhanced sustainability disclosures, among other matters.\n\n## Oversight of other emerging sustainability issues\n\nThe BSC also discussed on key developments, such as climate \u0234 nance and adaptation, addressed at the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), and the corresponding risks, opportunities, and impacts to the bank.\n\n## Announcement of Decarbonisation Commitments\n\nAs part of DBS' commitment to being net zero in its \u0234 nanced emissions by 2050, the BSC was actively involved in reviewing and approving a report setting out sectoral targets for nine sectors, and aligned with sciencebased decarbonisation glidepaths. This report was announced in September 2022. The BSC will review the targets periodically and any updates on DBS' progress will be provided annually in the Sustainability Report.\n\nPlease refer to the Governance chapter in the Sustainability Report 2022 for more details on the sustainability-related governance structure.\n\n## E \u038d ective controls\n\n## Group Approving Authority\n\nThe Group Approving Authority (GAA) is an integral part of our corporate governance framework and was updated in August 2022. The Board's responsibilities are well de \u0234 ned in the GAA. The Board is the decision-making body for matters with signi \u0234 cant impact to DBS as a whole; these include matters with strategic, \u0234 nancial or reputational implications or consequences. The speci \u0234 c matters that require board approval under the GAA include:\n\n- \u00b7 Group's annual and interim \u0234 nancial statements;\n- \u00b7 investments and divestments exceeding certain material limits;\n- \u00b7 Group's annual budget;\n- \u00b7 capital expenditures and expenses exceeding certain material limits;\n- \u00b7 capital-related matters including capital adequacy objectives, capital structure, capital issuance and redemption;\n- \u00b7 dividend policy; and\n- \u00b7 risk strategy and risk appetite statement.\n\n## Scope of delegation of authority in the GAA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe GAA ensures that appropriate controls and decision-making are consistently applied throughout DBS. Under the GAA, the Board has delegated to the CEO the responsibility to ensure that the Group's businesses and operations are operated in accordance with Board-approved strategies and standards, which include responsibilities for the internal control framework within DBS. On matters where authority has been delegated to him, the CEO may further delegate his responsibilities and authorities to any GMC\n\nmember or members and may empower them to, in turn, delegate their responsibilities and authorities to other executives and committees of the Group.\n\nThe GAA covers internal authority only and does not override any speci \u0234 c provisions arising from statutory, regulatory, exchange listing requirements, or the DBSH's Constitution. The GAA is regularly reviewed and updated to accommodate changes in the scope and activities of DBS' business and operations. The Board approves the GAA and any change to it.\n\n## Internal controls framework\n\nOur internal controls framework covers \u0234 nancial, operational, compliance and information technology controls, as well as risk management policies and systems. The Board, supported by the AC and BRMC, oversees the Group's system of internal controls and risk management. DBS adopts the Three Lines Model for risk management, where each line has clear roles and responsibilities.\n\n## First line\n\nOur business and support units are our \u0234 rst line. Their responsibilities include the identi \u0234 cation and management of risks arising from and relating to their respective areas of responsibilities, and ensuring that our operations remain within approved boundaries of our risk appetite and policies. DBS has an established incident noti \u0234 cation protocol that sets out processes for the escalation of incidents according to the level of severity. In this way, appropriate levels of management are made aware of such incidents and can take action accordingly. There are also well-de \u0234 ned procedures for the escalation, investigation and follow up of any reported wrong-doing by a DBS employee, customer, vendor or third party.\n\n## Second line\n\nRisk Management Group, Group Legal and Compliance and parts of Group Technology & Operations and Group Finance form the second line. They are responsible for the development and maintenance of risk management policies and processes and they provide objective review and challenge on the activities undertaken by business and support units.\n\n## Third line\n\nGroup Audit forms the third line. It provides an independent assessment and assurance on the reliability, adequacy and e \u038d ectiveness of our system of internal controls, risk management, governance framework and processes.\n\n| Board, CEO and    | Provides oversight of the three lines model                 | Provides oversight of the three lines model                   | Provides oversight of the three lines model   |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Senior Management | First line                                                  | Second line                                                   | Third line                                    |\n| Role              | Own and manage risks in respective  areas of responsibility | Provide independent risk oversight,  monitoring and reporting | Provide independent assurance                 |\n| Unit              | Business and support units                                  | Risk Management, Legal and  Compliance                        | Internal Audit                                |\n\n## Group Audit\n\n## Key responsibilities and processes\n\nGroup Audit is independent of the activities it audits. Its objectives, scope of authority and responsibilities are de \u0234 ned in the Audit Charter, which is approved by the AC. Group Audit reports functionally to the Chairperson of the AC and administratively to the CEO. Group Audit's responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the reliability, adequacy and e \u038d ectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls, risk management, governance framework and processes;\n- \u00b7 providing an objective and independent assessment of the Group's credit portfolio quality, the execution of approved credit portfolio strategies and control standards relating to credit management processes;\n- \u00b7 reviewing whether DBS complies with laws and regulations and adheres to established policies; and\n- \u00b7 reviewing whether management is taking appropriate steps to address control de \u0234 ciencies.\n\nGroup Audit adheres to the DBS Code of Conduct and is guided by the Mission Statement in the Audit Charter. It adopted the Code of Ethics and aligned its practices with the International Professional Practices Framework established by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). In addition, it has embedded IIA's 10 Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing into its activities.\n\nGroup Audit has unfettered access to the AC, the Board and management, as well as the right to seek information and explanation. Group Audit has an organisational and strategic alignment to the Group. The Head of Group Audit has a seat in the GMC and attends all the business reviews and strategic planning forums. The respective heads of audit in each of the \u0234 ve key locations outside Singapore are part of that location's management team.\n\nGroup Audit adopts a risk-based approach in its auditing activities. An annual audit plan is developed using a structured risk and control assessment framework through which the inherent risk and control e \u038d ectiveness of each auditable entity in the Group are assessed. This risk assessment methodology and\n\napproach are aligned with that of the Group, including the risk taxonomy.\n\nThe assessment also covers risks arising from new lines of business, new products and emerging risks from DBS' operating environment. Audit projects are planned based on the results of the assessment, with priority given to auditing higher risk areas and as required by regulators.\n\nAudit reports containing identi \u0234 ed issues and corrective action plans are reported to the AC and senior management. Progress of the corrective action plans is monitored, and past due action plans are included in regular reports to the senior management and the AC. In all routine audits, Group Audit evaluates the control environment and management's control awareness which incorporates risk culture as guided by the Financial Stability Board's Guidance on Sound Risk Culture.\n\nGroup Audit apprises regulators and external auditors of all relevant audit matters. It works closely with external auditors to coordinate audit e \u038d orts.\n\n## Quality assurance and key developments\n\nIn line with leading practices, Group Audit has a quality assurance and improvement programme (QAIP) that covers its audit activity and conforms to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. As part of the QAIP, internal quality assurance reviews (QAR) are conducted quarterly and external QAR are carried out at least once every \u0234 ve years by quali \u0234 ed professionals from an external organisation. From 2019 to 2021, the internal QAR was contracted to an independent assessor, Protiviti.\n\nBased on Protiviti's assessment, Group Audit leads the industry in the use of Agile Auditing approach and digital audit tools. These tools incorporate both rule-based and predictive analytics, enabling continuous risk monitoring. For 2021, in Protiviti's capability maturity model, Group Audit was rated the highest level for Reporting in addition to audit planning, agile auditing, dynamic risk assessment, and data analytics. For independence, b objectivity and transparency, Group Audit appointed Ernst & Young in 2022 as the new independent assessor for the internal QAR.\n\nIn 2022, Group Audit implemented Audit Xchange, a workbench to institutionalise and digitise its Data Driven Operating Model and Agile practices to improve its audit process. We also enhanced on our dynamic risk assessment and continuous monitoring capabilities to improve the speed of risk identi \u0234 cation and response. The increased use of analytical tools and data driven approach, coupled with DBS' suite of remote working technologies, has helped Group Audit to be more e \u038d ective in providing audit assurance.\n\n## Dealings in securities\n\nAlthough the Group has transitioned to a semi-annual reporting regime, the trading updates that are provided for the \u0234 rst and third quarters of each \u0234 nancial year are, for the purpose of the 'black-out' policies prescribed under Rule 1207(19) of the SGX Listing Rules, deemed to constitute ' \u0234 nancial statements'. Accordingly, Directors and employees are prohibited from trading in DBS' securities (i) one month before the release of the full-year \u0234 nancial statements; and (ii) two weeks before the release of its quarterly \u0234 nancial statements for the \u0234 rst, second and third quarters of each \u0234 nancial year.\n\nIn addition, business units and subsidiaries engaging in proprietary trading are restricted from trading in DBS' securities during the black-out period. Group Secretariat informs all Directors and employees of each blackout period ahead of time. Directors and employees are prohibited at all times from trading in DBS' securities if they are in possession of material non-public information.\n\nGMC members are only allowed to trade in DBS' securities within speci \u0234 c window periods (15 market days immediately following the expiry of each black-out period) subject to preclearance. GMC members are also required to obtain pre-approval from the CEO before any sale of DBS' securities. Similarly, the CEO is required to seek pre-approval from the Chairman before any sale of DBS' securities. As part of our commitment to good governance and the principles of share ownership by senior management, the CEO is expected to build up and hold at least the equivalent of three times his annual base salary as shareholding over time.",

        "page_content": "DBS has put in place a personal investment policy which prohibits employees with access to price-sensitive information in the course of their duties from trading in securities in which they possess such price-sensitive information. Such employees are also required to seek preclearance before making any personal trades in securities, and may only trade through the Group's stockbroking subsidiaries and bank channels for securities listed in Singapore and Hong Kong. The personal investment policy discourages employees from engaging in short- term speculative trading.\n\n## Related Party Transactions and Interested Person Transactions\n\nDBS has embedded procedures to comply with regulations governing related party transactions and interested party transactions.\n\nFor related party transactions, we are required to comply with regulations prescribed by the MAS which set out the de \u0234 nition, scope and general principles governing such transactions, along with the responsibilities of banks to maintain oversight and control so as to mitigate the risk of abuse arising from con \u0235 icts of interest.\n\nWe have established a Board-approved framework to give e \u038d ect to these regulatory requirements. This, along with material related party transactions, is reviewed by the Board regularly.\n\nAll new Directors are briefed on relevant provisions that a \u038d ect them. If necessary, existing credit facilities to related parties are adjusted prior to a Director's appointment, and all credit facilities to related parties are continually monitored.\n\nWith respect to interested party transactions, we have established processes to comply with the requirements outlined in Chapter 9 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual. The aggregate contract values of DBS' interested person transactions entered into in 2022 are set out in the table on page 60.\n\nDBS entered into various interested person transactions with Temasek and its associates on arm's length commercial terms and for the purpose of carrying out day-to-day operations (such as leasing of premises, telecommunication/ data services, IT systems and related services, redemption of air miles by DBS/ POSB credit card holders, logistics and security services).\n\nIn FY2022, our contracts with Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited Group amounted to an aggregated SGD 79.0 million. This accounted for less than 0.15% of DBS' audited net tangible assets.\n\n## Material contracts\n\nSave for the transactions disclosed in the table on page 60 and via SGXNET, there were no material contracts involving the interest of any Director or controlling shareholder of DBS entered into by DBS or any of its subsidiary companies, which are either still subsisting at the end of the \u0234 nancial year, or if not then subsisting, entered into since the end of the previous \u0234 nancial year.\n\n## Assessing the e \u038d ectiveness of internal controls\n\nDBS has a risk management process that requires all units to perform a half-yearly risk and control self-assessment (RCSA) to assess the e \u038d ectiveness of their internal controls. In addition, all units of the Group are required to submit quarterly attestations on their controls relating to the \u0234 nancial reporting process, and annual attestations on their compliance with the overall internal controls framework. Based on the RCSA and the quarterly and annual\n\nattestations, the CEO and the key management personnel responsible for risk management and internal control systems provide an annual attestation to the AC relating to the adequacy and e \u038d ectiveness of DBS' risk management and internal control systems.\n\nGroup Audit performs regular independent reviews to provide assurance on the adequacy and e \u038d ectiveness of DBS' internal controls on risk management, control and governance processes. The overall adequacy and e \u038d ectiveness of DBS' internal controls framework is reviewed by the AC and BRMC.\n\n## Rule 720(1) Undertaking\n\nIn compliance with Rule 720(1) of the Listing Manual, we have procured undertakings from all of our Directors and executive o \u025d cers to use their best endeavours to (a) comply with the relevant provisions of the Listing Manual; and (b) procure that DBS complies with the relevant provisions of the Listing Manual.\n\n| Name of interested person                                                                                               | Aggregate contract value of all interested  person transactions in 2022 (excluding  transactions less than SGD 100,000) (SGD million)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Transactions entered into with Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited ('Temasek')  Group (including Joint Ventures) and DBS | Transactions entered into with Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited ('Temasek')  Group (including Joint Ventures) and DBS                 |\n| Temasek Group                                                                                                           | 79.0 (1)                                                                                                                                |\n| Transactions entered into with associates of Temasek                                                                    | Transactions entered into with associates of Temasek                                                                                    |\n| Capitaland Investment Limited Group                                                                                     | 2.4                                                                                                                                     |\n| Certis CISCO Security Pte Ltd Group                                                                                     | 25.0                                                                                                                                    |\n| Mapletree Investments Pte Ltd Group                                                                                     | 0.2                                                                                                                                     |\n| SATS Ltd Group                                                                                                          | 1.4                                                                                                                                     |\n| Singapore Airlines Limited Group (SIA)                                                                                  | 194.6 (2)                                                                                                                               |\n| Singapore Technologies Telemedia Pte  Ltd Group                                                                         | 0.2                                                                                                                                     |\n| Singapore Telecommunications  Limited Group (Singtel Group)                                                             | 197.7 (3)                                                                                                                               |\n| SMRT Corporation Ltd Group                                                                                              | 8.5                                                                                                                                     |\n| Starhub Ltd Group                                                                                                       | 26.7                                                                                                                                    |\n| Surbana Jurong Private Limited Group                                                                                    | 4.2                                                                                                                                     |\n| Total                                                                                                                   | 539.9                                                                                                                                   |\n\n- 1.

In particular, but without limiting the foregoing, the Board noted that:\n\n- (i) in relation to the two-day digital disruption in November 2021 in Singapore, management has completed the remedial plans arising from an external independent review. Initiatives to strengthen DBS' technology resilience will continue in 2023; and\n- (ii) the systems integration of LVB was completed in December 2022, and post-implementation reviews are currently in progress.\n\nBased on the internal controls established and maintained by the Group, work performed by internal and external auditors, reviews performed by management and various Board committees, as well as assurances received from and mitigation and remedial actions undertaken by management, the Board, with the concurrence of the AC is of the opinion that the Group's internal controls and risk management systems were adequate and e \u038d ective as at 31 December 2022 to address \u0234 nancial, operational, compliance risks and information technology risks which the Group considers relevant and material to its operations.\n\nThe Board notes that the internal controls and risk management systems provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the Group will not be a \u038d ected by any event that could be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. In this regard, the Board also notes that no system can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error, fraud or other irregularities.\n\n## Strong culture\n\n## E \u038d ective safeguards\n\nWe believe that e \u038d ective safeguards against undesired business conduct have to go\n\nbeyond a 'tick-the-box' mentality. In DBS, other than relying on published codes of conduct, we also advocate the following organisational safeguards to maintain a strong risk and governance culture.\n\n- \u00b7 Tone from the top: The tone set by the Board and senior management is vital; it is equivalent to the moral compass of the organisation. In addition to having in place comprehensive policies, we conduct a robust self-assessment on the Group's risk culture. Please refer to the risk culture section on this page for more information.\n- \u00b7 Aligning strategies and incentives via the balanced scorecard: Please refer to the section on 'Our 2022 priorities' on pages 26 to 31 for more information.\n- \u00b7 Respecting the voice of control functions: We believe that respect for the voice of control functions is a key safeguard. We ensure that control functions are well integrated into our organisational structure so that they can properly discharge their responsibilities.\n- \u00b7 Risk ownership: Please refer to page 58 for details on our three lines of defence.\n- \u00b7 Having established escalation protocols: We designed a noti \u0234 cation protocol that makes it mandatory for sta \u038d to report signi \u0234 cant incidents. This means that the organisation is prepared to receive bad news and take necessary remedial actions without shooting the messengers.\n- \u00b7 Encouraging constructive challenges at all levels: Fundamentally, we inculcate a culture that encourages constructive challenges and debate, where all views are evaluated for decision-making. We also operate a culture where we actively engage the Board for their views early.\n- \u00b7 Reinforcing cultural alignment: Finally, we conscientiously reinforce our cultural norms by rewarding right behaviours and censuring wrong ones.\n\n## Risk Culture\n\nRisk Culture is closely intertwined with our corporate values and it encompasses the general awareness, attitudes and behaviour of our employees towards risks. The results of our Risk Culture and Conduct Survey conducted in 2022 indicated a satisfactory risk culture bank-wide.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to monitor our risk culture pulse with a risk culture and conduct dashboard, comprising multi-faceted indicators. Creating awareness remained a key focus as we continue to reinforce a strong culture of risk and control across all levels within the organisation. We leveraged digital communication channels to share culturerelated content and conducted training with case studies to aid managers in strengthening the 'Tone from the Middle' and to enhance\n\nemployee risk sensing and judgement. We continue to place emphasis on conduct as part of our compensation evaluation process.\n\n## The DBS Code of Conduct (Code of Conduct)\n\nThe Code of Conduct sets out the principles and standards of behaviour that are expected of employees of the Group (including part-time and temporary employees) when dealing with customers, business associates, regulators and colleagues. The principles covered in the Code of Conduct include professional integrity, con \u0234 dentiality, con \u0235 icts of interests, fair dealings with customers and whistle-blowing. It also de \u0234 nes the procedures for employees of DBS to report incidents and provides protection for those sta \u038d for these disclosures.\n\nAll employees of DBS are required to read and acknowledge the Code of Conduct on an annual basis. Members of the public may access the Code of Conduct on DBS' website at the following URL: https://go.dbs. com/CodeOfConduct. The Code of Conduct encourages employees of DBS to report their concerns to DBS' dedicated, independent investigation team within Group Compliance which handles whistle-blowing cases according to a well-de \u0234 ned protocol. Alternatively, in case of actual or potential con \u0235 ict of interest or fear of retribution, employees of DBS may write in con \u0234 dence to Human Resources, Group Audit, or even the CEO or the Chairman. In addition, employees of DBS have the option of using the DBS Speak Up service.\n\n## Whistle-blowing policy\n\nDBS Speak Up is a hotline service run by an independent external party that gives employees of the Group the opportunity to speak up on misconduct and/ or wrong-doing by a DBS employee, customer, vendor or third party.\n\nDBS Speak Up service includes:\n\n- \u00b7 a dedicated hotline number, website, email address, fax number and postal address for reporting of suspected incidents of misconduct and wrongdoing;\n- \u00b7 specialist call centre operators with knowledge of individual organisations;\n- \u00b7 expert forensic investigators to analyse reports;\n- \u00b7 timely reporting of incidents to dedicated representatives within an organisation; and\n- \u00b7 recommendations on corrective action.\n\n## Accountability to our shareholders\n\n## Shareholder rights\n\nDBS promotes fair and equitable treatment of all shareholders. All shareholders enjoy speci \u0234 c rights under the Singapore Companies",

Ordinary shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings in person or by proxy. Indirect investors who hold DBSH shares through a nominee company or custodian bank or through a CPF agent bank ('Relevant Intermediaries') may attend and vote at general meetings by requesting their Relevant Intermediaries to appoint them as proxies.\n\nDBS respects the equal information rights of all shareholders and is committed to the practice of fair, transparent and timely disclosure. All price-sensitive information is publicly released prior to any sessions with individual investors or analysts.\n\nThe Board provides shareholders with regular \u0234 nancial reports, which aim to give shareholders a balanced assessment of the Group's \u0234 nancial performance and position. The Board also ensures timely and full disclosure of material corporate developments to shareholders.\n\n## Engagement with shareholders\n\nOur investor relations activities promote regular, e \u038d ective and fair communication with shareholders. Separate brie \u0234 ng sessions were conducted for the media and analysts when quarterly results were released. All press statements and quarterly \u0234 nancial statements have been published on our website and the SGX website. A dedicated investor relations team supports the CEO and the CFO in maintaining a close and active dialogue with investors. The DBS website provides contact details for investors to submit their feedback and raise any questions.\n\nDuring the year, we held over 450 meetings with equity investors and over 100 meetings with debt investors. We participated in 27 investor conferences and road shows. These engagements were conducted through inperson or virtual meetings. These meetings\n\nprovide a forum for management to explain DBS' strategy and \u0234 nancial performance, and solicit analysts' and investors' perceptions of DBS.\n\nIn addition, to ensure Directors are kept updated on analysts' views on DBS Group's performance, the Board is updated annually on, i nter ali a, the following, a summary of analysts' views, feedback and recommendations, share price performance and total shareholders' return.\n\nWe have a disclosure policy to ensure that all disclosures of material information are timely, complete and accurate. The policy sets out how material information should be managed to prevent selective disclosure. Our Group Disclosure Committee (GDC) assists the CEO and the CFO in implementing the disclosure policy. The GDC's objectives are to: (a) periodically review DBS' disclosure policy and update it as needed, (b) ensure that all material disclosures are appropriate, complete and accurate, and (c) ensure selective or inadvertent disclosure of material information is avoided.\n\n## Conduct of shareholder meetings\n\nDBS encourages and values shareholder participation at its general meetings and was one of the \u0234 rst large market capitalisation companies to incorporate live voting and live question & answer functions at its fully virtual AGM in March 2022.\n\nThe Chairman plays a pivotal role in fostering constructive dialogue between shareholders, Board members and management at general meetings. Resolutions requiring shareholders' approval are tabled separately for adoption at general meetings unless they are closely related and are more appropriately tabled together.\n\nDBS puts all resolutions at general meetings to a vote by electronic poll and announces the results by showing the number of votes cast for and against each resolution and the respective percentages.

At the general meeting, handsets are provided for poll voting and the results of the electronic poll voting are announced immediately after each resolution has been put to a vote. DBS maintains an audit trail of all votes cast at the general meeting. The outcome of the general meeting (including detailed results of the poll vote for each resolution) is promptly disclosed on SGXNET within the same day after the conclusion of that meeting.\n\nAnnual General Meetings (AGMs) provide shareholders with the opportunity to share their views and to interact with the Board, including the chairpersons of the Board committees and certain members of senior management. Our external auditor is available to answer shareholders' queries. At each AGM, DBS' \u0234 nancial performance for the preceding year is presented to shareholders.\n\nThe Company Secretary prepares minutes of general meetings, which incorporate substantial and relevant comments or queries from shareholders relating to the agenda of the meeting and responses from the Board and management. These minutes may be assessed via our website.\n\n## Conduct of 2023 AGM\n\nWith the improving COVID-19 situation in Singapore, we will be holding a wholly physical AGM in 2023.\n\n## Remuneration report Remuneration report\n\nWe believe that our long-term success depends in large measure on the contributions of our employees.

As our scores improved in the current \u0234 nancial year, our variable pay pool was better than the previous year. The Compensation and Management Development committee (CMDC) evaluated and approved the variable pay pool which was subsequently endorsed by the Board of Directors (Board).\n\nIn 2022, an external compensation consultant, McLagan, was engaged to provide an independent review of the Group's compensation system and processes to ensure compliance with the FSB Principles for Sound Compensation Practices. McLagan and its consultants are independent and not related to us or any of our Directors. The results of the review showed that we are in compliance with the FSB Principles for Sound Compensation Practices.\n\n## Senior management and material risk personnel\n\nIn line with the principles set out by FSB, a substantial portion of remuneration for our Senior Management as well as Material Risk Personnel are variable. Their variable remuneration is subject to deferral, thus ensuring alignment to the time horizon of risks.\n\nThe following charts show the mix of \u0234 xed and variable pay for both groups for performance year 2022:",

Excluding the CEO's remuneration which has been separately disclosed, the median increase in total remuneration of the Senior Management who were members of the Group Management Committee for both 2021 and 2022 was 10.7%.\n\nWhile corporate governance guidelines recommend that at least the top \u0234 ve key executives' remuneration be disclosed, the Board believes that it would be disadvantageous for us to do so because of the constant battle for talent in a highly competitive industry. This is consistent with banking industry practice in the local market.

Notably, return on equity, at 15%, signi \u0234 cantly surpassed previous records.\n\nDBS' sterling \u0234 nancial performance re \u0235 ected the bene \u0234 t of higher interest rates, the strength of a broad-based franchise and multi-year transformation e \u038d orts. In particular, the bank's strengthened current and savings account base enabled it to enjoy higher leverage to rising interest rates than in previous years, contributing to strong total income. Diversi \u0234 ed engines of growth also helped to mitigate the drag from lower wealth management and investment banking fee income.\n\nIn 2022, DBS continued to make headway in growing its Asia franchise. In India, with the successful integration of Lakshmi Vilas Bank, DBS India now has an enlarged platform that encompasses 2.5 million retail and 15,000 corporate customers. Income and pro \u0234 t rose for the year. Notwithstanding China-US tensions, DBS' Greater Bay Area franchise also saw robust growth. In Taiwan, DBS is on track to complete the integration of Citi's consumer banking business by August 2023.\n\nSolid progress was also made in cementing a new way of working. A multi-year e \u038d ort in industrialising arti \u0234 cial intelligence/ machine learning continued to deliver not just value to the customer but also revenue uplift to the bank. Ecosystem partnerships enabled the bank to further scale its customer base outside Singapore without high acquisition costs. 'Managing through Journeys', which involves cross-functional squads working horizontally to ensure the bank is truly customer\u0234 rst, gained in maturity.\n\nDBS also continued to advance the sustainability agenda. The bank's net-zero roadmap is one of the most comprehensive in scope among global banks. On the social impact front, DBS Foundation's new Community Impact Chapter committed SGD 5.6 million towards 10 programmes to help foster a more equitable and inclusive society.\n\nFinally, DBS was named by Global Finance as 'World's Best Bank'. This is the seventh global best bank award DBS has won in the past \u0234 ve years. The bank was also the only Singapore-headquartered company to be recognised as one of the \"100 Best Workplaces for Innovators\" by US-based Fast Company.\n\nIn recognition of Mr Gupta's 2022 performance, his present-year remuneration is as outlined below:\n\n## Breakdown of remuneration for performance year 2022 (1 January - 31 December)\n\n|                 | Salary  remuneration  SGD   | Cash bonus (1) SGD   | Deferred  remuneration (2) SGD   | Others (3) SGD   | Total (4) SGD   |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Mr Piyush Gupta | 1,500,000                   | 5,765,000            | 8,035,000                        | 80,529           | 15,380,529      |\n\n- (1) The amount has been accrued in 2022 \u0234 nancial statements\n\n- (3) Represents non-cash component and comprises club, car and driver\n- (4) Refers to performance remuneration for 2022 - includes \u0234 xed pay in 2022, cash bonus received in 2023 and DBSH ordinary shares granted in 2023",

The chart below provides an overview of the risks arising from our business segments. The asset size of each business segment re \u0235 ects its contribution to the balance sheet, and the risk-weighted assets (RWA) o \u038d er a risk-adjusted perspective.\n\nRefer to Note 46.1 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 180 for more information about DBS' business segments\n\n| SGD million           | Consumer  Banking/ Wealth  Management   | Institutional  Banking   | Treasury Markets   | Others (a)   | Group   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------|---------|\n| Assets (b)            | 126,394                                 | 326,469                  | 204,972            | 80,193       | 738,028 |\n| Risk-weighted  assets | 42,117                                  | 224,637                  | 41,566             | 38,575       | 346,895 |\n| % of RWA              | Consumer  Banking/ Wealth  Management   | Institutional  Banking   | Treasury Markets   | Others (a)   | Group   |\n| Credit risk           | 79                                      | 95                       | 52                 | 56           | 84      |\n| Market risk           | 0                                       | 0                        | 42                 | 13           | 6       |\n| Operational risk      | 21                                      | 5                        | 6                  | 31           | 10      |\n\n- (a) Encompasses assets/ RWA from capital and balance sheet management, funding and liquidity activities, DBS Vickers Group and The Islamic Bank of Asia Limited\n- (b) Before goodwill and intangibles\n\n## Reputational risk\n\nRisk that arises if our shareholder value (including earnings and capital) is adversely a \u038d ected by any negative stakeholder perception of DBS' image. This in \u0235 uences our ability to establish new relationships or services, service existing relationships and have continued access to sources of funding. Reputational risk usually occurs when the other risks are poorly managed.\n\nRead more about this on page 98.\n\n## 3 Risk governance\n\nThe Board oversees DBS' a \u038d airs and provides sound leadership for the CEO and management. Authorised by the Board, various Board committees oversee speci \u0234 c responsibilities based on clearly de \u0234 ned terms of reference.\n\nUnder our risk management approach, the Board, through the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC), sets our Risk Appetite, oversees the establishment of enterprise-wide risk management policies and processes, and establishes risk appetite limits to guide DBS' risk-taking.\n\nThe BRMC also oversees the identi \u0234 cation, monitoring, management and reporting of credit, market, liquidity, operational and reputational risks. To facilitate the BRMC's risk oversight, the following risk management committees have been established.\n\n## Risk management committees\n\nRisk Executive Committee (Risk EXCO)\n\nAs the overall executive body regarding risk matters, the Risk EXCO oversees DBS' risk management.\n\nGroup Credit Risk Committee (GCRC)\n\nGroup Credit Risk Models Committee (GCRMC)\n\nGroup Market and Liquidity Risk Committee (GMLRC)\n\nGroup Operational Risk Committee (GORC)\n\nGroup Scenario and Stress Testing Committee (GSSTC)\n\nEach of the committees reports to the Risk EXCO, and serves as an executive forum to discuss and implement DBS' risk management.\n\nKey responsibilities:\n\n- \u2022 Assess and approve risk-taking activities\n- \u2022 Oversee DBS' risk management infrastructure, which includes frameworks, decision criteria, authorities, people, policies, standards, processes, information and systems\n- \u2022 Approve risk policies such as model governance standards, stress testing scenarios, and the evaluation and endorsement of risk models\n- \u2022 Assess and monitor speci \u0234 c credit concentration\n- \u2022 Recommend stress-testing scenarios (including macroeconomic variable projections) and review the results\n\nThe members in these committees comprise representatives from the Risk Management Group (RMG) as well as key business and support units.\n\nProduct Approval Committee (PAC)\n\nThe PAC provides group-wide oversight and direction for the approval of new product and outsourcing initiatives. It evaluates new product and outsourcing initiatives to ensure that they are in line with the DBS' strategy and risk appetite.\n\nMost of the above committees are supported by local risk committees in all major locations, where appropriate. These local risk committees oversee the local risk positions for all businesses and support units, ensuring that they keep within limits set by the Group risk committees. They also approve location-speci \u0234 c risk policies.\n\nThe Chief Risk O \u025d cer (CRO), who is a member of the Group Executive Committee and reports to the Chairman of the BRMC and the CEO, oversees the risk management function. The CRO is independent of business lines and is actively involved in key decision-making processes. He often engages with regulators to discuss risk matters, enabling a more holistic risk management perspective.\n\nWorking closely with the risk and business committees, the CRO is responsible for the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Management of DBS' risks, including systems and processes to identify, approve, measure, monitor, control and report risks\n- \u00b7 Engagement with senior management about material matters regarding all risk types\n- \u00b7 Development of risk controls and mitigation processes\n- \u00b7 Ensuring DBS' risk management is e \u038d ective, and the Risk Appetite established by the Board is adhered to\n\n## 4 Risk Appetite\n\nDBS' Risk Appetite is set by the Board and governed by the Risk Appetite Policy, which articulates the risks that we are willing to accept. It also serves to reinforce our risk culture by setting a clear message from the 'tone from the top'. A strong organisational risk culture, complemented with a balanced incentive framework (refer to 'Remuneration Report' section on page 63), helps to further embed our Risk Appetite.\n\n## 4.1 Risk thresholds and economic capital usage\n\nOur Risk Appetite takes into account a spectrum of risk types and is implemented using thresholds, policies, processes and controls.\n\nSetting thresholds is essential in making DBS' Risk Appetite an intrinsic part of our businesses as they help to keep all our risks within acceptable levels. Portfolio risk limits for the quanti \u0234 able risk types are established top down, and these are implemented using frameworks. As for the nonquanti \u0234 able risk types, these are managed using qualitative principles.",

        "page_content": "To ensure that the thresholds pertaining to our Risk Appetite are completely risk sensitive, we adopted both economic capital (EC) and regulatory capital (RC) as our risk metrics. Additionally, both EC and RC are assessed as part of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\n\nOur capital allocation structure monitors credit, market and operational risks by assessing regulatory capital utilisation at the business unit level. The diagram below shows how they are managed along the various dimensions. A bu \u038d er is also maintained for other risks, such as country, reputational, model risks, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther quantitative or qualitative controls are used to manage the other risks at granular levels. The following chart provides a broad overview of how our Risk Appetite permeates throughout DBS. Refer to Sections 5 through 9 for more information about each risk type.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2 Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an integral part of our risk management process. It includes both sensitivity and scenario analyses, and is conducted regularly. In particular, the ICAAP (a group-wide exercise spanning di \u038d erent risk types) is performed annually. In addition, stress tests are carried out in response to microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions, or portfolio developments. Every stress test is documented and the results are reviewed by senior management and/or the BRMC.\n\nStress testing alerts senior management to our potential vulnerability to exceptional but\n\nplausible adverse events. As such, stress testing enables us to assess capital adequacy and identify potentially risky portfolio segments as well as inherent systematic risks. This then allows us to develop the right contingency plans, exit strategies and mitigating actions beforehand.\n\nThe ICAAP ensures our business plans are consistent with our Risk Appetite. This is done by comparing the projected demand for capital to the projected supply of capital under various scenarios, including severe macroeconomic stress.\n\n5\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe most signi \u0234 cant measurable risk DBS faces - credit risk - arises from our daily activities in our various businesses. These activities include lending to retail, corporate and institutional customers. It includes the risk of lending, pre-settlement and settlement risk of foreign exchange, derivatives and securities.\n\nRefer to Note 43.1 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 172 for details on DBS' maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\n## 5.1 Credit risk management at DBS\n\nDBS' approach to credit risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Policies\n\nThe dimensions of credit risk and the scope of its application are de \u0234 ned in the Group Credit Risk Management Policy. Senior management sets the overall direction and policy for managing credit risk at the enterprise level.\n\nThe Group Core Credit Risk Policies (CCRPs) established for Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management and Institutional Banking set forth the principles by which DBS conducts its credit risk management and control activities. These policies, supplemented by a number of operational standards and guides, ensure consistency in identifying, assessing, underwriting, measuring, reporting and controlling credit risk across DBS, and provide guidance in the formulation of businessspeci \u0234 c and/ or location-speci \u0234 c credit risk policies and standards.\n\nThe operational standards and guides are established to provide greater details on the implementation of the credit principles within the Group CCRPs and are adapted to re \u0235 ect di \u038d erent credit environments and portfolio risk pro \u0234 les. The CCRPs are approved by the Group Chief Credit O \u025d cer.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nCredit risk is managed by thoroughly understanding our wholesale customers - the businesses they are in, as well as the economies in which they operate. It is also managed through statistical models and data analytics for retail customers.\n\nThe assignment of credit risk ratings and setting of lending limits are integral parts of DBS' credit risk management process, and we use an array of rating models for our wholesale and retail portfolios. Most of these models are built internally using DBS' loss data, and the limits are driven by DBS' Risk Appetite Statement and the Target Market and Risk Acceptance Criteria (TM-RAC).\n\nWholesale borrowers are assessed individually, and further reviewed and evaluated by experienced credit risk managers who consider relevant credit risk factors in the \u0234 nal determination of\n\nthe borrower's risk. For some portfolios within the SME segment, DBS also uses a programme-based approach to achieve a balanced management of risks and rewards. Retail exposures are assessed using credit score models, credit bureau records as well as internally and externally available customer behaviour records supplemented by our Risk Acceptance Criteria (RAC). Credit applications are proposed by the business units, and applications outside the RAC are independently assessed by the credit risk managers.\n\n## Refer to Section 5.3 on page 88 to read more about our internal credit risk models.\n\nPre-settlement credit risk for traded products arising from a counterparty potentially defaulting on its obligations is quanti \u0234 ed by evaluation of the mark-to-market value, plus potential future exposure. This is included within DBS' overall credit limits to counterparties for internal risk management.\n\nWe actively monitor and manage our exposure to counterparties for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative trades to protect our balance sheet in the event of a counterparty default. Counterparty risk exposures that may be adversely a \u038d ected by market risk events are identi \u0234 ed, reviewed and acted upon by management, and highlighted to the appropriate risk committees. Speci \u0234 c wrongway risk arises when the credit exposure of a counterparty (from the traded product transaction) directly correlates with the probability of default of the counterparty. DBS has processes in place to guide the handling of speci \u0234 c wrong-way risk transactions, and its risk measurement metric takes into account the higher risks associated with such transactions.\n\nIssuer default risk that may also arise from derivatives, notes and securities are generally measured based on jump-to-default computations.\n\n## Concentration risk management\n\nFor credit risk concentration, we use EC as our measurement tool as it combines the individual risk factors such as the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD), in addition to industry correlation and portfolio concentration. EC thresholds are set to ensure that the allocated EC stays within our Risk Appetite. Concentration risk for retail is managed at two levels - product level where exposure limits are set up, and segment level to manage the growth of high-risk segments. Governance processes are in place to ensure that these thresholds are monitored regularly, and appropriate actions are taken when the thresholds are breached.\n\nDBS continually examines and reviews how we can enhance the scope of our thresholds and approaches to manage concentration risk.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance risks\n\nResponsible \u0234 nancing, covering environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, is a topic of increasing importance that a \u038d ects investing and \u0234 nancing decisions across the bank. DBS recognises that our \u0234 nancing practices have a substantial impact on society and failure of our customers to appropriately manage ESG issues can directly impact their operations and long-term economic viability, as well as the communities and environment in which they operate.\n\nDBS considers ESG risks as critical in our pursuit of business strategies. The Board approves DBS' overall and speci \u0234 c risk governance frameworks and oversees an independent Group-wide risk management system. In 2022, the Board approved the incorporation of environmental risk considerations into our Risk Appetite Statement. Our Group Responsible Financing Standard documents our overarching approach to responsible \u0234 nancing and additional assessment required when entering into transactions with elevated ESG risks. The requirements of this Standard represent the minimum standards for DBS and we have also sought alignment, where possible, with international standards and best practices. Where signi \u0234 cant ESG issues are identi \u0234 ed, escalation is required to the relevant Global Industry Specialist and IBG Sustainability for further guidance prior to approval by the Credit Approving Authority.\n\nRefer more about \"Responsible \u0234 nancing\" in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Country risk\n\nCountry risk refers to the risk of loss due to events in a speci \u0234 c country (or a group of countries). This includes political, exchange rate, economic, sovereign and transfer risks.\n\nDBS manages country risk through the requirements of the Group CCRP and the said risk is part of our concentration risk management. The way we manage transfer risk at DBS is set out in our Country Risk Management Standard. This includes an internal transfer risk and sovereign risk rating system, where assessments are made independently of business decisions. Our transfer risk limits are set in accordance with the Group Risk Appetite Policy.",

        "page_content": "Transfer risk limits for priority countries are set based on country-speci \u0234 c strategic business considerations as well as the acceptable potential loss according to our Risk Appetite. Management actively evaluates and determines the appropriate level of transfer risk exposures for these countries taking into account the risks and rewards and whether they are in line with our strategic intent. Limits for all other non-priority countries are set using a model-based approach.\n\n## Pillar 1 credit stress testing\n\n## Pillar 2 credit stress testing\n\n## Industry-wide stress testing\n\nSensitivity and scenario analyses\n\nRisk appetite for each country is approved by the BRMC, while transfer risk limits are approved by the Board EXCO and senior management.\n\n## Credit stress testing\n\nDBS engages in various types of credit stress testing, and these are driven either by regulators or internal requirements and management. Our credit stress tests are performed at the total portfolio or sub-portfolio level, and are generally\n\nconducted to assess the impact of changing economic conditions on asset quality, earnings performance, capital adequacy and liquidity. DBS' stress testing programme is comprehensive and covers a range of risks and business areas.\n\nDBS typically performs the following types of credit stress testing at a minimum and others as necessary:\n\nDBS conducts Pillar 1 credit stress testing regularly as required by regulators. Under Pillar 1 credit stress testing, DBS assesses the impact of a mild stress scenario (at least two consecutive quarters of zero growth) on Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) estimates (i.e. PD, LGD and EAD) and the impact on regulatory capital. The purpose of the Pillar 1 credit stress test is to assess the robustness of internal credit risk models and the cushion above minimum regulatory capital.\n\nDBS conducts Pillar 2 credit stress testing once a year as part of the ICAAP. Under Pillar 2 credit stress testing, DBS assesses the impact of stress scenarios, with di \u038d erent levels of severity, on asset quality, earnings performance as well as internal and regulatory capital. The results of the credit stress test form inputs to the capital planning process under ICAAP. The purpose of the Pillar 2 credit stress testing is to examine, in a rigorous and forward-looking manner, the possible events or changes in market conditions that could adversely impact DBS and to develop the appropriate action plan.\n\nDBS participates in the annual industry-wide stress test (IWST) conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to facilitate the ongoing assessment of Singapore's \u0234 nancial stability. Under the IWST, DBS is required to assess the impact of adverse scenarios, as de \u0234 ned by the regulator, on asset quality, earnings performance and capital adequacy, where applicable.\n\nDBS also conducts multiple independent sensitivity analyses and credit portfolio reviews based on various scenarios. The intent of these analyses and reviews is to identify vulnerabilities for the purpose of developing and executing mitigating actions.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nDBS constantly invests in systems to support risk monitoring and reporting for our Institutional Banking and Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management businesses.\n\nThe end-to-end credit process is continually being reviewed and improved through various front-to-back initiatives involving business, operations, risk management and other key stakeholders. Day-to-day monitoring of credit exposures, portfolio performance and external environmental factors potentially a \u038d ecting credit risk pro \u0234 les is key to our philosophy of e \u038d ective credit risk management.\n\nIn addition, credit trends, which may include industry analysis, early warning alerts and signi \u0234 cant weak credits, are submitted to\n\nthe various risk committees, allowing key strategies and action plans to be formulated and evaluated. Credit control functions also ensure that any credit risk taken complies with the credit risk policies and standards. These functions ensure that approved limits are activated, credit excesses and policy exceptions are appropriately endorsed, compliance with credit standards is carried out, and covenants established are monitored.\n\nIndependent risk management functions that report to the CRO are jointly responsible for developing and maintaining a robust credit stress testing programme. These units oversee the implementation of credit stress tests as well as the analysis of the results, of which\n\nmanagement, various risk committees and regulators are informed.\n\n## Non-performing assets\n\nDBS' credit facilities are classi \u0234 ed as 'Performing assets' or 'Non-performing assets' (NPA), in accordance with the MAS Notice to Banks No. 612 'Credit Files, Grading and Provisioning' (MAS Notice 612).\n\nCredit exposures are categorised into one of the following \u0234 ve categories, according to our assessment of a borrower's ability to repay a credit facility from its normal sources of income and/ or the repayment behaviour of the borrower.\n\n| Classi \u0234  cation grade   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performing assets        | Performing assets                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Pass                     | Indicates that the timely repayment of the outstanding credit facilities is not in doubt.                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Special mention          | Indicates that the borrower exhibits potential weaknesses that, if not corrected in a timely manner, may  adversely a \u038d  ect future repayments and warrant close attention by DBS.                                                            |\n| Classi \u0234   ed or NPA     | Classi \u0234   ed or NPA                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Substandard              | Indicates that the borrower exhibits de \u0234  nable weaknesses in its business, cash  \u0235  ow or  \u0234  nancial position that  may jeopardise repayment on existing terms.                                                                            |\n| Doubtful                 | Indicates that the borrower exhibits severe weaknesses such that the prospect of full recovery of the  outstanding credit facilities is questionable and the prospect of a loss is high, but the exact amount remains  undeterminable as yet. |\n| Loss                     | Indicates that the outstanding credit facility is not collectable, and little or nothing can be done to recover the  outstanding amount from any collateral or from the assets of the borrower generally.                                     |\n\nA default is considered to have occurred with regard to a particular borrower when either or both of the following events have taken place:\n\n- \u00b7 Subjective default: Borrower is considered to be unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without DBS taking action such as realising security (if held)\n- \u00b7 Technical default: Borrower is more than 90 days past due on any credit obligation to DBS\n\nFor retail borrowers, the categorisation into the respective MAS loan grades is at the facility level and consistent with MAS Notice 612.\n\nCredit facilities are classi \u0234 ed as restructured assets when we grant non-commercial concessions to a borrower because its \u0234 nancial position has deteriorated or is unable to meet the original repayment schedule. A restructured credit facility is classi \u0234 ed into the appropriate non- performing grade based on the assessment of the borrower's \u0234 nancial condition and its ability to repay according to the restructured terms.\n\nSuch credit facilities are not returned to the performing status until there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the borrower will be able to service all future principal and interest payments on the credit facility in accordance with the restructured terms and MAS Notice 612. Apart from what has been described, we do not grant concessions to borrowers in the normal course of business.\n\nIn addition, it is not within DBS' business model to acquire debts that have been restructured at inception (e.g. distressed debts).\n\nRefer to Note 2.11 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 131 for our accounting policies regarding speci \u0234 c and general allowances for credit losses.\n\nIn general, speci \u0234 c allowances are recognised for defaulting credit exposures rated substandard and below.\n\nThe breakdown of our NPA by loan grading and industry and the related amounts of speci \u0234 c allowances can be found in Note 43.2 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 173. A breakdown of past due loans can also be found in the same note.\n\nWhen required, we will take possession of all collateral and dispose them as soon as practicable. Realised proceeds are used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.\n\nA breakdown of collateral held for NPA is shown in Note 43.2 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 175.\n\nRepossessed collateral is classi \u0234 ed in the balance sheet as other assets. The amounts of such other assets for 2021 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## 5.2 Credit risk mitigants\n\n## Collateral received\n\nWhere possible, DBS takes collateral as a secondary source of repayment. This includes, but is not limited to, cash, marketable securities, real estate, trade receivables, inventory, equipment, and other physical and/ or \u0234 nancial collateral. We may also take \u0234 xed and \u0235 oating charges on the assets of borrowers.\n\nPolicies are in place to determine the eligibility of collateral for credit risk mitigation. Collateral is generally diversi \u0234 ed and periodic valuations of collateral are required. Real estate constitutes the bulk of our collateral, with a signi \u0234 cantly lower proportion in marketable securities and cash.\n\nFor derivatives, repurchase agreements (repo) and other repo-style transactions with \u0234 nancial market counterparties, collateral arrangements are typically covered under market-standard documentation, such as International Swaps & Derivatives Association\n\n(ISDA) Agreements and Master Repurchase Agreements.\n\nThe collateral received is marked-tomarket on a frequency that DBS and the counterparties have mutually agreed upon. This is governed by internal guidelines with respect to collateral eligibility. In the event of a default, the credit risk exposure is reduced by master-netting arrangements where DBS is allowed to o \u038d set what we owe a counterparty against what is due from that counterparty in a netting-eligible jurisdiction.\n\nRefer to Note 15 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 143 for further information on \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities subject to netting agreement but not o \u038d set on the balance sheet.\n\nCollateral held against derivatives generally consists of cash in major currencies and highly rated government or quasi- government bonds. Exceptions may arise in certain countries, where due to domestic capital markets and business conditions, the bank may be required to accept less highly rated or liquid government bonds and currencies. Reverse repo-transactions are generally traded with large institutions with reasonably good credit standing. DBS takes haircuts against the underlying collateral of these transactions that commensurate with collateral quality to ensure credit risks are adequately mitigated.\n\nIn times of di \u025d culty, we will review the customers' speci \u0234 c situation and circumstances to assist them in restructuring their \u0234 nancial obligations.\n\nHowever, should the need arise, disposal and recovery processes are in place to dispose the collateral held. DBS maintains a panel of agents and solicitors to assist in the disposal of non-liquid assets and specialised equipment quickly.",

        "page_content": "## Collateral posted\n\nDBS is required to post additional collateral in the event of a rating downgrade. As at 31 December 2022, for a three-notch downgrade of its Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Services ratings, DBS will have to post additional collateral amounting to SGD 11 million (2021: SGD 2 million).\n\n## Other credit risk mitigants\n\nDBS accepts guarantees as credit risk mitigants. Internal requirements for considering the eligibility of guarantors for credit risk mitigation are in place.\n\n## 5.3 Internal credit risk models\n\nDBS adopts rating systems for the di \u038d erent asset classes under the Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRBA).\n\nThere is a robust governance process for the development, independent validation and approval of any credit risk model. The models go through a rigorous review process before they are endorsed by the GCRMC and Risk EXCO. They must also be approved by the BRMC before submission for regulatory approval. The key risk measures generated by the internal credit risk rating models to quantify regulatory capital include PD, LGD and EAD. For portfolios under the Foundation IRBA, internal estimates of PD are used while the supervisory LGD and EAD estimates are applied. For portfolios under the Advanced IRBA, internal estimates of PD, LGD and EAD are used. In addition, the ratings from the credit models act as the basis for underwriting credit risk, monitoring portfolio performance and determining business strategies. The performance of the rating systems is monitored regularly and reported to the GCRMC, Risk EXCO and BRMC to ensure their ongoing e \u038d ectiveness.\n\nAn independent risk unit conducts formal validations for the respective rating systems annually. The validation processes are also independently reviewed by Group Audit. These serve to highlight material deterioration in the rating systems for management attention.\n\n## 5.3.1 Retail exposure models\n\nRetail exposures are categorised into the following asset classes under the Advanced IRBA: residential mortgages, qualifying revolving retail exposures, and other retail exposures.\n\nWithin each asset class, exposures are managed on a portfolio basis. Each customer or account is assigned to a risk pool, considering factors such as borrower characteristics and collateral type. PD, EAD and\n\nLGD estimates are based on internal historical default, utilisation and realised losses within a de \u0234 ned period.\n\nProduct-speci \u0234 c credit risk elements such as underwriting criteria, scoring models, approving authorities, asset quality, and business strategy reviews, as well as systems, processes and techniques to monitor portfolio performance, are in place. Credit risk models for secured and unsecured portfolios are also used to update the risk level of each loan on a monthly basis, re \u0235 ecting the broad usage of risk models in portfolio quality reviews.\n\n## 5.3.2 Wholesale exposure models\n\nWholesale exposures are largely under the Foundation IRBA for capital computation. They include sovereign, bank and corporate. Specialised lending exposures are under IRBA using supervisory slotting criteria.\n\nSovereign exposures are risk-rated using internal risk-rating models. Factors related to country-speci \u0234 c macroeconomic risk, political risk, social risk and liquidity risk are included in the sovereign rating models to assess the sovereign credit risk in an objective and systematic manner.\n\nBank exposures are assessed using the bank-rating model. The model considers both quantitative and qualitative factors such as capital levels and liquidity, asset quality and management strength.\n\nLarge corporate exposures are assessed using internal rating model. Factors considered in the risk assessment process include the counterparty's \u0234 nancial strength and qualitative factors such as industry risk, access to funding, market standing and management strength.\n\nSME credit rating models consider risk factors such as those relating to the counterparty's \u0234 nancial strength, qualitative factors, as well as account performance.\n\nCredit risk ratings under the IRBA portfolios are, at a minimum, reviewed by designated approvers on an annual basis unless credit conditions require more frequent assessment.\n\n## 5.3.3 Specialised lending exposures\n\nSpecialised lending IRBA portfolios include income-producing real estate, project \u0234 nance, object \u0234 nance, and commodities \u0234 nance. These adopt the supervisory slotting criteria speci \u0234 ed under Annex 7v of MAS Notice 637, which are used to determine the risk weights to calculate credit risk-weighted exposures.\n\n## 5.3.4 Securitisation  exposures\n\nWe arrange securitisation transactions for our clients for fees. These transactions do not involve special-purpose entities that we control. For transactions that are not underwritten, no securitisation exposures are assumed as a direct consequence of arranging the transactions. Any decision to invest in any of such arranged transactions is subject to independent risk assessment.\n\nWhere DBS provides an underwriting commitment, any securitisation exposure that arises will be held in the trading book to be traded or sold down in accordance with our internal policy and risk limits. In addition, DBS does not provide implicit support for any transactions we structure or have invested in.\n\nWe invest in our clients' securitisation transactions from time to time. These may include securitisation transactions arranged by us or with other parties.\n\nWe may also act as a liquidity facility provider, working capital facility provider or swap counterparty. Such securitisation exposures require the approval of the independent risk function and are subject to regular risk reviews. We also have processes in place to monitor the credit risk of our securitisation exposures.\n\n## 5.3.5 Credit exposures falling outside internal credit risk models\n\nDBS applies the Standardised Approach (SA) for portfolios that are expected to transit to IRBA or for portfolios that are immaterial in terms of size and risk pro \u0234 le. These portfolios include:\n\n- \u00b7 IRBA-transitioning retail and wholesale exposures\n- \u00b7 IRBA-exempt retail exposures\n- \u00b7 IRBA-exempt wholesale exposures\n\nAny identi \u0234 ed transitioning retail and/ or wholesale exposures are expected to adopt Advanced or Foundation IRBA, subject to approval by regulators. Prior to regulatory approval, these portfolios are under SA.\n\nThe portfolios under the SA are subject to our overall governance framework and credit risk management practices. DBS continues to monitor the size and risk pro \u0234 le of these portfolios and will enhance the relevant risk measurement processes if these risk exposures become material.\n\nDBS uses external ratings for credit exposures under the SA where relevant, and we only accept ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch in such cases. DBS follows the process prescribed in MAS Notice 637 to map the ratings to the relevant risk weights.\n\n## 5.4. Credit risk in 2022\n\n## Concentration risk\n\nDBS' concentration risk remained well managed across geographies and industry/ business segments.\n\nOur geographic distribution of customer loans remained stable. Growth was seen mainly in Singapore, Hong Kong and Rest of the World.\n\n## Geographical Concentration (SGD billion)\n\n## Industry Concentration (SGD billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Rest of Greater China\n\nAbove refers to gross loans and advances to customers based on country of incorporation\n\nAbove refers to gross loans and advances to customers based on MAS Industry Code\n\nRefer to Note 43.4 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 176 for DBS' breakdown of credit risk concentration.\n\n## Collateral received\n\nThe tables below provide breakdowns by loan-to-value (LTV) bands for the borrowings secured by real estate and other collateral from the various market segments.\n\n## Residential mortgage loans\n\nThe LTV ratio is calculated using mortgage loans including undrawn commitments divided by the collateral value. Property\n\nvaluations are determined using a combination of professional appraisals and housing price indices.\n\nFor Singapore mortgage loans, the increases in property price index for HDB and private residential properties drove a shift of 14.8% from the LTV > 50% band to up to 50% LTV band.\n\nFor Hong Kong mortgage loans, there was an approximate 25.1% increase in the proportion\n\nof mortgage exposure in the 51% to 80% LTV band, as property price index decreased by 15.2% and 12.7% for Urban and New Territory region respectively in 2022.\n\nFor Rest of Greater China, the shift in the proportion of mortgage exposure to the up to 50% LTV band was mainly driven by the increase in property price index for Taiwan mortgage by 15.6% in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022\n\n- Others\n- Professionals and private individuals (excluding housing loans)\n- Financial institutions, investments and holding companies\n\n## 2021\n\n- Transportation, storage & communications\n- General commerce\n- Housing loans\n- Building and construction\n- Manufacturing\n\nSingapore, our home market, continued to account for the largest share of our gross loans and advances to customers which contributed to 47% of our total portfolio.\n\nOur portfolio was well diversi \u0234 ed across industry and business segments. Building and Construction, General Commerce and Manufacturing remained the largest contributors in the wholesale portfolio, accounting for 48% of the total portfolio.\n\n## Non-performing assets\n\nNew non-performing asset (NPA) formation was o \u038d set by recoveries and write-o \u038d s. In absolute terms, our total NPA decreased by 12% from the previous year to SGD 5.13 billion and non-performing loans (NPL) ratio dropped to 1.1% in 2022.\n\nRefer to 'CFO Statement' on page 20.",

More than 90% of such loans were fully collateralised and majority of these loans had LTV < 80%. Our property loans were mainly concentrated in Singapore and Hong Kong, which together accounted for about 80% of the total property loans.\n\nThe LTV ratio is calculated as loans and advances divided by the value of collaterals that secure the same facility.

This policy is supplemented with standards and guides, which facilitate the identification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting of market risk in a consistent manner. They also set out the overall approach, requirements and controls governing market risk stress testing across DBS.\n\nThe criteria for determining the positions to be included in the trading book are stipulated in the Trading Book Policy Statement.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nDBS utilises Value-at-Risk (VaR), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from market movements. This measure uses historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. It assumes that historical changes in market values re \u0235 ect the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future.\n\nDBS limits and monitors market risk exposures using Expected Shortfall (ES) that is VaR calculated with a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 97.5% con \u0234 dence interval.\n\nES is supplemented with other risk control metrics such as sensitivities to risk factors and loss triggers for management action.\n\nDBS conducts backtesting to verify the predictiveness of the VaR model. Backtesting compares VaR calculated for positions at the close of each business day with the pro \u0234 t and loss (P&L) that arises from those positions on the following business day. The backtesting P&L excludes fees and commissions, revenues from intra-day trading, non-daily valuation adjustments and time e \u038d ects.\n\nFor backtesting, VaR at the 99% con \u0234 dence interval and over a one-day holding period is used. We adopt the standardised approach to compute market risk regulatory capital under MAS Notice 637 and MAS Notice FHC-N637 for the trading book positions. As such, VaR backtesting does not impact our regulatory capital for market risk.\n\nThere are limitations to VaR models; for example, past changes in market risk factors may not provide accurate predictions of future market movements, and the risk arising from adverse market events may not be considered.\n\nTo monitor DBS' vulnerability to unexpected but plausible extreme market risk-related events, we conduct multiple market risk stress tests regularly. These cover trading and nontrading portfolios and follow a combination of historical and hypothetical scenarios depicting risk-factor movement.\n\nEconomic Value of Equity (EVE) and Net Interest Income (NII) variability are the speci \u0234 c key risk metrics used to assess our interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB). EVE and NII variability measure how the economic value and earnings of the bank change under both regulatory and/ or internal scenarios. Credit risk arising from loans and receivables is managed under the credit risk management framework.\n\nIRRBB arises from mismatches in the interest rate pro \u0234 les of assets, liabilities and capital instruments. Estimating IRRBB requires the use of behavioural models and assumptions on certain parameters such as loan prepayment, \u0234 xed deposits early redemption and the duration of non-maturity deposits. DBS measures IRRBB on a monthly basis.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nRobust internal control processes and systems have been designed and implemented to support our market risk management approach. DBS reviews these control processes and systems regularly, and these reviews allow senior management to assess their e \u038d ectiveness.\n\nThe RMG Market and Liquidity Risk unit an independent market risk management function reporting to the CRO - monitors, controls and analyses DBS' market risk daily. The unit comprises risk control, risk analytics, production and reporting teams.",

The Net Interest Income (NII) of the non-trading book was assessed under various rate scenarios to determine the impact of interest rate movements on future earnings. With simulations using a 100 basis points parallel upward or downward shift in yield curves on DBS' banking book exposures, NII was estimated to increase by SGD 958 million and decrease by SGD 1,331 million respectively.\n\nForeign exchange risk in our non-trading portfolios was primarily from structural foreign exchange positions (a) , arising mainly from our strategic investments and retained earnings in overseas branches and subsidiaries.\n\n(a)  Refer to Note 39.3 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 166 for details on DBS' structural foreign exchange positions.\n\n7\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nDBS' liquidity risk arises from our obligations to honour withdrawals of deposits, repayments of borrowed funds at maturity and our commitments to extend loans to our customers.

It assesses the adequacy of our counterbalancing capacity to fund or mitigate any cash \u0235 ow shortfalls that may occur as forecasted in the cash \u0235 ow movements across successive time bands. To ensure that liquidity is managed in line with our Risk Appetite, core parameters such as the types of scenarios, the survival period and the minimum level of liquid assets, are pre-speci \u0234 ed for monitoring and control on a group-wide basis. Any occurrences of forecasted shortfalls that cannot be covered by our counterbalancing capacity will be escalated to the relevant committees for evaluation and action.\n\n## Funding sources (SGD billion)\n\n## Wholesale Funding Breakdown (SGD billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDBS aims to maintain continuous access to the investor base for capital and senior wholesale funding to support our commercial banking activities. We seek cost e \u025d ciencies over the long term and to broaden our investor base through proactive and frequent engagement. Capital instruments are primarily issued from DBS Group Holdings Ltd (DBSH) while covered bonds originate from DBS Bank Ltd. Senior notes are issued from both DBSH and the Bank as required.\n\nLiquidity risk stress testing is performed regularly using cash \u0235 ow maturity mismatch analysis, and covers adverse scenarios including general market and idiosyncratic stress scenarios. Stress tests assess our vulnerability when liability run-o \u038d s increase, asset rollovers increase and/ or liquid asset bu \u038d ers decrease. In addition, ad hoc stress tests are performed as part of our recovery planning and ICAAP exercises.\n\nLiquidity risk control measures such as liquidity-related ratios and balance sheet analysis are complementary tools for cash \u0235 ow maturity mismatch analysis, and they are performed regularly to obtain deeper insights and \u0234 ner control over our liquidity pro \u0234 le across di \u038d erent locations.\n\nThe liquidity risk control measures also include concentration measures regarding top depositors, wholesale borrowing and swapped funds ratios.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nRobust internal control processes and systems support our overall approach in identifying, measuring, aggregating, controlling and monitoring liquidity risk across DBS. Continuous improvement in data and reporting platforms has allowed most elements of internal liquidity risk reporting to be centralised.\n\nThe RMG Market and Liquidity Risk unit manages the day-to-day liquidity risk monitoring, control reporting and analysis.\n\n## Liquidity management and funding strategy\n\nDBS strives to develop a diversified funding base with access to funding sources across retail and wholesale channels. Our funding strategy is anchored on the strength of our core deposit franchise and is augmented by our established long-term funding capabilities.\n\nThe diagrams below show our funding structure as at 31 December 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to Note 31 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 153 for more details of our wholesale funding sources and Note 44.1 on page 178 for the contractual maturity pro \u0234 le of our assets and liabilities.\n\nGrowth in the regional franchise generates price, volume, currency and tenor mismatches between our assets and liabilities. To this end, where practicable and transferable without loss in value, we make appropriate use of swap markets for relevant currencies, commensurate with the liquidity of each, in the conversion and deployment of surplus funds across locations.\n\nAs these swaps typically mature earlier than loans, we are exposed to potential cash \u0235 ow mismatches arising from the risk that counterparties may not roll over maturing swaps to support our ongoing funding needs.\n\nThis risk is mitigated by triggers set on the number of swaps transacted with the market and by conservative assumptions on the cash \u0235 ow behaviour of swaps under our cash \u0235 ow maturity gap analysis (refer to Section 7.2 on page 95).\n\nIn general, the term borrowing needs are managed centrally by the head o \u025d ce in consultation with our overseas locations, subject to relevant regulatory restrictions and to an appropriate level of presence and participation required by the respective local funding markets.\n\nThe Group Asset and Liability Committee and respective Location Asset and Liability Committees regularly review the composition and growth trajectories of the relevant balance sheets and re \u0234 ne our funding strategy according to business momentum, competitive factors and prevailing market conditions.\n\n## 7.2 Liquidity risk in 2022\n\nDBS actively monitors and manages our liquidity pro \u0234 le through cash \u0235 ow maturity mismatch analysis.\n\nIn forecasting cash \u0235 ow under the analysis, behavioural pro \u0234 ling is necessary in cases\n\nwhere a product has indeterminate maturity or the contractual maturity does not realistically re \u0235 ect the expected cash \u0235 ow.\n\nTwo examples are maturity-indeterminate savings and current account deposits, which are generally viewed as sources of stable funding for commercial banks. A conservative view is adopted in the behavioural pro \u0234 ling of assets, liabilities and o \u038d -balance sheet commitments that have exhibited cash \u0235 ow patterns that di \u038d er signi \u0234 cantly from the contractual maturity pro \u0234 le shown under Note 44.1 of our \u0234 nancial statements on page 178.\n\nThe table below shows our behavioural net and cumulative maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities over a one-year period, in a normal scenario without incorporating growth projections. DBS' liquidity was observed to remain adequate in the maturity mismatch analysis.\n\n| SGD million (a)                               | Less than        1 week   | 1 week to  1 month   | 1 to 3 months   | 3 to 6 months   | 6 months to  1 year   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| As at 31 Dec 2022 (b)  Net liquidity mismatch | 27,278                    | 1,126                | (15,986)        | 23,451          | 10,019                |\n| Cumulative mismatch                           | 27,278                    | 28,404               | 12,418          | 35,869          | 45,888                |\n| As at 31 Dec 2021 (b)  Net liquidity mismatch | 37,477                    | 20,619               | (6,556)         | 13,624          | 7,136                 |\n| Cumulative mismatch                           | 37,477                    | 58,096               | 51,540          | 65,164          | 72,300                |\n\n- (a) Positive indicates a position of liquidity surplus.

        "page_content": "## 7.3 Liquid assets\n\nLiquid assets are assets that are readily available and can be easily monetised to meet obligations and expenses under times of stress.\n\nSuch assets are internally de \u0234 ned under the governance of the relevant oversight committees, taking into account the asset class, issuer type and credit rating, among other criteria, before they are re \u0235 ected as available funds through cash \u0235 ow maturity mismatch analysis. DBS' Treasury function expects to be able to operationally monetise our pool of liquid assets to meet liquidity shortfalls when the need arises. These liquid assets must be unencumbered and free of any legal, regulatory, contractual or other restrictions.\n\nIn practice, liquid assets are maintained in key locations and currencies to ensure that operating entities in such locations possess a degree of selfsu \u025d ciency to support business needs and guard against contingencies. The main portion of our liquid assets is centrally maintained in Singapore to support liquidity needs in smaller overseas subsidiaries and branches. Internally, DBS sets a requirement to maintain its pool of liquid assets above a minimum level as a source of contingent funds, taking into account regulatory recommended liquid asset levels as well as internally projected stress shortfalls under the cash \u0235 ow maturity mismatch analysis.\n\nThe table below shows DBS' encumbered and unencumbered liquid assets by instrument and counterparty against other assets in the same category under the balance sheet.

Group LCR has been maintained well above the minimum LCR requirements of 100% for both all-currency and SGD.\n\nDBS' LCR is sensitive to balance sheet movements resulting from commercial loan/ deposit activities, wholesale inter-bank lending/ borrowing, and to the maturity tenor changes of these positions as they fall into or out of the LCR 30-day tenor. In order to meet the LCR requirements, DBS holds a pool of unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) comprising predominantly cash, balances with central banks and highly rated bonds issued by governments or supranational entities.\n\n7.5\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\n\nDBS is subject to the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) under MAS Notice to Banks No. 652 'Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)' (MAS Notice 652). Group NSFR has been maintained consistently above the minimum regulatory requirement of 100%.\n\nNSFR aims to improve the resiliency of banks by promoting long term funding stability. We manage our NSFR by maintaining a stable balance sheet supported by a diversi \u0234 ed funding base with access to funding sources across retail and wholesale channels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 8 Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is inherent in our business activities and may arise from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. DBS' objective is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels, taking into account the markets we operate\n\nin, the characteristics of the businesses as well as our economic and regulatory environment.\n\n## 8.1 Operational risk management at DBS\n\nDBS' approach to operational risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n## Policies\n\nRisk methodologies\n\nProcesses, systems and reports\n\n## Policies\n\nThe Group Operational Risk Management (ORM) Policy sets our overall approach for managing operational risk in a structured, systematic and consistent manner.\n\nThere are policies, standards, tools and programmes in place to govern ORM practices across DBS. These include corporate operational risk policies and standards that are owned by the respective corporate oversight and control functions. The key policies address risk areas relating to technology, compliance, fraud, money laundering, \u0234 nancing of terrorism and sanctions, new product, outsourcing and ecosystem partnership.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nDBS adopts the standardised approach to compute operational risk regulatory capital.\n\nTo manage and control operational risk, we use various tools, including risk and control self-assessment (RCSA), operational risk event management and key risk indicator monitoring.\n\nDBS' Three Lines Model adopts one common risk taxonomy, and a consistent risk assessment approach to managing operational risk. RCSA is conducted by each business or support unit to identify key operational risk and assess the e \u038d ectiveness of internal controls. When control issues are identi \u0234 ed, the units develop action plans and track the resolution of the issues.\n\nOperational risk events are classi \u0234 ed in accordance with Basel standards. Such events, including any signi \u0234 cant incidents that may impact DBS' reputation, must be reported based on certain established thresholds. Key risk indicators with prede \u0234 ned escalation triggers are employed to facilitate risk monitoring in a forward-looking manner.\n\nAdditional methodologies are in place to address subject-speci \u0234 c risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n## Technology risk\n\nInformation Technology (IT) risk is managed through an enterprise technology risk management approach. This covers risk identi \u0234 cation, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting. In addition, the appropriate governance, IT policies and standards, control processes and risk mitigation programmes are in place to support the risk management approach.\n\n## Cyber security risk\n\nCyber security risk is a continuous focus of the bank. The Chief Information Security O \u025d cer (CISO) oversees the cyber security function and the one-stop competency centre for all cyber security related matters, such as operational risks, data protection risks and compliance with cyber security related regulations. DBS places signi \u0234 cant emphasis to secure our people, information, network, equipment and applications in accordance with the Bank's risk appetite. The Bank continues to devote signi \u0234 cant resources to improve our cyber hygiene and control environment to stay ahead of the cyber threat curve. The CISO o \u025d ce, as\n\nthe second line, conducts regular assessments to validate the e \u025d cacy of our controls and obtain assurance that our control framework remains e \u038d ective against emerging and evolving threats. DBS also provides relevant training to drive security awareness amongst our sta \u038d and promote a strong security culture.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nCompliance risk refers to the risk of DBS not being able to successfully conduct our business because of any failure to comply with laws, regulatory requirements, industry codes or standards of business and professional conduct applicable to the \u0234 nancial sector.\n\nThis includes, in particular, laws and regulations applicable to the licensing and conducting of banking or other \u0234 nancial businesses, \u0234 nancial crime such as anti-money laundering and countering the \u0234 nancing of terrorism, fraud and bribery/ corruption. We maintain a compliance programme designed to identify, assess, measure, mitigate and report on such risks through a combination of policy and relevant systems and controls.\n\nTo counter \u0234 nancial crime and sanctions risks, DBS established minimum standards for our business and support units to manage our actual and/ or potential risk exposures. In addition, standards aimed to provide the end-to-end management for fraud and related issues at the unit and geographical levels, are implemented through the Fraud Management Programme. We implement surveillance and compliance testing controls where necessary to obtain assurance that the control framework is operating e \u038d ectively.\n\nDBS also provides relevant training and implements assurance processes. We strongly believe in the need to promote a strong compliance culture as well, and this is developed through the leadership of our Board and senior management.\n\n## New product, outsourcing and ecosystem partnership risks\n\nEach new product, service, outsourcing arrangement or ecosystem partnership is subject to a risk review and sign-o \u038d process, where relevant risks are identi \u0234 ed and assessed. Variations of existing products or services and existing outsourcing arrangements and ecosystem partnerships are also subject to a similar process.\n\n## Other mitigation programmes\n\nA robust business continuity management programme is in place to ensure that essential banking services can continue in the event of unforeseen events or business disruptions. This includes a crisis management plan to enable quick response to manage incidents. Exercises are conducted annually, simulating di \u038d erent scenarios to test business continuity plans and crisis management protocol. The e \u038d ectiveness of these exercises as well as DBS' business continuity readiness\n\nand our alignment to regulatory guidelines are communicated and attested by senior management to the BRMC annually.\n\nDBS' management of the Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated the e \u025d cacy of our business continuity plans, keeping the bank in good stead. We were able to quickly adapt and adjust to the pandemic to ensure minimal impact on our customers and assure the health and safety of our employees. We dialled up our work-from home capabilities by leveraging technology and data, and proactively managed the operational risks which arose from new or revised processes as we moved towards a hybrid work arrangement.\n\nTo mitigate losses from speci \u0234 c risk events which are unexpected and signi \u0234 cant, DBS e \u038d ects group-wide insurance coverage under the Group Insurance Programme. These insurance policies relate to crime and professional indemnity, directors and o \u025d cers liability, cyber security risk, property damage and business interruption, general liability and terrorism.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nRobust internal control processes and systems are integral to identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing and reporting operational risk.\n\nAll units are responsible for the day-to-day management of operational risk in their products, processes, systems and activities, in accordance with the various frameworks and policies. The RMG Operational Risk unit and other corporate oversight and control functions:\n\n- \u00b7 Oversee and monitor the e \u038d ectiveness of operational risk management\n- \u00b7 Assess key operational risk issues with the units\n- \u00b7 Report and/ or escalate key operational risks to risk committees with recommendations on appropriate risk mitigation strategies\n\nDBS has in place an integrated governance, risk and compliance system with aligned risk assessment methodology, common taxonomy, and uni \u0234 ed processes for the three lines model. We have in place an operational risk landscape pro \u0234 le which provides the Board and senior management with an integrated view of DBS' operational risk pro \u0234 le periodically, across key operational risk areas and business lines.",

The losses may be categorised into the following seven Basel risk event categories:\n\n| Basel risk event types                            | 2022        | 2022   | 2021        | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|\n|                                                   | SGD million | %      | SGD million | %      |\n| Execution, delivery and process management (EDPM) | 10.22       | 83%    | 9.56        | 87%    |\n| External fraud                                    | 0.83        | 7%     | 0.49        | 5%     |\n| Business disruptions and system failures          | 0.81        | 7%     | 0.70        | 6%     |\n| Clients, products and business practices          | 0.39        | 3%     | 0.19        | 2%     |\n| Damage to physical assets                         | 0.07        | 0%     | 0.04        | 0%     |\n| Internal fraud                                    | 0.04        | 0%     | 0           | 0%     |\n| Employment practices and workplace safety         | 0.01        | 0%     | 0.01        | 0%     |\n| Total (a)                                         | 12.37       | 100%   | 10.99       | 100%   |\n\nNotes\n\n(a) Reportable operational risk events are those with net loss greater than SGD 10,000 and are reported based on the date of detection\n\nEDPM, which comprised mainly processing errors, accounted for the highest share of our total losses in 2022 and the increase was largely attributable to one risk incident.\n\n## 9 Reputational Risk\n\nDBS views reputational risk typically as an outcome of any failure to manage risks in our day-to-day activities/ decisions, and from changes in the operating environment. These risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial risk (credit, market and liquidity risks)\n- \u00b7 Inherent risk (operational and business/ strategic risks)\n\n## 9.1 Reputational risk management at DBS\n\nDBS' approach to reputational risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n## Policies\n\nRisk methodologies\n\nProcesses, systems and reports\n\n## Policies\n\nDBS adopts a four-step approach for reputational risk management, which is to prevent, detect, escalate and respond to reputational risk events.\n\nAs reputational risk is typically a consequence of the failure to manage other risk types, the de \u0234 nitions and principles for managing\n\nsuch risks are articulated in the respective risk policies. These are reinforced by sound corporate values that re \u0235 ect ethical behaviours and practices throughout DBS.\n\nAt DBS, we have policies in place to protect the consistency of our brand and to safeguard our corporate identity and reputation.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nUnder the various risk policies, we have established a number of mechanisms for ongoing risk monitoring.\n\nThese mechanisms take the form of risk limits, key risk indicators, conduct/ culture and other operating metrics, and include the periodic risk and control self-assessment process. Apart from observations from internal sources, alerts from external parties/ stakeholders also serve as an important source to detect potential reputational risk events. In addition, there are policies relating to media communications, social media and corporate social responsibility to protect DBS' reputation. There are also escalation and response mechanisms in place for managing reputational risk.\n\nWhile the respective risk policies address the individual risk types, the Reputational Risk Policy focuses speci \u0234 cally on our stakeholders' perception of how well DBS manages its reputational risks. Stakeholders\n\ninclude customers, government agencies and regulators, investors, rating agencies, business alliances, vendors, trade unions, the media, the general public, the Board and senior management, and DBS' employees.\n\nWe recognise that creating a sense of shared value through engagement with key stakeholder groups is imperative for our brand and reputation.\n\nRead more about our stakeholder engagement on page 80.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nOur units are responsible for the day-to-day management of reputational risk, and ensure that processes and procedures are in place to identify, assess and respond to this risk. This includes social media monitoring to pick up adverse comments on DBS. Events a \u038d ecting DBS' reputational risk are also included in our reporting of risk pro \u0234 les to senior management and Board-level committees.\n\n## 9.2 Reputational risk in 2022\n\nDBS' priority is to prevent the occurrence of a reputational risk event by adopting good risk attitudes and behaviours, instead of taking mitigating action when it occurs. There were no signi \u0234 cant reputational risk incidents endangering the DBS franchise in 2022.\n\n## Capital management and planning\n\n## Objective\n\nThe Board of Directors (Board) is responsible for setting our capital management objective, which is to maintain a strong capital position consistent with regulatory requirements under the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Notice to Banks No. 637 'Notice on Risk Based Capital Adequacy Requirements for Banks Incorporated in Singapore' (MAS Notice 637) and Notice to Designated Financial Holding Companies FHC-N637 on 'Risk Based Capital Adequacy Requirements' (MAS Notice FHC-N637), and the expectations of various stakeholders including customers, investors and rating agencies. The Board articulates this objective in the form of capital targets. This objective is pursued while delivering returns to shareholders and ensuring that adequate capital resources are available for business growth and investment opportunities as well as adverse situations, taking into consideration our strategic plans and risk appetite.\n\nOur dividend policy is to pay sustainable dividends that grow progressively with earnings. In line with this, the Board proposed a \u0234 nal dividend of 42 cents per share, an increase of six cents from the previous payout, and a special dividend of 50 cents per share. The combined payout of 92 cents per share re \u0235 ects our robust earnings pro \u0234 le and strong capital position. Together with the ordinary dividends of 36 cents per share for each of the \u0234 rst three quarters, the total dividend payout for the \u0234 nancial year rose to SGD 2.00 per share, a 67% increase from the SGD 1.20\n\nper share for \u0234 nancial year 2021. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the annualised dividend will rise to SGD 1.68 per share. The Scrip Dividend Scheme will not be applied to the \u0234 nal and special dividends, having been suspended since June 2021.\n\n## Process\n\nOur capital management objective is implemented via a capital management and planning process that is overseen by the Capital Committee. The Chief Financial O \u025d cer chairs the Capital Committee. The Capital Committee receives regular updates on our current and projected capital position. A key tool for capital planning is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) through which we assess our projected capital supply and demand relative to regulatory requirements and our capital targets. The ICAAP generally has a three-year horizon and covers various scenarios, including stress scenarios of di \u038d ering scope and severity.\n\nCapital capacity is allocated on two dimensions: by business line and by entity. Capital allocations by business line are set as part of the budget process and monitored during the year. Return on regulatory capital is one of several metrics used to measure business performance. Capital allocations by entity seek to optimise the distribution of capital resources across entities, taking into account the capital adequacy requirements imposed on each subsidiary in its respective jurisdiction. Capital is allocated to ensure\n\nthat each subsidiary is able to comply with regulatory requirements as it executes its business strategy in line with our strategy.\n\nDuring the course of the year, these subsidiaries did not experience any impediments to the distribution of dividends.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nWe manage our capital structure in line with our capital management objective and seek to optimise the cost and \u0235 exibility o \u038d ered by various capital resources. In order to achieve this, we assess the need and the opportunity to raise or retire capital. There were no Additional Tier 1 nor Tier 2 transactions during the year.\n\nRefer to Note 33 of the \u0234 nancial statements for details on the movement of share capital during the year.\n\nRefer to Notes 32 and 34 to the \u0234 nancial statements as well as the Main Features of Capital Instruments document (https://www.dbs.com/investors/ \u0234 xedincome/capital-instruments) for the terms of the capital instruments that are included in Eligible Total Capital.",

The applicable magnitude will be a weighted average of the jurisdiction-speci \u0234 c countercyclical bu \u038d er requirements that are required by national authorities in jurisdictions to which a bank has private sector credit exposures. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) expects jurisdictions to implement the countercyclical bu \u038d er during periods of excessive credit growth. Of the jurisdictions where we have material private sector credit exposures, Hong Kong has applied a countercyclical bu \u038d er of 2.5% from 1 January 2019, reducing to 2.0% from 14 October 2019 and 1.0% from 16 March 2020 and remained unchanged thereafter.\n\nThe MAS has designated DBS Bank as a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB). Under the MAS' framework for identifying and supervising D-SIBs, the higher loss absorbency requirement for locally incorporated D-SIBs is met by the foregoing minimum ratios being two percentage points higher than those established by the Basel Committee. The Basel Committee has developed an indicator-based methodology for identifying global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) on which higher loss absorbency requirements will be imposed. While we are not a G-SIB, we are required to disclose the set of indicators which are included in the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures published on DBS website (https://www.dbs.com/investors/default.page).\n\nOn 19 December 2022, the MAS announced that the implementation of the \u0234 nal Basel III reforms in Singapore will be deferred to between 1 January 2024 and 1 January 2025. This move is to allow the industry su \u025d cient time for proper implementation of systems needed to adopt the revised framework, and is aligned with the implementation timelines of other major jurisdictions. The MAS will \u0234 nalise the implementation timeline for the \u0234 nal Basel III reforms (including the transitional arrangement for the output \u0235 oor) by 1 July 2023.\n\nOn 7 February 2022, the MAS imposed on DBS Bank an additional capital requirement arising from the widespread unavailability of DBS Bank's digital banking services during 23 to 25 November 2021. Notwithstanding the multiplier of 1.5 times applied on DBS Bank's risk-weighted assets for operational risk, the Group's capital ratios remained robust. The additional capital requirement will be reviewed when MAS is satis \u0234 ed that DBS Bank has addressed the shortcomings identi \u0234 ed through an independent review of the incident.\n\nWith e \u038d ect from 1 January 2023, MAS Notice 637 was amended to: (a) implement the revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements for IRRBB published by the Basel Committee; (b) implement a -100bps interest rate \u0235 oor on the post-shock interest rates under the standardised interest rate shock scenarios set out in Annex 10C of MAS Notice 637; (c) provide additional clarity on the application of interest rate \u0235 oors, interest rate caps, and passthrough rates when computing IRRBB under the standardised interest rate shock scenarios; and (d) implement various other technical revisions.",

As at the date of this statement, the members of the CMDC are Mr Anthony Lim (Chairman), Mr Peter Seah, Dr Bonghan Cho, Ms Punita Lal and Ms Judy Lee.\n\nUnder the terms of the DBSH Share Plan:\n\n- (a) Awards over DBSH's ordinary shares may be granted to Group executives who hold such rank as may be determined by the CMDC from time to time. Awards may also be granted to (amongst others) executives of associated companies of DBSH who hold such rank as may be determined by the CMDC from time to time, and non-executive Directors of DBSH;\n- (b) Where time-based awards are granted, participants are awarded ordinary shares of DBSH or, at the CMDC's discretion, their equivalent cash value or a combination of both as part of their deferred bonus, at the end of the prescribed vesting periods. Awards are granted under the DBSH Share Plan at the absolute discretion of the CMDC. Dividends on unvested shares do not accrue to employees;",

In addition, during the \u0234 nancial year, certain non-executive Directors received an aggregate of 32,672 share awards which vested immediately upon grant. These share awards formed part of their directors' fees for 2021, which had been approved by the shareholders at DBSH's annual general meeting held on 31 March 2022.\n\nDetails of the share awards granted under the DBSH Share Plan to Directors of DBSH are as follows:\n\n| Directors of the Company   | Share awards granted during  the  \u0234   nancial year under review   | Share awards vested during  the  \u0234   nancial year under review   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mr Peter Seah              | 16,025                                                            | 16,025                                                           |\n| Mr Olivier Lim             | 3,550                                                             | 3,550                                                            |\n| Mr Piyush Gupta            | 232,662 (1)                                                       | 291,673                                                          |\n| Dr Bonghan Cho             | 2,109                                                             | 2,109                                                            |\n| Mr Ho Tian Yee             | 1,715                                                             | 1,715                                                            |\n| Ms Punita Lal              | 2,287                                                             | 2,287                                                            |\n| Ms Judy Lee                | 1,148                                                             | 1,148                                                            |\n| Mr Anthony Lim             | 2,824                                                             | 2,824                                                            |\n| Mr Tham Sai Choy           | 3,014                                                             | 3,014                                                            |\n\n- (1) The share awards granted to Mr Piyush Gupta are time-based awards which will vest over a 4-year period.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su \u025d cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities ('ACRA Code') together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the \u0234 nancial statements in Singapore, and we have ful \u0234 lled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Overview\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u00b7 We determined the overall Group materiality based on 5% of the Group's pro \u0234 t before tax.\n\n## Group scoping\n\n- \u00b7 Full scope audit procedures were performed over the Singapore Operations of DBS Bank Ltd. and DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited ('signi \u0234 cant components').\n- \u00b7 We identi \u0234 ed as component entities ('other components') the branches of DBS Bank Ltd. Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul, Tokyo and London, as well as the subsidiaries DBS Bank (China) Limited, PT Bank DBS Indonesia, DBS Bank (Taiwan) Ltd and DBS Bank India Limited. This is where certain account balances were considered to be signi \u0234 cant in size in relation to the Group. Consequently, audit speci \u0234 ed procedures for the signi \u0234 cant account balances of these components were performed to obtain su \u025d cient and appropriate audit evidence.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u00b7 Speci \u0234 c allowances for loans and advances to customers\n- \u00b7 General allowances for credit losses (Stage 1 and 2 Expected Credit Loss)\n- \u00b7 Goodwill\n- \u00b7 Valuation of \u0234 nancial instruments held at fair value\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the accompanying \u0234 nancial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of signi \u0234 cant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including, among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was in \u0235 uenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the consolidated \u0234 nancial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in \u0235 uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated \u0234 nancial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated \u0234 nancial statements as a whole, as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the e \u038d ect of misstatements, both individually and on the \u0234 nancial statements as a whole.\n\n| How we determined overall Group materiality   | 5% of the Group's pro \u0234  t before tax                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rationale for benchmark applied               | \u00b7  We chose 'pro \u0234  t before tax' as, in our view, it is the benchmark against  which performance of the Group is most commonly measured.  \u00b7  We selected 5% based on our professional judgement, noting that it is  also within the range of commonly accepted pro \u0234  t-related thresholds. |\n\nIn performing our audit, we allocated materiality levels to the signi \u0234 cant components and other components of the Group. These are less than the overall Group materiality.",

The Group's \u0234 nancial reporting process is dependent on its Information Technology ('IT') systems. Our audit scope included testing the operating e \u038d ectiveness of b the controls over the integrity of key \u0234 nancial data processed through the IT systems that are relevant to \u0234 nancial reporting.\n\nIn establishing the overall Group audit approach, we determined the extent of audit procedures that were needed to be performed across the Group by us or by other PwC network \u0234 rms, operating under our instruction, who are familiar with the local laws and regulations in each respective territory, (the 'component auditors'). Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to b have in the procedures to be able to conclude whether su \u025d cient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on b the \u0234 nancial statements as a whole.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signi \u0234 cance in our audit of the \u0234 nancial statements for the \u0234 nancial year ended 31 December 2022.

The valuations of 'Level 3' instruments rely on signi \u0234 cant unobservable inputs.\n\nWe considered the overall valuation of \u0234 nancial instruments (Level 1, 2 and 3) to be a key audit matter given the \u0234 nancial signi \u0234 cance to the Group, the nature of the underlying products and the estimation involved to determine fair value.\n\nIn determining fair value, management also make adjustments to recognise credit risk, funding costs, bid-o \u038d er spreads and, in some cases, parameter and model risk limitations. This is broadly consistent with the banking industry, albeit the methodology to calculate some of these adjustments is continuing to evolve.\n\n(Refer also to Notes 3 and 42 to the \u0234 nancial statements.)\n\nWe assessed the design and tested the operating e \u038d ectiveness of the controls over the Group's \u0234 nancial instruments valuation processes. These b included the controls over:\n\n- \u00b7 management's testing and approval of new models and revalidation of b existing models;\n- \u00b7 the completeness and accuracy of pricing data inputs into valuation models;\n- \u00b7 monitoring of collateral disputes; and\n- \u00b7 governance mechanisms and monitoring over the valuation processes (including derivative valuation adjustments) by the Group Market and Liquidity Risk Committee and the Group Valuation Committee.\n\nWe determined that we could rely on the controls for the purposes of our audit. In addition, we:\n\n- \u00b7 engaged our own specialists to use their own models and input sources to determine an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of the Group's Level 1 and Level 2 \u0234 nancial instruments. We compared these to the Group's calculations of fair value to assess individual material valuation di \u038d erences or systemic bias;\n- \u00b7 assessed the reasonableness of the methodologies used and the assumptions made for a sample of \u0234 nancial instrument valuations with signi \u0234 cant unobservable valuation inputs (Level 3 instruments);\n- \u00b7 performed procedures on collateral disputes to identify possible indicators of inappropriate valuations;\n- \u00b7 performed tests of inputs and assessed the methodology over fair value adjustments, in light of available market data and industry trends; and\n- \u00b7 considered the implications of global reforms to Interest Reference Rates ('IBOR Reform') in our assessment of fair value.\n\nOverall, we considered that the valuation of \u0234 nancial instruments held at fair value was within a reasonable range of outcomes.\n\n## Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors' Statement (but does not include the \u0234 nancial statements and our auditor's report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, and the other sections of the Annual Report ('the Other Sections') which are expected to be made available to us after that date.\n\nOur opinion on the \u0234 nancial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the \u0234 nancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identi \u0234 ed above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the \u0234 nancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nWhen we read the Other Sections, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of \u0234 nancial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls su \u025d cient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair \u0234 nancial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.\n\nIn preparing the \u0234 nancial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's \u0234 nancial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the \u0234 nancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in \u0235 uence the economic decisions of b users taken on the basis of these \u0234 nancial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the \u0234 nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su \u025d cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of b not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e \u038d ectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi \u0234 cant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the \u0234 nancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the \u0234 nancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \u0234 nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain su \u025d cient appropriate audit evidence regarding the \u0234 nancial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated \u0234 nancial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We b remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi \u0234 cant audit \u0234 ndings, including any signi \u0234 cant de \u0234 ciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most signi \u0234 cance in the audit of the \u0234 nancial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene \u0234 ts of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nIn our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors, have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Yura Mahindroo.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nPublic Accountants and Chartered Accountants\n\nSingapore, 10 February 2023",

Domicile and Activities\n\nThe Company, DBS Group Holdings Ltd, is incorporated and domiciled in the Republic of Singapore and has its registered o \u025d ce at 12 Marina Boulevard, Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower Three, Singapore 018982.\n\nThe Company is listed on the Singapore Exchange.\n\nThe Company is an investment holding, treasury and funding vehicle for the group. Its main subsidiary is DBS Bank Ltd. (the Bank), which is wholly owned and engaged in a range of commercial banking and \u0234 nancial services, principally in Asia.\n\nThe \u0234 nancial statements relate to the Company and its subsidiaries (the b Group) and the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures.\n\n## 2. Summary of Signi \u0234 cant Accounting Policies\n\n## 2.1 Basis of preparation\n\n## Compliance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I))\n\nThe \u0234 nancial statements of the Company and the consolidated \u0234 nancial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)). As permitted by Section 201(10)(b) of the Companies Act 1967 (the Act), the Company's income statement has not been included in these \u0234 nancial statements.\n\nThe \u0234 nancial statements are presented in Singapore dollars and rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 2.2 Signi \u0234 cant estimates and judgement\n\nThe preparation of \u0234 nancial statements requires management to exercise judgement, use estimates and make assumptions in the application of policies and in reporting the amounts in the \u0234 nancial statements. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may di \u038d er from these estimates. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions used that are signi \u0234 cant to the \u0234 nancial statements, and areas involving a higher degree of judgement and complexity, are disclosed in Note 3.\n\n## 2.3 New or amended SFRS(I) e \u038d ective for 2022 year-end\n\nThe amendments e \u038d ective from 1 January 2022 did not have signi \u0234 cant impact on the Group's \u0234 nancial statements.\n\n## 2.4 New SFRS(I) and Interpretations e \u038d ective for future periods\n\nThe amendments and interpretations e \u038d ective for future periods do not have a signi \u0234 cant impact on the Group's \u0234 nancial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA)\n\n## General Accounting Policies\n\nA summary of the signi \u0234 cant group accounting policies is described further below starting with those relating to the entire \u0234 nancial statements, followed by those relating to the income statement, the balance sheet and other speci \u0234 c topics. This does not re \u0235 ect the relative importance of these policies to the Group.\n\n## 2.5 Group Accounting\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to a \u038d ect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is transferred to the Group to the date control ceases.\n\nThe acquisition method is used to account for business combinations. Please refer to Note 2.13 for the Group's accounting policy on goodwill.\n\nAll intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nAssociates are entities over which the Group has signi \u0234 cant in \u0235 uence but no control, where the Group generally holds a shareholding of between and including 20% and 50% of the voting rights.\n\nJoint ventures are entities which the Group has joint control and rights to the net assets of the entity.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost. In addition, when the Group's share of the fair value of the identi \u0234 able net assets of the investment exceeds the cost of acquisition paid by the Group, the excess is recognised in pro \u0234 t and loss as part of the share of pro \u0234 t from associates and joint ventures.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, these investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of post-acquisition pro \u0234 ts or losses and the Group's share of other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from the associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction of the carrying amount of the investments.\n\n## 2.6 Foreign currency treatment\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems in the \u0234 nancial statements are measured using the functional currency of each entity in the Group, this being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The Group's \u0234 nancial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are measured using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the entity undertaking the transaction at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange di \u038d erences arising from this translation are recognised in the income statement within 'Net trading income'.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities measured at cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair values in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair values are determined, which is generally the balance sheet date.\n\nUnrealised foreign exchange di \u038d erences arising from non-monetary \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities classi \u0234 ed as fair value through pro \u0234 t or loss (FVPL) are recognised in the income statement as trading income.\n\nNon-monetary \u0234 nancial assets that are classi \u0234 ed at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) relates mainly to FVOCI equities. Please refer to Note 2.9 for the accounting treatment of FVOCI equities.\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nThe results and \u0234 nancial position of subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and branches or units whose functional currency is not Singapore dollars ('foreign operations') are translated into Singapore dollars in the following manner:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date;\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses in the income statement are translated at exchange rates prevailing at each month-end, approximating the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions; and\n- \u00b7 All resulting exchange di \u038d erences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under foreign currency translation reserves in equity. When a foreign operation is partially or fully disposed of, or when it is liquidated, such exchange di \u038d erences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss.\n\nFor acquisitions prior to 1 January 2005, the foreign exchange rates at the respective dates of acquisition were used. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation on or after 1 January 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. Please refer to Note 28 for b an overview of goodwill recorded.\n\n## 2.7 Segment reporting\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to management.\n\nIn preparing the segment information, amounts for each business segment are shown after the allocation of certain centralised costs, funding income and the application of transfer pricing, where appropriate. Transactions between segments are recorded within the segment as if they are third party transactions and are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nPlease refer to Note 46 for further details on business and geographical segment reporting.",

The calculation includes signi \u0234 cant fees and transaction costs that are integral to the e \u038d ective interest rate, as well as premiums or discounts.\n\n## Fee and commission income\n\nThe Group earns fee and commission income from a diverse range of products and services provided to its customers. Fee and commission income are recognised when the Group has satis \u0234 ed its performance obligation in providing the promised products and services to the customer, and are recognised based on contractual rates agreed with customers, net of expected waivers based on historical experience, and net of expenses directly related to it. The Group generally satis \u0234 es its performance obligation and recognises the fee and commission income on the following basis:\n\n- \u00b7 Transaction-based fee and commission income is recognised on the completion of the transaction. Such fees include underwriting fees, brokerage fees, bancassurance sales commission and variable service fees, and fees related to the completion of corporate \u0234 nance transactions.\n- \u00b7 For a service that is provided over a period of time, fee and commission income is generally recognised on equal proportion basis over the period during which the related service is provided or credit risk is undertaken. This basis of recognition most appropriately re \u0235 ects the nature and pattern of provision of these services to the customers over time. Fees for these services can be billed to customers in advance or periodically over time. Such fees include the b income from issuance of \u0234 nancial guarantees and bancassurance \u0234 xed service fees.\n\nThe Group does not provide any signi \u0234 cant credit terms to customers for the above products and services.\n\nDirectly related expenses typically include brokerage fees paid, card-related expenses and sales commissions, but do not include expenses for services delivered over a period (such as service contracts) and other expenses that are not speci \u0234 cally related to fee and commission income transactions.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. This is generally the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities, and the date when shareholders approve the dividend for unlisted equity securities. Dividend income arising from \u0234 nancial assets classi \u0234 ed as FVPL is recognised in 'Net trading income', while those arising from FVOCI \u0234 nancial assets is recognised in 'Net income from investment securities'.\n\n## Allowances for credit and other losses\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.11 for the accounting policy on impairment of \u0234 nancial assets.\n\nC)\n\n## Balance Sheet\n\n## 2.9 Financial assets\n\n## Initial recognition\n\nPurchases and sales of all \u0234 nancial assets are recognised on the date that the Group enters into the contractual arrangements with counterparties. When the Group acts as a trustee or in a \u0234 duciary capacity for assets it does not directly control or bene \u0234 t from, the assets and the corresponding income belonging to a customer are excluded from the \u0234 nancial statements.\n\nFinancial assets are initially recognised at fair value, which is generally the transaction price.\n\n## Classi \u0234 cation and subsequent measurement\n\nSFRS(I) 9 categorises debt-like \u0234 nancial assets based on the business model within which the assets are managed, and whether the assets constitute a 'basic lending arrangement' where their contractual cash \u0235 ows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Interest is de \u0234 ned as consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and may include a pro \u0234 t margin.\n\nThe classi \u0234 cation of the \u0234 nancial assets and the associated accounting treatment are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments are measured at amortised cost when they are in a 'hold to collect' (HTC) business model and have contractual cash \u0235 ows that are SPPI in nature. The objective of a HTC business model is to collect contractual principal and interest cash \u0235 ows. Sales are incidental to the objective and expected to be either insigni \u0234 cant or infrequent. These assets consist primarily of loans in the 'Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management' and 'Institutional Banking' segments as well as debt securities from the 'Others' segment.\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) when they are in a 'hold to collect & sell' (HTC & S) business model and have cash \u0235 ows that are SPPI in nature. Both the collection of contractual cash \u0235 ows and sales are integral to achieving the objective of the HTC & S business model. Assets measured at FVOCI comprise mainly of debt securities from 'Treasury Markets' and the 'Others' segment.\n\nUnrealised gains or losses on FVOCI debt instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves. When they are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments in FVOCI revaluation reserves are reclassi \u0234 ed to the income statement as 'Net income from investment securities'.\n\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments are measured at fair value through pro \u0234 t or loss (FVPL) when:\n- i) the assets are not SPPI in nature;\n- ii) the assets are not part of a 'HTC' or 'HTC & S' business model; or\n- iii) the assets are designated at FVPL to eliminate or signi \u0234 cantly reduce the measurement or recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on di \u038d erent bases.\n\nAssets measured at FVPL are mainly recorded in the 'Treasury Markets' segment. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on FVPL \u0234 nancial assets are taken to the income statement in the period they arise.\n\n- \u00b7 Subsequent changes in fair value of non-trading equity can be taken through pro \u0234 t or loss or comprehensive income, as elected. The Group\n\ngenerally elects its non-trading equity instruments to be classi \u0234 ed as FVOCI. Other than dividend income, gains and losses on FVOCI equity instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves, and not reclassi \u0234 ed to pro \u0234 t or loss upon derecognition.\n\n- \u00b7 Derivatives (including derivatives embedded in \u0234 nancial liabilities but separated for accounting purposes) are also classi \u0234 ed as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. Derivatives are classi \u0234 ed as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives other than those designated as hedging instruments in cash \u0235 ow or net b investment hedges are included in 'Net trading income'.\n\n## Reclassi \u0234 cation\n\nReclassi \u0234 cation of \u0234 nancial assets are prohibited unless the Group changes its business model for managing \u0234 nancial assets. In practice, this b is expected to be infrequent.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair value of \u0234 nancial assets is the price that would be received if the asset is sold in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is generally estimated by discounting the future contractual cash \u0235 ows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar \u0234 nancial instruments. Where applicable, a b valuation reserve or pricing adjustment is applied to arrive at the fair value. The determination of fair value is considered a signi \u0234 cant accounting policy for the Group and further details are disclosed in Note 42.\n\n## O \u038d setting\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented net when there is a legally enforceable right to o \u038d set the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle them on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the b liability simultaneously.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash \u0235 ows from the \u0234 nancial assets have expired or when they have been transferred together with substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nThe Group enters into certain transactions where it transfers \u0234 nancial assets recognised on its balance sheet but retains either all or a portion of the risks and rewards of the transferred \u0234 nancial assets. In such cases, the transferred \u0234 nancial assets are not derecognised from the balance sheet. Such transactions include repurchase agreements described in Note 2.12. They also include transactions where control over the \u0234 nancial asset is retained, for example, by a simultaneous transaction (such as options) with the same counterparty to which the asset is transferred. These are mainly transacted in the 'Treasury Markets' segment. In such cases, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement which is the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.\n\nPlease refer to Note 20 for disclosures on transferred \u0234 nancial assets.\n\n## 2.10 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the cash \u0235 ow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and non-restricted balances with central banks which are readily convertible into cash.\n\n## 2.11 Impairment of \u0234 nancial assets at amortised cost and FVOCI\n\n## Expected Credit Losses (ECL)\n\nECL are recognised for all \u0234 nancial assets held at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, guarantees and undrawn credit commitments. It represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls over the residual term of a \u0234 nancial asset, guarantee or undrawn commitment.\n\nAt initial recognition, allowance is required for ECL resulting from possible default events that may occur within the next 12 months ('12-month ECL'). In the event of a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk, allowance is required for ECL resulting from possible default events over the expected life of the instrument ('lifetime ECL').\n\nThe ECL recognised follows the three-stage model: \u0234 nancial instruments where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered Stage 1; \u0234 nancial instruments which experience a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk are in Stage 2; and \u0234 nancial instruments with objective evidence of default or credit-impaired are in Stage 3.\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1 - Financial instruments are classi \u0234 ed as Stage 1 at initial recognition and will remain under Stage 1 unless they experience a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk or become credit-impaired. 12-month ECL is recognised for these instruments.\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 - Financial instruments which experience a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk (SICR) subsequent to initial recognition, but are not yet credit-impaired, will migrate from Stage 1 to Stage 2. Lifetime ECL is recognised for these instruments.\n\nSigni \u0234 cant increase in credit risk (SICR): SICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default at reporting date to the risk of default at origination using a range of qualitative and quantitative factors.\n\nFor wholesale exposures, a \u0234 nancial instrument is deemed to have experienced a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk when:\n\n- \u00b7 the observed change in its probability of default (PD), as observed by downgrades in the Group's internal credit risk rating for this instrument between origination and reporting dates, is more than pre-speci \u0234 ed thresholds; or\n- \u00b7 it is placed on certain internal credit watchlists categories for closer scrutiny of developing credit issues.\n\nFor retail exposures, days past due is the main driver, supplemented with a PD-based criterion. In any event, all retail and wholesale exposures that are more than 30 days past due are presumed to have experienced a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk, unless assessed otherwise, and are classi \u0234 ed as Stage 2. b\n\nInstruments in Stage 2 that no longer exhibit a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk will be transferred back to Stage 1.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Stage 3 - Financial instruments that become credit-impaired with evidence of default, i.e. non-performing assets, are transferred to Stage b 3. Please refer to Risk Management section for the de \u0234 nition of b non-performing assets.\n\nLifetime ECL is recognised for these assets. ECL for Stage 3 assets are also known as speci \u0234 c allowances.\n\nA Stage 3 exposure that is restructured can be upgraded to Stage 2 if there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the obligor is able to service future principal and interest payments in accordance with the restructured terms. Stage 3 \u0234 nancial assets are written-o \u038d , in whole or in part, when the Group has exhausted all practical recovery e \u038d orts and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of future recoveries.\n\n## Measurement of ECL\n\nECL are unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering past events, current conditions and assessments of future economic conditions at the reporting date. The ECL associated with a \u0234 nancial instrument is typically a product of its probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) discounted using the original e \u038d ective interest rate to the reporting date.\n\n| Component   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PD          | Point-in-time (based on current conditions, adjusted to  take into account estimates of future conditions that will  impact PD) estimate of the likelihood of default.                                                             |\n| LGD         | Estimate of the loss arising on default. It is based on the  di \u038d  erence between the contractual cash  \u0235  ows due and  those that the Group would expect to receive, including  recoveries from collaterals.                      |\n| EAD         | Estimate of the expected credit exposure at time of  default, taking into account repayments of principal  and interest as well as expected drawdowns on  undrawn credit commitments and potential pay-outs on  guarantees issued. |\n\nThe 12-month ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD, LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated using the lifetime PD. The 12-month and lifetime PDs represent the probability of default occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively.\n\nIn most instances, expected remaining maturity is the same as the remaining contractual life which represents the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to the credit risk of the borrower. However, for some revolving products (e.g. credit cards), the expected remaining maturity may exceed the contractual maturity. In such instances, behavioural expected remaining life will be used.\n\n## ECL Modelling - Point-in-Time and Forward-Looking Adjustments\n\nThe Group leverages the models and parameters implemented under the Basel II Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) framework where possible, with appropriate modi \u0234 cations to meet SFRS(I) 9 requirements.\n\nOther relevant historical information, loss experience or proxies will be utilised for portfolios without appropriate Basel models and parameters, with a view to maximise the use of available information that is reliable and supportable.\n\nFor the wholesale portfolios, credit cycle indices (CCIs) have been developed for the key industries and geographies. CCIs are summary measures that depict broad-based, sector-wide changes in credit risk,\n\nwhich are constructed by comparing the median expected default frequency of \u0234 rms within each segment against a long-run average. Expected default frequency is in turn a market-based point-in-time default risk measure driven by the market value of \u0234 rms' assets, asset volatility and leverage. CCIs are then used as inputs to convert the generally more through-the-cycle PDs derived from Basel models/ parameters into the point-in-time equivalents by adding the unaccounted portion of cyclical variations, as well as to incorporate forward-looking information. LGDs are determined using historical loss data, which are adjusted for both the latest and forecasted recovery experience.\n\nThe Group relies on a Monte Carlo simulation approach to consider over 100 probability-weighted forward-looking scenarios in estimating ECL. This involves simulations of many alternative CCI scenarios to arrive at an unbiased ECL estimate that are meant to cover all possible good and bad scenarios based on known estimates.\n\nFor retail portfolios, historical loss experience is used in conjunction with the forecast loss rates which take into account relevant macroeconomic variables, such as property prices and unemployment rates.\n\n## Expert credit judgement and post model adjustments\n\nThe measurement of ECL requires the application of expert credit judgement and post model adjustments. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 assignment of credit risk ratings and determination of whether exposures should be placed on credit watchlists;\n- \u00b7 assessment of whether a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk has occurred;\n- \u00b7 selecting and calibrating the ECL models such as CCIs;\n- \u00b7 determining the expected remaining maturity of revolving products (e.g. overdrafts and credit cards);\n- \u00b7 determination of the forecast loss rates; and\n- \u00b7 application of thematic overlays based on emerging risk themes where potential risks may not be fully captured in the underlying modelled ECL. Such top-down additional modelled ECL was quanti \u0234 ed by means of applying conditional probabilities on more severe scenarios materialising from emerging risk themes.\n\nThe Group has two thematic overlays as at 31 December 2022.\n\nIn addition to the base scenarios generated by the model, the Group has incorporated a stress scenario and assigned probabilities to the scenarios, in line with management's judgement of the likelihood of each scenario. The stress scenario envisages persistence of the RussiaUkraine con \u0235 ict, as well as a sharp, broad-based global recession with a spike in risk aversion in \u0234 nancial markets and large capital out \u0235 ows from emerging economies. b\n\nThe other thematic overlay is to address pricing pressures and risks of asset stranding that the conventional energy sector could face as a result of a transition to a low-carbon economy. Probabilities were assigned to the scenarios in-line with management's judgement of the likelihood of each scenario.\n\n## Governance framework\n\nThe measurement of ECL is subject to a robust governance framework as described below.\n\n- \u00b7 The Group ECL Review Committee (Review Committee) is the overarching committee for ECL related matters and comprises senior management and representatives from functions across the Group. Signi \u0234 cant changes to ECL models and methodologies and the application of thematic overlays are subject to the oversight and approval of the Review Committee.\n- \u00b7 The Review Committee is supported by the Group ECL Operating Committee (Operating Committee) which comprises cross functional representatives and subject matter experts. The Operating Committee recommends changes to ECL models, methodologies and thematic overlays to the Review Committee; provides oversight over system design, infrastructure and development; and establishes principles and signi \u0234 cant policies pertaining to ECL. Group Credit Risk Models Committee oversees ECL models and credit risk models used by the Group.\n- \u00b7 Location ECL committees are established for key overseas subsidiaries to govern and manage location-speci \u0234 c ECL reporting.\n- \u00b7 ECL models are subject to independent validation by the Risk Management Group (RMG) Model Validation team, as well as independent reviews by internal and external auditors. The validation and assurance processes cover the review of the underlying ECL methodology including its logic and conceptual soundness.\n\n## Minimum Regulatory Loss Allowance\n\nSingapore banks are required to maintain the Minimum Regulatory Loss Allowances (MRLA) of at least 1% of the gross carrying amount of selected credit exposures net of collaterals per MAS Notice 612. For periods when Stage 1 and 2 ECL fall below MRLA, the shortfall is appropriated from retained earnings in the shareholders' funds into a non-distributable Regulatory Loss Allowance Reserve (RLAR) account.\n\n## 2.12 Repurchase agreements\n\nRepurchase agreements (Repos) are arrangements where the Group sold the securities but are subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem the securities at a pre-determined price. The securities are retained on the balance sheet as Group retains substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership and these securities are disclosed within 'Financial assets pledged or transferred' (Note 20). The consideration received is recorded as \u0234 nancial liabilities in either 'Due to banks' or 'Deposits and balances from customers'. Short-dated repos transacted as part of Treasury Markets activities are measured at FVPL. b\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements (Reverse repos) are\n\narrangements where the Group purchased the securities but are subject to a commitment to resell or return the securities at a predetermined price. b The risk and rewards of ownership of the collateral are not acquired by the Group and are re \u0235 ected as collateral received and recorded o \u038d -balance sheet. The consideration paid is recorded as \u0234 nancial assets as 'Cash and balances with central banks', 'Due from banks' or 'Loans and advances to customers'. Short-dated reverse repos transacted as part of Treasury Markets activities are measured at FVPL.\n\n## 2.13 Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising from business combinations generally represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of identi \u0234 able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses and is tested at least annually for impairment.\n\nAt the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units (CGU) or group of CGUs expected to bene \u0234 t from the combination's synergies.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of a CGU, or group of CGUs, including the goodwill, exceeds the applicable recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU or CGU group is the higher of the CGU's or CGU group's fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. An impairment loss on goodwill is recognised in the income statement and cannot be reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## 2.14 Properties and other \u0234 xed assets\n\n## Owned properties and other \u0234 xed assets\n\nProperties (including investment properties) and other \u0234 xed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the costs of the assets to their estimated residual values over the estimated useful lives of the assets. No depreciation is recognised when the residual value is higher than the carrying amount.\n\nGenerally, the useful lives are as follows:\n\nLeasehold land\n\n100 years or over the remaining lease period, whichever is shorter. Leasehold land where the unexpired lease period is more than 100 years is not depreciated.\n\nBuildings\n\n30 to 50 years or over the remaining lease period, whichever is shorter.\n\nComputer software\n\n3 to 5 years\n\nO \u025d ce equipment, furniture and \u0234 ttings\n\n5 to 10 years\n\nLeasehold improvements\n\nUp to 20 years\n\n## Leased properties and other \u0234 xed assets\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The measurement of the associated right-of-use assets generally approximates the lease liability.\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e \u038d ective interest method. The right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nExtension options and termination options are included in the assessment of the lease term if the options are reasonably certain to be exercised or not exercised accordingly. If the Group changes its initial assessment, adjustments are made to the carrying amounts of the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets prospectively.\n\nThe recognition exceptions for short-term leases and leases of lowvalue assets are applied.\n\nPlease refer to Note 27 for the details of owned and leased properties and other \u0234 xed assets.\n\n## 2.15 Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition, classi \u0234 cation and subsequent measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. The Group generally classi \u0234 es and measures its \u0234 nancial liabilities in accordance with the purpose for which the \u0234 nancial liabilities are incurred and managed. Accordingly:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities are classi \u0234 ed as \u0234 nancial liabilities at fair value through pro \u0234 t or loss if they are incurred for the purpose",

Upon a loan draw-down, the amount of the loan is generally recognised as 'Loans and advances to customers' on the Group's balance sheet.\n\n## Letters of credit\n\nLetters of credit are recorded o \u038d -balance sheet as contingent liabilities upon issuance, and the corresponding payables to the bene \u0234 ciaries and\n\nreceivables from the applicants are recognised on the balance sheet upon acceptance of the underlying documents.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantees are initially recognised in the \u0234 nancial statements at fair value on the date the guarantees are given.\n\nFinancial guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of the ECL (Note 2.11); and\n- \u00b7 the unamortised portion of the fees that were received on initial b recognition.\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.8 for the principles for recognising the fees.\n\nO \u038d -balance sheet credit exposures are managed for credit risk in the same manner as \u0234 nancial assets.\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.11 on the Group's accounting policies on allowances for credit losses.\n\n## 2.17 Provisions and other liabilities\n\nProvisions for other liabilities of uncertain timing and amounts are recognised when:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of b past events;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that an out \u0235 ow of resources embodying economic bene \u0234 ts will be required to settle the obligation; and\n- \u00b7 a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 2.18 Share capital and other instruments classi \u0234 ed as b equity\n\nOrdinary shares, preference shares and other instruments which do not result in the Group having a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another \u0234 nancial asset, or to exchange \u0234 nancial assets or \u0234 nancial liabilities with the holder under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group, are classi \u0234 ed as equity. b Distributions arising from such instruments are recognised in equity as there is no contractual obligation to pay distributions on these instruments. Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issuance of such instruments are accounted for as a deduction from equity.\n\nWhen any entity within the Group purchases the Company's ordinary shares ('treasury shares'), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a component within equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n\nWhen treasury shares are subsequently cancelled, the cost of the treasury shares is deducted against either the share capital account or retained earnings. When treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any realised gain or loss on sale or reissue, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and related income tax, is recognised in other reserves.\n\nFor ordinary and preference shares, interim dividends are recorded during the \u0234 nancial year in which they are declared payable. Final dividends are recorded during the \u0234 nancial year in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## D) Other Speci \u0234 c Topics\n\n## 2.19 Hedging and hedge accounting\n\nAs part of the overall risk management of the Group, derivatives and other instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks, including exposures arising from forecast transactions.\n\nWhere hedge accounting is not applied, the derivatives are treated in the same way as derivatives held for trading purposes, i.e. realised and unrealised gains and losses are recognised in 'Net trading income'. The Group applies hedge accounting for economic hedge relationships that meet the hedge accounting criteria. To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of each hedging relationship, the Group designates and documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item; the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge transaction; and the methods used to assess the e \u038d ectiveness of the hedge. At inception and on an on-going basis, the Group also assesses and measures the e \u038d ectiveness of the hedging relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.\n\nWhere all relevant criteria are met, hedge accounting is applied to remove the accounting mismatch between hedging instrument and the hedged item. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk in fair value hedges, cash \u0235 ow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations as described below.\n\n## \u00b7 Fair value hedge\n\nFor a qualifying fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment on the hedged item is amortised using the e \u038d ective interest method to the income statement over its remaining maturity.\n\nHowever, where the hedged item is an equity instrument classi \u0234 ed as FVOCI, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are both recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves. The amounts recorded in b FVOCI revaluation reserves are not subsequently reclassi \u0234 ed to the income statement.\n\n## \u00b7 Cash \u0235 ow hedge\n\nThe e \u038d ective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated and qualifying as a cash \u0235 ow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the cash \u0235 ow hedge reserves in equity. This amount is reclassi \u0234 ed to the income statement in the periods when the hedged forecast cash \u0235 ows a \u038d ect the income statement. The ine \u038d ective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement under 'Net trading income'.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in the cash \u0235 ow hedge reserves remains until the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss in the cash \u0235 ow hedge reserves is reclassi \u0234 ed from equity to the income statement.\n\n## \u00b7 Net investment hedge\n\nHedges of net investments in the Group's foreign operations are accounted for in a manner similar to cash \u0235 ow hedges. On disposal of the foreign operations, the cumulative gain or loss in the foreign currency translation reserves is reclassi \u0234 ed to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nWhen designating the hedging instrument, the Group may elect to exclude the valuation components of currency basis spreads and forward points from the hedge relationship on a hedge-by-hedge basis.\n\nThe forward points and currency basis spreads which are excluded and recorded in other comprehensive income are:\n\n- \u00b7 reclassi \u0234 ed to the income statement when the forecast transaction occurs; or\n- \u00b7 amortised to the income statement over the hedging tenor for time-period hedges. The amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are not subsequently reclassi \u0234 ed to the income statement for hedges of FVOCI equities.\n\nThe Group has elected to apply the SFRS(I) 9 hedge accounting rules in full.\n\nPlease refer to Note 39 for further details relating to hedge accounting, including fair value, cash \u0235 ow and net investment hedges.\n\n## 2.20 Employee bene \u0234 ts\n\nEmployee bene \u0234 ts, which include base pay, cash bonuses, sharebased compensation, contribution to de \u0234 ned contribution plans such as the Central Provident Fund and other sta \u038d -related allowances, are recognised in the income statement when incurred.\n\nFor de \u0234 ned contribution plans, contributions are made to publicly or privately administered funds on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further payment obligations.\n\nEmployee entitlement to annual leave is recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual unutilised leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the balance sheet date.\n\n## 2.21 Share-based compensation\n\nEmployee bene \u0234 ts also include share-based compensation, namely the DBSH Share Plan, the DBSH Employee Share Plan and the DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plans). The details of the Plans are described in Note 40.\n\nEquity instruments granted and ultimately vested under the Plans are recognised in the income statement based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant. The expense is amortised over the vesting period of each award, with a corresponding adjustment to the share plan reserves.\n\nA trust has been set up for the DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan. The employer's share of the trust fund is consolidated. The unvested DBSH shares held by the trust funds are accounted for as treasury shares, which is presented as a deduction within equity.",

        "page_content": "## 2.22 Current and deferred taxes\n\nCurrent income tax for current and prior periods is recognised as the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The Group considers uncertain tax positions generally at the level of the total tax liability to each tax authority for each period. The liability is determined based on the total amount of current tax expected to be paid, taking into account all tax uncertainties, using either an expected value approach or a single best estimate of the most likely outcome.\n\nTax assets and liabilities of the same type (current or deferred) are o \u038d set when a legal right of o \u038d set exists and settlement in this manner is intended. This applies generally when they arise from the same tax reporting group and relate to the same tax authority.\n\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary di \u038d erences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the \u0234 nancial statements. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nThe amount of deferred tax assets recognised takes into account the likelihood the amount that can be used to o \u038d set payable taxes on future pro \u0234 ts.\n\nDeferred tax related to fair value re-measurement of FVOCI investments, which are recognised outside pro \u0234 t or loss, is also recognised outside pro \u0234 t or loss, i.e. in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the FVOCI revaluation reserves.\n\n## 3. Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe Group's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to the reported amounts in the \u0234 nancial statements. Certain accounting estimates require management's judgement in determining the appropriate methodology for valuation of assets and liabilities. Procedures are in place to ensure that methodologies are reviewed and revised as appropriate. The Group believes its estimates for determining the valuation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate.\n\nThe following is a brief description of the Group's critical accounting estimates that involve management's valuation judgement.\n\n## 3.1 Impairment of \u0234 nancial assets\n\nIt is the Group's policy to recognise, through charges against pro \u0234 t, allowances in respect of estimated and inherent credit losses in its portfolio as described in Note 2.11.\n\nECLs are unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering past events, current conditions and assessments of future economic conditions at the reporting date. This will necessarily involve the use of judgement.\n\nPlease refer to Risk Management section for a further description of the Group's credit risk management framework, policies and procedures.\n\n## 3.2 Fair value of \u0234 nancial instruments\n\nThe majority of the Group's \u0234 nancial instruments reported at fair value are based on quoted and observable market prices or on internally developed models that are based on independently sourced or veri \u0234 ed market parameters.\n\nThe fair value of \u0234 nancial instruments without an observable market price in an active market may be determined using valuation models. The choice of model requires signi \u0234 cant judgement for complex products especially those in the 'Treasury Markets' segment.\n\nPolicies and procedures have been established to facilitate the exercise of judgement in determining the risk characteristics of various \u0234 nancial instruments, discount rates, estimates of future cash \u0235 ows and other factors used in the valuation process.\n\nPlease refer to Note 42 for further details on fair valuation and fair value hierarchy of the Group's \u0234 nancial instruments measured at fair value.\n\n## 3.3 Goodwill impairment\n\nThe Group performs an impairment review to ensure that the carrying amount of a CGU to which goodwill is allocated does not exceed the recoverable amount of the CGU. Note 28 provides details of goodwill at b the reporting date.\n\nThe recoverable amount represents the present value of the estimated future cash \u0235 ows expected to arise from continuing operations. Therefore, in arriving at the recoverable amount, management exercises judgement in estimating the future cash \u0235 ows, growth rate and discount rate.\n\n## 3.4 Income taxes\n\nThe Group has exposure to income taxes in several jurisdictions. The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based on reasonable estimate of whether additional tax will be due. Where uncertainty exists around the Group's tax position, appropriate provisions are provided based on the technical assessment of the cases. Where the \u0234 nal tax outcome of these positions is di \u038d erent from the provision provided, the di \u038d erences will impact the income tax and deferred tax balances in the period in which the \u0234 nal tax is determined. Note 22 provides details of the Group's deferred tax assets/ liabilities.\n\n## 4.

Stage 2 exposures are also measured on lifetime basis\n\n## Sensitivity of ECL\n\nThe Group assessed ECL sensitivity for the wholesale and retail portfolios to changes in the allocation of exposures between Stages 1 and 2. ECL b is estimated to reduce by $804 million (2021: $1,187 million) should all the exposures in Stage 2 return to Stage 1 and were assigned a lower b 12-month ECL instead of lifetime ECL. b The impact also re \u0235 ects the higher PDs ascribed to Stage 2 exposures in addition to the recognition of b lifetime b instead of 12-month ECL.\n\nAs ECL estimation relies on multiple variables, no single analysis can fully demonstrate the sensitivity of the ECL to changes in macroeconomic variables.\n\n## 12.

The credit risk associated with favourable contracts is reduced by a master netting arrangement to the extent that if an event of default occurs, all amounts with the counterparty are settled on a net basis. Master netting arrangements do not result in an o \u038d set of \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as the legal right to o \u038d set the transactions is conditional upon default.\n\nThese agreements include derivative master agreements (including the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement), global master repurchase agreements and global securities lending agreements. The collaterals received and pledged under these agreements are generally conducted under terms that are in accordance with normal market practice. The agreements may allow rehypothecation of collateral received and there may be ongoing margin requirements to mitigate counterparty risk.\n\nThe disclosures set out in the tables below pertain to \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities that are not o \u038d set in the Group's balance sheet but are subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements that cover similar \u0234 nancial instruments. The disclosures enable the understanding of both the gross and net amounts, as well as provide additional information on how such credit risk is mitigated.\n\n|                               | The Group                    | The Group                   | The Group    | The Group                                        | The Group                                        | The Group    |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n|                               | Carrying                     | Not subject to  enforceable |              | Related amounts not o \u038d  set b on  balance sheet | Related amounts not o \u038d  set b on  balance sheet |              |\n| In $ millions                 | amounts  on b balance  sheet | netting  agreement          | Net  amounts | Financial  instruments                           | Financial collateral  received/ pledged          | Net  amounts |\n| 2022                          |                              |                             |              |                                                  |                                                  |              |\n| Financial Assets              |                              |                             |              |                                                  |                                                  |              |\n| Derivatives                   | 44,935                       | 6,751 (a)                   | 38,184       | 32,084 (a)                                       | 2,744                                            | 3,356        |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements | 36,289 (b)                   | -

Financial Assets Pledged or Transferred\n\nThe Group pledges or transfers \u0234 nancial assets to third parties in the ordinary course of business. Transferred assets continue to be recognised in the Group's \u0234 nancial statements when the Group retains substantially all their risks and rewards. Among these, as set out below, are securities pledged or transferred pursuant to repurchase or securities lending or collateral swap agreements and for derivative transactions under credit support agreements.\n\nThere were no derecognised assets that were subject to the Group's partial continuing involvement as at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021.\n\n## Securities and Certi \u0234 cates of deposit\n\nSecurities transferred under repurchase, securities lending and collateral swap arrangements are generally conducted under terms in line with normal market practice. The counterparty is typically allowed to sell or re-pledge the securities but has an obligation to return them at maturity. If b the b securities decrease in value, the Group may, in certain circumstances, be required to place additional collateral.\n\nFor repurchase agreements, the securities pledged or transferred continue to be recorded on the balance sheet while cash received in exchange is b recorded as a \u0234 nancial liability. The Group also pledges assets to secure its short position in securities and to facilitate settlement operations. The b fair value of the associated liabilities approximates their carrying amount of $9,020 million (2021: $4,488 million), which are recorded under 'Due b to b banks', 'Deposits and balances from customers' and 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet.\n\nFor securities lending and collateral swap transactions, the securities lent continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. As the Group mainly receives other \u0234 nancial assets in exchange, the associated liabilities are not recorded on the balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, the Group also pledges securities for derivative transactions under credit support agreements. These assets continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. As the related derivative assets and liabilities are managed on a portfolio basis, there is no direct relationship between the securities pledged and the associated liabilities. As such, the associated liabilities are not disclosed.\n\n| In $ millions                                      | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Financial assets pledged or transferred            |        |        |\n| Singapore government securities and treasury bills | 2,773  | 2,092  |\n| Other government securities and treasury bills     | 7,339  | 4,327  |\n| Bank and corporate debt securities                 | 2,641  | 1,407  |\n| Equity securities                                  | 1,232  | 42     |\n| Certi \u0234  cates of deposit                          | 504    | 563    |\n| Total                                              | 14,489 | 8,431  |\n\n## Covered bonds\n\nPursuant to the Bank's Global Covered Bond Programme, selected pools of residential mortgages originated by the Bank have been assigned to a bankruptcy-remote structured entity, Bayfront Covered Bonds Pte Ltd (see Notes 23.2 and 31.4). b These residential mortgages continue to be recognised on the Bank's balance sheet as the Bank remains exposed to the risks and rewards associated with them.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the carrying value of the covered bonds in issue was $7,575 million (2021: $5,689 million), while the carrying value of assets assigned was $16,740 million (2021: $9,237 million). b The di \u038d erence in values is attributable to an intended over-collateralisation required to b maintain the credit ratings of the covered bonds in issue, and additional assets assigned to facilitate future issuances.",

As a non-controlling shareholder, the Group's ability to receive dividends is subject to agreement with other shareholders. b The associates and joint ventures may also be subject to statutory, contractual or regulatory requirements restricting dividend payments or to repay loans or advances made.\n\n## 25. Unconsolidated Structured Entities\n\n'Unconsolidated structured entities' are structured entities, as de \u0234 ned by SFRS(I) 12, that are not controlled by the Group. In the normal course of business, the Group enters into transactions with these structured entities to facilitate customer transactions and for speci \u0234 c investment opportunities.\n\nWhile the economic exposures may be the same as those to other types of entities, SFRS(I) 12 speci \u0234 cally requires companies to disclose such exposures arising from transactions with unconsolidated structured entities. The table below re \u0235 ects exposures to third party securitisation structures where the Group holds an interest in the normal course of business.\n\nAs is the case with other types of counterparties, the carrying amount from transactions with unconsolidated structured entities have been included in the Group's \u0234 nancial statements.\n\nThe risks arising from such transactions are subject to the Group's risk management practices.\n\nThe table below represents the Group's maximum exposure to loss which for on-balance sheet assets and liabilities is represented by the carrying amount, and does not re \u0235 ect mitigating e \u038d ects from the availability of netting arrangements and \u0234 nancial instruments that the Group may utilise to economically hedge the risks inherent in third party structured entities, or risk-reducing e \u038d ects of collateral or other credit enhancements.\n\n|                                 | The Group   | The Group   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                   | 2022        | 2021        |\n| Derivatives                     | 25          | 6           |\n| Corporate securities            | 4,017       | 3,704       |\n| Loans and advances to customers | -           | 9           |\n| Other assets                    | 3           | 2           |\n| Total assets                    | 4,045       | 3,721       |\n| Commitments                     | 799         | 549         |\n| Maximum exposure to loss        | 4,844       | 4,270       |\n| Derivatives                     | 244         | 108         |\n| Total liabilities               | 244         | 108         |\n\nSFRS(I) 12 also requires additional disclosures where the Group acts as a sponsor to unconsolidated structured entities. The Group is deemed a sponsor of a structured entity if it plays a key role in establishing the entity, and has an on-going involvement with the structured entity or if the Group's name appears in the structured entity's name.\n\nThere are certain investment funds where the Group is the fund manager and the investors have no or limited removal rights over the fund manager. These funds are primarily subscribed by the investors. As of 31 December 2022, the Group did not hold any investment in these investment funds. The table below summarises the Group's involvement in the funds.\n\n|                                                          |   The Group |   The Group |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                                            |        2022 |        2021 |\n| Total assets of the sponsored structured entities        |         476 |         452 |\n| Fee income earned from the sponsored structured entities |           8 |           4 |\n\n## 26.   Acquisitions\n\n## 26.1 Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Limited\n\nThe Group announced on 20 April 2021 that it had entered into an agreement and have obtained approvals from Monetary Authority of Singapore and China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, Shenzhen O \u025d ce to subscribe for a 13% stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Limited ('SZRCB') for CNY 5.3 billion ($1.1 billion) ('the Investment').The purchase consideration was adjusted to CNY 5.2 billion ($1.1 b billion) following the dividend distribution of CNY 10 cents per share by SZRCB in May 2021.\n\nThe Investment is classi \u0234 ed as an associate and applies the equity method of accounting. The Group is able to exercise signi \u0234 cant in \u0235 uence over the b \u0234 nancial and operating policy decision through board representation.\n\nThe transaction was completed in October 2021 and a gain of $104 million was recognised, being the excess of the Group's share of the net fair value of the identi \u0234 able assets and liabilities over the cost of investment. The gain is included in share of pro \u0234 ts or losses of associates during the year. The Investment is in line with the Group's strategy of investing in its core markets and accelerates its expansion in the rapidly growing Greater b Bay Area.\n\n## 26.2 Consumer banking business of Citigroup Inc ('Citi') in Taiwan\n\nThe Group announced on 28 January 2022 that it had agreed to acquire the consumer banking business of Citi in Taiwan ('Citi Consumer Taiwan') via b a transfer of assets and liabilities, and will pay Citi cash for the net assets of Citi Consumer Taiwan plus a premium capped at $966 million (TWD b 22.1 billion). The acquisition is in line with the Group's strategy to scale up its investment and accelerates its expansion in Taiwan.\n\nCompletion of the proposed acquisition is subject to customary regulatory and migration conditions. Subject to the timing of satisfying these conditions, completion and migration is tentatively set to be around third quarter of 2023.",

Goodwill and Intangibles\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's goodwill and intangibles arising from business acquisitions are as follows:\n\n|                              | The Group   | The Group   |\n|------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                | 2022        | 2021        |\n| DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited | 4,631       | 4,631       |\n| Others                       | 709         | 731         |\n| Total                        | 5,340       | 5,362       |\n\nGoodwill is reviewed on an annual basis or when indicators of impairment exist.\n\nThe more material goodwill at the Group relates to DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited's franchise. The recoverable value of the franchise is determined based on a value-in-use calculation. The CGU's \u0234 ve-year projected free cash \u0235 ows, after taking into account the maintenance of capital adequacy requirements at target levels, are discounted by its cost of capital to derive its present value. To derive the value beyond the \u0234 fth year, a long-term growth rate is imputed to the \u0234 fth-year cash \u0235 ow and then discounted by the cost of capital to derive the terminal value. The long-term growth rate used does not exceed the historical long-term growth rate of the market the CGU operates in. The recoverable value is the sum of the present value of the \u0234 ve-year cash \u0235 ows and the terminal value.\n\nA growth rate of 3.5% (2021: 3.5%) and discount rate of 9.0% (2021: 9.0%) were assumed in the value-in-use calculation for DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited's franchise.\n\nThe process of evaluating goodwill impairment involves management judgement and prudent estimates of various factors including future cash \u0235 ows as well as the cost of capital and long-term growth rates. The results can be highly sensitive to the assumptions used. Key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of the CGU, including growth rate and discount rate, are tested for sensitivity by applying a reasonably possible change to those assumptions. The reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not result in an impairment of goodwill as at 31 b December 2022.\n\n## 29.

Financial Derivatives\n\n## 37.1 Trading derivatives\n\nMost of the Group's derivatives relate to sales and trading activities. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivatives to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities are entered into principally for dealer's margin or for the purpose of generating a pro \u0234 t from short-term \u0235 uctuations in price.\n\nTrading includes mainly market-making and warehousing to facilitate customer orders. Market-making involves quoting bid and o \u038d er prices to other market participants with the intention of generating revenues based on spread and volume. Warehousing involves holding on to positions in order to liquidate in an orderly fashion with timing of unwinding determined by market conditions and traders' views of markets as they evolve.\n\n## 37.2 Hedging derivatives\n\nThe accounting treatment of hedging derivatives varies according to the nature of the hedge and whether the hedge meets the speci \u0234 ed criteria to qualify for hedge accounting. Derivatives transacted for economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting are treated in the same way as derivative instruments held for trading purposes. Please refer to Note 39 for more details on derivatives used for hedging.\n\nThe following table summarises the contractual or underlying principal amounts of derivative \u0234 nancial instruments held or issued for trading and hedging purposes outstanding at balance sheet date.

        "page_content": "## 38. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nIn March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the dates on which LIBOR would be discontinued. All GBP, CHF, EUR, JPY London Interbank O \u038d ered Rate (LIBOR) settings and the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings would lose representativeness or discontinue after 31 December 2021. The remaining USD LIBOR settings would lose representativeness or discontinue after 30 June 2023. In Singapore, as announced by the Steering Committee for SOR & SIBOR Transition to SORA (SC-STS) on 31 March 2021, Singapore Swap O \u038d er Rate (SOR), which relies on USD LIBOR in its computation, would similarly be discontinued immediately after 30 June 2023 across all settings. The Singapore Interbank O \u038d ered Rate (SIBOR) would discontinue by end-2024, with 6-month SIBOR being discontinued immediately after 31 March 2022.\n\nThe Group's main interest rate benchmark exposures are USD LIBOR, SOR and SIBOR. USD LIBOR will be replaced by USD Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) while the replacement benchmark rate for SOR and SIBOR is Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA).\n\n## Changes in contractual cash \u0235 ows of \u0234 nancial instruments\n\nDuring the year, the Group continued to apply the practical expedients provided in SFRS(I) 9. These expedients require changes in the contractual cash \u0235 ows of \u0234 nancial instruments that result solely from IBOR reform and are economically equivalent to be accounted for by updating the e \u038d ective interest rate, rather than recognising an immediate gain or loss in the income statement.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nDuring the year, the Group continued to apply SFRS (I) 9's hedge accounting reliefs relating to Interest Rate Benchmark Reform.\n\nThe key assumption made when performing hedge accounting is that both the hedged item and hedging instrument will be amended from existing IBORs to new Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs) at the same time. Where actual di \u038d erences between those dates arise, hedge ine \u038d ectiveness will be recorded in the income statement.\n\n## How the Group is managing the transition to ARRs\n\nA Group steering committee was established in 2019 to manage the impact of IBOR reform on the Group. The committee comprises senior representatives from Institutional Banking Group, Consumer Banking Group, Treasury Markets, Finance, Risk Management Group, Technology & Operations, Legal and Compliance and Group Strategic Marketing and Communications and is chaired by the Corporate Treasurer. The Terms of Reference of the committee are to review transition plans related to LIBOR and SOR discontinuation, SIBOR reform and other interest rate benchmark reform, to assess the Group's key risks across di \u038d erent scenarios, and to develop strategies to manage existing and new business in the context of these risks. Oversight of IBOR reform is provided by the Group Executive Committee and the Board Risk Management Committee.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, changes required to systems, processes and models have been identi \u0234 ed and have been substantially implemented. All contracts with interest rates that are pegged to GBP, CHF, EUR, JPY LIBOR or one-week and two-month tenors for USD LIBOR have been remediated. For contracts referencing SOR, SIBOR or the remaining USD LIBOR settings, the Group has begun its communication with relevant counterparties and contract remediation is ongoing.\n\nThe Group has identi \u0234 ed that the risks arising from IBOR reform are:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk of contractual disputes arising from the lack of legal clauses catering for the discontinuation of an interest rate benchmark, and its replacement with an ARR, or such clauses failing to operate as expected; and\n- \u00b7 Risk of reputational harm due to poor customer management related to interest rate benchmark discontinuation, leading to loss of b customer business.\n\nThese risks are mitigated through robust oversight by the Group steering committee. The Group will continue to identify and assess risks associated with IBOR reform.\n\n## Exposures impacted by IBOR reform\n\nThe table below provides an overview of signi \u0234 cant IBOR-related exposure by interest rate benchmarks.\n\n- \u00b7 The exposures disclosed are for positions with contractual maturities after the announced IBOR cessation dates (a)\n\n.\n\n- \u00b7 Non-derivative \u0234 nancial instruments are presented on the basis of their gross carrying amounts.\n- \u00b7 Derivative \u0234 nancial instruments are presented by using their notional contract amounts and where derivatives have both pay and receive legs with exposure to IBOR reform, such as cross currency swaps, the notional contract amount is disclosed for both legs. As at 31 December 2022, there was $13,001 million (2021: $13,513 million) of cross currency swaps where both the pay and receive legs are impacted by IBOR reform.\n\n|                                            | The Group   | The Group   | The Group   | The Group   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                              | SGD  SOR    | SGD  SIBOR  | USD  LIBOR  | Total       |\n| 2022                                       |             |             |             |             |\n| Non-derivative  \u0234  nancial assets (b)      | 10,316      | 5,723       | 21,677      | 37,716      |\n| Non-derivative  \u0234  nancial liabilities (c) | 254         | -           | 1,010       | 1,264       |\n| Derivatives (notional)                     | 49,907      | -           | 388,718     | 438,625     |\n| Of which: hedging derivatives (d)          | 125         | -           | 2,903       | 3,028       |\n| 2021                                       |             |             |             |             |\n| Non-derivative  \u0234  nancial assets (b)      | 20,606      | 8,234       | 25,272      | 54,112      |\n| Non-derivative  \u0234  nancial liabilities (c) | 256         | -           | 1,018       | 1,274       |\n| Derivatives (notional)                     | 51,312      | -           | 376,816     | 428,128     |\n| Of which: hedging derivatives (d)          | 125         | -           | 3,791       | 3,916       |\n\n## 39.   Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group enters into hedging transactions to manage exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks. Hedge accounting is applied to minimise volatility in earnings arising from changes in interest rate and foreign exchange rates.\n\nPlease refer to Risk Management section for more information on market risk and the Group's risk management practices and Note 2.19 for the Group's accounting policy for hedge accounting.\n\n## 39.1 Fair value hedge\n\nIn accordance with the risk management strategy in place, the Group enters into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates on the fair value of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 issued \u0234 xed rate debt;\n- \u00b7 \u0234 xed rate bonds; and\n- \u00b7 exposures to corporate loans.\n\nIn such instances, the Group hedges the benchmark interest rate risk component which is an observable and reliably measurable component of interest rate risk. Speci \u0234 cally, the Group has designated fair value hedge relationships, on a hedge-by-hedge basis, to hedge against movements in the benchmark interest rate. This e \u038d ectively results in the recognition of interest expense (for \u0234 xed rate liabilities), or interest income (for \u0234 xed rate assets) at \u0235 oating rates. The Group also uses cross currency swaps when there is a need to hedge both interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\n\nFor risks not covered by hedge accounting, the Group manages these in accordance with its risk management strategy.\n\nThe Group assesses prospective hedge e \u038d ectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of the hedged item resulting from movements in the benchmark interest rate with the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps used to hedge the exposure. The Group determines the hedge ratio by comparing the notional of the derivative with the principal of the debt issued or the bond asset purchased, or the loan granted.\n\nThe Group has identi \u0234 ed the following possible sources of ine \u038d ectiveness:\n\n- \u00b7 the use of derivatives as a protection against interest rate risk creates an exposure to the derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not o \u038d set by the hedged item. This risk is minimised by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties;\n- \u00b7 the use of di \u038d erent discounting curves when measuring the fair value of the hedged items and hedging instruments. For derivatives, the discounting curve used depends on collateralisation and the type of collateral used; and\n- \u00b7 di \u038d erence in the timing of settlement of hedging instruments and hedged items.",

        "page_content": "The Group typically uses foreign currency denominated borrowings/ deposits to fund its investments in non-SGD denominated FVOCI equity instruments. To reduce the accounting mismatch on the borrowings/ deposits and FVOCI equity instruments because of foreign exchange rate movements, the Group designates the borrowings/ deposits as the hedging instruments in fair value hedges of the FVOCI equity instruments. The b hedge ratio is determined by comparing the principal of the borrowings/ deposits with the investment costs of the FVOCI equity instruments.

These are applied on a hedge-by-hedge basis or portfolio basis, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 For cash \u0235 ows from assets subject to repricing or reinvestment risk, a portfolio cash \u0235 ow hedge relationship is designated using interest rate swaps. A dynamic process is applied for this hedge as the portfolio composition can change e.g. due to maturities and new originations. The portfolio cash \u0235 ow hedge relationship e \u038d ectively extends the duration of the assets, such that the interest cash \u0235 ows are transformed from a \u0235 oating rate basis to a b \u0234 xed rate basis.\n- \u00b7 Foreign currency forwards and swaps are used to hedge against variability in future cash \u0235 ows arising from USD-denominated interest income, and to hedge against foreign exchange movements arising from a portfolio of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Cross currency swaps are used to mitigate the risk of \u0235 uctuation of coupon and principal cash \u0235 ows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates of issued foreign currency debt and foreign currency bonds.\n- \u00b7 Bond forwards are used to reduce exposures to foreign currency bonds.\n\nFor risks not covered by hedge accounting, the Group manages these in accordance with its risk management strategy.\n\nThe Group assesses hedge e \u038d ectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative re \u0235 ecting the terms of the hedged item due to movements in the hedged risk with the changes in fair value of the derivatives used to hedge the exposure.\n\nThe Group determines the hedge ratio by comparing the notional of the derivatives with the assets subject to repricing/ reinvestment/ re \u0234 nancing risk or amount of forecast earnings denominated in foreign currency or the principal of the debt securities issued or purchased foreign currency bonds.\n\nThe Group has identi \u0234 ed the following possible sources of ine \u038d ectiveness in its cash \u0235 ow hedge relationships:\n\n- \u00b7 the use of derivatives as a protection against currency and interest rate risk creates an exposure to the derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not o \u038d set by the hedged item. This risk is minimised by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties;\n- \u00b7 di \u038d erence in tenor of hedged items and hedging instruments;\n- \u00b7 di \u038d erence in timing of settlement of the hedging instrument and hedged item; and\n- \u00b7 designation of o \u038d -market hedging instruments.\n\nThe following table sets out the maturity pro \u0234 le of the hedging instruments used in cash \u0235 ow hedges. The amounts shown in the table re \u0235 ect the notional amounts of derivatives.

The Group regularly reviews its hedging strategy, taking into account the long-term outlook of currency fundamentals and the impact of \u0235 uctuations in foreign exchange rates on capital adequacy ratios.\n\nThe table below analyses the currency exposure of the Group by functional currency.\n\n| In $ millions    | Net  investments  in foreign  operations (a)   | The Group Financial  instruments  which hedge  the net  investments   | Remaining  unhedged  currency  exposures   |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 2022             |                                                |                                                                       |                                            |\n| Hong Kong dollar | 10,262                                         | 4,451                                                                 | 5,811                                      |\n| US dollar (b)    | 9,331                                          | 5,706                                                                 | 3,625                                      |\n| Chinese yuan     | 4,277                                          | 269                                                                   | 4,008                                      |\n| Taiwan dollar    | 1,954                                          | 1,842                                                                 | 112                                        |\n| Others           | 5,618                                          | -                                                                     | 5,618                                      |\n| Total            | 31,442                                         | 12,268                                                                | 19,174                                     |\n| 2021             |                                                |                                                                       |                                            |\n| Hong Kong dollar | 9,934                                          | 2,298                                                                 | 7,636                                      |\n| US dollar (b)    | 9,829                                          | 6,150                                                                 | 3,679                                      |\n| Chinese yuan     | 4,424                                          | 296                                                                   | 4,128                                      |\n| Taiwan dollar    | 2,190                                          | 684                                                                   | 1,506                                      |\n| Others           | 4,276                                          | -                                                                     | 4,276                                      |\n| Total            | 30,653                                         | 9,428                                                                 | 21,225                                     |\n\nPlease refer to Note 35 for information on the foreign currency translation reserves.

Share-based Compensation Plans\n\nAs part of the Group's remuneration policy, the Group provides various share-based compensation plans to foster a culture that aligns employees' interests with shareholders', enable employees to share in the Group's performance and enhance talent retention.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Main Scheme/ Plan                                                                                                                                        | Note   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| DBSH Share Plan (Share Plan)                                                                                                                             |        |\n| \u00b7  The Share Plan is granted to Group executives as determined by the committee appointed to administer the Share Plan  ('Committee') from time to time. | 40.1   |\n\n- \u00b7 Participants are awarded shares of the Company or, at the Committee's discretion, their equivalent cash value or a combination.\n- \u00b7 Awards consist of main award and retention award (20%/ 15% of main award) for employees on bonus/ sales incentive plans respectively. Dividends on unvested shares do not accrue to employees.\n- \u00b7 For employees on bonus plan, the main award vests from 2 to 4 years after grant i.e. 33% will vest 2 years after grant; another 33% will vest on the third year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will vest 4 years after grant.\n- \u00b7 For employees on sales incentive plan, the main award vests from 1 to 3 years after grant; i.e. 33% will vest 1 year after grant, another 33% will vest on the second year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will vest 3 years after grant.\n- \u00b7 Top performers and key employees are also awarded shares as part of talent retention. There are no additional retention awards for such shares granted. The shares are subject to the usual four-year vesting schedule.\n- \u00b7 The awards will lapse immediately upon termination of employment, except in the event of ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.\n- \u00b7 The market price of shares on the grant date is used to estimate the fair value of the shares awarded. The fair value of the shares granted includes an adjustment to exclude the present value of future expected dividends to be paid during the vesting period.\n- \u00b7 Vested and unvested shares are subject to clawback/ malus. Conditions that trigger such clawback/ malus are in the Remuneration Report section of the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 Shares are awarded to non-executive Directors as part of director's remuneration. Details of these awards are disclosed in b the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report.\n\nThe Directors reviewed the changes to the vesting schedule and retention award percentage on 5 December 2022. This includes a revision to the share and cash deferral proportions for Senior Management and Material Risk Personnel to be in line with regulatory and market practices. The changes will apply to the shares grant in 2023 and do not impact the 2022 \u0234 nancial statements.\n\n## DBSH Employee Share Plan (ESP)\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee has ceased granting shares under the ESP e \u038d ective from \u0234 nancial year 2018 remuneration. All outstanding ESP share grants have fully vested in 2022.\n\n## DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP)\n\n- \u00b7 The ESPP was implemented in 2019 in selective markets across the Group. All permanent employees who hold the rank of b Vice President and below are eligible to participate in the scheme.\n- \u00b7 The ESPP is a share ownership plan for eligible employees to own DBSH shares through monthly contributions via deductions from payroll or designated bank accounts.\n- \u00b7 Participants contribute up to 10% of month salary (minimum S$50, capped at S$1,000) and the Group will match 25% of the b participant's contributions to buy DBSH ordinary shares for a period of 12 months during each plan year.\n- \u00b7 The matching shares bought from the Group's contribution will vest 24 months after the last contribution month for each b plan year.\n- \u00b7 The matching shares will lapse immediately upon termination of employment, except in the event of ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.\n\n40.1\n\n40.2",

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\n## 42.1 Valuation Process\n\nThe valuation processes within the Group are governed by the Valuation Policy, which is approved by the Board Audit Committee.\n\nThe Valuation Policy applies to all \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, covering both market prices as well as model inputs. Financial assets and liabilities are marked directly using reliable and independent quoted market prices where available or by using reliable and independent market parameters (as model inputs) in conjunction with a valuation model.\n\nValuation models go through an assurance process carried out by the Risk Management Group (RMG), independent of the model developers. b This assurance process covers the review of the underlying methodology including its logic and conceptual soundness together with the model inputs and outputs. Model assurances are conducted prior to implementation and subject to regular review or when there are signi \u0234 cant changes arising from market or portfolio changes. b Where b necessary, the Group also imposes model reserves and b other adjustments in determining fair value. b Models are approved by the Group Market and Liquidity Risk Committee (GMLRC).\n\nA process of independent price veri \u0234 cation (IPV) is in place to establish the accuracy of the market parameters used when the marking is performed by the Front O \u025d ce. The IPV process entails independent checks to compare traders' marks to independent sources such as broker/ dealer quotes or market consensus providers.\n\nWhere market parameters are sourced independently for the marking of b \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities, or used as inputs into a valuation model, these are checked for reliability and accuracy, for example by reviewing large daily movements or by referencing other similar sources, or transactions.\n\nValuation adjustments and reserves are taken to account for closeout costs, model and market parameter uncertainty, and any other factor that may a \u038d ect valuations. Valuation adjustment and reserve methodologies are approved by the GMLRC and governed by the Valuation Policy.\n\nThe valuation adjustments and reserves include but are not limited to:\n\n## Model and Parameter Uncertainty Adjustments\n\nValuation uncertainties may occur during fair value measurement either due to uncertainties in the required input parameters or uncertainties in the modelling methods used in the valuation process. In such situations, adjustments may be necessary to take these factors into account.\n\nFor example, where market data such as prices or rates for an instrument are no longer observable after an extended period of time, these inputs used to value the \u0234 nancial instruments may no longer be relevant in the current market conditions. In such situations, adjustments may be necessary to address the pricing uncertainty arising from the use of stale market data inputs.\n\n## Credit Valuation Adjustments\n\nCredit valuation adjustments are taken to re \u0235 ect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk. Credit valuation adjustments are based upon the creditworthiness of the counterparties, magnitude of the current or potential exposure on the underlying transactions, netting and collateral arrangements, and the maturity of the underlying transactions.\n\n## Funding Valuation Adjustments\n\nFunding valuation adjustments represent an estimate of the adjustment to fair value that a market participant would make in incorporating funding costs and bene \u0234 ts that arise in relation to uncollateralised derivatives positions.\n\n## Day 1 Pro \u0234 t or Loss (P&L) Reserve\n\nIn situations where the market for an instrument is not active and its fair value is established using a valuation model based on signi \u0234 cant unobservable market parameters, the Day 1 P&L arising from the di \u038d erence in transacted price and end-of-day model valuation is set aside as reserves. A market parameter is de \u0234 ned as being signi \u0234 cant when its impact on the Day 1 P&L is greater than an internally determined threshold. The Day 1 P&L reserve is released to the income statement when the parameters become observable or when the transaction is closed out or amortised over the duration of the transaction. At year end, the unamortised Day 1 P&L was not material.\n\n## Bid-O \u038d er Adjustments\n\nThe Group often holds, at varying points in time, both long or short b positions in \u0234 nancial instruments which are valued using midmarket levels. Bid-o \u038d er adjustments are then made to account for close-out costs.\n\n## 42.2 Fair Value Hierarchy\n\nThe fair value hierarchy accords the highest level to observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest level to unobservable inputs. The fair value measurement of each \u0234 nancial instrument is categorised in accordance with the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the input with the lowest level that is signi \u0234 cant to the entire measurement. If unobservable inputs are deemed signi \u0234 cant, the \u0234 nancial instrument will be categorised as Level 3.\n\nFinancial instruments that are valued using quoted prices in active markets are classi \u0234 ed as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. These would include government and sovereign securities, listed equities and corporate debt securities which are actively traded. Derivatives contracts which are traded in an active exchange market are also classi \u0234 ed as Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\n\nWhere fair value is determined using quoted market prices in less active markets or quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, such instruments are generally classi \u0234 ed as Level 2. In cases where quoted prices are generally not available, the Group will determine the fair value based on valuation techniques that use market parameters as inputs including but not limited to yield curves, volatilities and foreign exchange rates. The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data so that reliability of the fair value measurement is high. These would include corporate debt securities, repurchase, reverse repurchase agreements and most of the Group's over-thecounter (OTC) derivatives.\n\nThe Group classi \u0234 es \u0234 nancial instruments as Level 3 when there is reliance on unobservable market parameters whether used directly to value a \u0234 nancial asset or liability, or used as inputs to a valuation model, attributing to a signi \u0234 cant contribution to the instrument value. These would include all input parameters which are derived from historical data, for example, asset correlations or certain volatilities. Level 3 instruments also include unquoted equity securities which are measured based on the net asset value of the investments. In addition, Level 3 inputs include all stale quoted security prices and other approximations (e.g. bonds valued using credit default swap spreads).",

As the Group does not hedge changes in own credit risk arising from \u0234 nancial liabilities, presenting the own credit movements within other comprehensive income does not create or increase an accounting mismatch in the income statement.\n\nThe change in fair value attributable to changes in own credit risk has been determined as the amount of change in fair value that is attributable to changes in funding spreads above benchmark interest rates. Fair value changes arising from factors other than the Group's own credit risk are b insigni \u0234 cant.\n\nThe cumulative amounts attributable to changes in own credit risk for these \u0234 nancial liabilities as at 31 December 2022 was a gain of $66 million (2021: loss of $49 million).\n\nRealised losses attributable to changes in own credit risk as at 31 December 2022 was a loss of $22 million (2021: loss of $22 million).\n\n## 42.4 Financial assets & liabilities not carried at fair value\n\nFor \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value in the \u0234 nancial statements, the Group has ascertained that their fair values were not materially di \u038d erent from their carrying amounts at year-end.\n\nFor cash and balances with central banks, due from banks, loans and advances to customers, as well as due to banks and deposits and balances from customers, the basis of arriving at fair values is by discounting cash \u0235 ows using the relevant market interest rates for the respective currencies.\n\nFor investment debt securities, subordinated term debts and other debts issued, fair values are determined based on independent market quotes, where available. Where market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash \u0235 ow method.\n\nThe fair value of variable interest-bearing as well as short-term \u0234 nancial instruments accounted for at amortised cost is assumed to be approximated by their carrying amounts.",

Credit Risk\n\n## 43.1 Maximum exposure to credit risk\n\nThe following table shows the exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and o \u038d -balance sheet \u0234 nancial instruments, before taking into account any collateral held, other credit enhancements and netting arrangements. For on-balance sheet \u0234 nancial assets, the maximum credit exposure is the carrying amounts. For contingent liabilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the amount the Group would have to pay if the instrument is b called upon. For undrawn facilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the undrawn credit facilities granted to customers.\n\n| In $ millions                                                 | 2022    | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| On-balance sheet                                              |         |         |\n| Cash and balances with central banks (excluding cash on hand) | 51,650  | 54,237  |\n| Government securities and treasury bills                      | 64,995  | 53,262  |\n| Due from banks                                                | 60,131  | 51,377  |\n| Derivatives                                                   | 44,935  | 19,681  |\n| Bank and corporate debt securities                            | 62,667  | 53,788  |\n| Loans and advances to customers                               | 414,519 | 408,993 |\n| Other assets (excluding deferred tax assets)                  | 17,416  | 15,268  |\n|                                                               | 716,313 | 656,606 |\n\n## O \u038d -balance sheet\n\n| Contingent liabilities and commitments (excluding capital commitments)   | 403,937   | 366,031   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total                                                                    | 1,120,250 | 1,022,637 |\n\nThe Group's exposures to credit risk, measured using the expected gross credit exposures that will arise upon a default of the end obligor are as shown in the Group's Pillar 3 Disclosures (unaudited). These exposures, which include both on-balance sheet and o \u038d -balance sheet \u0234 nancial instruments, are shown without taking into account any collateral held or netting arrangements.\n\n## Analysis of Collateral\n\nWhilst the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the assets or, in the case of o \u038d -balance sheet instruments, the amount guaranteed, committed, accepted or endorsed, the likely exposure may be lower due to o \u038d setting collateral, credit guarantees and other actions taken to mitigate the Group's exposure.\n\nThe description of collateral for each class of \u0234 nancial asset is set out below.\n\n## Balances with central banks, Government securities and treasury bills, Due from banks and Bank and corporate debt securities\n\nCollateral is generally not sought for these assets.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Group maintains collateral agreements and enters into master netting agreements with most of the counterparties for derivative transactions. Please refer to Note 37 for the impact of netting arrangements recognised for the computation of Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).\n\n## Loans and advances to customers, Contingent liabilities and commitments\n\nCertain loans and advances to customers, contingent liabilities and commitments are typically collateralised to a substantial extent. In particular, residential mortgage exposures are generally fully secured by residential properties. Income-producing real estate, which is a sub-set of the Specialised Lending exposure, is fully secured by the underlying assets \u0234 nanced.\n\nThe extent to which credit exposures are covered by Basel eligible collateral, besides real estate, after the application of the requisite regulatory haircuts, is shown in the Group's Pillar 3 Disclosures (unaudited). The amounts are a sub-set of the actual collateral arrangements entered by the Group as Basel imposes strict legal and operational standards before collateral can be admitted as credit risk mitigants. As a result, certain collateral arrangements which do not meet its criteria will not be included. Certain collateral types which are not permitted as credit risk mitigants for credit exposures under the Standardised Approach are also excluded.\n\n## 43.2 Loans and advances to customers\n\n|                                 | The Group   | The Group   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                   | 2022        | 2021        |\n| Performing Loans                |             |             |\n| - Neither past due nor impaired | 412,989     | 408,018     |\n| - Past due but not impaired     | 2,536       | 1,764       |\n| Non-Performing Loans (impaired) | 4,759       | 5,290       |\n| Total gross loans               | 420,284     | 415,072     |\n| Pass                            | 411,573     | 405,367     |\n| Special Mention                 | 3,952       | 4,415       |\n| Substandard                     | 2,415       | 2,848       |\n| Doubtful                        | 1,243       | 1,192       |\n| Loss                            | 1,101       | 1,250       |\n| Total gross loans               | 420,284     | 415,072     |\n\n## Non-performing assets (NPAs)\n\n|                                                    | The Group   | The Group   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                                      | 2022        | 2021        |\n| Balance at 1 January                               | 5,849       | 6,686       |\n| Institutional Banking & Others                     |             |             |\n| - New NPAs                                         | 1,157       | 1,006       |\n| - Upgrades                                         | (155)       | (7)         |\n| - Net repayments                                   | (847)       | (1,338)     |\n| - Write-o \u038d  s                                     | (619)       | (533)       |\n| Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management (net movement) | (112)       | (47)        |\n| Exchange di \u038d  erences                             | (148)       | 82          |\n| Balance at 31 December                             | 5,125       | 5,849       |",

Capital Management\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting the Group's capital management objective, which is to maintain a strong capital position consistent with regulatory requirements under the MAS Notice to Banks No. 637 'Notice on Risk Based Capital Adequacy Requirements for Banks Incorporated in Singapore' (MAS Notice 637) and MAS Notice FHC-N637, and the expectations of various stakeholders, including customers, investors and rating agencies. The Board articulates this objective in the form of capital targets. This objective is pursued while delivering returns to shareholders and ensuring that adequate capital resources are available for business growth and investment opportunities as well as adverse situations, taking into consideration the Group's strategic plans and risk appetite.\n\nThe Group's capital management objective is implemented via a capital management and planning process that is overseen by the Capital Committee. The Chief Financial O \u025d cer chairs the Capital Committee. The Capital Committee receives regular updates on the Group's current and projected capital positions. A key tool for capital planning is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) through which the Group assesses its forecast capital supply and demand relative to regulatory requirements and internal capital targets. The ICAAP generally has a three-year horizon and covers various scenarios, including stress scenarios of di \u038d ering scope and severity.\n\nThe Group is subject to and has complied with the capital adequacy requirements set out in the MAS Notice FHC-N637, which e \u038d ects the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital adequacy framework in Singapore, throughout the year. The Group's capital adequacy ratios as at 31 December 2022 and 2021 have been subject to an external limited assurance review, pursuant to the MAS Notice FHC-N609 'Auditor's Report and Additional Information to be submitted with Annual Accounts'.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures (unaudited) published on DBS website (https://www.dbs.com/investors/default.page).",

The amount of \u0234 nancing required for the Company to purchase or acquire\n\nits Ordinary Shares, and the impact on the Company's \u0234 nancial position, cannot be ascertained as at the date of this Notice as these will depend on whether the Ordinary Shares are purchased or acquired out of capital or pro \u0234 ts, the number of Ordinary Shares purchased or acquired and the price at which such Ordinary Shares were purchased or acquired.\n\nBased on the existing issued and paid-up Ordinary Shares as at the Latest Practicable Date and excluding any Ordinary Shares held in treasury, the purchase by the Company of 2% of its issued Ordinary Shares will result in the purchase or acquisition of 51,472,576 Ordinary Shares.\n\nAssuming that the Company purchases or acquires 51,472,576 Ordinary Shares at the Maximum Price, in the case of both market and o \u038d -market purchases, of SGD 37.68 for one Ordinary Share (being the price equivalent to 5% above the average closing prices of the Ordinary Shares traded on the SGXST over the last \u0234 ve market days on which transactions were recorded immediately preceding the Latest Practicable Date), the maximum amount of funds required is approximately SGD 1.9 billion.\n\nThe \u0234 nancial e \u038d ects of the purchase or acquisition of such Ordinary Shares by the Company pursuant to the proposed Share Purchase Mandate on the \u0234 nancial statements of the Group and the Company for the \u0234 nancial year ended 31 December 2022 based on these and other assumptions are set out in paragraph 2.7 of the Letter to Shareholders dated 9 March 2023 (the 'Letter').\n\nPlease refer to the Letter for further details.",
