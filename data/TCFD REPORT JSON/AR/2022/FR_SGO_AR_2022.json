The French version of this Universal Registration Document may be used for the purposes of a public offer of securities or the admission of securities to trading on a regulated market if it is supplemented with a  securities  note  and,  if  required,  a  summary  note,  as  well  as  all  updates  made  to  the  Universal Registration  Document.  The  whole  is  then  approved  by  the AMF  in  accordance  with  (EU)  Regulation No. 2017/1129.\n\nThis English version of the Universal Registration Document cancels and replaces the previous English version posted on the Saint-Gobain website on March 28, 2023 and April 18, 2023. The only changes made in this version are to reflect paragraphs of the French version (which as stated below is the authentic text) that need to be adjusted in the English translations: (i) the text below 'Environment'' (excluding the table) on page 137, (ii) the text below 'Social' (excluding the table) on page 141, (iii) the text below 'Ethics and communities' (excluding the table) on page 147 and (iv) the figures in the column entitled 'Climate change adaptation' of the tables presenting the Taxonomic indicators on pages 390, 392 and 394.\n\nThis English-language version of the Universal Registration Document is a free translation of the original French version of the Universal  Registration  Document  made  available  on  the  Company's  website.  It  is  not  a  binding  document.  In  the  event  of a  conflict  of  interpretation,  reference  should  be  made  to  the  French  version  which  is  the  authentic  text.  The  auditors'  report applies to the French version of the Management Report and the financial statements.",

It is a source of great satisfaction for me and all the members of our Board of Directors, and will reflect on all our stakeholders.\n\nOur performance in 2022 was all the more remarkable that it was achieved in an unsettled market environment , with rising geopolitical risks, inflation - which led to a very sharp rise in energy prices - and disorganized logistics chains. Many congratulations to Benoit Bazin and all teams who have successfully adapted to this new situation! Saint-Gobain's performance was faultless.\n\nAll our financial indicators hit record levels. The Group has clearly shown that it can deliver profitable and sustainable growth. I am delighted that the sharp increase in the dividend will allow our shareholders to share in this success.\n\nIn terms of sustainability, Saint-Gobain is present in ESG (environmental, social, and governance) stock market indices and has obtained certification for its achievements in gender equality, climate\n\n\u00cb\n\n## MESSAGE FROM\n\n## PIERRE-ANDR\u00c9 DE CHALENDAR\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors of Saint-Gobain\n\n'\n\n## THE GROUP HAS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT IT CAN DELIVER PROFITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH.

Over the long term,\n\nthe Group's integrated approach, which incorporates ESG criteria in its analysis of risks and opportunities, is a key part of its business model . Our response to social, societal, and environmental challenges and the recognition of the interests of all our internal and external stakeholders are essential to enable Saint-Gobain to contribute to a low carbon economy, generate performance while using fewer resources, and foster a fairer world. Our directors pay constant attention to this topic in particular. I am proud of the quality, depth, and density of the interaction between the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors , which is the embodiment of effective governance.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our teams around the world . The 168,000 men and women who bring our ambition to life every day are ambassadors of our values. Their unfailing commitment will secure Saint-Gobain's future.\n\nThe Board of Directors is very confident that our Group will achieve its goals and create sustainable value for all its stakeholders.",

'\n\nSaint-Gobain achieved a remarkable financial and non-financial performance in 2022. This performance was driven by the strength of our position as a leader in sustainable construction, the flawless execution and success of our \"Grow & Impact\" strategic plan, our innovation capabilities, our robust country-based operating model and, of course, the talent and commitment of our teams. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them all.\n\nThe figures speak for themselves: sales up 16% from 2021 to \u20ac51.2 billion, a sharp increase in operating income to \u20ac5.3 billion, and a record margin of 10.4%. In four years, our sales have increased by 23%, our operating income by 66% and our operating margin has shown a structural increase, reaching double-digit levels for the second year in a row. Net earnings per share have doubled, and our cash flow generation has tripled. These are all big steps forward, reflecting the company's constant value creation , with a return on capital employed (ROCE) of over 15% in both of the past two years.\n\nThis ability to create value is the result of the Group's profound transformation. We now have an agile, responsive organizational structure , led by local managers in their own countries. We have made far-reaching changes to our scope of activity to strengthen our growth and profitability. Nearly one third of the Group's scope has changed since 2018 with divestments and acquisitions totaling nearly \u20ac13 billion in sales including \u20ac1.9 billion purchased and \u20ac3.8 billion sold in 2022 alone. The creation of a global platform with more than \u20ac5 billion in sales\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin construction chemicals - a key segment for the decarbonization of the sector - is an integral part of this move. While it was historically focused on Europe, Saint-Gobain continued to rebalance its geographic footprint and now generates more than 62% of operating income (2022 pro forma ) in North America (30%) and emerging countries (32%).\n\nSaint-Gobain demonstrates its commitment to sustainability by maximizing the positive impact of its offering - with nearly 75% of sales addressing sustainable development issues and minimizing its environmental footprint , in particular with several pioneering technologies developed in 2022, such as the zero-carbon production of glazing and plasterboard. Saint-Gobain has cut its CO2 emissions by 27% in relation to 2017 levels. Given the strong growth in its business over the same period, this represents a 42% reduction in emissions per euro of sales.\n\nIn 2023, Saint-Gobain is structured to face a volatile business environment where uncertainty has virtually become the norm. Our Group will resolutely continue to implement the strategic priorities of the \"Grow & Impact\" plan by developing its offering to respond to the major challenges facing our planet and humanity , including the climate emergency, the energy crisis, the increasing scarcity of natural resources, and growing urbanization. I am confident that 2023 will be another good year for Saint -Gobain , and that we will create value for all our stakeholders.",

It  quickly expanded into international markets, establishing itself in the United States in 1829, Germany in 1858 (3) , Italy in 1888 and Spain in 1905.\n- \u00b7 In  1970,  the  Group,  which  successfully  overcame  the major  crises  of  the  century  and  invested  heavily  in research and development, withdrew from its chemical activities and merged with Pont-\u00e0-Mousson, created in 1856 and specializing in cast iron pipes.\n- \u00b7 In  1986,  the  privatization  of  Saint -Gobain  -  which  had been nationalized in 1982 - was a huge popular success: 1,500,000 shareholders subscribed to the operation (4) .\n- \u00b7 In  1990,  through  the  acquisition  of  Norton,  the  Group doubled  its  presence  in  the  United  States,  which opened up new markets and enabled it to develop its know-how  in  the  areas  of  abrasives,  plastics  and ceramics.\n- \u00b7 The acquisition of Poliet in 1996 provided the basis for developing  the  distribution  businesses.  Saint -Gobain then  continued  its  acquisitions  in  the  world  of construction material trading.\n- \u00b7 The  acquisition  in  2005  of  British  Plaster  Board,  the world leader in plasterboard, was Saint -Gobain's largest ever. Combined with Isover glass wool and its range of insulation  solutions,  it  made  Saint -Gobain  the  world leader in interior solutions.\n- \u00b7 In 2007, Saint -Gobain focused its strategy on sustainable  housing,  while  continuing  to  serve  many industrial markets and, thanks to its numerous locations, continued to expand in emerging countries.\n- \u00b7 In 2019  and  2020,  the  Group  implemented  its 'Transform & Grow' plan, which aimed at establishing a new organization - by country and by market - and to ensure agile and value-creating portfolio management.\n- \u00b7 In 2020, Saint -Gobain formulated its corporate purpose, 'Making the world a better home' (see below, p. 15).\n- \u00b7 In  2021,  the  acquisition  of  Chryso  turned  Saint -Gobain into a major player in construction chemicals.\n- \u00b7 In  July  2021,  the  Group  changed  its  governance,  with Benoit Bazin succeeding Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar as Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  latter  remaining  Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 In  October  2021,  Saint -Gobain  launched  its  'Grow  & Impact' strategic plan (see section 2.3.1, p. 57).\n- \u00b7 In  September  2022,  the  Group  finalized  its  acquisition of GCP Applied Technologies, a key step in establishing itself as a leader in construction chemicals.\n- \u00b7 At  the  end  of  2022,  Saint -Gobain  is  present  in 75 countries (see section 1.1.3, p. 7).\n\n<!-- image -->",

With this corporate purpose, Saint -Gobain  took  on  its  ambition  to  improve  everyone's  lives  by  making  the  planet  a  fairer,  more  harmonious  and sustainable  living  space.  Through  its  business  model,  generally,  and  with  its  solutions,  specifically,  Saint -Gobain  has  a tangible  impact  on  the  life  of  each  individual,  their  environment,  and  their  way  of  working,  caring  for  themselves  and getting around. The Group's corporate purpose is the link between the infinitely small unit of each person's living space and the infinitely large one of our shared home: the planet.\n\n## MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER HOME : THE MANIFESTO\n\nOur corporate purpose sets the course for our common future. Together with and for our customers, we design, manufacture and distribute materials and solutions that have a positive impact on everyone's life and provide well-being, quality of life and performance, while caring for the planet.\n\nOur corporate purpose reflects who we are. Our 350 years of history, our collective strength and our leadership empower us to pursue our development, by addressing the major challenges facing humanity, namely, climate change, resource protection and the fight against inequality.\n\nWe are both an international and multi-local company, fully integrated into the territories where we operate to support their vitality and help build a fairer and more sustainable, open and engaging world.\n\nOur corporate purpose is a call to action. Our approach is clearly focused on the future. Together with our customers, partners and all our stakeholders, it guides our action to unleash individual and collective aspirations, and enable everyone to live better in the world. It calls on us to innovate openly, with the everrenewed ambition of better uniting humanity and nature for the common good.\n\nOur corporate purpose is based on values that guide us. We carry out our business in compliance with the Principles of Conduct and Action and the humanist values that permeate our corporate culture. Listening, dialog, care, solidarity, trust and respect for difference are central to our commitment.\n\nThis is the profound ambition of our corporate purpose: to act every day to make the world a more beautiful and sustainable place to live.\n\n1\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n7\n\n4\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1",

Formalized  in  2003,  translated  into  31  languages, 5\n\nand distributed to all employees, these principles constitute  an  ethical  reference  applicable  in  action.  They are a condition of belonging to Saint -Gobain. 4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Professional commitment\n\n\u00b7\n\nRespect for others\n\n\u00b7\n\nIntegrity\n\n\u00b7\n\nLoyalty\n\n\u00b7\n\nSolidarity\n\nThese principles of conduct are the fundamental values that unite managers and employees.\n\nThe Principles of Conduct and Action refer explicitly to the applicable conventions of the International Labor Organization  (ILO),  the  International  Charter  on  Human Rights,  the  guidelines  for  multinational  enterprises  of  the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the OECD's convention on the fight against corruption. Saint -Gobain has been signed up to  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  since  2003.  This demonstrates  the  Group's  drive  for  Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR), which includes regular communication  of  its  progress  in  areas  covered  by  the Global Compact.\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  Principles  of  Conduct  and Action is reflected in policies and commitments applied by all  of  its  entities  in  all  countries  in  which  they  operate.\n\n\u00cb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRespect for the law\n\n\u00b7\n\nCaring for the environment\n\n\u00b7\n\nRespect for health and safety at work\n\n\u00b7\n\nRespect for employee rights\n\nThese principles guide the actions of all management and employees in the performance of their duties.\n\nForemost  among  these  commitments  are  the  'reference policies'. These define the management  principles applicable  to  all  Saint -Gobain  entities  and  employees,  as well as to subcontractors in their work for the Group, and suppliers under the Responsible Purchasing policy (see section 3.1.2.B, p. 73).\n\nThis  desire  to  establish  the  Principles  of  Conduct  and Action as a sign of belonging is illustrated by the objective set by the Group's Board of Directors to train all managers on  the  Principles  in  their  first  year  with  the  Group.  In addition,  the  Principles  of  Conduct  and  Action  are included  in  the  welcome  booklets  for  all  Saint -Gobain employees and in most employment contracts (see section 3.1.5.A p. 86).",

        "page_content": "## C - An approach aimed at creating shared value with all of the Group's stakeholders\n\nFor Saint -Gobain, sustainable growth is conceived within its ecosystem, in other words, taking into account the interests of all its stakeholders. It is therefore a question of pursuing a development trajectory that integrates both the financial performance and shareholder value objective (see p. 19 below) as well as the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\n## a.  Embedding CSR at the heart of the business model\n\n## A cross-functional priority\n\nFor  Saint -Gobain,  CSR  is  a  long-term  commitment, necessarily an  integral part of its business  model (see section 1.2.3, p. 20) and permeating all of its activities. It involves a twofold commitment: maximizing the positive contribution  to  climate,  social  and  societal  issues,  and minimizing  the  impact  on  human  beings  and  the environment.  For  the  Group,  this  is  a  process  of continuous development that has been one of its priorities for many years:\n\n- \u00b7 2003:  Saint -Gobain  signs  the  United  Nations  Global Compact  and  adopts  the  Principles  of  Conduct  and Action (see above, p. 16);\n- \u00b7 2009: formalization of the compliance program;\n- \u00b7 2015:  setting  of  ambitious  environmental  targets  for 2025 (reduction of CO2 emissions by 20%, reduction of water  discharges  by  80%,  reduction  of  non-recovered waste  by  50%  compared  to  2010  at  equal  levels  of production);\n- \u00b7 2020: development  of  the  roadmap  to  carbon neutrality by 2050 and formalization of new environmental objectives for 2030.\n\n## A global and local priority\n\nThe cross-functional nature of CSR calls for the systematic integration of ESG (environment, social and governance) criteria into the analyses carried out, the decisions made and the actions taken throughout the organization. At the central  level,  this  is  reflected  in  the  creation  of  a  CSR Committee  within  the  Board  of  Directors.  It  then\n\norchestrates, at the global level, faster implementation of the  CSR  roadmaps  adopted  by  the  entities  at  the  local level .  To  achieve  this,  no  fewer  than  22,000  employees belong  to  more  than  40  internal  CSR  communities.  An internal CO2 price was set in 2016 and revised upwards in October  2021  to  \u20ac75  per  metric  ton  for  investment expenditure, and to \u20ac150 per metric ton for research and development  decisions.  And  lastly,  a  capital  investment budget  of  \u20ac100  million  per  year  has  been  allocated  to initiatives  (including  R&D)  to  reduce  the  Group's  CO2 footprint.\n\nSaint -Gobain's CSR approach must therefore be embodied within all the Group's constituent parts and teams. This is reflected  in  a  wide  variety  of  programs  and  actions worldwide.  The  'Climate  Academy'  at  Saint -Gobain University,  launched  in  November  2021,  added  new training throughout 2022 to take action on the environmental footprint at all levels of the organization.\n\n(6)\n\nIdem.\n\nThese include: 'Improving our individual footprint', 'Building your roadmap to take action', or 'Bringing your supply  chain  into  your  climate  journey'.  It  also  includes new  modules  on  human  resources  and  information systems.\n\n## A Group-wide approach at ecosystem level\n\nFinally,  it  contributes  to  shaping  the  CSR  outlook  for  all business  sectors  in  which  Saint -Gobain  operates.  The Group  collaborates  with  NGOs  and  semi-public  bodies such as EFRAG (5) ;  it  is  also  developing partnerships with other members of its ecosystem, such as the WBCSD (6) ; it increasingly nurtures close relationships with start-ups to leverage open innovation (see section 2.3.4.D, p. 62).\n\n## A differentiating factor\n\nIn terms of CSR, the Group sees this commitment as a real differentiating  factor  compared  to  its  competitors .  The strategic  nature  of  its  approach  means  that  Saint -Gobain enjoys great legitimacy in the fight against climate change, through  the  impact  of  its  solutions  on  reducing  GHG (greenhouse  gas)  emissions  in  the  construction  and mobility  sectors  and  through  its  action  to  reduce emissions  from  its  industrial  processes  and  those  of  its customers.  In  an  environment  where  awareness  of environmental and social issues has increased significantly, the authentic nature of its CSR approach is also a source of appeal in recruitment, a lever for employee commitment, and notable support for the perception of all of  its  brands.  This  commitment  also  counts  on  the commercial side. According to a study conducted in 2022 by  Danish  retailer  Br\u00f8drene  Dahl,  a  Group  brand,  it appears that a significant portion of the brand's customers consider the following criteria  to  be  'important'  or  'very important':  the  possibility  of  finding  eco-labels  and certifications on products (38%), eco-responsible delivery options  (43%),  focus  on  social  responsibility  (45%), sustainable development (45%) and climate (51%).\n\n## Making progress on all six pillars of the Saint -Gobain roadmap\n\nThe  CSR  roadmap  guides  the  Group's  actions  to  reduce the  environmental,  social  and  societal  impact  of  its operations  and  solutions  (see  section  3.1,  p.  72).  It  takes into  account  both  Saint -Gobain's  strategic  commitment and the specific expectations of stakeholders. It performs an educational role, with a view to fostering synergies with its stakeholders. It is based on six pillars and measures the progress  made  through  the  double  prism  of  maximizing the Group's contribution and minimizing its footprint.",

        "page_content": "Highlights of 2022\n\n## 1.3.2 FEEDBACK ON A TRANSFORMATIVE YEAR\n\nIn 2022, Saint -Gobain progressed at a very fast pace, on an ambitious path, the lines of which are defined by its 'Grow  &  Impact'  strategic  plan ,  announced  in  October 2021.  Through  this  plan,  the  aim  is  to  accelerate  the Group's  transformation  into  an  organization  that  is resolutely focused on its customers, capable of providing them with solutions that address the complex issues they\n\nface (see section 2.3.2, p. 57). Key performance indicators show that the results are already on track ,  with  a  more efficient, more agile organization and an optimized profile (\u20ac13 billion in disposals and acquisitions since the start of the  'Transform  &  Grow'  plan);  with  significant  growth  in sales  (+23%  between  2018  and  2022)  and  operating income  (+66%  between  2018  and  2022);  with  a  record cash flow (\u20ac3.8bn); with a two-digit operating margin for the second year in a row (10.4% in 2022); with a continued increase  in  the  net  promoter  score (8) (from  22  to  37 between  2019  and  2022);  and  with  continuous  progress towards  a  more  sustainable  model  thanks  to  a  CO \u2082 emission  reduction  of  -27%  between  2017  and  2022).\n\nThese results are all the more significant given that the context  is  particularly  volatile .  Several  phenomena  are taking  place  at  the  same  time,  calling  into  question  the global  equilibrium:  firstly,  with  the  rise  of  confrontations between  East  and  West,  between  South  and  North, between  democracies  and  illiberal  regimes;  on  the logistical  front,  with  the  disruption  of  supply  chains  and the  surge  in  commodity  prices;  on  the  economic  front, with the return of inflation and recession. These changes have  a  direct  impact  on  the  Group's  business  model, through crucial issues such as consumption, the organization  of  production  and  the  rapid  increase  in energy costs, a distinguishing feature of 2022. The quest for  restraint  in  energy  use,  an  essential  subject  for  the preservation of natural resources as well as the decarbonization of the construction sector, is made even more urgent by the crisis in energy prices. As an industrial group  operating  production  facilities  for  glass,  gypsum, mineral  wools  and  refractory  products,  Saint -Gobain  is naturally a major  energy  consumer.  To  reduce  its consumption,  the  Group  uses  a  range  of  solutions,  from operational  excellence  through  the  WCM  program  (see section  3.1.3.B.a,  p.  77)  to  faster  progress  towards  the circular economy,  through  data  collection  and  the deployment  of  new  algorithms,  the  modernization  of equipment,  the  optimization  of  logistics,  and,  of  course, the  widespread  use  of  eco-responsible  actions  by  all teams, regardless of their business line or the type of site where they work.\n\nThese  constraints  define  a  world  in  which  instability gradually  becomes  the  norm  rather  than  the  exception; they combine with megatrends that are part of the long term ,  such  as  climate  change,  the  depletion  of  natural resources,  population  growth,  digitalization  and  lifestyle changes (see section 2.1.1, p. 43).\n\nIn  this  context,  the  Group,  which  aims  to  be  the  world leader in sustainable construction, offers tangible solutions  for  markets  in  the  renovation  of  existing buildings, light construction, and decarbonization of the industrial and  construction  sectors . In this sense, Saint -Gobain's business model, which combines performance  and  sustainable  development,  is a  lever  to accelerate  the  transformation  of  the  economy  and society  and  thus  enable  them  to  meet  the  global challenges they face .\n\nThis unique role that Saint -Gobain plays in the ecosystem of  its  stakeholders implies  an  unwavering  commitment from  all  its  teams . For  them,  this  means  constantly moving  towards  a  more  agile  and  efficient  organization, measurable through indicators such as margins, the costto-price ratio, and cash flow conversion. The aim is then to determinedly pursue efforts around energy savings, which are  directly  linked  to  the  Group's  carbon  footprint,  and around  all  aspects  of  its  CSR  roadmap.  To  achieve Saint -Gobain's  medium  and  long-term  objectives, the 'Grow  &  Impact'  plan  is  transforming  the  Group's organizational structure to put the customer at the heart of innovation , by systematizing the search for progress on all  fronts,  from  zero-carbon  industrial  processes  to  light construction systems, as well as solutions to further limit the use of virgin natural raw materials. The following are all synergy levers which serve this objective: the deployment of key account managers, giving customers a single point of  contact  for  all  of  the  Group's  solutions;  the  design  of comprehensive offers ranging from co-design and consulting to distribution and services; the development of cross-selling between  distribution  and  industry;  the widespread use and rationalization of data; the optimization of logistics flows.\n\n\u00cb",

        "page_content": "## SAINT-GOBAIN TODAY\n\nThe Group's activities\n\nSaint -Gobain  aspires  to  be  the  partner  of  choice  for  its customers: installers, processors, manufacturers, distributors  and  architects.  The  Group's  glass  solutions improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings  and  user comfort in all its dimensions : thermal insulation, control of light  inputs,  aesthetics,  interior  design  and  decoration, protection  against  bullets  and  fire.  These  properties  are obtained  as  a  result  of  thin  film  technologies:  using physical and chemical methods, stacks of films transform the glass into functional glazing. This means that the most complex glazing can  consist  of  up  to  twenty  successive layers.  Saint -Gobain  presents  itself  as  the  technological leader  in  the  sector  by  bringing  to  market  innovations such  as  Priva-Lite  active  glazing,  which  is  electrically opaque on demand, or SageGlass solutions, with variable tint,  mainly  offered  for  fa\u00e7ade  projects.  State-of-the-art offers  also  meet  specific  needs:  glazing  with  burglar resistance or fire protection capabilities.\n\nThe Group's glazing solutions play an essential role in both the construction  market and  the renovation  market (see  section  2.1.2,  p.  47)  by  providing  strategic  benefits, particularly in terms of energy savings. In the case of the construction of an office building in India, for example, this results  in  savings  of  9%  on  the  annual  expenditure  on temperature regulation (i.e., more than \u20ac50,000 per year) compared with standard glazing. These advances include solutions  such  as  the  integration  of  Eclaz  One  in  fa\u00e7ade solutions for the construction of new  multi-family buildings, or Planitherm Stadip glass for the renovation of single-family homes, in particular to increase the reflection of  thermal  infrared  rays  and  limit  the  loss  of  heat  by radiation.\n\nSaint -Gobain  is  present  with  its  glazing  solutions  across the entire value chain of the transport market (cars, trucks, public transport, rail, aerospace industry), from production to  distribution  and  maintenance.  The  Group  provides  its clients with solutions thanks to brands such as Saint -Gobain (flat glass manufacturing and sales), Sekurit, a brand with a long history of bringing safety and comfort benefits to the automotive market (automotive glass and windshields), Sekurit Service (production and distribution of replacement glazing), GlassDrive and France Pare Brise (automotive glass fitting and repairing).\n\nEndlessly recyclable, glass, in all its forms - from window and fa\u00e7ade glass to automotive glass - is one of the areas where  the  Group's  commitment  to  the development  of the circular economy materializes (cf. section 3.4, p. 115). This requires both investment in industrial processes - in particular to eliminate all types of contaminants present in glass  waste  -  and  also  the  development  of  efficient  and sustainable  collection  networks.  It  is  in  this  spirit  that Saint -Gobain Glass France signed partnership agreements from  2019  with  several  companies  specializing  in  the recovery  of  end-of-life  windows.  At  the  same  time, Saint -Gobain Glass is developing several cullet sorting lines on  its  flat  glass  manufacturing  sites,  to  ensure  optimal sorting  before  adding  this  secondary  material  to  the product mix. During spring 2022, the Saint -Gobain Group achieved a world first: manufacturing flat glass with 100% cullet and  100%  green  energy,  for  a  zero-carbon\n\n\u00cb\n\nproduction  (scopes  1  and  2).  Following  this  world  first, Saint -Gobain  Glass  launched  the  world's  first  low-carbon glass,  Ora\u00e9.  The  carbon  footprint  of  Ora\u00e9  is  40%  lower than  the  European  average  for  Saint -Gobain  clear  glass. Ora\u00e9 is combined with the most efficient thin-film glazing in order to reduce both carbon emissions during use and the carbon footprint of the product.\n\n## b.  Gypsum\n\nPlaster-based  solutions  for  partitions  and  coverings  for walls, fa\u00e7ades, ceilings and floors provide Group customers with benefits in terms of thermal and acoustic comfort,  fire  protection  and  humidity  resistance,  thus meeting  the  growing  market  demand.  Gypsum  is  a decisive asset in Saint -Gobain's vision, formulated as part of the 'Grow & Impact' plan, and which aims to make the company  the worldwide  leader  in  light  and  sustainable construction .  Among the advantages of this construction method (cf. section 2.3.5, p. 64), depending on the type of building,  wall  construction  processes  using  plaster-based partitions  can  notably  produce  time  savings  of  20%  to 50%  compared  to  traditional materials, and bring environmental benefits such as reduced impacts in terms of  CO2  emissions  and  water  consumption.  In  emerging markets  in  particular,  the  replacement  of  traditional masonry  walls  with  plasterboard  walls  represents  a  very significant source of growth.\n\nTo develop this offer, the Group extracts and transforms gypsum into an extensive range of plaster-based products for the construction and renovation markets, through all of its  brands such as Placo\u00ae, Rigips and Gyproc (see the list of Saint -Gobain's main brands below, section 1.4.3, p. 34), thanks  to  increasingly  efficient  and  virtuous  industrial facilities,  particularly  in  terms  of  energy  consumption, diversification  of  energy  sources,  and  the  commissioning of  the  first  'low-carbon'  plasterboard  plant  in  Norway planned for 2023. These solutions comply with the highest technological standards and Saint -Gobain promotes their widespread  adoption,  they  also  remain  a  step  ahead  of new  regulations  concerning,  for  example,  the  elimination of formaldehyde to improve interior air quality (Activ'Air).\n\nGypsum  can  be  recycled  indefinitely  in  a  closed  loop, thanks to processes allowing the removal of contaminants embedded  in  the  paper  present  on  the  faces  of  the plasterboard. The Group has waste recovery and gypsum recycling services in a dozen countries in order to supply its industrial sites with recycled raw materials (up to 30% of input materials in some plants), also contributing to the Group's strategic positioning in the global movement to expand the  circular  economy .  Saint -Gobain  continues  to expand  in  this  market,  strengthening  its  presence  and industrial  capacities,  notably  through  the  acquisition  of Continental Building Products in the United States in 2020. In September 2022, Saint -Gobain launched the world's first plasterboard  made  from  50%  recycled  plaster.  Called Placo\u00ae  Infini  13,  this  innovation  was  developed  at  the Placo\u00ae  plant  in  Chamb\u00e9ry,  France.  Saint -Gobain  has  also announced  its  first  carbon-neutral  plasterboard  plant  in Fredrikstad, Norway, to be operational by early 2023.",

Ceilings\n\nThrough its portfolio  of  complementary  brands ,  such  as Ecophon,  CertainTeed,  Eurocoustic,  Sonex,  and  Vinh Tuong  (see  the  list  of  the  Group's  main  brands  below, section  1.4.3,  p.  34),  Saint-Gobain  is one  of  the  world leaders in ceiling solutions , providing benefits particularly in  terms  of  thermal  and  acoustic  insulation.  The  Group offers a wide range of multi-material solutions for ceilings and wall panels that combine acoustics and aesthetics for the comfort and well-being of the end user. Its main brand, Ecophon,  develops  high-performance  acoustic  systems (capable of halving noise pollution) intended primarily for non-residential markets (offices, schools, healthcare buildings).  In  2022,  the  Saint -Gobain Group strengthened its presence in the acoustic insulation and ceiling markets through the acquisition of several international companies, including Clipso and Fade. These acquisitions complement the Group's know-how and geographical presence to offer to  all  its  customers  the  most  suitable  solutions  for  their projects,  whether  it  be  museums,  schools,  hospitals, offices,  collective  or  individual  housing,  or  professional recording studios.\n\n## d.  Insulation\n\nIn residential and non-residential buildings , Saint -Gobain's insulation market  offering  meets  the challenges  of reducing  energy  consumption  and  improving  thermal and  acoustic  comfort .  All  of  its  brands,  such  as  Isover, CertainTeed and Izocam, offer a wide range of products, from mineral wools (glass wool, rock wool), to polystyrene and  polyurethane  foams  -  on  specific  markets  -,  to  biosourced  products  (wood  fibers),  thus  covering  the insulation  needs  of  all  types  of  buildings  as  well  as  their interior  installations  (roofs,  walls,  floors).  Its  offer  brings benefits  in  terms  of ease of installation for  professionals and in terms of efficiency and sustainability for investors and owners.\n\nThe  Group  has  considerably  increased  its  production  of glass  wool  for  blowing,  a  mechanized  solution,  greatly reducing installation time. It is complemented by a whole range of solutions for insulating heating or air conditioning systems,  improving  their  efficiency  and  reducing  their energy consumption. The Climaver range, for example, is a 'two-in-one' product that replaces metal ducts as well as the thermal and acoustic insulation used to protect them. The  solutions  proposed  by  Saint -Gobain  for  the  exterior and  interior  insulation  of  walls  also support  the  strong momentum in the renovation market (see section 2.1.2.A, p.  47),  with  innovations  such  as  Optimax  Habito,  which saves installation time by 20% on average, reduces the risk of  injury,  and  also  reduces  waste  on  site  and  makes  the materials used in this solution completely recyclable.\n\nThe Group also provides cutting-edge insulation solutions for a very wide range of applications outside construction, ranging  from  engine  compartments  and  vehicle  interiors (cars,  railcars,  ships,  etc.)  to  household  appliances  and photovoltaic panels.\n\n## SAINT-GOBAIN TODAY\n\nThe Group's activities\n\nIn  the  insulation  market,  Saint -Gobain  is  once  again demonstrating its commitment to circularity .  It  should be remembered  that mineral wools can be recycled indefinitely.  In  France,  Isover  is  the  first  player  in  the market  to  have  launched  a glass  wool  waste  recovery service , recycling the waste by reinjecting it back into the company's  production  process.  The  Group  acts  both through  the  technical  characteristics  of  its  solutions  and through initiatives such as its ILOOP project, supported by the European Union, to contribute to the gradual recovery of glass  wool  waste  generated  on  construction  or demolition sites, as well as through its participation in the European project for the recovery of mineral wool waste, WOOL2LOOP.\n\n## e.  Mortars and construction chemicals\n\nProtecting,  insulating  and  decorating  are  among  the  key functions  of  Saint -Gobain's  fa\u00e7ade  offering.  The  Group  is one  of  the  world  leaders  in  the  field  of  mortars  and construction  chemicals  with  brands  such  as  Weber, Chryso  and  GCP. The  Group's  special  tiling  solutions ensure  safety  and  ease  of  use. In  flooring,  its  solutions cover  various  fields  of  application:  new  and  renovated subfloors,  leveling  and  finishing  prior  to  laying  a  floor, protective coatings for industrial flooring, decoration with the use of self-colored mortars, solutions for areas of high footfall  and  underfloor  heating,  as  well  as  a  pump  truck service  to  improve  the  productivity  and  comfort  of installers.\n\nA range of mortars and coatings is available, covering all areas  of  construction ,  to  help  in  structural  work,  rework and waterproofing solutions. A line of admixtures caters to the growing demand for improved technical properties in concrete for use in construction.\n\nThe  Group  is  expanding  rapidly  on  the construction chemicals  market ,  notably  thanks  to  the  acquisition  in 2021 of Chryso, specializing in admixtures for construction materials, providing differentiated and innovative solutions and  employing  1,300  people,  as  well  as  significant acquisitions in Mexico (Impac), in Romania (Duraziv), and in Peru (Z Aditivos).\n\nIn  2022,  Saint -Gobain  continued  to  grow  significantly  in the construction chemicals markets with the acquisition of GCP Applied Technologies, a global provider in concrete admixtures,  cement  additives  and  specialty  construction building materials, comprising 1,800 people, as well as the acquisition of SIB France, a French  distributor  of decorative mineral flooring, dyed in the mass and offering greater  sustainability.  Saint -Gobain  also  announced  a major  partnership  with  Ecocem,  an  Irish  company specializing in low-carbon  cement.  This  partnership focuses  on  accelerating  the  delivery  of  low-carbon products  to  market.  Designed  to  reduce  CO2  emissions from  cement,  mortar  and  concrete,  these  products  will support  the  acceleration  of  the  construction  industry's transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy.  These  acquisitions represent a decisive step towards establishing the Group as  a  worldwide  leader  in  construction  chemicals,  with more than \u20ac4 billion in sales. Pooling these resources and solutions offers customers a highly comprehensive portfolio and global coverage.\n\n1 1 1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## SAINT-GOBAIN TODAY\n\nThe Group's activities\n\n## f. Exterior products\n\nSaint -Gobain, through its CertainTeed and Brasilit brands, is present in the United States and in Latin America with a full range of outdoor products. For roofs, the Group offers premium  asphalt  and  composite  shingles,  solar  roofing solutions, roll roofing  systems  and  accessories.  For fa\u00e7ades,  it  offers  polymer  shakes  and  shingle,  and insulation  cladding  solutions.  Saint -Gobain  also  supplies solutions  such  as  barriers,  terraces  and  balustrades. Solutions incorporating these various products provide the Group's  customers  with  benefits  in  terms  of  aesthetics, ease  of  installation  and  maintenance,  and  resistance  to bad weather.\n\n## g.  Distribution of products, solutions and services for construction and housing\n\nSaint -Gobain serves hundreds of thousands of customers each  year  on  the construction,  renovation  and  home improvement  markets . With  brands  such  as  CEDEO, Point.P,  Optimera  and  Dahl  (see  the  list  of  the  Group's main brands below, section 1.4.3, p. 34), the Group has a network  of  strong  and  complementary  brands,  both generalist and specialist. Primarily oriented towards trade customers,  the  Saint -Gobain  trading  brands  also  serve small  and  medium-sized  businesses  and  large  companies and allow for a presence of the Group across the whole construction value chain .  They also support individuals in the  completion  of  their  projects  with  professionals.  The various  brands  thus  strive  to  balance  their  customer portfolios, a guarantee of solidity and profitability. Another major asset is the regional network: in France, the Group has  more  than  2,000  sales  outlets,  anchored  in  the  local fabric, able to serve the most dynamic economic areas.\n\nThe Group's expertise in the field of distribution is key to achieve the strategic goals of the 'Grow & Impact' plan (see  section  2.3.1,  p.  57)  by  providing  its  professional clients  with  a  large  array  of  solutions  and making Saint -Gobain a one-stop-shop provider . It also allows for a very high  degree  of  proximity  with  the  Group's  clients , thanks  to  the  value  brought  by  data  collection  and analysis  (see  section  2.3.3,  p.  58)  and  thanks  to  the support Saint -Gobain provides its clients across the board, including training on its products and services (see below). It also enables the Group to capture the structural growth of  the  residential  building  renovation  market  in  Europe (see section 2.1.2.A, p. 47).\n\nLogistics  is  essential  to  distribution  and  receives  special attention  through  the  automation  and  robotization  of processes. The trading brands are making their system of centralized  logistics  bases  and  adapted  delivery  centers increasingly efficient. This allows for a successful deployment of Saint -Gobain's e-commerce offering (regarding  delivery  times  especially)  for  low-volume  and low-weight  products  in  particular.  To  support  logistics, robust  information  systems  are  necessary.  Thanks  in particular to data collection and analysis , digital technology is  one  of  the  tools  available  to  Saint -Gobain\n\nbrands to offer customers a unique omnichannel experience: e-commerce, m-commerce, enhanced product content  (features,  descriptions,  visuals,  technical  and regulatory sheets, etc.), as well as digital services that save time.  The  teams  also  benefit  from  productivity  tools (robotic  process  automation),  machine  learning  and optimal data exploitation using data processing algorithms.  This  approach  allows  the  Group  to  better understand  and  model  product  and  customer  targets  to optimize  the  work  of  the  sales  force.  Ultimately,  digital technology acts as a lever to boost Saint -Gobain's growth (see section 2.3.3, p. 58).\n\nThrough  distribution,  Saint -Gobain  is  also  committed  to supporting its professional clients throughout their journey.  On  the  French  market,  the  Group  is  actively delivering on this commitment  by  designing and marketing services ranging from training (via the creation of  apprentice  training  centers  (cf.  section  3.2.4.B.b,  p.  98 sq.)  or  training  provided  to  more  than  10,000  clients regarding the RGE label (9) ) to the recovery of site waste (notably thanks to a partnership agreement with Ecodrop, a  construction  site  waste  collection  service),  digital solutions offering assistance with estimates and costing on construction sites (with the Solu+ platform), and the rapid generation  of  estimates  and  invoices  (with  the  Tolteck solution).\n\nLastly, distribution is an  area  where Saint -Gobain's demanding stance in the area of responsibility materializes.  This  is  reflected,  for  example,  in  the search for  an  ever-smaller  delivery  logistics  footprint ,  notably thanks to 'low-carbon' delivery solutions, the optimization of circuits and the installation of sales outlets in the heart of urban areas, as well as through the use of distribution chains as an essential tool in the collection of waste from construction sites,  with  a  view  to\n\npromoting the circular economy . In  2017,  Saint -Gobain  Distribution  B\u00e2timent France set up structures to collect waste from the same types  of  construction  materials,  products  and  equipment that it sells to professionals, thus becoming a key private network of site waste collection points in the construction and public works sector.\n\n## h.  Piping\n\nSaint -Gobain offers  complete  solutions drawing on more than 165 years of experience in  the  water supply market to meet the highest expectations. Through its PAM brands, the  Group  produces  and  markets  ductile  cast  iron  pipe systems  for  drinking  water  and  sanitation,  covers  and gratings  for  roads,  as  well  as  cast  iron  systems  for collecting  and  evacuating  wastewater  and  rainwater  in buildings. Saint -Gobain's offer is aimed at public authorities, public and private water companies, as well as players in the mining, hydroelectric and industrial markets. To  guarantee  the  preservation  of  water  quality  and  the sustainability of these solutions, the Group offers a set of certificates  and  approvals  in  full  compliance  with  all standards and regulations in force in its markets.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1 THE GROUP'S ENVIRONMENT\n\n## 2.1.1 MAJOR CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nMegatrends at work - climate change, scarcity of natural resources, urbanization and population growth, digitization and  changes  in  lifestyles  -  will  continue  to  shape  the  evolution  of  the  world  for  decades.  These  fundamental movements  represent  many  of  the  challenges  that  the  economy  and  society  face,  to  which  Saint -Gobain  provides tangible, immediately operational solutions, thereby offering huge growth potential for the Group.\n\nThese major trends create a world that is also constrained by a range of crises: geopolitical and regional, as well as global  through  the  disorganization  of  supply  chains,  the increase in energy costs and its effects on the depletion of commodities, and rising interest rates. These crises make the  economic,  political  and  social  context  more  volatile; they focus on the interdependence of all these phenomena, and on the urgency for society as a whole to provide solutions to the challenges it faces. For Saint -Gobain,  the  aim  is  to  equip  ourselves  with  all  the agility necessary in order to be able to adapt at all times to a  constantly  changing  environment  and  to  be  able  to provide  the  appropriate  answers  for  each  of  these challenges:\n\n- \u00b7 On climate change, propose solutions for decarbonization  of  the  construction  and  industrial sectors;\n- \u00b7 Regarding  the  depletion  of  natural  resources,  reduce the collection of raw materials and accelerate towards a circular economy;\n- \u00b7 In  terms  of  continuous  urbanization,  provide  solutions for building renovation, light construction and mobility;\n- \u00b7 Regarding  digitization,  accelerate  data  innovation, collection and use;\n- \u00b7 Finally,  regarding  changing  lifestyles,  offer  solutions adapted to new uses, new expectations and their longterm evolution.\n\n## A - Climate change\n\nThe imminent environmental threat lies in climate change and its consequences on economic, social, environmental and geopolitical balances. The only answer to this threat is decarbonization  of  the  economy  as  a  whole,  through  a drastic  reduction  in  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  for all  of  the  world's  economies.  This  involves  correcting  an ongoing trend of increasing GHG emissions; an encouraging sign is that this increase is slowing (1) .  In  the context  of  the  sixth  IPCC  assessment  cycle (2) ,  the  Paris Agreement targets, signed in 2015, remain the priority: to keep temperature rise below 2\u00b0C - and, if possible, 1.5\u00b0C compared to the pre-industrial era.\n\nIn  the  starkest  terms,  this  means  reducing  global  CO2 emissions (estimated at 40.2 billion tonnes in 2022) by an average of 1.4 billion tonnes each year by 2050, according to the Global Carbon Project (3) . Each year, on the basis of the latest scientific work, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report compares the gap between  these  commitments  and  the  reduction  required to meet the objective. Its 13th and latest edition, published at  the  end  of  2022,  entitled  The  Closing  Window (4) , indicates  that  the  international  community  is  not  aligned with the target, the current trend leading to an increase of 2.8\u00b0C  at  the  end  of  the  century,  while  the  commitments made to date will only be able to reduce this increase to a level of 2.4  to  2.8\u00b0C.  Only  a  rapid  and  profound transformation of the global economic system can deliver the huge reductions in GHG emissions needed, i.e., a 30% reduction  by  2030  to  meet  the  2\u00b0C  target,  in  order  to avoid climate disaster (5) .\n\nAmong  the  sectors  mentioned  in  the  UNEP  report,  the construction sector is essential because it, alone, accounts for  nearly  40%  of  the  world's  annual  CO2  emissions,  two thirds  of  which  are  related  to  the  operation  of  buildings (operational emissions related to heating, air conditioning, and  sanitary  hot  water)  while  one  third  is  related  to  the production of materials, their transport and to construction machinery, i.e., the embedded carbon (6) . The development  of  the  construction  sector  is  therefore central to the response to climate change, both in terms of new  construction  and  for  existing  buildings,  since  it  is estimated  that  nearly  half  of  the  current  stock  will  still exist  and  will  continue  to  emit  carbon  in  2050 (7) . Decarbonization  necessarily  involves  massive  renovation plans,  particularly  in  developed  countries,  in  order  to improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings  and  the replacement  of  fossil  fuels  for  heating  and  refrigeration with renewable energies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's environment",

        "page_content": "## STRATEGY\n\nThe Group's environment\n\nThe  solution  to  climate  change  therefore  combines  the general public, governments (through regulation, taxation and investment), and companies, which have an essential role  to  play  in  minimizing  their  carbon  footprint  and maximizing their positive contribution to change. Saint -Gobain, which formalized its support for the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C initiative supported by the United  Nations  Global  Compact  (for  more  on  the partnership  with  the  Global  Compact,  see  in  particular section  4.2.3,  p.  150),  committed  to  reducing  its  CO2 emissions  by  33%  (in  absolute  terms)  between  2017  and 2030. The Group has also set its target as contributing to carbon neutrality by 2050 (see section 3.3.1.B.b, p. 104).\n\nSaint -Gobain,  through  its  unique  position  in  the  value chain, helps to meet the decarbonization challenge by an offer  to  its  industrial  customers  and  the  construction  of solutions that actively contribute to this objective (see section 3.3.2.C, p. 107), in particular by improving the energy efficiency of buildings and therefore the avoidance of emissions through light construction techniques (see section 2.3.5, p. 64).\n\nThe Group also aligns its portfolio of activities with this objective ;  the  acquisitions  of  Chryso  in  2021  and  GCP Applied Technologies in 2022 make Saint -Gobain a world leader in construction chemicals ,  with applied specialties, in  particular  decarbonizing  new  construction,  as  a new additive technology allowing Saint -Gobain customers to produce low-carbon cement.\n\nIn  the  field  of  High  Performance  Solutions,  the  Group's offerings enable its industrial customers to move towards more energy-efficient energy, a key approach to preserving their profitability and reducing their greenhouse  gas  emissions. The 'Surface Solutions' Business  Unit  offers  solutions  that,  for  example,  allow aluminum manufacturers to avoid up to 17% of their CO2 emissions, and the wood industry a 54% reduction. In this area, co-development is key, and is reflected in Saint -Gobain's  contribution  to  the  economy  by  enabling the industry to make progress towards decarbonization.\n\nLastly, the Group is committed to reducing the impact of its own operations in terms of GHG emissions, particularly by  continuing  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  its  processes and  through  innovations  such  as  the  'low  carbon'  glass production pilot project completed successfully in France in 2022. In the Czech Republic, the electrification of glass fiber  furnaces  will  ultimately  reduce  CO2  emissions  by 20%, i.e., 50,000 tonnes per year. The Group also doubled the  share  of  low-carbon  electricity  in  its  energy  mix between 2020 and 2021, now at nearly 40%. Saint -Gobain is  continuing its path to contributing to carbon neutrality\n\nby deploying increasingly advanced systems to measure and monitor GHG emissions across its entire value chain. All  of  the  Group's  activities  are  concerned,  including  in distribution;  in  Norway,  Dahl  Optimera  has  moved to the complete  electrification  of  its  vehicle  fleet,  in  order  to achieve  clean  transport.  Finally,  Saint -Gobain  also  plays, more broadly, a key role by helping to mobilize the entire building  value  chain  towards  a  common  decarbonization goal.\n\n## B - Environment and the use of natural resources\n\nCentral to the sustainability of economic models and the ability of mankind to live on the planet, natural resources are becoming scarce, due to consumption that has tripled in 50 years (8) ; it concerns both fossil resources extracted including hydrocarbons  -  and  resources  constantly renewed, including drinking water. The 'overshoot day' (9) , i.e., the date on which mankind's annual demand on nature (ecological footprint) exceeds Earth's ability to regenerate natural resources over the entire year (biocapacity), tends to arrive earlier each year; it was calculated as July 22 in\n\n2022 (10) . Here  too,  the  construction  sector  plays  a  key role , with 50% of the consumption of natural resources, as well  as  12%  of  drinking  water  consumption  and  40%  of solid waste production (11) .\n\nSaint -Gobain  meets  this  challenge  using  its  construction and  industry  solutions.  In  2022,  the  Group  was  the first industrial manufacturer  to  produce  and  market  a plasterboard  designed  with  more  than  50%  recycled plaster , and  which  retains  the  same  technical  and functional performance  as  a  standard  plasterboard. Another  example  of  an  application  is  that,  through  the Placo\u00ae brand, Saint -Gobain will provide nearly 100,000 m 2 of  removable  and  re-usable  partitions  for  the  2024 Olympic Games, thereby serving the goal of a construction that  is  more  frugal  in  resources  and  takes  into  account long-term sobriety objectives.\n\nIn  Germany,  Rigips  launched  RiCycling,  a  system  that reduces the use of gypsum, from extraction to dismantling, further advancing its commitment to sustainability.  For  the  Group's  industrial  customers,  its Valoref  brand,  already  the  European  leader  in  refractory waste  recycling,  diversifies  the  materials  handled  and internationalizes its activities in North America, China and India.\n\nAll  of  the  solutions  offered  by  Saint -Gobain  for  light construction are, in general, an essential response to the increasingly  low  impact  of  the  construction  sector  as  a whole,  through  a  reduction  in  resources.  This  is  how Saint -Gobain  is  accelerating  its  transition  to  a  circular economy, taking into account the entire life cycle of its products and solutions , in order to limit their consumption of  natural  resources,  extend  their  lifespan  and  promote their  recycling,  to  reduce  the  production  of  non-recycled waste  (see  section  3.4.1,  p.  116).  This  commitment  also concerns the improvement of the Group's own processes; unrecycled  waste  decreased  by  24%  between  2017  and 2021.  In  France,  this  is  how  the  Aniche  flat  glass  plant launched the 'Tri Calcin' (cullet  sorting)  project  with  the aim  of  significantly  reducing  its  CO2  emissions  and recycling the glass available in local reconstruction sites. In Denmark,  Isover  has  implemented  a  'virtuous'  program, 'Glass to Wool', which recovers and recycles old glazing to  make  glass  wool.  Saint -Gobain  also  reduced  its  water emissions by 40% in 2021 compared to 2010, with a target of  80%  by  2025.  The  Group's  distribution  activities, through their territorial coverage, play an important role in advancing  towards  a  circular  economy;  Saint -Gobain Distribution  B\u00e2timent  France  has  thus  become  the  first private network of waste collection points for construction sites.",

        "page_content": "## C - Demographics and urbanization\n\nIn  November 2022, the world's population surpassed the symbolic  threshold  of  eight  billion  people.  While  experts predict a slowdown and a future halt to this growth, with a peak  of  10.4  billion  inhabitants  in  the  2080s,  this megatrend has serious consequences due to its spectacular pace; it took only eleven years to populate the planet  with  this  eighth  billion,  between  2011  and  2022.  It nevertheless  covers  very  different  realities;  in  developed countries,  the  evolution  of  birth  has  already  led  to  a continuous  aging  of  the  population,  generating  specific needs  for  adaptation  of  housing,  prefiguring  what  will happen  later  on  across  the  globe.  In  other  geographical regions,  the  rapid  increase  in  the  population  has  led  to serious  tensions  in  the  building  sector  and  the  ability  to provide healthy and dignified housing to all.\n\nHowever,  the  rapidly  growing  global  population  has  also been  predominantly  urban  since  2007 (12) , with  the urbanization  rate  already  exceeding  80%  in  high  and middle  income  countries (13) . The  urban  population  is expected to grow by two billion over the next 30 years. The majority of mankind now lives in cities, which account for  more  than  60%  of  energy  and  natural  resource consumption and more than 70% of global GHG emissions. This rapid urbanization has led to the need to build many new  constructions  quickly  (particularly in emerging countries)  and  therefore  a  demand  for  solutions  to increase  productivity,  by  building  faster  and  with  less labor. Urbanization is also reflected in major constraints on waste  management  and  energy  supply,  as  well  as  all infrastructures  such  as  transport,  through  modernized, densified, smart networks, renovated rolling stock, offering greater  comfort  and  energy  efficiency,  not  to  mention opening  up  to  innovations  such  as  the  development  of drones in urban environments. It also concerns collective use areas, from offices to hospitals to places dedicated to sport, commerce  and  entertainment.  Transport  and buildings  are  therefore  at  the  heart  of  the  issue  of urbanization, with the challenge of transforming buildings to  move  towards  energy  sobriety  and  preparing  for adaptation  to  climate  change,  by  designing  and  building resilient and adaptable cities over the long term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's environment\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  a  central  role  to  play  in  meeting  the needs of both affordable and sustainable construction, so that  everyone  can  benefit  from  decent,  energy-efficient housing,  and  contributing  to  a  comfortable  urban  life, using  all  its  solutions  for  renovation,  new  construction, and  infrastructure  related  to  water  supply.  Through  its distribution  brands,  the  Group  also  provides  solutions adapted to the urban environment, through a network of local points of sale, redesigned logistics to make it more virtuous, and a capacity to recover construction waste. It also contributes to the development of new, smarter and more  sustainable  mobility  solutions  (see  section  1.4.1.B.a, p. 29).\n\n## D - Digitization\n\nDigitization  is  a major  trend  that  has  reached  maturity with the general public today; 30 years after the first SMS was sent, it is estimated that, in 2022, 73% of people over 10  years  old  worldwide,  all  countries  combined,  have  a mobile  phone.  It  continues  to  significantly  influence  the development of all the economic and industrial sectors in which Saint -Gobain operates.\n\nIn distribution , the underlying trend of constant expansion of e-commerce was further accelerated by the pandemic that  began  in  2020  and  which  led,  for  example,  to  the share of e-commerce exceeding 15% of total retail sales in the  United  States (14) .  Beyond  the  transposition  of  offers via  digital  platforms,  and  the  attention  paid  to  the ergonomics of websites, the challenge today is to take into account user experience in a comprehensive way and thus recreate a direct and special link between brands on the one  hand  and  customers  and  end  users  on  the  other, offering  a  customized  experience  to  each.  This  can  be done by designing offers  integrating  associated  services; by collecting and analyzing data, while respecting privacy; by taking into account all channels and points of contact (web,  mobile,  social  networks,  and  points  of  sale).  In addition  to  individual  customers,  this  radical  customer relations challenge  deeply  redefines  the  relationship between  professionals  (particularly  craftsmen)  with  their suppliers. The evolution of technologies and uses requires brands  to  constantly  assess  trends  and,  if  need  be, integrate new  systems  and  new  features  such  as augmented reality, m-commerce, or voice search. Beyond the purely commercial relationship, the compartmentalization  brought  on  by  digital  technology encourages  product  brands  and  distribution  brands  to holistically redefine the relationship with all their stakeholders,  including  their  employees,  their  suppliers, and the general public.",

        "page_content": "## STRATEGY\n\nThe Group's environment\n\nIn industry , digital  systems  continue  to  revolutionize processes  and  methods  of  organization  and  production. Widespread  measurement,  real-time  data  capture  and control  systems,  automation,  augmented  operators,  and the  interconnection  of  industrial  systems  give  rise  to  an ever-increasing volume of data and the ability to analyze it.  After  the  arrival  of  computers  and  robots  in  factories (contributing,  through  their  positive  impact  in  terms  of ergonomics,  to  improving  the  health  and  well-being  of employees),  this  fourth  industrial  revolution  enables progress in multiple areas: increased productivity (through the  reduction  of  inventories,  breakdowns,  waste  of  time and material); greater agility by improving the flexibility of production  processes;  the  new  possibility  of  customizing production;  and  also  minimizing  of  the  environmental footprint  of  production,  through  the  reduction  of  waste production,  the  optimization  of  logistics  flows,  the optimization of energy and raw material consumption, and therefore reduction of GHG emissions.\n\nIn construction , digitization  is  transforming  the  entire construction and renovation value  chain.  Upstream,  it  is the actual design (of buildings) that increasingly relies on digital  models,  or  Building  Information  Modeling  (BIM), offering  an  integrated  vision  of  the  building  during  all stages  of  its  life  cycle  through  a  'digital  twin';  on construction  sites,  3D  scanning  and  photogrammetry provide  new  knowledge  of  reality.  As  for  construction itself,  digital  technology  enables  new  operating  methods such  as  off-site  construction  (prefabrication  or  modular construction), as well as 3D printing. Downstream, wireless monitoring,  the  interconnection  of  systems  and  home automation  contribute  to  increasing  the  comfort  of  the home, to optimizing energy consumption of buildings, and to improving their safety. In transport infrastructures and high-rise  buildings,  the  collection  of  real-time  mass  data also  enables  precise  monitoring  of  the  behavior  of structures  over  the  long  term,  predictive  analysis  and, ultimately, optimization of maintenance  and  better accident  prevention,  contributing  to  better  management of the built stock throughout its life cycle.\n\nFor Saint -Gobain, digitization is a source of progress and improvement  in  performance,  as  well  as  a  system  for decarbonization  of  its  industrial  processes.  This  is  a fundamental issue that affects all of the Group's activities and has major impacts on customer relations, recruitment and  training,  the  innovation  process,  market  positioning and  industrial  processes  themselves  (see  section  2.3.3, p. 58), and on social and environmental responsibility.\n\n## E - Changing lifestyles\n\nIn Western countries, individuals spend an average of 90% of their time indoors (15) , and the widespread use of remote working is redefining expectations for residential buildings, felling  the  structural  trend  of  increasing  the  housing renovation  market  linked  to  energy  sobriety  targets.  The entire attitude  to  work is  being  called  into  question, thanks partly to the digitization of work systems, but also\n\nbecause of the increase in geographical mobility, societal changes  such  as  changes  in  family  structures  and  the arrival of new generations on the labor market, or workers' demands for a better work-life balance. In terms of uses of buildings, stronger expectations on very concrete subjects related to health, comfort - in terms of noise, temperature, light, aesthetics, air quality - and the inhabitability of living spaces are added to these concerns. For example, 65% of exposure  to  outdoor  air  pollution  is  estimated  to  occur inside;  the  elimination  of  indoor  pollutants  from  homes themselves  -  including  volatile  organic  compounds  contributes to this same requirement.\n\nAll  the  megatrends  affecting  living  places  require more modular and scalable buildings ,  in  order  to  facilitate  the change  of  use  of  buildings  and  thus  more  easily  switch from office to residential use, and vice versa, and also their ability  to  adapt  to  changing  expectations,  such  as  needs related to home care for the elderly.\n\nChanges  in  lifestyles  also  have  significant  impacts  on mobility.  Globalization  and  an  increase  in  the  global standard  of  living  have  the  effect  of  increasing  people's mobility. The  demand  for  decarbonization  and  the increasing density of residential centers are also leading to changes  in  public  transport  networks,  which  are  being improved  and  made  more  efficient  and  environmentally friendly. With regard to individual vehicles, the transition is now fully underway towards models that emit fewer GHG, are more  energy  efficient and are cleaner, more comfortable,  and  able  to  interact  in  real  time  with  other vehicles and with the entire environment (see section 2.1.2, p.  50).  Beyond  this  technological  revolution,  we  are witnessing  a  change  to  the  symbolism  of  the  car  in  the minds of consumers, and as a result a growing preference for  use  rather  than  possession.  This  underlying  trend, which is part of a wider social movement, has very serious impacts in terms of vehicle design.\n\nFor  Saint -Gobain,  changes  in  lifestyles  are  both  an incentive  to  closely  monitor  changes  in  customer expectations,  and  an  important  lever  for  transforming industry,  construction  and  distribution in  order  to  make them more virtuous and to provide ever more comfortable living conditions.  In  India,  the  Asepta  ceiling  slabs produced by Saint -Gobain Gyproc eliminate microbes and help  equip  spaces  for  a  healthy  environment.  In  the Netherlands, new schools built using solutions offered by the Group make it possible to better care for children with high-performance  acoustics,  brightness,  optimum  air quality and irreproachable thermal comfort.\n\nIn  general, the  solutions  offered  by  Saint -Gobain  to design  new,  more  energy-efficient  and  more  enjoyable buildings to be used, to renovate the entire existing shell, and  to  deploy  more  efficient  and  environmentally friendly  means  of  transport  are  among  the  essential solutions to these new expectations.\n\n\u00cb",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.2 TRENDS IN THE GROUP'S VARIOUS MARKETS\n\nSaint -Gobain is driven by the acceleration of the markets in  which the Group operates, and where it seizes growth opportunities. This dynamic is at work in all geographical areas  and  on  global  markets (16) . Despite  a  cyclical slowdown characterized by an inflationary environment with its consequences on energy and material prices - and by  the  rise  in  interest  rates  -  with  its  consequences  on household  confidence  -,  the  major  trends  around  the world are materializing  in  structural  market  changes  that are favorable to the Group's development.\n\nIn  Western  European  markets,  the  continued  increase  in the  volume  of  the  renovation  market  is  in  response  to regulatory  changes,  at  community  level  with  the  'Fit  for 55'  package.  With  an  aging  portfolio  of  buildings,  the subject of energy is central; renovation is made imperative due  to  the  objectives  of  reducing  the  European  Union's strategic  dependence  and  combating  energy  insecurity. The  new  construction  sector  is  subject  to  stricter standards in order to deliver better results, particularly in terms  of  energy  sobriety,  and  must  respond  to  housing shortages.  In  North  America,  the  construction  market  is characterized  by  an  acceleration  in  light  construction practices,  while  the  pre-existing  shortage  has  led  to increasing demand for new housing. In emerging markets, robust  population  growth  and  continued  urbanization have given way to light construction. Finally, on the global markets, the demand to combat climate change creates a very strong growth horizon for technologies and solutions to  decarbonize  industry,  particularly  the  construction industry.\n\n## A - Renovation and building envelope\n\nIn  mature  markets,  the  evolution  of  the  construction market is determined by major trends such as the increase in the ownership rate, or even the aging, of the population, which  lead  to  increased  need  for  renovation.  It  is  also  a market where the energy efficiency imperative is essential. The  existing  (and  dense)  housing  stock  is  also  aging; however, this is a sector where decarbonization technologies are developed and allow extremely significant  gains  in  terms  of  avoiding  GHG  emissions, especially  in  a  context  of  rising  energy  prices.  The renovation  sector  is  particularly  promising  for  growth  in Europe, where it accounted for over \u20ac800 billion per year in 2022 (17) . The  figures  accompanied  by  forecasts published as part of the Euroconstruct report (covering an area including Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland,  France,  Hungary,  Ireland,  Italy,  the  Netherlands, Norway,  Poland,  Portugal,  the  United  Kingdom,  Czechia, Slovakia,  Sweden  and  Switzerland)  of  November  2022 show a particularly robust sector.\n\n## SIZE OF THE EUROPEAN BUILDING RENOVATION MARKET (\u20ac bn), 2019-2023 (18)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  intervention  of  political  authorities  is  decisive  in  this market. However, renovation (nearly 50% of Saint -Gobain's sales worldwide) corresponds to three key objectives concerning public strategies and therefore the link  between  policy  makers  and  the  population:  the commitment to contributing to carbon neutrality, energy independence, and the protection of household purchasing power. At the European level, the REPowerEU initiative has resulted in an additional \u20ac56 billion by 2027 allocated to energy efficiency. On the regulatory front, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) should lead  to  the  introduction  of  mandatory  Minimum  Energy Performance Standards (MEPS). This is a historic moment: it  is  estimated  that  70%  of  residential  space  in  Europe\n\nneeds to be renovated if we want to achieve the goal of\n\ncarbon neutrality , bearing in mind that 55% of buildings in the  European Union are in the worst energy classes E, F and  G  (the  biggest  consumers  of  energy  per  square meter).  However,  this  objective  assumes  that  the  annual buildings renovation rate will be doubled within ten years, throughout  the  European  Union.  The  priorities  of  the 'RenovationWave'  plan  are  to  limit  energy  poverty, renovate public buildings, and to decarbonize heating and air  conditioning (19) .  The  European  Commission's  strategy is  to  renovate  35  million  energy-inefficient  buildings  and create  up  to  160,000  additional  'green'  jobs (20) in  an environmental, social and efficiency-related public governance  project.  The  renovation  objective  does  not concern  only  residential  buildings;  office  space  is  also concerned. In France, the latter is subject by decree to a 40% reduction in energy consumption before 2030, 50% by  2040  and  60%  before  2050  for  any  surface  area greater than 1,000 m \u00b2 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's environment",

Maximum application of the EPBD directive would thus deliver very significant results , both on the percentage of buildings not renovated, on GHG emissions by buildings (by contributing to half of the necessary decarbonization efforts by 2030), and on their energy consumption (21) :\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShare of non-renovated buildings (percentage of the total surface) by 2050, depending on the region in Europe, as compared to 47% to 65% in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  the  Member States, there has been an acceleration in public investment plans to support energy renovation : in Poland,  the  plan  is  budgeted  at  \u20ac3.5  billion  per  year, corresponding to the renovation of 250,000 housing units; in  Italy,  the  government  extended  and  increased  the amount of aid granted via the 'superbonus'; in Spain, the creation of 'energy saving certificates' is a complement to the  'Green  Deal'  announcing  \u20ac7  billion  for  renovation.  In the Netherlands, in addition to the 2022-2024 plan for the insulation  of  buildings,  there  is  a  ban  on  renting  out housing that achieves lower than a D-class rating by 2030, in  line  with  a  principle  similar  to  the  one  adopted  in France,  where  the  'MaPrimeR\u00e9nov''  state  scheme  is  the government's  commitment  to  a  target  of  700,000 renovations per year.\n\nThe sector's growth prospects are therefore supported by both investment plans and the constant strengthening of construction  and  renovation  standards , particularly  in developed  economies.  Market  growth  is  also  driven  by adapting buildings to changes of use , and in particular the explosion of working from home (cf. section 2.1.1.E, p. 46), which  has  consequences  in  terms  of  renovation  and restructuring needs for both individual housing and office buildings.  Other  factors  have  similar  effects,  such  as  the increase in ownership rate in some countries, or the aging of  the  population,  which  requires  renovating  homes  to make  them  livable  for  longer;  the  latter  trend  is  a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEvolution of energy consuption for heating, cooling and domestic hot water in Europe by 2050.\n\nfundamental  structural  trend  that  is  already  evident  in developed countries, in China, and will extend to the entire planet  over  the  long  term.  By  2050,  one  in  four  people living in Europe or North America could be 65 or older.\n\nIn an unstable geopolitical context, beyond the subject of climate  change,  crises  are  finally  confirming  that  there  is an urgent need for mass renovation of existing buildings from  the  point  of  view  of  the  protection  of  the  least favored households and public health .  The rise in energy prices, and the difficulty it causes for heating, should thus cause, in the event of a moderate winter - comparable to the  average  winters  of  2000-2019  -  an  estimated overmortality of nearly 150,000 people on the continent in the winter of 2022-2023, or even more than 180,000 in the event  of  lower  temperatures (22) .  However,  even  without these  crises,  inadequate  housing  has  particularly  serious consequences. According to the WHO, unhealthy housing causes 130,000 deaths every year in Europe, a figure that can be reduced by investing heavily in improving the living conditions of residents through renovation and insulation. In  addition  to  statistics  and  human  benefits,  this  is  a sensible  investment  in  terms  of  public  finances;  a  study showed that the renovation of 600,000 unsuitable homes in  France,  occupied  by  the  smallest  households,  would cost  \u20ac6.5  billion  in  public  money,  but  in  the  long  term would  lead  to  a  reduction  in  healthcare  costs  of  nearly \u20ac500 million per year.\n\n\u00cb",

        "page_content": "## STRATEGY\n\nThe Group's environment\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  new  construction  is  subject  to regulatory constraints that tend to strengthen regularly, in order  to accelerate  the  development  of  the  sector  and respond  to  the  ecological  challenges  and  those  around energy  transition .  In  France,  for  example,  the  RE2020 system  demonstrates  the  shift  from  thermal  regulation (which began in 1974) to more ambitious and demanding environmental regulations for  all  market  players,  in  order to  continue  to  improve  the  energy  performance  and comfort of buildings, while reducing their carbon impact. It is  structured  around  three  main  areas (26) :  to  continue  to improve energy performance and reduce consumption by new buildings; to reduce the impact on the climate of new buildings  by  taking  all  their  emissions  into  account  over their life cycle, from construction to end-of-life (construction materials, equipment), through the operating phase (heating, sanitary hot water, air conditioning,  lighting,  etc.),  through  a  life  cycle  analysis; and  finally,  to  allow  occupants  to  live  in  a  living  and working  space  adapted  to  future  climate  conditions  by pursuing  the  objective  of  comfort  in  the  summer.  In particular, buildings will have to be more resilient to heat waves,  which  will  be  more  frequent  and  intense  due  to climate change.\n\nAll of these constraints require strong mobilization from all players  in  the  sector  in  order  to  carry  out  a  real transformation,  particularly  thanks  to  the  development and  marketing  of  new  technological  solutions  for  the entire sector, particularly 'low-carbon' concrete. Furthermore, traditional construction methods are challenged by the rapid emergence of light  construction techniques (see section 2.3.5, p. 64) which  offer significant performance benefits in terms of raw material consumption  (up  to  50%  reduction),  and  therefore decarbonization .  These  techniques  also  save  time  (up  to\n\n20%  of  the  constructive  on-site  process)  and  therefore productivity (building  with  fewer  human  resources), particularly  in  rapid  urbanization  situations.  They  also bring benefits in terms of well-being ,  thanks to improved thermal,  acoustic  and  visual  comfort.  The  penetration  of this  construction  method  is  high  because  it  responds  to challenges  both  in  developed  countries  (pressure  on natural resources, search for productivity and lack of labor for professionals, expectations of modularity and environmental responsibility on the part of end users) and in  emerging  countries  (benefits  in  terms  of  speed  of construction, housing needs  created  by  population growth).  Its  growth  will  therefore  exceed  that  of  the construction  sector  as  a  whole,  offering  particularly significant sources of value.\n\n## C - Industry\n\n## Sustainable mobility\n\nOverall,  after  the  contraction  seen  in  2020,  and  despite cyclical  constraints  such  as  the  increase  in  the  average price  of  vehicles,  interest  rates  and  the  prices  of  basic materials  (particularly  metals),  the  automotive  market  is starting  to  grow  again  and  will  continue  to  grow  in  the short to medium term. Its global volume is estimated at 90 million  units  in  2025,  i.e.,  a  return  to  2019  levels,  and growth  rates  between  3%  and  5%  between  2023  and 2025.  In  the  case  of  China,  2022  volume  has  already exceeded  the  pre-Covid-19  crisis  level (27) . The  electric vehicle  market,  in  which  Saint -Gobain  holds  leading positions, will drive most of this growth, with extremely strong growth forecasts , driven in particular by changes in standards, widespread constraints imposed by cities, and the continuation of government subsidy programs.\n\nGLOBAL EV SALES AND FORECAST, 2020-2028 (28)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00cb",

        "page_content": "The electrification of the vehicle fleet has begun a radical acceleration -  which  will  mainly  concern  fully  electric vehicles,  unlike  plug-in  hybrids  -  including  the  European Commission's announcement of a ban on the sale of new thermal  cars  for  2035.  All  car  manufacturers  have  since positioned  themselves  in  relation  to  this  deadline,  by announcing  their  own  roadmap  for  the  electrification  of their  range.  The  'Fit  for  55'  strategy  published  by  the Commission also stipulates changes in the taxation of fuels and the deployment of charging infrastructure for vehicles. It  is  indeed  an explosion  in  the  electric  vehicle  market that,  in  Europe  and  around  the  world,  is  mainly  due  to public regulation and subsidies; in China, the continuation of  tax  rebates  in  2023  represents  a  public  spending  of nearly  $15  billion (29) . However,  this  development  has significant  consequences  on  the  sector's  value  chain,  for example by making technologies that enable progress in terms of vehicle weight, thermal and acoustic insulation of the passenger compartment,  engine  insulation and connectivity even more necessary.\n\nWith regard to public transport, the growth and increasing density  of  urban  areas,  and  the  increasingly  strict regulations  adopted  at  the  local  level  on  pollution automatically  lead  to  a  growing  demand  for  transport solutions  that  are  effective  in  energy  terms,  connected, easier  to  maintain,  and  that  offer  users  a  higher  level  of safety  and  comfort.  In  particular,  this  means  putting lighter,  and  therefore  less  fuel-consuming  and  less  GHGemitting, fleets into service. In maritime  transport, decarbonization also involves the deployment of technologies  that  save  weight,  for  example  for  cruise ships, and thus significantly reduce fuel consumption.\n\nIn 2022, the aviation sector, which has suffered an historic drop  in  activity  volume  due  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic, already returned to a level equivalent to 85% of that of the pre-crisis  operations  in  Europe,  and  is  expected  to  catch up  as  early  as  2025 (30) ,  a  trend  that  covers  different situations  between  types  of  companies  (i.e.,  historical  or low cost) and geographical areas (Asia lagging behind in 2022  due  to  the  persistence  of  restrictive  measures  to combat Covid-19). The global development of this sector is  responding  to  a  strong  structural  trend  of  increasing\n\n(29)\n\nIdem.\n\n## STRATEGY\n\nThe Group's environment\n\ndemand  for  both  business  flights,  tourism  and  affinity travel. However, this remains a promising market with very strong  medium-  and  long-term  growth,  with  negligible impact  from  the  crisis  on  the  need  for  new  aircraft  by 2040,  estimated  at  more  than  43,000  aircraft,  doubling the global fleet of commercial aircraft (31) .\n\n## Other industries\n\nGlobal industrial production is expected to grow by 2.6% per  annum  over  the  decade  2022-2030 (32) . In  this positive context, all segments of this business sector are gradually moving  towards decarbonization  of  their operations  in  general  and  their  industrial  processes  in particular , which requires massive financial investments.\n\nSome  of  the  segments  in  which  Saint -Gobain  is positioned should experience faster growth, for example, the health sector. Thus, the transition of the glass industry (which emits more than 80 million tonnes of CO2 per year) to carbon neutrality at global level, involves both the use of  new  energies  and  significant  needs  in  terms  of innovative  refractory  solutions  for  glass  furnaces.  The constant  expansion  of renewable  energies , which  is essential  for  achieving  the  decarbonization  objectives  of the  economy in  general  and  heavy  industry  in  particular, generates strong structural growth needs for flat glass and specialty glass (in the case of solar energy) and glass fiber (in  the  case  of  wind  energy). The expected development of hydrogen leads to a growth in the market for advanced solutions  such  as  technical  zircon  powders  used  to manufacture  the  high-temperature  electrolyzers  required in  this  industrial  process.  Another  example  is  that  in  the the  steel  industry ,  the  use  of  low-carbon  technologies  such  as  grinding  wheels  for  rolling  mills  -are  among  the solutions for manufacturers to move towards lower energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Steelmakers, as well as aluminum manufacturers, are also in demand for refractory  solutions  involved  in  the  design  of  new  lowcarbon  furnaces.  Finally,  the  growth  of  industries  using refractory and ceramic materials generates, mechanically, greater needs in terms of the collection and recycling of\n\nthese materials.",

Based  on  a mapping  of  its  stakeholders,  Saint -Gobain  identified priority  issues  and  carried  out  a  materiality  matrix,  i.e.,  a graphic representation of the importance of these issues, based on the expectations of stakeholders and the vision of the Group's management teams.\n\nThe  materiality  matrix  published  by  Saint -Gobain  was reviewed in 2020 with the help of Mazars. The following methodological principles have been adopted:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify  priority  issues,  based  on  the  documentation available on the Group, its activities and its environment;\n\n\u00cb\n\n- \u00b7 Share these issues with its main stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 Prioritize these issues by  comparing  stakeholder expectations against management's vision.\n\nA  methodology  note  is  available  on  the  Group  website. The assessment is based on information gathered during interviews  with  experts,  customer  surveys,  employee surveys,  minutes  of  meetings  with  various  stakeholders, and  internal  interviews.  For  example,  interviews  with external  stakeholders  conducted  in  the  context  of  the Group's  corporate  purpose  or  the  'me@Saint -Gobain' survey conducted among Group employees were included in the analysis, as were the Group's transformations as part of the 'Transform & Grow' program in 2019-2020.",

The Group aims to continue its growth and become leader in most of its markets,  by  outperforming  its  competitors.  This ambition implies, through its values, actions and commitments, transforming  the  market  and  guiding change, becoming a reference for all its stakeholders : its employees, its professional customers in the construction and industrial  sectors,  its  end  consumers,  regulators,  and local communities, the media and citizens. Being a leader also means being a pioneer and paving the way for others, constantly innovating with and for the entire ecosystem in which Saint -Gobain operates.\n\nThe Group's value proposition is reflected in the marketing of  alternative  solutions  to  traditional  construction,  by means of constructive modes and lighter products, which are both more sustainable and more efficient, maximizing its  environmentally  friendly  impact on  the  entire  value chain  (for  example,  by  reducing  GHG  emissions  over  the entire  life  cycle  of  its  solutions,  by  making  it  easier  to modify,  deconstruct  or  reassign  buildings,  by  enabling gains  on  all  types  of  comfort,  or  by  increasing  the productivity of the Group's customers and all professionals), while minimizing the footprint of Saint -Gobain's  operations  (particularly  by  reducing  CO2 emissions  in  logistics  flows  and  industrial  processes,  as well as the decrease in the consumption of non-renewable natural resources and waste production).\n\n\u00cb\n\nSaint -Gobain's continued growth is achieved through the 'Grow & Impact' strategic plan announced at the end of 2021  (see  below,  section  2.3).  It  is  based  on  solid fundamentals:  while  it  is  one  of  the  oldest  companies  of European  origin,  with  more  than  three  centuries  of existence (see section 1.2.1, p. 14), the Group has also been able to transform rapidly and profoundly in recent years. This  is  how  Saint -Gobain  has  developed  one-third  of  its business portfolio by making around 100 acquisitions and nearly 70 disposals in recent years. This development also assumes a disciplined financial approach (see section 2.3.7, p. 68). This is primarily reflected in dynamic management within  its  scope,  through  value-creating  acquisitions  and targeted  disposals  of  underperforming  businesses.  The Group made major acquisitions in 2021 and 2022, such as those of Chryso and GCP, to establish itself as a worldwide leader in the fast-growing -and essential for decarbonization  of  the  industry  -  construction  chemicals segment. Saint -Gobain has also made strategic investments  for  the  future  in  order  to  increase  its production capacity and upgrade its systems. Under this plan,  Saint -Gobain  has  set ambitious  targets  for  the 2021-2025 period (34) organic growth of between 3% and 5%;  an  operating  margin  of  between  9%  and  11%;  and  a return  on  invested  capital  between  12%  and  15%.  The Group also aims to align its geographical profile with the growth regions of its markets, with the aim of balancing its presence  between  Western  Europe  (55%  of  its  sales), North  America  (20%)  and  emerging  countries  (25%).  In terms  of  markets,  Saint -Gobain's  objective  is  to  maintain its balance between 20% of sales from the global business lines and 80% for the Group's local customers.",

In this context, the word 'Grow' refers to the Group's determination to pursue its growth by designing, producing and distributing innovative, efficient  and  sustainable  solutions.  The  word  'Impact'  refers  to  the  responsibility  of  having  a  positive  impact  on everyone's lives while ensuring personal and collective well-being. This strategic plan, adopted for a period of four years,  is  therefore  just  the  beginning;  it  is  a  transformation  lever  to  enable  Saint -Gobain  to  make  a  significant contribution to meeting the global challenges of decarbonization, circularity and the search for a better living for all (see chapter 3, p. 70).\n\nAs  part  of  the  'Grow  &  Impact'  plan,  Saint -Gobain  has identified  clear  medium-term  objectives:  leverage  the opportunities offered by the evolution of the renovation market in Europe , drawing on its very dense coverage and its leading position as a solution provider, develop its role in the lightweight construction market (see section 2.3.5, p. 64),  particularly  in  North  America  and  emerging countries, through its portfolio of solutions for residential and commercial buildings; capitalizing on its technological lead  and  innovation  potential  to provide to its  industrial customers (particularly  in  the  construction  and  mobility sectors) solutions  to  make  progress  in  the  field  of sustainable development , on the decarbonization, circularity, and well-being fronts.\n\nIn 2021, the first year of the plan was already characterized by historical performance , with organic revenue growth of +18% compared to 2020 and nearly 14% compared to 2019. Saint -Gobain had thus delivered remarkable performance on particularly promising underlying markets over the long term. This success can also be seen from an environmental\n\n## 2.3.2 A SOLUTIONS-BASED APPROACH\n\nThe  combination  of  a  global  presence  and  an  extensive offering allows Saint -Gobain to offer market participants a solution-based approach combining several products and services. Beyond the traditional approach of best meeting a specific need with a dedicated product, the objective is to support  clients  dealing  with  complex  issues  by offering them sustainability and performance benefits, or contribution  to  sustainable  development .  In  Poland,  for example, the Group launched a comprehensive catalog of partition  solutions  and  building  elements  using  of  five branded  Saint -Gobain  products:  Ecophon,  Glassolutions, Isover,  Rigips  and  Weber.  Designed  for  architects  and contractors, it is also intended for all persons involved in the construction process (individual investors, appraisers, etc.) as it provides practical and reliable information on all technical parameters, facilitates the collection of documentation  required  for  the  project,  and  describes Saint -Gobain's solutions.\n\nThe Group's organization by country and market enables it to be as close as possible to its customers, anticipate their expectations and offer them the appropriate solutions. By combining its skills, inventing and offering new services, implementing  its  full  potential  for  innovation,  and strengthening  synergies  between  its  business  lines, Saint -Gobain offers integrated solutions that better meet its customers' expectations. This approach, which represents a major differentiating factor for Saint -Gobain, is implemented in several areas.\n\nand  societal  point  of  view,  with  carbon  emissions  still falling in 2021 (-27% vs 2017 on scope 1 and 2 emissions), in line with the 2030 target of -33% vs 2017 and the goal of contributing to carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nFor  the  entire  period  covered  by  the  'Grow  &  Impact' plan,  the  Group  is  continuing  its  transformation  in  a methodical  and  disciplined  manner  in  order  to  serve  its strategic priorities: accelerate its growth to exceed that of its  markets;  strengthen  its  leading  role  in  contributing  to building  a  'low-carbon'  economy;  strengthening  the Group's  profile  as  part  of  a  dynamic  of  targeted acquisitions and divestments that create value; maintain a very  good  level  of  margin,  with  a  constant  focus  on  the differential  between  prices  and  costs;  continuing  strong free  cash  flow  generation;  continuing  its  operational excellence  program;  maintaining  structural  improvement in its working capital requirement while maintaining good inventory  levels;  and,  finally,  stepping  up  its  industrial investments.\n\nThis  is firstly developing  cross-selling , in particular through  vertical  market  solutions,  with  joint  sales  forces mastering  a  whole  portfolio  of  brands,  with  training services for professional customers and end consumers, or even with specialized sales channels. Many of the teams in the 75 countries where Saint -Gobain operates have pooled their sales forces and adjusted their sales conditions to sell solutions  from  several  construction  brands  to  the  same customers. This is  the  case,  for  example,  in  Brazil,  where four  brands  have  been  grouped  within  joint  sales  teams, allowing  them  to  approach  all  types  of  decision-maker together, from the requirement writer to distribution. This approach makes it possible, in concrete terms, to meet all customer expectations by combining additional Saint -Gobain materials for the same project. In the case of the construction or renovation of a school, the Group can therefore  make  use  of  all  solutions  in  terms  of  thermal, acoustic  and  visual  comfort  by  providing  solutions  for partitions,  floors,  ceilings  and  glazing.  In  this  case,  the architect's  work  is  greatly  facilitated,  and  the  Group exploits the full range of its know-how while increasing the volume of its sales. Another illustration of this principle is that, in the case  of  the  shipbuilding  market,  the 'Saint -Gobain Marine' Business Unit offers the opportunity to find all the Group's solutions that meet the demanding needs  of  this  sector,  all  in  the  same  place,  from  fire protection  to  acoustic  performance,  and  weight,  fuel consumption (and therefore CO \u2082 emission) reduction. With this  unique  organization,  customers  benefit  from  full support  and  optimal  contact  with  each  of  the  brands.

        "page_content": "## STRATEGY\n\nThe strategic approach\n\nreplacement automotive glazing, and Saint -Gobain Surface Solutions have combined their sales approach in order to offer customers a more comprehensive range of solutions.\n\nThis  involves offering  systems , i.e., a  combination  of products and services, which guarantee a given technical performance  and  often  combine  benefits  in  terms  of sustainable development and productivity. This approach corresponds  to  a  growing  demand  from  customers because it brings benefits in terms of efficiency and speed; because it responds to a growing shortage of skilled labor; and  because  it  responds  to  an  increasing  demand  for system-wide performance and not a product or material. It is also a strong differentiating factor for Saint -Gobain.\n\nThis  approach  includes  prefabrication,  light  fa\u00e7ades, partition  systems,  building  science,  High  Performance Solutions,  and  connected  glazing  solutions.  The  same product, offered as part of a system, can itself result from the combination of several products owing to collaboration  between  the  various  Group  entities.  For example,  there  is  the  case  of  GlasrocX,  a  solution proposed  by  Rigips,  which  combines  an  Adfors  nonwoven  sail  with  a  Gyproc  board  and  offers  benefits  of protection against moisture both inside and outside. This solution  is  complemented  by  the  application  of  mortars developed by Weber. Also worthy of mention are the DuoTech  (France)  and  SilentFx  (United  States)  special acoustic plasterboard solutions, consisting of two plasterboards bonded with the special Greenglue adhesive,  which  improves  the  acoustics  of  the  solution while  remaining  flexible,  avoiding  the  creation  of  an acoustic bridge and ensuring perfect bonding.\n\nIn many countries, the external technical insulation system (ITE  or  ETICS),  offered  by  Weber,  combines  Weber coatings, Isover insulating materials and the Adfors grid to build  a  certified  system.  In  the  Middle  East  and  Spain, Saint -Gobain recently launched a new light fa\u00e7ade system consisting  of  GX  plasterboards  combined  with  Isover insulating  materials,  which  are  complemented  by  the application of Weber plasters. This creates new technology  fa\u00e7ades  with  a  traditional  rendering  that respects the aesthetics of the environment but offers the qualities of resistance to local climatic conditions. Another example, through the Optimax solution, which results from the  combination  of  a  Habito  board  with  a  fastening accessory and good mechanical glass wool, Placo\u00ae-Isover offers a fast and convenient system in terms of installation in France while guaranteeing the same performance.\n\nThis  solution-based  approach  consists  finally  of  offering services,  and  thus  ever  more  options  to  the  Group's customers across the entire value chain. This is notably the case  in  the  field  of  shared  logistics  and  kitting  services, intermediation  platforms,  after-sales  services,  automated warehouses,  recycling  services  and  digital  solutions.  In Finland,  for  example,  distributors  can  combine  solutions from the three Weber, Isover and Gyproc brands as part of the same  delivery,  which  facilitates  their inventory management while improving the level of service to their own customers.\n\nBy  means  of  this  approach,  Saint -Gobain  improves  its competitive edge by offering integrated offers for a wide range  of  situations ,  from  the  renovation  of  single-family homes,  hospitals,  schools,  and  collective  housing,  to  the construction  of  new  offices  and  collective  and  individual housing,  green  mobility  and  the  decarbonization  of industry.\n\n## 2.3.3 LEVERAGING DATA AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES\n\n## Accelerate digital technology, leverage the data revolution\n\nDigital  technology  has  already  transformed  all  of  the business sectors in which Saint -Gobain operates (see  section  2.1.2,  p.  47).  The  Group  approaches  this subject as a lever for progress and  performance improvement,  and  also  as  a  cross-functional  challenge, which  concerns  both  its  internal  operations  (industrial processes, management,  employee  engagement),  its relations  with  its  suppliers,  its  customers  and  other stakeholders,  as  well  as  its  social  and  environmental responsibility.\n\nData, the fuel of the 21st century, is becoming increasingly important  in  Saint -Gobain's  model.  It  has  become  an essential lever in all its dimensions; owing to the collection of  an  increasing  volume  of  data ,  the  commissioning  of new algorithms and the deployment of new technologies , it is now  possible  to  obtain  a  much  more  precise knowledge of the real situation, and thus prevent, predict and model scenarios, all of which help decision-making in all business sectors.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Industry\n\nDigital technology has totally transformed factory organization:  machines  are  connected  in  real  time  and data  analysis  allows  for  better  control  of  production processes,  more  rapid  resolution  of  any  technical  issues and, more generally, an increase in operational efficiency. Digital technology  also  helps customize deliverables further  along  the  value  chain  and  opens  up  further opportunities for co-development. Plant engineers use the data  to  better  understand  the  complex  dynamics  of manufacturing  chains,  which  helps  to  better  control industrial  processes  and  thus  improve  efficiency,  deploy predictive  maintenance  approaches,  as  well  as  reduce variability, defects,  waste,  energy  and  raw  material consumption,  and  greenhouse  gas  production.  This  is an essential  level  for  progress  in  achieving  the  Group's decarbonization (see  section  3.3,  p.  100) and  circularity (see  section  3.4,  p.  115)  objectives.  This  fourth  industrial revolution,  or  ' Industry  4.0 ',  is  also  based  on advanced automation  and  robotization  of  industrial  tasks .  Within the  Group,  thousands  of  robots  and  automatic  trolleys perform repetitive tasks in complete safety. Operators are connected  and  are  assisted  by  the  use  of  augmented reality,  which  is  particularly  effective  for  maintenance  or troubleshooting.  With  production  units  where  software and  machine  tools  interact  directly  with  each  other, a number of applications have been made possible , such as the  real-time  monitoring  of  production,  automated  alert systems,  predictive  maintenance  and  product  quality optimization, by reducing both costs and the quantity of resources  and  energy  employed.  As  an  example,  the 'Construction Industry' Business Unit uses software based",

Reducing the cost of data storage and the price of sensors has contributed to the introduction of tools to assess and monitor production in real time , such as edge computing solutions, based on a nano-computer equipped with open-source artificial intelligence software for key systems. This approach, launched, for example, in the abrasives manufacturing plants in India, constitutes a first step towards the development of multi-factory global artificial  intelligence  solutions,  using  data  storage  and enrichment. In total, more than 60% of Saint -Gobain's main industrial sites are already connected to the Group's digital\n\n## STRATEGY\n\nThe strategic approach\n\nmanufacturing  hub,  thus  creating  a  digital  production ecosystem.\n\nDigital  technology and data are also used to protect the health  and  safety of  operators  working  on  the  Group's industrial  sites.  Within  the  'Surface  Solutions'  Business Unit, an application based on data collection enables users to  minimize  their  daily  exposure  to  vibrations,  thus preserving  their  health  and  safety,  while  increasing productivity.\n\n## Customer relations\n\nBeyond  the  optimization  of  industrial  processes  and  logistics,  data  is  the  key  to  Saint -Gobain's  transformation  into  a solution  provider,  (see  section  2.3.2,  p.  57)  thanks  to  the  in-depth  knowledge  of  customers  provided  by  the  multiple points of contact between them and the Group throughout the value chain, and the mass of data they generate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the retail sector, Saint -Gobain's digital platforms enable rapid  digitization  of  interactions  with  customers.  The deployment of advanced data analysis systems based on artificial intelligence enables a better understanding of the customer  and  therefore  a  greater  proximity  to  them,  as well as an increase in sales and profit margin.\n\nNew innovations are constantly supporting the consolidation  of  relations  with  business  customers;  at CEDEO,  this  means,  for  example,  the  establishment  of 'click & collect' lockers to simplify the lives of craftsmen, who sometimes have to go to work outside their branch's opening hours. They can place an order online and retrieve it in lockers at any time, day or night. At Point.P, the rollout of digital systems for professionals allows them to be ever more efficient and to continue to develop their skills, always in line with the sector's developments. Configurators, simulators, software, etc. - the brand offers a  wide  range  of  digital  systems:  Solu+,  Cap  Renov+, Tolteck and the 'Objectif RGE' application, which prepares craftsmen for the RGE certification examination ('Recognized Environmental Guarantor').\n\n## Relations with suppliers\n\nDigital  technology  is  also  changing  the  way  we  interact with  suppliers.  Digitization  of  supplier  processes  requires centralization  of  the  Purchasing  Department  and  the automation of traditional tasks, notably through electronic auctions  using  new  online  tools.  Campaigns  to  monitor suppliers'  e-reputation  have  also  been  undertaken,  with significant  outcomes,  to  identify  potential  problems  and promote a responsible purchasing policy.\n\n## 3D, a driver of acceleration and performance\n\n3D  continues  to  grow  across  all  Saint -Gobain  Business Units: it is now deployed on more than four continents, in the glass business as well as those dedicated to mobility, insulation, roofing and fa\u00e7ades. The unique ability offered by three-dimensional visualization to model the properties and  structure  of  the  most  complex  materials,  combined with  data  science  to  boost  the  marketing  and  product development approach, allows for a faster time to market. In particular, it has enabled the development of more than 50 new products in the roofing business in North America. In  all  stages  of  construction  or  renovation  projects,  the digital  model,  or  Building  Information  Modeling  (BIM), which offers an integrated vision of the building during all stages of its life cycle through a 'digital twin', modifies the very  design  of  buildings,  and  allows  custom  parts  to  be cut in the factory, with customized deliveries on site. This technological revolution paves the way for an increase in the Group's sales; it maximizes Saint -Gobain's contribution to the productivity of its business customers, with savings of up to 30% in terms of installation time, and also offers considerable  room  for  improvement  when  it  comes  to minimizing  their  environmental  footprint,  with  savings  of up  to  20%  of  waste  produced  during  the  installation phase, moving towards zero waste.",

        "page_content": "## STRATEGY\n\nThe strategic approach\n\n## Structure the organization, recruit employees, attract talent\n\nIn  2022,  the  Group's  'Digital  and  Information  Systems' function continued its development in order to continue to move  towards  a  project-oriented  and  business-oriented approach.  Rather  than  a  traditional  approach  based  on infrastructure,  this  is  about  directing  the  Group's  efforts and resources to support all  teams  on  the  ground,  in  an agile way,  to  enable  them  to  make  the  most  of Saint -Gobain's  organization,  which  gives  priority  to  local resources,  while  deploying  the  strength  of  a  global organization.\n\nTo disseminate the data-related approach successfully, it is  essential  to  allow  all  of  its  employees  to  embrace  this technological revolution; for this reason, the DnA Academy,  launched  in  2019  in  three  countries  (Poland, France  and  Spain)  to  accelerate  the  transition  to  a  data culture  in  the  industry,  is  now  expanding  to  other activities.  Today,  several  thousand  people  within  the Group have participated in awareness training, and several hundred of them have pursued this approach by training in programming and machine learning. The DnA Academy continues to develop and adapt to needs, particularly for the supply chain, marketing and all management professions, as well as for engineers and data specialists.\n\nThis  global  approach  is  complemented  locally  by  DnA Hubs, which bring together data science specialists, local IT  managers,  and  managers  to  identify  and  propose promising  use  cases.  In  general,  the  Group  deploys  its technologies step by step, convinced that early, inexpensive advances can quickly be a source of progress; this  involves  deploying  agile  approaches  through  the testing of local solutions in proof of concept mode, some of which will then be repeated in order to be rolled out to larger scopes. In India, the DnA Garage extracts the value through advanced analysis of the data collected through all of the Group's local activities, from internal and external\n\nsources.  The  meeting  of  data  specialists,  engineers, translators  -  experts  linked  to  business  priorities  -  and application  developers  helps  identify  use  cases,  design models, develop pilots, and support projects that focus on customer  knowledge,  marketing  analysis  and  operational efficiency.\n\nIn  addition,  Saint -Gobain  is  reinventing  its  methods  by adding a growing  number  of  talents  in  software engineering  and  data  expertise.  These  include  data analysts and data engineers, who build data pools to store, clean and test them.\n\n## Data for sustainability\n\nData collection and analysis are also an essential lever to enable  Saint -Gobain  to  achieve  its  development  and transformation objectives in terms of GHG emissions and circularity of the economy.  The  Placo\u00ae  factory  in Chamb\u00e9ry  (France)  rolled  out  a  data  collection  and analysis project, which optimized manufacturing processes to  minimize  the  consumption  of  raw  materials  and  the quantity  of  non-compliant  products,  thereby  increasing energy sobriety and improving its economic and environmental  balance  sheet.  The  general  collection  of data and its processing using algorithms are essential for monitoring  the  progress  made  towards  decarbonization, and  in  particular  the  quantified  CO2  reduction  targets assigned to each Group plant. In plasterboard production plants, the deployment of sensors and a detailed analysis of real-time data have enabled the precise management of gas  combustion  using  an  algorithm  that  adapts  the intensity  of  the  dryers.  In  order  to  achieve  the  ambitious objectives  of  decarbonization  and  preservation  of  raw materials faced by the construction sector, this data-based approach  must  be  considered  across  the  entire  value chain,  taking  into  account  production  and  logistics  notably  by  using  digital  modeling  tools  -  and  more generally throughout the entire life cycle of the solutions that the Group provides to the markets.\n\n## 2.3.4 A CLIENT-CENTRIC KIND OF INNOVATION PROCESS\n\n## A - Putting the customer at the heart of innovation\n\nThe  environment  in  which  Saint -Gobain  operates  is  a rapidly changing world, subject to fundamental trends on a global scale (see section 2.1.1, p. 43), massively digitized (see section 2.1.1.D, p. 45), and where there are very high expectations in terms of energy sobriety, the fight against climate  change and limiting the use of natural resources, as well as productivity to deal with a growing shortage of labor  specialized  in  construction  and  renovation.  In  a complex  model  such  as  Saint -Gobain  (see  section  3.1.1, p.  72)  the  methodologies  applied  to  innovation  must necessarily evolve. It is only by means of its technological and  environmental  innovation  capacity  that  Saint -Gobain is the  leader  in  sustainable  construction.  In  essence, innovation is a non-linear process, which requires time to ask  the  right  questions  before  converging  towards solutions.  It  presents  itself  in  three  essential  facets: knowledge of the customer's needs, scalability, and value creation.\n\n## Cultivating proximity with the Group's customers\n\nThe  collective  approach  to  innovation  applies  both internally  and  more  broadly,  including  Saint -Gobain's stakeholders outside the organization, primarily among its customers.  This  approach  to  innovation,  geared  to  the outside  of  the  organization,  leads  to  open  and  crossfunctional methods, involving all of the Group's teams. The main  objective  is  to  better  understand  the  specific expectations of customers in each of the Group's markets, in  order  to  identify  use  cases  and  situations  where Saint -Gobain will  bring  value,  reduce  time  to  market  and optimize  return  on  investment.  For architects and engineers , this means technical support, ease of collaboration,  and  ease  of  testing  new  products  and solutions;  for craftsmen  and  building  contractors , this involves  the  supply  of  products  and  materials,  access  to distribution sites, ease of installation, advice on installation, and  project  management  support;  for developers ,  this  is the  total  cost  of  ownership,  on-time  delivery,  and  advice to  help  anticipate  changes  in  standards;  for owners  and occupants of  buildings,  this  concerns  in  particular  the multiple dimensions of comfort, customization, maintenance costs and property prices. In addition to the diversity  of  business  sectors, the  diversity  of  situations and expectations in each geographical region must also be taken into account. For tropical or semi-tropical areas, X-terium  plasterboards,  an  innovation  by  Saint -Gobain Plaka, with their high resistance to moisture - avoiding, for",

This  is  why  Saint -Gobain's eight  cross-functional  R&D  centers  are  deployed  all  over the  world  (France,  Germany,  the  United  States,  China, India, Brazil), as close as possible to local situations.\n\nIf customer  knowledge  is  acquired  in  particular  by managing  the  customer  relationship,  collecting  and analyzing  data  (see  in  this  chapter,  section  2.3.3,  p.  58), innovation seen through the prism of co-development is carried  out  through  a  full  range  of  tools  and  initiatives: deployment of training and methodologies, investments in test  benches,  development  of  real  or  virtual  prototyping resources to accelerate customer validation, and creation of  specific  locations.  'Design  thinking'  approaches  and user  experience  in  the  development  of  new  products, systems and services are also deployed in the various R&D centers. For the Group's industrial customers, Saint -Gobain's High Performance Solutions are particularly concerned by this approach.\n\nThe  Group's  distribution  activities  (see  section  1.4.2.B.g, p.  32)  are  also  a  valuable  tool  for  developing  a  more detailed  knowledge  of  the  market  needs,  owing  to  the proximity with the customers that they make possible.\n\n## Multiply approaches\n\nAs a result,  the  R&D  teams  are  able  to  run  scenarios  for the  use  of  different  prototypes  and  to  evaluate,  modify and  propose  solutions  that  meet  the  expectations  of customers  in  the  mobility  or  construction  industry markets.  The  determined  response  that  Saint -Gobain has given  to  the  consequences  of  the  pandemic  has  proven that  this  priority  given  to  customer  relationship  can  be satisfactorily  and  productively  maintained  through  digital initiatives  such  as  virtual  tours,  real-time  and  remote brainstorming,  or  virtual  and  augmented  reality.  Finally, teams of building science specialists, present in the various R&D  centers  around  the  world,  are  working  to  improve comfort  continuously  for  end  users  and  the  ease  of installation for craftsmen, as well as to reduce total cost of ownership for building owners. In Germany, the Rigips and Isover Development Center team (Ladenburg) has put this approach  into  practice  by  involving  customers  in  the creative  process,  from  reflection  to  the  creation  of prototypes.  With  its  'Smart  Gypsum'  showroom,  Rigips has  developed a unique initiative:  to  generate  innovation and creativity in the same place and to develop solutions that meet the real needs of customers and their practical requirements. Specialists in smart homes have been added around  professionals  from  construction  companies  or manufacturers  of  prefabricated  houses.  Meetings  and focus  groups  gathered  concerns,  expectations  and  their vision for construction over the next 5 to 10 years.\n\n## STRATEGY\n\nThe strategic approach\n\n## B - Place innovation at the heart of all the solutions provided by Saint -Gobain\n\nSince  it  was  founded,  the  Group  has  consistently  placed research and innovation at the heart of its strategy. Nearly 400  patents  are  filed  every  year  by  Saint -Gobain. Saint -Gobain's efforts focus on research-based innovation, particularly  in  terms  of  products  and  manufacturing processes,  but  they  also  apply  to  other  fields,  such  as innovation  in  business  models  and  in  services.  They  are guided by several priority areas:\n\nFor the construction markets , innovation includes advanced technologies such as prefabrication and robotization. Construction solutions via three-dimensional printing  minimize  the  use  of  materials,  facilitate  more advanced customization possibilities, and promote an 80% faster  construction  process.  Composite  exterior  thermal insulation systems, installed on lightweight fa\u00e7ade frames, combine within the Group the expertise of the construction  trades  and  those  of  High  Performance Solutions.  They  allow  the  amount  of  CO2  to  be  divided between  two  and  four  compared  to  concrete  wall solutions, and represent a weight saving of 85% compared to traditional walls, with the corresponding gains in terms of  speed  and  safety  during  installation.  In  the  area  of glazing, the iWin solution launched in 2022 by Saint -Gobain  Glass  brings  big  data  into  the  stream, transforming each insulated glass element into a traceable resource throughout its life cycle, before, during and after its use, from installation to recycling. Innovation is evident in all areas of construction with, for example, Saint -Gobain Building  Glass  having  developed  Miralite  Easysafe  safety mirrors,  manufactured  in  one  step  through  a  process combining paint, silver and anti-chip resin. By integrating a new 'hemp concrete'  activity  into  its  range  of  solutions, Weber  has  enhanced  its  strategic  offering  of  'ecocommitted'  products  and  services.  Another  example  of innovation that promotes  greater respect for the environment and the transition to the circular economy is the  Group's  workshops  in  Switzerland,  which  provide solutions  that  combine  Isover  glass  wools  with  wooden constructions  for  construction  sites  throughout  Europe. Still  in  the  construction  field,  Placo\u00ae  has  marketed  a modular solution of self-porting and adjustable structures for  all  types  of  needs,  the  Placo\u00ae  Cube  system,  which meets  the  ever-increasing  expectations  of  the  market  in terms  of  privacy,  acoustic  comfort  and  storage  of construction materials. Saint -Gobain is fully committed to the digital transformation of construction, as evidenced by the  three  Manufacturing  Leadership  Awards  received  in 2022  by  CertainTeed  and  Saint -Gobain  Research  North America.  These  awards  reward  industrial  companies  for their  innovations  in  digital  transformation.  In  distribution, innovation is reflected in the design of integrated services for  craftsmen  or  contracting  authorities  and  project managers on construction or renovation projects.",

        "page_content": "## STRATEGY\n\nThe strategic approach\n\nFor mobility ,  innovation  helps  improve  vehicle  comfort (noise,  vibration,  aerodynamics,  thermal  comfort,  etc.), reduces the overall weight of the vehicle, and enables the development of new features and uses in terms of safety, information  and  entertainment.  Lightened  glazing  thus increases  the  range  of  electric  vehicles  and  improves energy efficiency. In India, Vistadome trains are equipped with Saint -Gobain Glass solutions that provide brightness, thermal insulation and  soundproofing.  Innovation  is present  across  the  transport  market,  for  example,  with Solar Gard, the global leader in glass and protective films, developing  a  range  of  antimicrobial  products  with unparalleled  clarity.  In  space,  the  solutions  offered  by Omniseal  are  essential  for  the  smooth  running  of spacecraft  launch  operations,  both  for  carriers  and onboard satellites.\n\nIn the industry , the  goal  is  to  innovate  to  enable Saint -Gobain customers to decarbonize their processes.\n\n## C - Encourage creative thinking, adapt methods\n\nInnovation  is  one  of  the  five  'Attitudes',  the  pillars  of Saint -Gobain's management  culture. This implies a deliberately collective approach. Innovation is always born from  a  team,  different  people  coming  together,  chance and  serendipity;  it  presupposes  a  gathering  of  forces, different points of view. It also benefits from failures, which enable progress on the condition that their teams keep the right  state  of  mind.  Being  open-minded  and  thinking outside the box, taking original paths, questioning practices inherited from  the  past  to  suggest  and experiment  with  new  ones:  these  are  some  of  the  skills exploited by all Saint -Gobain's employees.\n\nIn  terms  of  operational  management,  this  assumes  that Saint -Gobain adapts its organization and methods in order to  create  conditions  for  creativity,  encourage  empathy with customers to spread co-development, give its space to  divergent  thinking,  spread  agile  methods,  tolerate failure  -  hence  the  'Grow  from  failure'  training  program available  on  the  Boost  platform  -  as  well  as  to  promote open  innovation.  Among  the  initiatives  put  in  place,  the Group  has  rolled  out  Innovation  Catalysts,  committed employees,  trained  in  the  mindset,  methodology  and innovation  tools,  having  developed  specific  skills  to  put them  into  practice  effectively,  and  who  support  their colleagues  in  the  implementation  of  their  innovation projects, both internally and externally.\n\nThe reorganization of Saint -Gobain enables the innovation process  to  move  away  from  a  silo  approach,  freeing  up strong  synergies  across  the  Group.  In  2022,  the  Group completely  reviewed  the  organization  of  innovation, notably  by  tightening  the  links  between  R&D,  marketing and the new 'Innovation Development' Department.\n\n\u00cb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore  generally,  it  involves  providing  all  employees  with information and tools to innovate, thereby developing new skills, and acquiring, mastering and disseminating appropriate methodologies internally. The central objective  is  to foster  an  innovative  mindset .  It  is  about cultivating curiosity and empathy with customers and the courage to challenge achievements and assumptions. The aim is also to build diverse teams, which are in a position to  seek  solutions,  design  prototypes  and  judge  the applicability and viability of the solutions conceived, at all times.  Initially developed  for  the  High  Performance Solutions  (HPS)  scope,  the  Saint -Gobain  Innovation  Hub exchange,  mutual  assistance  and  resources  platform  is gradually  expanding  to  offer  the  entire  Group  the necessary  training  and  tools  to  bring  innovation  projects to a successful conclusion.\n\n## D - Approaching innovation in ecosystem mode: open innovation and co-innovation\n\nTo complement its in-house capabilities, Saint -Gobain has been deploying its innovative approach through exchanges  and  partnerships  around  the  world  with  its customers  and  suppliers,  with  an  ecosystem  of  start-ups and via scientific collaborations and partnerships with the academic world.\n\n## Scientific and academic cooperation\n\nThe  SUN  international  network  of  universities  is  the framework  for  long-term  academic  collaboration that provides access to the most recent scientific advances in the  fields  of  interest  to  the  Group  and  to  a  rich  pool  of young  talents.  More  specifically, this leads to the establishment  of  partnerships  with  various  institutions  in the  data  science  and  artificial  intelligence  fields.  For example, the German Textile and Fiber Research Institutes and  Saint -Gobain's  'C\u00e9ramiques'  Business  Unit  have signed  an  agreement  to  jointly  develop  solutions  in  the field of metal oxide ceramic fibers. It is therefore expected that ceramic fiber, already widely used in the industry to protect itself from high temperatures, is to be improved in the coming years.",

        "page_content": "## Open innovation and cooperation with start-ups\n\nThrough  NOVA,  a  unique  structure  created  in  2006, Saint -Gobain plays an active role within the global start-up ecosystem. NOVA aims to enable disruptive innovation by identifying  opportunities  for  long-term  partnerships  and turning these into a reality. It also favors the development of new ideas and business models.\n\n## Identify adequate projects\n\nIn order to select the most relevant projects aligned with the  Group's  strategy,  in  a  win-win  approach  for  both parties, NOVA  balances  activities across a threedimensional  matrix  based  on  transversal  target  areas  aligned with Saint -Gobain's 'Grow & Impact' strategic plan and its long term growth objectives -, the engagement of internal business unit teams, and geographic coverage.\n\nIn  terms  of  target  fields  of  activity,  NOVA  takes  into account  the  most  important  topics  for  the  entire  Group, such as  the productivity  of  the  construction  businesses , buildings that are both durable and fostering better health, the digital client experience , electrification of transportation ,  industrial energy  transition ,  the circular economy and  high  performance  solutions.  This  approach takes into account aspects related to digitization and the contribution  to  sustainable  development.  It  also  provides targeted  support  to  Saint -Gobain  teams  working  on industrial  markets  such  as  mobility  -  in  particular  on autonomous vehicles - and life sciences.\n\n## Examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 AMT (United Kingdom), a start-up implementing postprocessing of 3D printed polymer components;\n- \u00b7 Fibrecoat  (Germany),  developing  new  fiber-based products for the aerospace industry;\n- \u00b7 Hyperframe (USA), proposing a metal framing system for the construction of commercial buildings;\n- \u00b7 LivSpace  (India),  specializing  in  the  optimization  of office spaces;\n- \u00b7 Mobility Work (France), developing a community-based maintenance management platform;\n- \u00b7 OMNEX (Belgium), producer of expanded glass panels for new buildings, renovations and conversions;\n- \u00b7 Spectralics (Israel), which develops optics and imaging technologies  based  on  wave  control  to  enhance automotive head-up displays;\n- \u00b7 Treble  (Iceland),  a  sound  simulation  platform  with unprecedented levels  of  speed  and  accuracy  enabling real-time audiovisual VR  experiences  of  building designs;\n- \u00b7 Tri'n'Collect  (France),  offering  recycling  services  for construction waste.\n\n## Identifying opportunities through multiple sources\n\nInitiating  relationships  with  startups  takes  place  in  many different  ways:  via  VC  investors,  incubators,  accelerators, as  well  as  through  NOVA's  involvement  in  key  events (ranging  from  the  Climatetech  Summit  in  the  United States to the Africarena Startup Challenge' in South Africa and the CSRtech Summit in China). Internal stakeholders also play an increasingly significant role, showcasing a shift in  Saint -Gobain's  corporate  culture:  more  often  than  not, the  NOVA  team  is  nowadays  introduced  to  start-ups  by local  business  teams,  as  was  the  case  in  Iceland  with Treble.\n\n## STRATEGY\n\nThe strategic approach\n\n## Deploy a variety of collaboration models\n\nNova works with Saint -Gobain teams to set up strategic co-development  partnerships , distribution  or  marketing agreements ,  or  even licensing agreements. Since the end of 2016,  NOVA  has  extended  its  expertise  to  the acquisition of financial stakes in start-ups .  The latter can take several forms: initial investment; follow-up investment in  a  company in which NOVA already has a holding; and investing  via  a  specialist  fund  rather  than  directly.  The total  investment  value  of  NOVA  in  start-ups  to  date amounts to around USD 100 million (at fair market value price). NOVA concentrates on the initial stages in the life of start-ups; Hyperframe, a start-up which has developed a metal framing system for commercial buildings construction,  was  only  a  two-person  company  when  the relationship  with  Saint -Gobain  was  launched  via  an acceleration program with Greentown Labs, a Massachusetts-based climatetech community and incubator  that  brings  together  startups,  corporates, investors, politicians, and others.\n\n## Development: a dynamic of growth\n\nThe  progressive  ramp-up  of  NOVA's  operations  has allowed to build an impressive funnel which led to 1,000 projects being screened in 2022, more than 300 reaching the  stage  of  'active  deals',  and  around  50  projects (including new direct investments, follow-on investments, new fund investments, and joint development/commercial agreements)  closed  during  the  year,  after  due  diligence and final negotiation.\n\n## Investing through dedicated funds\n\nNOVA is also a limited partner in three investment funds targeted  for  the  Group's  business  lines  and  geographical regions:  Navitas  Capital  for  construction  and  Phoenix Venture Partners (PVP) for material sciences, both in the United  States,  and  Environmental  Technologies  Fund (ETF)  in  Europe,  focusing  on  sustainable  development. NOVA has also invested in a new venture fund in China, Richland  Capital,  with  a  focus  on  high-performance solutions.\n\n## Partnering with incubators\n\nTo support its approach, Saint -Gobain has partnered with several incubators through NOVA. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Greentown  Labs  in  the  United  States,  specializing  in green  technologies,  which  opened  a  second  site  in Texas in 2021;\n- \u00b7 Impulse  Labs  in  France,  which  specializes  in  the incubation of construction startups;\n- \u00b7 Cubo in Brazil, a specialist in digitization;\n- \u00b7 Digihub Germany, local hub in Aachen for startups with digital solutions;\n- \u00b7 Polyhub  in  Italy,  incubator  of  Politecnico  di  Milano,  a renowned school in Italy;\n- \u00b7 Tus-Holdings in China, a company that develops, builds, and  manages  TusPark,  the  largest  university  science park in the world;\n- \u00b7 Also  in  China,  the  Impact  Hub  Innovation  Center  in Shanghai.\n\n1\n\n2 2 2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## STRATEGY\n\nThe strategic approach\n\n## Investing in innovation: a testimony to Saint -Gobain's trust in a more open world\n\nWhatever  the  form  of  collaboration  with  startups, Saint -Gobain's  philosophy  is  based  on  three  values:  an approach  that  benefits  all  stakeholders,  a  passion  for learning  and  researching  new  ideas,  and  an  open  and flexible  approach  to  relationships.  NOVA  also  acts  as  a portal  to  the  outside  world ,  helping  to  connect  internal teams  with  new  ways  of  working  and  with  innovation produced outside the Group.\n\n## E - Leveraging innovation to improve environmental performance\n\nThrough  the  dissemination  of  eco-innovation  practices (i.e.,  the  design  of  solutions  with  minimized  impacts  and optimized  benefits  for  the  environment  and  health), innovation is also ultimately emerging as an essential way of  achieving  Saint -Gobain's  objectives  in  the sustainable development field  on  all  measurement  scopes:  on  the Group's  operations,  as  well  as  on  the  upstream  and downstream  parts  of  the  value  chain.  Resulting  from innovation in construction chemistry, new  adhesive mortars  offered  by  Saint -Gobain  enable,  for  example,  a 46% reduction in CO2 emissions, a 28% reduction in water consumption, and a 25% reduction in use of raw materials compared  to  comparable  products;  still  in  construction, the  Adfors  and  Chryso  entities  offer  decarbonization solutions  to  global  players  in  the  sector.  This  approach\n\napplies  to  all  of  the  Group's  activities  and  industrial processes: the first 'low carbon' plasterboard plant will be operational  in  Norway  in  2023,  a  tangible  demonstration of  the  commitment  made  by  Saint -Gobain  to  reduce  its CO2 emissions (scopes 1 and 2) by 33% by 2030 compared to 2017, with a focus on contributing to carbon neutrality by 2050. For its industrial customers, Sefpro and Norton offer  specialty  materials  for  decarbonizing  manufacturing processes. In the field of mobility, brands such as Sekurit and  Norseal  are  marketing  solutions  that  improve  the energy efficiency of electric vehicles.\n\nInnovations such as Placo\u00ae Recycling, for example, enable the Group's professional customers to access a network of 180 approved collectors who recover sorted plaster waste from  construction  sites  in  order  to  be  able  to  prepare them  to  become  a  secondary  material,  recovered  by reintroduction  into  the  manufacturing  process  of  new boards.  Tens  of  thousands  of  tonnes  of  plaster  are recycled each year, accelerating the transition to a circular economy across the entire construction value chain.\n\nIn France, Isover has launched a new biosourced insulation made  of  recycled  textiles:  Isocoton,  a  high-performance biosourced insulating material, made from locally recycled textiles,  soft  to  touch,  easy  to  fit.  This  solution,  which contributes  to  a  more  circular  economy,  provides  the Group's clients with an alternative to traditional solutions for interior insulation of buildings.\n\n## 2.3.5 LEADING TRANSFORMATION IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY\n\nUnlike  a  traditional  construction  whose  massive  walls (bricks, cement, etc.) carry the weight of the building, light construction consists of constructing a skeleton - made of wood, metal, concrete or a combination of these materials - on which light fa\u00e7ade systems and internal partitions are connected. This type of construction, carried out on site or prefabricated -partially or totally -reduces  the environmental impact of  construction  and optimizes the consumption  of  resources while ensuring superior performance . While it is traditional in certain markets, such as individual housing in the United States and Scandinavian  countries, this  approach  is  intended  to develop  very  rapidly  throughout  the  world due  to  the decisive  advantages  it  brings,  particularly  in  terms  of speed of construction. This concerns emerging countries, where  dynamic  demographics  generate  strong  demand for new housing, as well as a series of developed countries, which are suffering from a shortage of residential premises (see section 2.1.2.B, p. 49), and those where qualified labor is  in  short  supply,  as  light  construction  techniques  have particular  advantages  in  terms  of  ease  of  construction, transformation and dismantling. It's about building quickly, better  and  cheaper.  In  France,  the  RE2020  regulation, which  requires  measuring  a  building's  environmental impact throughout its life, will encourage the development of light construction and recycled and recyclable materials with  lower  carbon  intensity.  Many  similar  initiatives  in\n\nSweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States,  Brazil  and  South  Africa  are  moving  in  the  same direction.  Wood  construction,  in  which  Saint -Gobain  has strong  expertise,  offers  significant  growth  prospects  in many  markets,  in  all  construction  segments.  Engineering woods now represent a growing potential for Saint -Gobain:  excellent  alternatives  to  load-bearing  walls, with  laminated  wood  panels  (CLTs)  replacing  those  in reinforced  concrete,  while  poles  or  beams  in  laminated and  glued  (commonly  referred  to  as  GlueLam)  or laminated  wood  (LVL)  replace  steel.  The  lightness  and mechanical  resistance  of  engineering  woods  makes  it possible  to  build  ever  higher  residential  towers,  and  can even  meet  certain  seismic  requirements.  However,  the very nature of the material opens the way to sustainable construction,  with  a  low  carbon  footprint  for  wood construction.  While  it  is  a  popular  solution  for  new properties  (particularly  as  part  of  RE2020),  wood  is  also suitable  for  renovation,  particularly  for  elevations  or extensions.  Wood  construction  also  allows  for  innovative approaches;  the  city  of  L\u00fcbeck  in  Germany  has  chosen Saint -Gobain  Br\u00fcggemann  to  build  a  temporary  primary school with its wooden modules. The interim establishment will be moved after a few years to be used elsewhere for other purposes.\n\n\u00cb",

        "page_content": "Lightweight construction solutions such as fa\u00e7ade systems\n\nand lightweight partitions also provide significant benefits in  terms  of  the  quantity  of  materials  consumed  (-79%  in the case of a residential building (35) ) and greenhouse gas emissions, thus  making  a  crucial  contribution  to  the objectives of construction decarbonization and orientation  towards  a  circular  economy .  Prefabrication techniques consist of manufacturing the various components of a building in a factory, including water and electricity circuits, and assembling them on site. They are a solution  to  the  challenge  of  labor  shortages  and,  with lower production and construction costs ,  they  also  save time by as much as 25-50% as well as delivering of more affordable  housing , meeting  both  the  imperatives  of protecting  household  purchasing  power  in  developed countries  and  providing  decent  and  comfortable  housing for all in emerging economies. Singapore, Australia and the UK are  increasingly  opting  for  modular  buildings  to  deal with  labor  and  housing  shortages;  the  Nordic  countries, such  as  Sweden,  are  already  building  90%  of  individual prefabricated homes. In Norway, Byggsystemer, a subsidiary of the Optimera retailer and leader in its market, is surfing this wave  by  offering  several  types  of prefabrication,  from  pre-distribution  of  wood  to  roof structures  and  ready-to-use  items  for  small  homes  and large buildings. Among the offers developed by the Group, Glasroc  X  plasterboard,  covered  by  a  technical  mineral pulp  developed  by  Adfors,  can  be  used  on  the  fa\u00e7ade, owing  to  its  improved  resistance  to  humidity  and  UV radiation. A new production line dedicated entirely to the manufacture of coated glass matting was opened in 2022 in  the  Czech  Republic.  In  Germany,  in  2021,  Saint -Gobain renovated  a  childcare  center  in  just  three  months,  using custom  prefabricated  and  pre-cut  panels.  In  India,  the combination of advanced glazing and modular construction  techniques  enabled  the  construction,  in  just 45 days, of the Indian Ministry of Defense's research and\n\n## STRATEGY\n\nThe strategic approach\n\ndevelopment  center  in  Bangalore,  a  1.3  million  square meters  building.  In  France,  the  Saint-Joseph  Hospital chose to use Isover's F4 fa\u00e7ades, sized and pre-decoupled in  the  factory;  they  are  easy  to  disassemble  and  recycle, facilitating future expansion projects.\n\nFor  Saint -Gobain,  which  offers  a  very  wide  range  of expertise in this field, light construction is at the heart of its contribution  to  a  more  environmentally  friendly economy .\n\nAlso  at  the  cutting  edge  of  the  sector's  transformation, construction  chemicals , which  groups  together  all  the chemical  components  used  to  paste,  join,  waterproof, protect,  strengthen  and  perfect  different  construction materials,  both  in  new  construction  and  renovation,  for buildings  and  infrastructures  (tunnels,  bridges,  roads, railways, dams, etc.). This sector takes a leading role as its innovative  technologies -  and  its  multiple  applications  reduce energy consumption, reduce the carbon footprint of  cement  and  concrete,  and  promote  the  circular economy . They therefore play a major role in the transition to low-carbon construction and are an essential component  of  the  Group's  strategy  to  be  the  leader  in sustainable  construction;  this  is  why  Saint -Gobain  is strengthening its leadership and accelerating its growth in this sector, through the acquisition of Chryso in September  2021  and  GCP  Applied  Technologies  in September 2022. Construction chemicals now account for more than 270 Saint -Gobain sites, spread over 75  countries.  This  market  is  currently  estimated  to  be worth  between  \u20ac80  billion  and  \u20ac90  billion,  with  annual growth  significantly  higher  than  that  of  the  construction market in general. The Group, with a revenue of more than \u20ac4 billion and a rich portfolio of brands (including Weber, Chryso, Impac and TekBond), is clearly positioned among the world's leading players in this key segment.\n\n## 2.3.6 A PERFORMANCE-ORIENTED ORGANIZATION\n\nWhile it is one of the oldest companies, Saint -Gobain is also one of the fastest-changing companies in recent years. Rather than thinking in terms of obstacles and steps, it is about developing a model that can adapt continuously, in the context of a world that has become fundamentally unstable. To achieve this, the Group is committed to continuously improving its organization.\n\n## A - Developing human capital: recruiting, training and growing talent\n\nSaint -Gobain's  development  depends  first  and  foremost on the quality and expertise of the men and women who make up the Group . This is reflected first and foremost in the  attention  paid  to  recruitment ,  in  a  context  of  tight supply in all the functions and business lines proposed by Saint -Gobain,  in  production,  distribution  and  support functions.  The  Group  is  therefore  fully  committed  to  the race to recruit the best talents in all specialties , including engineers,  digital  &  data  scientists,  sales  and  marketing staff,  product  managers,  supply  chain  and  sustainability specialists.  Beyond  the  recruitment  process  and  the attention  paid  to  its  brand  as  an  employer,  it  is Saint -Gobain's  collective  ability  to  train,  nurture  and constantly  develop  these  talents that  will  enable  it  to\n\nstand  out.  With  digital  technology  and  refined  data processing, career paths can be more easily individualized and the HR support policy customized (see section 3.2.3, p. 94). As for managers, the 'SG Talents' program aims to identify  those  who have significant evolution potential or key  skills.  This  attention  to  individual  career  paths  within the Group also includes talent retention, through initiatives such as the Young Talent Program, developed in Germany and  Austria  to  attract  and  retain  young  executives  and develop their skills, and to support them over a year and a half  in  order  to  see  them  progress  and  to  be  able  to occupy positions with greater responsibilities.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## STRATEGY\n\nThe strategic approach\n\nAs  a  rule, employee  development ,  which  implies  taking into account  individual aspirations as well as the organization's  needs,  entails  listening  to  each  employee, providing  internal  (geographic,  functional  or  inter-Group entity)  mobility  options,  and  measuring  satisfaction  and engagement on a comprehensive and regular basis. In the final analysis, all of the Group's actions resulted in a record employee engagement index of 84% in 2022 (36) , with 86% of  respondents  considering  that  their  working  conditions are good (see section 3.2.2.B, p. 92).\n\nFor  the  eighth  consecutive  year,  the  Group  has  been certified  'Top  Employer  Global'.  This  certification  is  a major  asset  for  the  roll-out  of  the  'Grow  &  Impact' strategic plan; it confirms that the Group is well positioned to retain and attract the right talent needed to implement its  ambitions,  and  to  meet  a  challenge: have  the  best teams in a diverse and inclusive work environment .\n\nThis ambition is put into practice by using a whole series of mechanisms: from the quality of social dialog to training programs, compensation policy and well-being in general. It  is  also  about promoting  diversity  in  all  its  forms :  the variety  of  points  of  view,  experiences,  cultures  and backgrounds  has  a  positive  impact  on  the  working conditions and creativity of the teams, on the potential for innovation,  and  on  results. Saint -Gobain  continues  to make progress , particularly in terms of gender equality. In 2022, the percentage of women among managers at the Group level was 27.4%. In 2022, for the fourth consecutive year,  Saint -Gobain  was  also  present  in  the  Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. This index tracks the performance of companies that have committed to supporting gender equality in their organization through ambitious goals and aggressive  policies.  At  both  Group  and  local  level,  the Saint -Gobain  teams  are  working  to  encourage  the recruitment  and  development  of  women;  through  their initiatives, changes in behavior and operating methods, the internal  culture  continues  to  evolve.  The  role  of  women within  the  Group  concerns  all  activities,  countries  and levels in the organization, including businesses deemed to be 'physical'  or  'dull',  where  diversity  still  needs  to  gain ground.  This  is  why  the  Group  has  now  formulated  new targets  for  2025:  reaching  30%  of  women  among managers,  and  30%  among  members  of  the  Business Units' Executive Committees.\n\nGenerally  speaking,  the  Group  is  committed  to  always maintaining  a  diversity  index  above  90%,  which  was  the case in 2022 when the diversity index was 91.8%. Over and above diversity, inclusion is the essential target, ensuring that the contribution of each employee, male and female, is given its true value . In this area, Saint -Gobain is making progress through targeted recruitment, the implementation of objectives and performance indicators, and internal awareness-raising campaigns.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## B - Building a culture of trust, responsibility and collaboration\n\nSaint-Gobain's  new  organization,  aiming  to  empower countries  and  at  local  level, entails  building  trust ,  as  a condition  for  effective delegation  of  authority  and fostering  cross-functional  collaboration between  all  the Group's  functions  and  business  lines  at  global  level.  The impact that the pandemic has had on the ways of working has demonstrated the relevance of this new organization and of new management  methods.  Saint-Gobain's positioning as a solution provider ,  capable of assembling products,  systems  and  services,  makes  this  increased collaboration  essential  for  implementation  of  the  new 'Grow & Impact' strategic plan.\n\nThe  TEC  (Trust,  Empowerment,  Collaboration)  approach, which concerns all Group employees , applies to behavioral,  organizational  and  cultural  aspects of  life  at Saint-Gobain: trust,  empowerment,  and  collaboration lie at the heart of Saint-Gobain's transformation and growth model. This implies promoting reciprocity and environmentally  friendly  collaborative  behavior,  which must  free  up  individual  energies  within  its  teams,  which contribute to the development of collective intelligence.\n\nTEC represents a significant change in corporate culture within  the  Group,  which  primarily  concerns  managerial culture : the aim is to establish, by default, the principle of trust and thus move from a vertical, traditional structure, to an open, learning organization, leaving the freedom of act at local management level  in  the  75  countries  where Saint-Gobain operates. It also responds to the underlying trends  affecting  the  world  in  which  the  Group  operates, and  in  particular  to  the  disintermediation  brought  about by  new  technologies,  which  makes  managerial  methods obsolete and promotes profound changes in the relationship  between  individuals  and  work.  Successive lockdowns,  the  advent  of  remote  working  and  the adaptation of working conditions at production sites have required  employees  to  increase  their  autonomy.  The atomization  of  organizations  has  called  for  greater flexibility and adaptation. In this regard, the Covid-19 crisis served  as  a  launching  ramp  to  reshape  the  rules  of management and interpersonal relations. In this sense, the TEC approach represents a way of aligning Saint-Gobain's strategy with changes in the lifestyles and expectations of its various stakeholders (see section 2.1.3, p. 52), as well as a way of enhancing its brand as an employer.\n\nThe TEC culture also helps make the innovation process more  efficient ,  and  also helps  to  align  it  with  customer needs by  removing  barriers  between  countries,  business lines (solutions for construction and solutions for industry) and  functions (for example, researchers, marketing specialists and technicians).\n\nTo implement this approach on the ground ,  the Group is relying increasingly on its training program (see section 3.2.3.C, p. 95), as well as on approaches such as collective and individual coaching, made accessible to a greater number of employees, or even the gradual roll-out of 360\u00b0  assessments,  which  are  accessible  to  all employees and were made routine in 2022 for the entire 'top  150'  of  the  organization.  Giving  and  receiving feedback  is  also  encouraged,  so  as  to  strengthen collaboration  and  trust,  across  the  whole  Group  (for example  via  the  annual  me@Saint-Gobain  survey),  at individual  level  (by  developing  the  capacity  to  ask  for feedback and to provide it) both in project management (for example via the Evolve collaborative platform) and at individual  level  (by  developing  the  ability  to  request feedback and receive it).",

        "page_content": "Among the initiatives put in place to promote the spread of the TEC  culture throughout Saint-Gobain, two programs  are  deployed  via  the  Unicampus  program, combining courses and collaborative activities. The first is the virtual training session entitled 'Become a Saint -Gobain culture champion to serve strategy', accessible to all Group employees, and highly recommended for new recruits. The second, called 'Grow your  Impact  as  a  TEC  leader',  is  a  workshop  specifically dedicated to managers in charge of teams.\n\nA new toolkit for managers and their teams is available to those  who  wish  to  work  on  these  topics  as  a  team.  It includes  content,  articles,  videos  and  books  to  study  the notions  of  Trust,  Empowerment  and  Collaboration  in depth. For the second year in a row, the annual me@saintgobain survey (see section 3.2.2.B, p. 92) contains a TEC index composed of 10 questions, which is used to measure progress on a collective basis. Each manager can therefore measure  the  TEC  index  for  their  scope  and  draw  up  an improvement  plan  with  their  teams.  Lastly,  Saint -Gobain has  developed  and  launched  a  new  360\u00b0  assessment system  for  managers  based  on  TEC  behaviors.  The Group's 150 senior executives carried out their assessment, accompanied by a debriefing with a coach in 2022. A team assessment, on the same basis, is being developed.\n\n## C - Give priority to local resources\n\nSince 2019, Saint -Gobain has been organized according to its  customers and therefore by geographical areas for its regional businesses, and by global Business Units within its High  Performance  Solutions  division,  with  a  view  to improving  agility  and  remaining  as  close  as  possible  to its customer base . Based on the 'Transform & Grow' plan, the  Group's corporate  governance  model ,  which  is  as close  as  possible  to  its  markets,  is  part  of  a  resolutely 'multi-national'  approach.  The  new  organization  has enabled  a profound  culture  change , highlighting  the empowerment  of  teams,  their performance , and  the satisfaction of customer needs, and granting a high degree of decision-making autonomy at local level.\n\nSaint -Gobain's  organization  and  culture  are  therefore profoundly  transformed,  with  a simplified  structure (one boss principle)  and  90%  of  CEOs  native  to  the  region  in which  they  operate.  The  new  rules  for  executive compensation  (bonus  entirely  linked  to  the  performance of  the  country  or  market)  are  aligned  with  performance: priority given to cash generation, ROCE, EBITDA and ESG impact  (on  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  diversity  and safety). In full control of the Group's development in their market,  they  also  aim  to  shape  the  evolution  of  local construction ecosystems.\n\n## D - Leveraging the Group's global footprint\n\nAt the global level, the strength of an international group makes it possible to build a pool of expertise to support its local activities . First of all, this involves the widespread sharing of best practices .  The sharing of knowledge and expertise ,  essential to promote synergies, is facilitated by\n\n## STRATEGY\n\nThe strategic approach\n\nmeetings between innovation and marketing professionals, and  has  materialized  with  the  creation  of  the  'Hive' community.  Evidence  also  of  this  dynamic  is  the  roll-out globally via the Unicampus program (see section 3.2.3.C.c, p.  96),  of  a  training  offer  that  includes  courses  on  the principal central offices (marketing, industrial performance,  sustainable  development,  research  and development, purchasing, etc.) combining theory, practice and experience sharing.\n\nThis  approach  also  involves setting  up  cross-business platforms at  Group level. It also involves the deployment of  shared  service  centers in areas  such  as  human resources  or  the  finance  function.  Saint -Gobain's  global dimension  also  allows  us  to  test  numerous  innovative business  models  in  different  contexts  and  promote  the exchange of best practices between countries.\n\nThis clearly differentiates Saint -Gobain from its competitors: in addition to its in-depth knowledge of local markets, the Group sets itself apart from local competitors through  its capacity  for  innovation  and  the  operational excellence provided by its cross-functional organization at global  level.  Through  the  richness  of  its  offering  and  its ability  to  offer  complete  solutions  adapted  to  each customer segment, Saint -Gobain stands out from its local and international competitors.\n\n## E - Search for synergies\n\nSaint -Gobain's  new  organization,  in  general,  encourages synergies  in  support  functions : with  unique  customer services, shared online stores and common logistics, sales forces can work more efficiently and devote more time to cross-selling  and  upselling.  It  has  also  led  to changes  in sales  structures .  The  search  for  synergies  is  an  essential condition  for  the  Group  to  be  a  solution  provider (see section 2.3.2, p. 57). On the other hand, the objective is  to  offer  customers  combined  offers  and  to  make  the Group a one-stop shop for a given application. Using these synergies, Saint -Gobain facilitates the customer experience by  offering  complete  building  systems  along with exclusive related services. The customer only has to place a single order to receive all of the products at the worksite,  while  a  Saint -Gobain team also ensures smooth progress of work on site.\n\nFinally, synergies are also generated through the spreading  a  culture  of  innovation , (see  section  2.3.4, p. 60) developing dynamic project management methods and placing  the  client  at  the  heart  of  the  approach.  This culture  has  historically  been  expressed  in  different  ways within Saint -Gobain:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Group's  industrial  business  lines  can  thus  benefit from  the  experience  of  retailers  in  terms  of  digitizing their product and service offering for customers;\n- \u00b7 The  regional  businesses,  in  the  construction  markets, are increasingly developing a co-development approach,  a  model  that  is  in  the  DNA  of  the  High Performance  Solutions  businesses.  They  thus  benefit from the experiences already existing within Saint -Gobain.",

        "page_content": "The strategic approach\n\n## 2.3.7 ALLOCATING THE GROUP'S RESOURCES EFFICIENTLY\n\nIn terms of allocating financial resources, Saint -Gobain's approach aims both to target investments in order to stimulate growth and to maintain a portfolio that is both agile and value-creating.\n\n## A - Implementing an investment policy targeting growth\n\n## a. Seizing growth opportunities in key markets and ensuring sustainable development\n\nSaint -Gobain continued its investment policy to strengthen its industrial capacity in  the  countries  where the  market  is  growing  at  the  fastest  pace,  through  the commissioning  of  new  production  lines  and  new  plants. This is an effort totaling more than \u20ac830 million in 2022, including  more  than  \u20ac560  million  outside  Europe  (North America, Asia and developing countries).\n\nWith regard to plasterboard (drywall), in 2022, the Group announced the commissioning of a new production line in Vizag, India , with  a  capacity  of  40  million  m 2 of plasterboard.  In China, the  Group  is  investing  more  than \u20ac42 million in the sector to prepare the construction of the second tranche of the Yangzhou site (plaster and gypsum board  (drywall))  and  to  open  a  new  plant  in  the  city  of Binzhou,  in  the  north  of  the  country.  In  Yuzhou, Saint -Gobain  is  building  a  new  site  to recycle up  to 500,000  tonnes  of  desulfurized  gypsum,  a  by-product generated by local power plants, to produce 40 million m 2 of  plasterboard  and  200,000  tonnes  of  gypsum  powder per year. The Group is also continuing its growth policy in Africa with  the  acquisition  of  a  gypsum-based  product plant in Nairobi, Kenya ; this new site enables us to cater to growth in local demand.\n\nWith  regard  to mortars, in  2022  Saint -Gobain  opened  a new  dry  mortar  industrial  site  in  Antalya, Turkey; these facilities will allow production of 200,000 tonnes per year, in  a  consciously  'Industry  4.0'  approach.  The  Group's investment  in  this  market  is  also  reflected  in  the commissioning of new plants in Muscat, Oman and Manila, Philippines ,  as  well  as  by  launching  new  production lines at the industrial sites of Haiphong, Vietnam ,  and San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico .\n\nAmong the innovative  construction  solutions ,  expanded clay is a lightweight, insulating and fire-resistant material. Thanks to an investment of \u20ac2 million and the deployment of advanced measurement technologies, the H\u00e4\u00e4demeeste site in Estonia will  be  able  to  rapidly  increase production volumes,  with  a  target  of  350,000  m 3 per  year,  while  at the same time reducing its carbon footprint.\n\nIn  the  glass  sector,  investments  aim  in  particular  to increase the efficiency of processes and their contribution to sustainable growth. The Chennai site in India is carrying out a renovation process, notably through the use of highquality refractories, in order to achieve a 25% increase in production and a 15% reduction in energy consumption. In Germany , the  reconstruction  of  the  glass  furnaces  is underway  at  the  K\u00f6ln-Porz  site,  with  the  aim  of modernizing all the installations and significantly reducing\n\nthe  carbon  footprint  of  the  flat  glass  manufacturing process.  In China, a  new  production  line  was  put  into operation  at  the  Saint -Gobain  Sekurit  site  in  Minhang, Shanghai,  to  produce  laminated  windscreens  for  electric vehicles, with an annual capacity of 900,000 windscreens.\n\nIn  terms  of  abrasives,  in  2022,  the  Group  inaugurated  a new production site  in  Bangalore, India ,  withith  state-ofthe-art technologies to reduce the production of industrial waste, energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This plant will  enable Saint -Gobain to respond to the growth of the market  in  the construction , furniture  and automotive sectors in India, the Middle East and South East Asia .\n\nAlso  in  High  Performance  Solutions,  in  2022,  the  Group opened a new silica glass manufacturing line in Poland ,  in Gorlice. This production, under the Adfors brand name, will provide solutions to Saint -Gobain's customers in growing markets such as high-temperature insulation and batteries for electric vehicles .\n\n## b. Supporting the Group's commitments and its transformation\n\nTo achieve its long-term goals, and in particular to meet its commitment  to  achieving  carbon  neutrality  by  2050, Saint -Gobain has set up a capital investment budget over several years to support the reduction of its CO2 footprint. For 2022, these efforts represent more than \u20ac60 million in investments in research and development, but also nearly \u20ac130  million  to  reduce  CO2  emissions,  including  nearly \u20ac60  million  for  Europe,  more  than  \u20ac30  million  for  the Americas  and  more  than  \u20ac17  million  for  the  'High Performance Solutions' activity alone.\n\n## B - Ensuring agile and value-creating portfolio management\n\nSaint -Gobain pursues a strategy of managing its business portfolio that is both dynamic and value-creating.\n\n## a. Continuing the strategy of value-creating acquisitions\n\nIn 2022, Saint -Gobain completed or signed 44 acquisitions for  \u20ac1.9  billion  in  sales.  These  acquisitions  are  perfectly aligned  with  the  Group's  strategy  laid  out  in  the  Grow  & Impact  plan.  Saint -Gobain's  vision,  to  be  the  worldwide leader in light and sustainable construction, naturally leads to external growth that favors sectors such as construction chemicals , strengthens the Group's positioning  in lightweight  and  sustainable  construction methods around the world ,  and enables it to continue to improve its technological leadership .",

        "page_content": "In the  field  of construction  chemicals , Saint -Gobain completed  the  acquisition  of GCP Applied  Technologies Inc.,  the  global  leader  in  the  industry,  on  September  27, 2022, after obtaining approval from the relevant competition  authorities.  This  planned  acquisition  was announced on December 6, 2021. GCP provides the Group with  a  world-renowned  platform  for  cement  additives, concrete adjuvants and  solutions for infrastructure, commercial and residential construction. This acquisition is a  decisive  step  in  strengthening  Saint -Gobain's  offer  to decarbonize construction, thus supporting its strategy as a worldwide leader in sustainable construction.\n\nIn  order  to  expand  its  presence  around  the  world  particularly  in  concrete  adjuvants,  which  are  essential  to the decarbonization of construction - the Group has also finalized  the  acquisition  of Matchem in Brazil and  has signed  an  exclusive  agreement  with IDP  Chemicals in Egypt . These two companies are positioned in the growth segments  of  the  building  and  infrastructure  sectors,  in geographical areas that are expected to experience strong growth in the coming years.\n\nIn the field of outdoor construction materials, on July 29, 2022,  Saint -Gobain  finalized  the  acquisition  of Kaycan , which had been announced on May 31, 2022. Kaycan is a major player in the market, generating more than half of its revenues in Canada and the rest of the United States . With this acquisition, the Group strengthens its status as a world  leader  in  sustainable  construction,  by  becoming  a major  player  in  Canada's  fa\u00e7ade  beveling  market  and expanding  its  outdoor  cladding  offering  in  the  United States, through solutions including aluminum and processed  wood.  Saint -Gobain  has  thus  consolidated  its leading  position  in  the  North  American  market  and complemented  its  range  of  sustainable  construction solutions.\n\nIn Portugal ,  the  Group  signed  an  agreement  to  acquire Fibroplac -recognized  for  the  high  quality  of  its plasterboard production -and Falper , which has developed an advanced digital solution for the design and production of light steel structures. These two acquisitions will  support  and  accelerate  Saint -Gobain's  strong  growth in  the  Portuguese  market,  both  in  plasterboard  systems and prefabricated modular construction.\n\nSaint -Gobain  and  Turkish  group  Dalsan announced  that they have signed a joint venture agreement under which they will merge their plaster and plasterboard businesses in  Turkey.  In  2023,  once  the  industrial  investment  of  the new  Turgutlu  plant  (Manisa)  has  been  completed,  with their  combined  know-how  and  expanded  production capacity  in  plasterboard  and  plaster,  this  partnership  will provide  Turkish  consumers  with  access  to  the  most comprehensive  and  innovative  portfolio  of  light  and sustainable  solutions  for  the  construction  and  renovation of  the  building  shell  as  well  as  for  interior  partitions. Saint -Gobain  and  Dalsan  will  also  benefit  from  an optimized  and  modern  industrial  system,  ready  to  serve local  developers  and  export  customers  in  neighboring countries.\n\n## STRATEGY\n\nThe strategic approach\n\nRegarding  its High  Performance  Solutions ,  Saint -Gobain completed  two  acquisitions: in the United States , Monofrax LLC , a leading regional player in the electrocast refractory market, and in South Korea with Global SFC ,  a major  player  in  nano-ceramic  window  coating  film technology. These acquisitions will strengthen the Group's technological leadership and thus boost the growth of its global activities.\n\n## b. Continuing a regular portfolio review to focus the Group's strengths\n\nSaint -Gobain continued its portfolio optimization strategy, aimed  at  enhancing  the  Group's  growth  and  profitability profile in line with the objectives of the 'Grow & Impact' plan  in  the  light  of  three  decisive  criteria:  the  strategic suitability  of  the  activity  in  relation  to  the  rest  of  the Group;  its  performance  against  Saint -Gobain's  own  value creation  criteria;  and  its  prospects  within  the  Group's global organization.\n\nIn  2022,  Saint -Gobain  completed  or  signed  20  disposals worth \u20ac3.8 billion in sales.\n\nFollowing  several  disposals  made  by  Saint -Gobain  since 2018  in  Europe,  the  Group  sold  its glass processing businesses in Estonia, as well as in Germany and Austria. In the United Kingdom ,  Saint -Gobain sold two processing sites  specializing  in  the  production  of  double  glazing,  at Motherwell  (Scotland)  and  Canterbury  (England).  In France , the  Group  also  sold  its  glass  transformation business  Saint -Gobain  Glassolutions  Grand-Ouest.  This transaction allows Saint -Gobain to concentrate its investments on innovative solutions for sustainable construction,  such  as  the  so-called  'low-carbon'  glazing offer, which has just been launched on the market, or the recycling of glazing.\n\nIn  the retail sector,  the  Group  sold  all  of  its  distribution activities in the United Kingdom . The agreement, signed in December 2022, provides for the sale - which is expected to be finalized in Q1 2023 - of all its trademarks, including Jewson ,  its  wood  and  building  materials  distributor.  It followed  with  the  sale  of International Decorative Surfaces (IDS), its distribution business specializing in floor coverings,  worktops  and  laminates, CTD  Tile  Group ,  its distribution business  specializing  in  tiling  and Ideal Bathrooms , its distribution company  specializing  in plumbing,  heating  and  sanitary  products.  Saint -Gobain also  sold  its  retail  business  in Poland .  Lastly,  the  Group sold  its  wood  processing  and  distribution  business  in Denmark , due to insufficient positioning and critical mass.\n\nSaint -Gobain concentrates its High Performance Solutions activities  on  markets  where  the  Group,  thanks  to  its leading  positions  and  its  capacity  for  innovation,  enables its industrial clients to accelerate their approach to carbon neutrality  and  circularity.  It  is  with  this  in  mind  that Saint -Gobain  sold  its  ' Crystals  and  Sensors '  business, which  specializes  in  radiation  detection  for  medical imaging,  security,  nuclear  safety,  oil  and  gas  operations and  environmental  monitoring,  and  provides  sapphirebased products for medicine, industry and the electronic and  aerospace  sectors.  Following  the  same  approach,  in 2022,  the  Group  finalized  the  sale  of  certain  ceramic activities  in  Brazil  ( Vinhedo ) and  the  United  States ( Latrobe ), intended mainly for the traditional steel market.",

        "page_content": "## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nManaging impacts across the value chain\n\n## 3.1.2 PURCHASING AND LOGISTICS OPTIMIZATION\n\n## A - Purchasing\n\nPurchasing is a key factor in Saint -Gobain's competitiveness. Its organization is adapted to the specific features  of  its  activities  and  the  countries  where  it  is located to ensure its efficiency and manage supply chain risks. Purchasing  meets  the  needs  of  the  Group's manufacturing  and  distribution  activities.  Although  the purchasing functions are based on shared policies and on a  common  base,  especially  the  implementation  of  the Responsible  Purchasing  policy  (see  section  3.1.2.B),  they do not operate at the same level of the Saint -Gobain value chain:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-trade purchases: these relate to purchases upstream  of  the  production  stage  (raw  materials, energy,  chemicals,  components,  etc.),  purchases  of equipment  used  for  production  (machinery,  civil engineering,  etc.),  all  logistics  expenses,  as  well  as purchases  of  support  functions  (IT,  marketing,  human resources, environment, health and safety, communication, finance, audit, etc.);\n- \u00b7 Trade purchases: downstream  purchases  of  the production  to  ensure  the  offerings  of  the  Group's distribution brands.\n\nSaint -Gobain's purchasing policy favors the establishment of medium- and long-term contracts and partnerships with its suppliers.\n\nThe Group is committed to develop the professionalism of its  buyers  through  training  activities.  A  training  path  is open  to  all  Group's  buyers  within  the  scope  of  the Purchasing School. More specific training courses intended for  trade  buyers  complete  this  program.  These  training courses, which are particularly important for newcomers in the  purchasing  function,  provide  them  with  tools  that enable  them,  and  their  teams,  to  achieve  behavioral excellence in their daily activities.\n\nBeyond the specific features connected with its activities, Saint -Gobain  recognizes  the  major  role  the  purchasing function plays in competitiveness, innovation and sustainable performance. Buyers are especially committed to  the  2030  CO2  roadmap,  both  for  the  control  and  the reduction of scope 3 emissions and for the development of renewable or decarbonized energy purchases (see section 3.3.3, p. 113) or to support the development of ever more sustainable products and solutions.\n\nThe supply chain of industrial sites is mostly local. Under 4%  of  a  region's  purchases  are  made  outside  its geographical  region.  This  implies  the  management  of  a large number of suppliers. More than 205,000 companies supply the sites, of which about 21,000 account for 91% of Group  purchases.  Trade  purchases  are  concentrated around over 15,500 suppliers.\n\n## B - Responsible purchasing\n\nIn  an  environment  where  supply  chains  are  becoming more complex, and where the collective awareness of the impacts  of  purchasing  on  stakeholders  is  growing,  the responsible purchasing program aims to integrate ethical requirements  into  the  purchasing  process,  both  for suppliers, based on the supplier charter, and for buyers, by applying  the  buyer  charter.  It  helps  manage  and  reduce the environmental, social and societal risks associated with Saint -Gobain's supply chains.\n\nThus,  ethical  criteria  respecting  human  rights,  working conditions  and  compliance  with  standards,  health  and safety  and  the  environment  are  integrated  into  the purchase process. The responsible purchasing program is implemented with high standards in accordance with the Group's  general  purchasing  principles  to  develop  longterm relationships with suppliers.\n\nThe  program  is  based  on  ISO  20400  standard.  An  audit conducted in 2021 by an independent third party validated the approach and attested of its maturity.\n\nThe 'responsible purchasing' program includes four major steps set out in Saint -Gobain's vigilance plan:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nManaging impacts across the value chain\n\n## a.  Risk management\n\nThe  CSR  risk  mapping  of  purchases,  developed  by Saint -Gobain,  includes  risks  related  to  sourcing  country and  risks  related  to  purchasing  category.  Risks  linked  to human rights, particularly forced labor and child labor, and corruption  risks  are  inherent  to  the  environment  of  the countries of origin.\n\nRisks linked to purchasing categories include environmental  performance,  and  more  specifically  the carbon and water footprints, as well as health and safety impacts.  The  mapping  uses  recognized  international sources  to  assess  the  specific  risks  by  country  and  by activity.  While  the  general  principles  and  sources  are identical,  the  impact  of  purchases  and  the  risks  for  the company  are  weighted  according  to  the  nature  of  the purchase:\n\n- \u00b7 Upstream  purchases,  managed  by  the  non-trade purchasing team;\n- \u00b7 Purchases  related  to  distribution  activity  offerings managed by the marketing distribution teams and the trade purchasing teams.\n\nIn  accordance with this procedure, purchasing categories or  suppliers  with  specific  risks  have  been  identified,  such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Purchases of some natural raw materials such as wood or sand;\n- \u00b7 Particular  types  of  subcontractors  working  directly  on Saint -Gobain sites;\n- \u00b7 Purchases made in countries exposed to risks regarding human rights in general and child labor, corruption and working conditions in particular.\n\n## b.  Risk management and mitigation measures\n\nThe process and tools used to manage risks for trade and non-trade  purchases  are  aligned.  However,  the  action plans  put  in  place  are  specific  to  each  of  the  two purchasing teams, to maintain management methods and a  level  of  control  adapted  to  the  risks  and  potential negative impacts of each of the activities.\n\n## For non-trade purchases\n\nDepending on the level of risk identified, suppliers answer an evaluation questionnaire based on documentation. It is verified and evaluated by a third party, and an on-site CSR audit  takes  place  depending  on  the  results.  The  entire approach forms part of a constant dialog with the supplier and  leads  to  the  establishment  of  action  plans  and  CSR performance  improvement  plans.  In  2018,  the  evaluation questionnaire and its related score scale were reviewed to check that they corresponded to the types and levels of risks  identified  by  the  mapping.  Since  2021,  following  the reassessment of the minimum performance thresholds, the suppliers concerned have been invited to undergo a new assessment  to  comply  with  the  Group's  reinforced requirements.\n\nSaint -Gobain has set a target of having assessed the CSR performance of more than 90% of suppliers identified as at risk and  generating  annual  revenue  of  more  than \u20ac100,000 with the Group for the period 2017-2022. In the context of a global health crisis in 2020 and the impacts on  supply  chains  since  then,  74.5%  of  these  at-risk suppliers have been assessed.\n\nThe Group wants to conduct around 40 to 50 CSR audits a year, mainly in emerging countries.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe use of the 'SMETA 4-Pillar' standard for on-site audits is widespread, so that suppliers' audit efforts can be better shared with all of their customers. Based on the results of the assessments,  the  relevant  buyer  implements  a corrective action plan with the supplier, including priorities and deadlines for implementation.\n\nIn the event of non-compliance with these action plans or implementation  deadlines,  a  supplier  de-listing  policy  is applicable,  after  which  the  supplier  will  no  longer  have access to the Group's calls for tenders and all entities of the latter will withdraw from any ongoing partnerships.\n\nThe  Responsible  Purchasing  policy  is  being  rolled  out  to non-trade suppliers via a private digital platform developed  by  Saint -Gobain  and  entirely  dedicated  to responsible  purchasing.  Suppliers  have  access  to  it  to acknowledge  receipt  of  the  Group  Suppliers  Charter,  to send essential supporting documents electronically (wood certificates, quality certificates, ISO standards), to answer self-assessment  questionnaires,  to  obtain  all  information on Saint -Gobain's 'responsible purchasing' guidelines and to  access  details  of  their  CSR  evaluations  or,  where appropriate, CSR audits.\n\nThe  responsible purchasing approach  also  includes ongoing training for buyers on the Group code of ethics, with  particular  emphasis  on  the  fight  against  corruption, the working conditions of employees of suppliers, forced labor  and  child  labor.  Constant  information  on  the sustainable  development  stakes  is  also  communicated. The Non-Trade Purchasing Department has issued a 'Best Practices' brochure for all purchasers, to remind them of the CSR best practices to be built into the entire purchase process.\n\n## For trade purchases\n\nThe procedures and tools are aligned with those already in place for non-trade purchases. Given the different nature of purchases, certain risk criteria and their weighting and performance  monitoring  are  managed  separately  by  the marketing  and  purchasing  teams  of  the  distribution entities.  The  program  is  overseen  by  members  from  the Group's responsible purchasing team. Accordingly, synergies  and  best  practices  for  responsible  purchasing are shared between the various buyers, while performance measurement  is  both  maintained  and  adapted  to operational risks and opportunities.\n\nThis  implementation  is  coupled  with  training  sessions  for buyers. Strategic suppliers are the ones primarily targeted by  the  deployment  of  the  Responsible  Purchasing program.  This  concerns  the  European  partners  of  the distribution  entities  that  supply  more  than  \u20ac3  million  as well as the main partners by retailer in each country. These identified suppliers  cover  more  than  75%  of  trade purchases (see section 4.2.2, p. 137).\n\nAt the same time, the marketing and purchasing teams of the 'Building Distribution' Business Unit are continuing the qualification and control audits of the plants of their ownbrand suppliers, especially in India and China. The purpose of these audits is to assess their management system, the environmental,  social  and  legal  aspects  of  production activities,  and  to  ensure  that  the  products  are  of  good quality.\n\nFollowing each audit, the supplier receives a report as well as  recommendations  on  compliance  with  an  expected effective date or paths for improvement.",

Risk management related to natural raw materials\n\n## Sand\n\nPurchases of sand by Saint -Gobain are intended for glass and  glass  wool  production,  production  of  mortars,  and distribution  activities.  Given  the  quality  of  the  sand required for our business lines, purchases are mainly made from  open  and  mechanized  quarries.  Suppliers  undergo evaluations of their environmental and social practices as part  of  the  Responsible  Purchasing  policy.  Finally,  the Group is implementing an action plan to reduce its sand consumption by substituting it with recycled materials as part  of  the  circular  economy  program  (see  section  3.4.1, p. 116). Since 2018, an indicator to monitor the reduction of extractions  of  virgin  natural  raw  materials  has  been implemented (see section 4.2.2, p. 137).\n\n## Timber purchases\n\nSaint -Gobain's  activities  have  an  impact  on  the  timber sector either through the supply of packaging (pallets and boxes) or by purchases of timber for construction markets as  part  of  its  distribution  activities.  Environmental  and social  risks  and  those  related  to  human  rights  adherence primarily affect trade purchasing. Saint -Gobain is committed  to  fighting  deforestation  through  a  'Timber Purchasing'  policy,  by  acting  ethically  and  responsibly throughout  the  Group's  value  chain  to  preserve  forests, the local populations living in them, and biodiversity. This policy was issued in the early 2000s and updated in 2020.\n\nTo control risks and ensure traceability of purchases, the 'Timber  Purchasing'  policy  is  based  on  a  due  diligence method  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the European  Union  Timber  Regulation  (EUTR),  and  the recommendations of recognized institutions or specialized non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as the red list of  endangered  species  maintained  by  the  IUCN (International  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature)  and reports of NGOs involved in the fight against deforestation.  In  particular,  for  species  or  regions  at  risk, specific certifications are required, such as the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) label.\n\nTo  ensure  that  the  risks  related  to  purchases  can  be controlled,  Saint -Gobain  carries  out  an  inventory  of  its timber products purchases and their derivatives. This year, 95.7% of timber products and their derivatives from trade come from responsibly managed timber. An audit of this inventory was carried out by a third party specializing in deforestation issues at the end of the year in 2020 and has confirmed the solidity of the program to secure purchases and compliance with the 'Timber Purchasing' policy.\n\nAs part of a continuous improvement process, the Group maintains  a  transparent  and  regular  dialog  with  nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to promote responsible forest management.\n\nSaint -Gobain has not completed the CDP questionnaire on forests  since  2020.  The  Group  shares  CDP's  objective  of combating deforestation for responsible forest management. It seeks a transparent dialog with the CDP so that the specific nature of construction timber is better valued  in  the  ratings.  The  questionnaire  is  currently focused on issues related to the use of palm oil or exotic\n\n## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nManaging impacts across the value chain\n\nspecies which are little or not present in the construction business lines. As a result, the answers to the questionnaire and the assessment are not very representative of the conducted  actions  and  their efficiency.\n\n## C - Optimization of the supply chain\n\nEnsuring  optimized  management  of  supply  chain,  from supplier to customer, is an essential part of both industrial efficiency and customer service. By ensuring the optimization of inventory levels, supply chain efficiency is also a crucial factor in cash management.\n\nThe Group's supply chains are mainly local and managed by country organizations. Global coordination and a team of  experts  allow  common  logistics  optimization  tools, dedicated training and customized supply chain improvement  programs  to  be  provided.  These  teams  of experts work directly in the countries with the support of the general management bodies to raise awareness of all functions, identify potential for improvement and draw up action  plans  to  be  implemented  by  the  country  teams. Depending on the maturity of local supply chains, actions may involve optimizing the management of product lines by  the  marketing  teams,  adapting  planning  (customer forecasts such  as  plant  scheduling), or optimizing transport. The objective is to maximize  customer satisfaction  while  optimizing  financial  and  environmental impacts.\n\nSaint -Gobain has also developed digital programs such as 'Industry  4.0'  and  'Supply  Chain  4.0'  to  optimize transport.  Whether  it  is  for  its  purchases  or  customer delivery,  the  Group  has  programs  for  route  optimization, optimal vehicle loading and more efficient travel planning by coordinating inbound and outbound transport to avoid empty kilometers.\n\nThus, the Group uses supply chain modeling, optimization and simulation software to find the best balance between delivery times, costs, inventories and carbon footprint.\n\nLogistics  represents  more  than  a  third  of  Saint-Gobain's scope  3  CO2  emissions,  so,  optimizing  it  both  upstream and  downstream  of  the  value  chain  is  a  key  factor  in reducing Saint -Gobain's carbon impact and achieving the target  of  a  16%  reduction  in  scope  3  emissions  by  2030 (see section 4.2.2, p. 137).\n\nIn  partnership  with  logistics  service  providers,  the  Group favors the use of vehicles that comply with EURO V and VI emission  standards  or  promotes  the  transition  to  loweremission fuels for the fleet.\n\nSaint -Gobain is committed to using transport modes in an agile way, switching to less-polluting multimodal transport modes  such  as  rail  and  river  or  sea  transport  whenever possible.\n\nNumerous actions have been taken, such as the initiatives of Point.P in France to develop river transport in the Paris region.  For  example,  the  Quai  de  Javel  branch  in  Paris receives  deliveries  by  barge,  thus  avoiding  the  use  of trucks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

They  are rolled  out  at  all  sites  worldwide.  The  Group  implements risk prevention and control policies for both industrial risks and environmental, health and safety risks.\n\n## a.  Preventing industrial and distribution risks\n\nThe  aim  of  the  industrial  and  distribution  risk  prevention policy is  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  accidental  events,  to minimize  their  severity  if  they  do  occur,  and  finally  to preserve the continuity of business operations. This policy applies to all Saint -Gobain sites.\n\nDefined  and  led  by  the  Risk  and  Insurance  Department, this policy is rolled out within the organization to the sites by a network of prevention coordinators. A risk prevention manual  is  the  Group  reference  base  and  is  available  in some  fifteen languages. It includes the applicable standards,  procedures  and  technical  rules,  methods  for identifying and reducing risks, including natural risks, and the  drafting  of  emergency  and  business  continuity  plans. This manual may be shared with the relevant stakeholders, such  as  permanent  on-site  subcontractors.  The  risk assessment  tool  is  used  by  all  operational  sites  and provides  an  objective  assessment  of  the  protection  and prevention level. It takes into account both human factors (organization,  procedures,  communication,  training,  etc.) and physical facilities. This means that each site is able to identify  its  areas  for  improvement,  develop  action  plans including  investments,  and  use  the  tool  to  measure progress.\n\nThe Group is rolling out business continuity plans for each site according to the risk assessment and the vulnerability of  processes  to  unforeseen  interruptions  including  an anticipation of the impacts of an accident so as to limit its effects.  The  aim  is  to  fully  or  partially  ensure  customer service  and  recover  operational  capacities  as  quickly  as possible.  The  subcontractors  working  on  the  sites  are involved in the process and must commit to a prevention plan.\n\nSaint -Gobain  constantly  adapts  its  risk  management system to better anticipate the potential risks associated with  the  effects  of  climate  change.  In  2022,  this  system was enhanced with a study conducted on the effects  of climate  change  in  the  major  regions  where  Saint -Gobain operates.  This  study  was  conducted  for  over  500\n\n\u00cb\n\nindustrial sites in 52 countries. The potential impacts were analyzed  based  on  various  global  warming  scenarios. Action plans to further increase prevention, particularly in the face of natural disaster risks, are being rolled out. They include a proposal for changing the design of specific sites to anticipate potential risks.\n\n## b.  Environmental, health, and safety risks\n\nSaint -Gobain's  environmental,  health  and  safety  policy  is applied  at  all  its  sites.  Its  deployment  is  based  on  a reference  framework  that  describes  the  environmental, health,  and  safety  management  system  and  explains  the risk identification and management  approach.  This management  system  is  based  on  ISO  or  equivalent certification  requirements,  in  particular  ISO  14001  and ISO 45001.\n\nWhether it is certified or not, each site of the Group carries out  its  own  assessment  of  environmental,  health  and safety  risks  under  the  site  officer's  responsibility.  To  do this,  a  standardized  method  has  been  deployed  and  is regularly updated. Training courses are organized for site teams, and a digital application incorporating risk analysis, assessment and management actions has been developed. This tool facilitates the deployment,  reliability and monitoring of risk management action plans at all of the Group's sites.\n\nAn  environmental,  health,  and  safety  risk  matrix  is  also included  in  the  internal  control  reference  framework. Compliance audits are conducted, and external certification  procedures  supplement  the  control  system. An internal audit standard also enables the monitoring and verification of action plans at the sites.\n\nAudits of the environmental, health, and safety management  system  are  conducted  by  the  functional department concerned. These audits are  conducted  as  a priority  at  ISO-certified  or  equivalent  sites.  In  addition  to these audits, a version of the audit methodology has been developed  for  smaller  sites  for  which  ISO  certification  is less suitable.\n\nDuring acquisitions, a process for integrating new entities into the Group is deployed by the country teams, including potential  compliance  of  the  environmental,  health  and safety management system.\n\nLastly, a training matrix defines the training on managing environmental,  health,  and  safety  risks  for  the  teams according to the position held. It is a particularly relevant tool to use to define employee training courses.",

The  Technology and  Industrial  Performance  Department  coordinates  the operational excellence programs.\n\n## a. WCM program\n\nSaint -Gobain's World Class Manufacturing (WCM) program combines standardization of methods, tools and best practices with the modularity required to adapt to a wide  variety  of  industrial  processes  and  site  sizes.  It  is based on continuous performance improvement methods such as Lean, Six Sigma, TPM  (Total Productive Maintenance),  or  5S.  This  program  defines  the  logic,  the objective  of  rigor,  and  the  actions  to  achieve  continuous improvements  in  terms  of  quality,  performance  and sustainability  by  integrating  a  high  level  of  service  and customer satisfaction.\n\nThe  WCM  program  is  based  on  certification  procedures such as ISO 9001 for quality, ISO 14001 and 50001 for the environment, ISO 45001, ILO OSH 2001 and ISO 45001 for health  and  safety.  Its  management,  the  monitoring  of  its execution and the improvement of the performance of the sites  are  managed  across  the  businesses  in  coordination with the departments of the sites.\n\nThe deployment of the WCM program at a site is adapted to  its  priorities,  size,  strengths  and  weaknesses  and  its objectives in terms  of  financial and  environmental performance, quality and customer satisfaction. Thus, each site  establishes  its  own  roadmap,  in  accordance  with international  guidelines,  standards  specific  to  its  business line, the expectations of its customers and the improvement objectives set. A WCM network of expertise has  been  set  up  to  enable  better  dissemination  of  the program, the optimization of resources by country, region or business line, as well as the sharing of expertise on each of the program pillars. A central team heads up the WCM network, trains the teams, creates and applies the program standards,  circulates  the  tools  and  provides  site-specific assistance on request.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSaint -Gobain's  WCM  program  is  based  on  eight  pillars, each one representing an area of excellence:\n\nThe foundations of the program define the methods and tools:\n\n- \u00b7 Analyzing losses to determine a prioritization of actions;\n- \u00b7 Resolving  problems  with  logic,  rigor  and  precision  for lasting improvement;\n- \u00b7 Involving  and  engaging  employees  in  a  proactive approach;\n- \u00b7 Improving standards to make progress easier to deploy and more robust over time.\n\nAchieving  industrial  excellence  is  a  demanding  process that requires gradual, methodical and constant implementation.  To  support  the  sites  in  this  process, training programs are rolled out during sessions led by the central teams. In 2022, more than 2,500 employees were trained.\n\nThe benefits in terms of competitiveness, improvement of customer service,  stability  of  performance  and  employee commitment  can  be  measured  at  each  stage  of  the  site path.  Stringency  levels  have  been  established  to  set principles shared by the entire organization. Each of these requirement levels matches both a performance objective set  by  the  business  and  a  maturity  milestone  in  the program. Audits verify the robustness of the implemented actions and the sustainability of the results obtained. As of the end of 2022, 173 sites were certified Bronze, 50 Silver and two Gold.\n\nThe  WCM  program  delivers  a  significant  reduction  in production costs while minimizing risks in terms of health, safety,  environmental  and  industrial  risks.  The  'Quality', 'Industrial performance' and 'Environment' pillars contribute significantly to reducing Saint -Gobain's environmental footprint by reducing production waste and water  consumption  and  by  improving  energy  efficiency. The WCM program and its extension to the supply chain represent  a  change  of  culture  and  management  system, with  the  aim  of  bringing  a  high  level  of  service  to customers, better competitiveness and greater efficiency, while  continuously  improving the health and safety of all Group employees and those of its partners. It fosters and promotes  employee  engagement  and  mobility.  Finally,  it contributes to the success of the digital transformation of plants  and  to  the  adoption  of  its  methods  and  tools  by users (see section 3.2.3, p. 95).\n\nThe  methods  developed  in  the  'People  Development' pillar make it possible to manage Saint -Gobain's technical skills  by  adapting  training  programs,  employee  career paths and, if necessary, the search for external skills. This pillar  is  also  essential  to  strengthen  the  TEC  culture (see section 2.3.6, p.66)\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n6\n\n5\n\n7\n\n4\n\n8\n\n9\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3",

Quality and the product compliance program\n\nThe  Group's  Quality  Department  aims  to  increase customer  satisfaction  by  improving  the  quality  approach through  product  compliance  and  reducing  costs  of  poor quality.\n\nThe quality culture developed at the sites is based on the ISO  9001  or  IATF  16494  certification  standards,  the 'Quality & Process Control' pillar of the WCM program, or the 'Internal Quality Control' reference framework (see  section  6.2.5,  p.  241).  Training  programs  on  the culture  and  tools  of  quality  and  compliance  are  also offered as part of UniCampus (see section 3.2.3, p. 95) or e-learning courses.\n\nAs  product  compliance  is  a  constantly  evolving  process, Saint -Gobain has complemented the measures already in place in 2021 with a program to strengthen the culture of product quality and compliance. The program is designed to remind countries and local teams of the key principles and processes related to product quality and compliance throughout  the  product  life  cycle,  from  design  to production, marketing, use and finally end of life.\n\nThis program includes four steps:\n\n- \u00b7 Awareness campaigns at all Group levels;\n- \u00b7 Definition of a roadmap by local management teams;\n- \u00b7 Evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  measures  in  the countries for each activity;\n- \u00b7 Definition and implementation of sustainable improvement plans if necessary.\n\nA  network  of  local  facilitators  (nearly  100  facilitators trained  by  the  end  of  2022)  has  been  set  up  to  support the teams in the countries or activities during deployment and  to  ensure  the  sharing  of  best  practices,  thus promoting  the  continuous  improvement  of  procedures. The progress of the program's implementation is monitored  by  a  committee  created  for  this  purpose, consisting of Executive Committee members (see section 1.5.2 , p. 39).\n\n## C - Protecting the health and safety of employees\n\nThe health and safety of employees are absolute priorities, and  Saint -Gobain  makes  them  central  to  its  corporate culture. It is important for everyone to participate in their own health and safety, and those of all of their colleagues.\n\n## a.  Employee health and well-being\n\nIn terms of health and well-being, Saint -Gobain adopted a policy  in  2013  and  updated  it  early  2022.  It  sets  out  the guidelines  for  action  to  protect  the  health  and  promote the well-being of its employees, customers and suppliers, users  of  its  products,  as  well  as  residents  living  near  its sites.  The  action  plans  focused  on  external  stakeholders are described in section 3.2.1 p. 90 of this chapter.\n\nTo ensure the same level of protection and medical care for all its employees worldwide, the Group has established mandatory  standards,  medical  monitoring  protocols  and recommendations for health and industrial hygiene. They are  supplemented  by  specific  standards  for  certain activities.\n\n\u00cb\n\nAll  Saint -Gobain  sites  worldwide  must  implement  the health  policy.  The  actions  implemented  by  each  site  are prioritized on the basis of risk assessments in accordance with the 'risk assessment and control' standard.\n\nThe  adaptation  of  workstations  and  their  adaptation  in case of limitation of the employee's working capacities are also  central  points  of  implementation  of  the  policy. Preventive programs and programs to promote health and well-being,  including  access  to  healthcare  and  social protection for employees and their families (see section 3.2.3 , p. 94) are implemented.\n\nThe recommendations concerning the organization of first aid  and  the  equipment  of  the  entities  with  automatic external defibrillators were communicated.\n\n## Chemical risk management\n\nSaint -Gobain  is  committed  to  reducing  and  controlling chemical risks (hazardous substances and products, dust). Three  complementary  tools  have  been  developed  to support the sites in managing chemical risks:\n\n- \u00b7 The internal standard and its implementation guide on the  assessment  and  control  of  the  risk  linked  to chemical  agents  provides  guidance  to  industrial  sites how to conduct a periodic assessment of exposure to hazardous  substances  according  to  precise  minimum rules.  It  is  supplemented  by  risk  management  guides (ventilation and personal protective equipment, examples  of  chemical  management  and  storage procedures,  activity-specific  product  inventories,  etc.) as well as training kits;\n- \u00b7 The  SBASE  database  provides  a  list  of  chemical substances  and  their  classification,  according  to  their level of danger on the basis of an internal classification system. This database is updated on an ongoing basis by internal and external experts in response to changes in the classification of the various regulatory frameworks, such as REACH in Europe;\n- \u00b7 The SAFHEAR management tool allows each industrial site to prepare and document its own inventory of the chemical  substances  and  products  used  and  also potentially generated  during  industrial production processes.  In  the  second  phase,  it  allows  sites  to document the results  of  exposure  assessments.  These data are consolidated worldwide.\n\nThe  inventory  of  products  and  substances  used  by Saint -Gobain entities is a continuous improvement process. As of the end of 2022, 81% of the sites have used SAFHEAR to update their inventory. The Group's objective is  to  have  100%  of  its  sites  covered  by  an  up-to-date inventory by the end of 2025 (see section 4.2.2 , p. 137).\n\nTraining,  educational  materials  and  technical  assistance help develop the skills of health managers on site. In 2022, more than 200 people have taken at least one e-learning module related to the assessment and control of chemical risks.",

        "page_content": "## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nManaging impacts across the value chain\n\nLastly,  Saint -Gobain  actively  monitors  updates  to  the European list of candidate substances for authorization or subject to authorization or restriction and anticipates the deadlines  for  authorization  of  substances,  in  order  to complete  its  substitution  and  to  fulfill  its  communication obligations with its customers.\n\nIn countries outside the European Union, subject to other chemical  regulations  such  as  the  US  'Toxic  Substance Control  Act',  the  Environmental  Protection  Act  and  the Chemicals Management Plan in Canada, or 'China REACH' in  China,  the  Group  applies  the  regulations  in  force  and monitors their evolution.\n\nThis  cross-functional  control  of  the  management  of chemical  substances  and  products  is  also  part  of  the product innovation and stakeholder information processes, particularly for consumers (see section 3.1.4, p. 84).\n\n## A health risk management indicator\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  defined  a  risk  control  indicator  for  the health  of  its  staff  relating  to  its  activities  in  line  with  its health standards.\n\nFollowing  the  HICE  (Health  Indicator  for  oCcupational Exposure)  indicator  targeting  noise  exposure  (HICE Noise), a new indicator dedicated to exposure to chemical agents  has  been  calculated  since  early  2023  (HICE Chemicals).  The  health  indicators  are  applied  to  all  sites affected  by  exposure  to  noise  and/or  chemical  agents. They correspond to the rate of potential exposure to these health  hazards  and  aims  to  promote  the  prioritization  of actions to reduce the risks of exposure to employees on the sites.\n\nThe 'HICE Bruit' indicator has been communicated twice a year  to  the  Group's  Executive  Committee  since  its deployment in 2021. At the end of 2022, it stands at a 17.4, which means that, on average, on each site, 17.4% of the work situations of employees and permanent subcontractors are subject to potential noise exposure.\n\nThe  'HICE  Chemicals'  indicator  also  tracks  the  progress that  remains  to  be  made  in  assessing  and  reducing chemical exposures at each site. HICE is the percentage to these exposures that are subject to potential exposure to hazardous substances that should be assessed or reduced. At its first communication early 2023, it reached 69.5 with a  'validation  rate'  of  risk  assessments  equal  to  36%.  This means that 36% of the sites have had the quality of their risk assessment  validated  by  a  trained  person  in accordance  with  the  Saint -Gobain  requirements  listed  in the 'risk assessment and control' standard. For these sites, the indicator is HICE 16.1. By default, the indicator for other sites that need to start or improve their risk assessment is HICE  100.  The  average  for  all  sites,  with  or  without  a validated assessment, is HICE 69.5.\n\n## Managing the risks of musculoskeletal disorders\n\nA  standard  for  assessing  factors  that  may  contribute  to the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders and a grid for detecting ergonomic factors were developed in 2021. The ergonomics standard lists the risk factors to be assessed and  specifies  the  method  for  assessing  these  risks,  in particular  on  the  basis  of  international  standards  (for example,  EN  ISO  14738:2008  and  ISO  11228-3).  The detection grid is an easy-to-use tool that lists the criteria to  be  assessed.  It  aims  to  identify  improvements  to  be made to a work situation through a before/after rating.\n\nThe Group has a set of information and precautions as to the  use  of  exoskeletons.  A  dedicated  platform  brings together the results of the work and recommendations of the INRS ( Institut  National de Recherche et de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 -the  French  national  research  and  safety  institute  for  the prevention  of  occupational  accidents  and  diseases)  and the IFA ( Institut f\u00fcr Arbeitsschutz der Deutschen Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung -the institute for occupational health and safety of German social insurance body  covering  accidents)  to  cover  the  use  of  an exoskeleton for the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).\n\n## b.  Safety\n\nSaint -Gobain  ensures  that  all  employees  on  its  sites, including  temporary  workers  and  subcontractors,  have safe working conditions and environments by identifying, reducing and controlling risks.\n\nAt  the  highest  level,  the  management  has  demonstrated its  involvement in the development of a culture of safety within  the  Group.  All  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors and the Executive Committee include safety performance reviews. Operational management is responsible everywhere and guarantees all aspects of safety: objectives,  action  plans  and  performance  measurement. To  underline  this  commitment,  part  of  managers'  annual variable  compensation  is  based  on  actions  and  results  in the area of safety. The performance of safety inspections and the application of safety standards are also considered.\n\nTo  build  on  this  result  and  sustain  the  overall  effort,  the TRAR  indicator  has  been  included  in  the  criteria  for  the long-term compensation plan since 2017 (see section 5.2 , p. 183).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nManaging impacts across the value chain\n\nWhen  a  serious  or  potentially  serious  event  (SIP  for 'Serious  Injury  Potential')  occurs,  local  management informs their superior. Once the victim has been rescued and  immediate  correction  action  has  been  taken,  an  indepth analysis of the accident is conducted, with the aim of  determining  the  root  causes  (technical,  human  and organizational factors) and developing an action plan. This analysis is undertaken with the local management, and an action plan is approved.\n\nThe results of the analysis and the key points identified are then  shared  via  the  global  networks  of  EHS  facilitators, either at an  entity  or  global  level,  and  also  with management. Alerts are circulated and shared with other sites,  in  order  to  raise  awareness  among  staff  about certain  risks  and  to  ask  the  following  questions:  'Could such an event occur on our site?' and 'If so, what can be done to prevent it?' Sharing information in this way helps to  strengthen  the  action  already  taken,  such  as  risk assessments  for  all  operations  and  the  introduction  of internal standards.\n\nThe  message  about  identification  of  potentially  serious events  is  periodically  reinforced,  for  example  during  the 'call  to  action'  for  all  site  managers  organized  by  the Group's  general  management  in  February  2022.  It  is essential  to  be  aware  of  them,  to  analyze  them  in  depth and then to take appropriate action to eliminate the root causes of these events, which have limited consequences, but  have  the  potential  to  cause  much  more  serious damage (such as a fatal accident) if the circumstances had been  slightly  different.  An  awareness-raising  video  was also broadcast throughout the Group in 2022.\n\nSafety inspections are organized on all sites according to the SMAT (Safety Management Tool) methodology. These inspections aim to encourage open dialog with the person visited,  on  the  subject of safety and health, following the observance  of  work  practices  by  the  inspector.  The positive  points  are  noted  as  a  priority,  as  well  as  any dangerous acts or conditions, which form the subject of an immediate priority action or an action incorporated into an action  plan.  A  guide  has  been  developed  to  help  local teams  train  visitors  and  people  visited  and  promote  the exchange of best practices. In 2022, 465,149 SMAT visits were carried out in the Group, which represents a ratio of 2.4 visits per employee, temporary worker and permanent subcontractor.\n\nNumerous  training  and  information  materials  and  tools have been developed or updated to support local teams in identifying and managing risk situations. For example, the tool '60s to Think' has been adapted to a more modern format  and  a  communication  on  the  concept  'Dare  to Take Care' has been distributed. 1,415 people completed at least one e-learning module in 2022. Two technical videos on  SIP  and  SMAT  have  been  translated  into  several languages  and  were  viewed  more  than  1,000  times  in 2022.  A  digital  platform  called  eSuite,  bringing  together EHS applications  to  help  sites  on  a  daily  basis  to  collect information  on  safety  visits,  risk  assessments,  event analyses,  action  plans,  etc.,  was  strengthened  in  2022  by integrating it into the MDH (Manufacturing Digital Hub) of the  OPEX  (Operational  Excellence)  department.  228 industrial sites are using the eSuite. Its deployment will be increased in 2023.\n\n## Solid results\n\nSaint -Gobain's  safety  commitment  applies  not  only  to  its employees  and  temporary  staff,  but  also  to  on-site subcontractors.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the TRAR (frequency rate of accidents with  and  without  lost  time  for  Saint -Gobain  employees, temporary  workers  and  permanent  subcontractors)  was 1.5. It was 1.9 at the end of December 2021. This significant reduction  is  attributable  to  awareness-raising  initiatives taken  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  by  both  General Management and the countries and businesses. France, for example, has seen its TRAR decrease by 41% in 2022.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, 76% of the entities did not declare any  occupational  accidents,  compared  with  74%  in  2021. The  'Millionaires  Club'  comprises  the  most  exemplary Group sites in terms of safety, with 1 million hours worked or  five  years  without  any  accidents  involving  lost  time, including all the individuals present on a site (employees, temporary  workers,  subcontractors,  visitors,  etc.).  At  the end of 2022, a total of 236 sites were in the 'Millionaires Club' (compared with 227 at the end of 2021). It values the entities that have the best results and that demonstrate to all  that  the  objective  of  zero  work-related  accidents  is possible. Among these sites, 86 are 'Silver Millionaires' (with ten years without a lost-time accident) and  56  'Gold  Millionaires'  (with  15  years  without  a  losttime accident).\n\nSaint -Gobain's  safety  commitment  applies  not  only  to  its employees  and  temporary  staff,  but  also  to  on-site subcontractors.  A  training  and  awareness-raising  course on  specific  risks  related  to  the  presence  of  on-site subcontractors  is  offered  to  the  teams  of  the  sites.  The buyer  network  is  also  involved  in  training  and  informing subcontractors  on  the  security  standards  to  be  put  in place and respected.\n\n## D - Environmental protection\n\nIn  addition  to  the  environmental  impact  management actions  integrated  into  the  'environment'  pillar  of  the WCM program (see section 3.1.3 , p. 77), thematic policies are  deployed  at  the  sites  for  stronger  impact  reduction measures. Each Saint -Gobain site implements an environmental  management  program  that  complies  with the Group reference base (see section 3.1.3, p. 76)\n\n## a.  Energy and air emissions\n\nSaint -Gobain's  policy  on  'energy,  atmospheric  emissions and  climate  change'  aims  to  reduce  its  greenhouse  gas emissions,  by  reducing  its  energy  consumption  while switching  to  low-carbon  solutions,  whether  through  its industrial processes, infrastructure or logistics, on all sites. To  coordinate  measures  to  reduce  energy  consumption and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (scopes  1  and  2)  energy and climate managers have been appointed for the most energy-intensive industrial processes. They are tasked with analyzing performance gaps relative to the best performers  and  with  sharing  best  practices  to  be replicated across all sites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "Fight against air pollution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nManaging impacts across the value chain\n\nEach  site,  in  a  manner  commensurate  with  their  impact, sets  the  progress  targets  and  monitoring  procedures  for managing energy and atmospheric emissions, taking into account comparisons on processes between the different sites.  All  of  these  actions  are  part  of  the  CO2  roadmap, established to track the Group's commitment  to contribute  to  the  objectives  of  contributing  to  carbon neutrality by 2050 (cf. section 3.3.3, p. 113).\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nDirect CO2 emissions of Saint -Gobain (scope 1) are mainly related  to  its  industrial  activities.  These  CO2  emissions result  from  the  combustion  of  fossil  fuels  and  chemical reactions  used  in  the  manufacturing  processes  (e.g.  the decarbonization of carbonates in the glass fusion processes). The Group's indirect CO2 emissions (scope 2) are  essentially  connected  with  its  electricity  purchases. The use of recycled raw materials in industrial  processes makes  it possible to reduce energy consumption, particularly  for  glass  melting.  In  the  case  of  flat  glass, energy  consumption  is  reduced  by  3%  when  the percentage of cullet is increased from 20% to 30% of raw materials. This reduction  in  energy  consumption  is accompanied by a reduction  in  CO2  emissions  (scope  1), while the reduction of virgin raw materials contributes to a reduction  of  greenhouse  gases  due  to  supply  chains ('scope' 3).\n\nThe Group is encouraging energy audits on its sites and is setting  up  a  system  for  energy  management  drawing  on ISO 50001 certification. As of the end of 2022, 161 sites in the scope concerned were ISO 50001-certified, representing 39% of Saint -Gobain's annual energy consumption.  In  addition,  the  Group  has  developed  an energy audit of industrial facilities to identify solutions for improving  the  energy  efficiency  of  facilities,  in  particular through  better  insulation.  This  tool,  which  is  currently being  deployed,  will  contribute  to  the  identification  and implementation  of  measures  to  reduce  the  energy consumption of sites, as well as the resulting emissions.\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  an  active  approach  to  controlling  all atmospheric emissions. Environmental managers coordinate  this  process.  When  the  primary  measures  are not sufficiently effective, dust emissions are controlled by investments  in  electrostatic  precipitators  or  bag  filters, depending on the type of industrial facility. This equipment also makes it possible to filter the heavy metals resulting from  impurities  contained  in  certain  raw  materials.  Some of  the  Group's  plants,  mainly  glass  furnaces  and  pipeline production  sites,  emit  substances  that  contribute  to  the acidification of environments such as sulfur dioxide (S02) or nitrogen oxides (N0x). The primary measures introduced to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions include the reduction in energy consumption and the use of fuels with a  low  sulfur  content.  Primary  measures  to  optimize processes,  particularly  combustion,  make  it  possible  to reduce  N0x  emissions  at  source.  In  addition  to  these primary measures, equipment for the secondary treatment of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides is also installed.\n\nSaint -Gobain  Glass  is  continuing  to  install  atmospheric pollution  control  equipment  on  all  its  float  production lines,  taking  advantage of line stoppages and repairs. On\n\n\u00cb\n\nits  28  glass  furnaces,  23  are  equipped  with  a  system  for the treatment of dust and S02, and 15 of a N0x. In three years, these actions have reduced dust emissions by 30%, S02 emissions by 20% and N0x emissions by 12% per ton of product sold.\n\nSome  industrial  sites  are  affected  by  Volatile  Organic Compound (VOC) emissions as a result of their industrial process. On-site monitoring is based on measurements as needed. The aim is to check that emissions are below the limits set by the environmental operation permit; as such, it  is  heavily dependent on the local context. Optimization of raw  materials  can  reduce  VOC  emissions,  while secondary  measures  through  a  decontamination  unit  are implemented when necessary.\n\n## b.  Water management\n\nSaint -Gobain's Water policy ('Water policy') confirms the desire  to  reduce  the  impacts  of  the  Group's  activities  on water resources as much as possible, whether in terms of water  intake  or  discharge.  The  long-term  objective  is  to withdraw as little  water  as  possible  and  to  aim  for  'zero discharge' of industrial water in liquid form, while avoiding generating  new  impacts  for  other  natural  environments and/or  for  other  stakeholders.  To  this  end,  Saint -Gobain does its utmost to:\n\n- \u00b7 reduce water withdrawals from the natural environment and optimize processes to minimize water consumption;\n- \u00b7 reuse 'process' water whenever possible;\n- \u00b7 recycle on-site or off-site with appropriate treatments;\n- \u00b7 not degrade water quality by reducing and controlling discharges into the natural environment and preventing any accidental pollution;\n- \u00b7 not  compete  with  local  populations  for  access  to drinking water.\n\nTo assess the water sensitivity of its sites, the Group uses the global 'Aqueduct' atlas of the WRI organization. This atlas  is  based  not  only  on  qualitative  and  quantitative physical risks (such as water stress or flood risk), but also on stakeholder risk (like access to water). This tool enables each industrial  site  to  assess  its  water  risk  from  'low'  to 'extremely high'. In 2022, 75 sites representing approximately  7%  of  water  withdrawals  and  3%  of Saint -Gobain discharge were located in high or extremely high-risk areas.\n\nMost  of  the  water  discharges  are  from  cooling  plants where  the  water  does  not  come  into  contact  with  any chemicals used in the process. The risks of impact on the quality  of  our  water  discharges  are  limited  to  certain  of our  activities,  such  as  the  manufacture  of  fiberglass  and glass  wool,  the  use  of  certain  ceramic  materials  and certain types of abrasives and the use of certain products in  our  chemical  construction  business.  Industrial  sites  are required to comply with local regulations and environmental  permits  regarding  effluent  treatment  and quality measures. In 2022, the Group published a technical guide on water efficiency for these industrial sites, which defines the applicable treatments according to the nature of the waste.",

        "page_content": "## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nManaging impacts across the value chain\n\nThe  'Focus  Site'  program  consists  of  supporting  sites which  contribute  to  80%  of  the  Group's  environmental indicator. In 2022, 41 sites contributed 80% of Saint -Gobain's water discharges and 109 sites for 80% of the samples. These focus sites drew up a short-, medium-, and  long-term  action  plan  to  reduce  their  impact.  The Group's  commitment  to  water  preservation  has  led  it  to participate, since 2012, in the CDP Water Disclosure, which aims  to  encourage  businesses  to  report  in  detail  on  the risks  and  opportunities  concerning  water  management and to report results transparently. In 2022, Saint -Gobain obtained an A- rating.\n\n## c.  Resource management\n\nSaint -Gobain has the long-term ambition of not producing any  non-recovered  production  waste  and  of  maximizing the  recycled  or  bio  based  content  of  its  products  and packaging.  The  Group  believes  that  waste  should  be considered  as  a  strategic  resource  and  that  secondary materials (from reuse or recycling) or co-products should be  used  whenever  possible  as  a  substitute  for  nonrenewable  virgin  resources.  The  policy  of  sustainable management of resources aims to promote the responsible management of resources in order to promote the transition to the circular economy.\n\nThe  main  focuses  for  the  deployment  of  this  policy  are incorporating  as  much  reused,  recycled  or  bio-sourced content  into  its  products  as  possible,  generating  as  little production waste as possible, and recovering waste from its processes internally or externally.\n\nIn line with Saint -Gobain's Health policy and in compliance with  local  regulations,  the  management  of  hazardous waste  is  closely  monitored  to  protect  the  health  of employees, residents, customers and users of its products and services.\n\n## Reducing and recovering waste\n\nThe industrial sites are working to reduce the quantities of waste  generated  in  accordance  with  the  three  Rs hierarchy:  Reduce,  Reuse  and  Recycle.  Incineration  and landfilling should be reduced until they are eliminated.\n\nOperational  excellence  carried  out  in  the  WCM  program (see section 3.1.3, p. 77), particularly in terms of quality and productivity,  is  the  first  approach  to  reduce  waste  and optimize the use of resources. The sites then seek to reuse production  waste  in  their  own  industrial  process.  Thus, sites  are  investing  in  units  to  reprocess  their  waste  and adapt  their  industrial  processes.  For  example,  in  2022, investments  were  made  at  several  sites  in  the  United States, such  as  in Nashville, Arkansas, where  the manufacturing site is now able to recycle in a closed loop this  production  waste,  equivalent  to  more  than  50,000 tons  per  year,  thus  saving  as  much  virgin  material  and avoiding  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with landfilling.\n\nEven for industrial processes favorable to the incorporation  of  recycled  materials,  optimizations  are possible. Saint -Gobain's plasterboard manufacturing plant in Vietnam has introduced a process to separate the paper from the plasterboard during a waste reprocessing phase.\n\nThe  plaster  is  reincorporated  into  the  process  when  the paper is recycled in the manufacture of cardboard via an external  recovery  network.  Production  waste  generated during  the  production  of  bitumen  membranes  in  the United States is recovered externally for use in addition to bitumen in road construction or renovation.\n\nSome  of  the  waste  generated  during  the  production  of mineral  wools  is  reprocessed  before  being  recovered externally  as  a  secondary  raw  material  for  the  roofing industry  or  for  certain  manufacturers  that  manufacture acoustic ceilings. The Group is also involved in the creation of  recycling  networks  with  the  help  of  external  local partners. Progress in the reduction and recycling of waste made  at  certain  Group  sites  shows  that  'zero  nonrecovered waste' is an achievable ambition.\n\n## Increase the share of recycled materials used in production\n\nSome  of  Saint -Gobain's products can be recycled indefinitely in a closed loop in their industrial process, for example glass or plaster products. Industrial processes are then  adapted  to  replace  natural  raw  materials  with recycled  materials  from  internal  or  external  collection whose characteristics, in terms of granulometry, moisture or impurity rate, may differ from virgin materials. With the support of external partners, channels are being set up to collect, transport, sort and reprocess waste, before turning it  into secondary raw materials that can be put back into our  processes.  Other  Group  products  also  accept  the replacement of virgin raw materials by recycled materials from other consumption circuits, for example glass wool, cast-iron pipe, ceramic grains and powders.\n\nActions are also being taken in all the Group's businesses to  accelerate  the  transition  to  a  circular  economy,  for example through innovation initiatives, the development of new industrial processes for recycling products at the end of their life cycle, the  implementation  of  industrial symbiosis  enabling  us  to  use  the  waste  from  certain industries as raw material for our own needs, etc.\n\nThis  change  in  composition,  which  involves  reducing extracted  virgin  material  inputs  to  replace  them  with recycled  materials  from  end-of-life  product  recovery channels  requires  adapting  industrial  sites,  in  particular raw  material  storage  areas,  composition  workshops,  or even industrial processes themselves.\n\nThe amount of recycled material in the products depends mainly on the existence of efficient, sustainable collection networks capable of supplying the sites.\n\nThe  approach  applied  to  products  also  applies  to  the packaging that accompanies them. Action plans are rolled out at the central level and relayed to the national level to increase  the  recyclability  and  recycled  content  of  the packaging used.\n\nThe  procedures  for  collecting  end-of-life  products  are described in section 3.4.4, p. 118.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Biodiversity and land use\n\nSaint -Gobain  is  particularly  committed  to  protecting biodiversity  at  its  high-impact  sites  or  in  areas  with remarkable biodiversity. Thanks to the experience acquired in the field of extraction activities, the Group now has strong internal expertise in the area; it has adopted a biodiversity policy, the aim of which is to preserve, restore, enhance  and  boost  biodiversity,  and  to  this  end  to encourage the involvement of all relevant stakeholders.\n\nA  mapping  study  of  all  Saint -Gobain  sites,  carried  out using  geographic  tools  such  as  WDPA,  is  updated regularly  and  makes  it  possible  to  assess  their  sensitivity to  ecosystems  based  on  their  proximity  to  areas  of  high biodiversity  value.  The  protected  areas  considered  are areas  recognized  by  the  International  Union  for  the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) or more locally defined as Natura  2000  or  RAMSAR  areas.  In  2019,  the  study  was continued, adding as criteria the environmental impact of the sites, the expectations of stakeholders and the actions already  undertaken  in  terms  of  biodiversity.  This  made  it possible  to  finalize  a  list  of  around  one  hundred  priority sites in 2021, the vast majority of which were quarries, for the implementation of biodiversity management plans and the sharing of best practices.\n\nOut of the 99 underground or surface quarries operated by  the  Group  worldwide,  the  vast  majority  are  for  the production  of  gypsum  (72,  representing  73%).  A  charter for  the  environment  and  biodiversity  in  all  Saint -Gobain's quarries and mines was published in 2019, capitalizing on the experience acquired over many years in gypsum. The Group's quarries are operated and then restored with the aim of preserving the environment in accordance with the local  rules.  During  the  operating  and  restoration  period, the  effects  on  residents  and  on  the  environment  are reduced  as  much  as  possible:  visual  impact,  dust,  noise and vibration, consequences to road traffic and repercussions on the local natural environments. In 2022, 28%  of  Saint -Gobain  priority  sites,  around  two  thirds  of which  are  active  quarries,  already  had  a  biodiversity management plan analyzed centrally. 'Biodiversity representatives'  have  been  appointed  at  each  of  the priority sites. A training module explaining the challenges of  biodiversity  and  the  successful  implementation  of  a biodiversity management plan was rolled out, and around twenty  best  practices  in  terms  of  biodiversity  were distributed internally.\n\nSaint -Gobain participates in the 'Act4nature International' program,  a  voluntary  commitment  to  biodiversity  from international  companies:  one  of  the  strong  commitments concerns the implementation of biodiversity management plans for all active open-cast quarries by 2025.\n\n## 3.1.4  DESIGNING AND DISTRIBUTING SUSTAINABLE AND EFFICIENT SOLUTIONS\n\n## A - An innovation process focused on safety and performance\n\nSaint -Gobain  regularly  develops  its  innovation  methods and processes to meet  new  market  expectations, particularly  the  development  of  ever  more  sustainable solutions (products, systems and services). The innovation approach,  made  up  of  iterations,  creativity,  agility  and openness to the outside world (university, partners, etc.), puts  the  customer  at  the  heart  of  the  project  from  the identification of needs to the validation of prototypes.\n\nThe methods used concern local projects and international projects  (via  pilot  countries).  The  marketing  teams  are involved  in  the  characterization  of  needs  (functional analysis)  and  formalize  functional  specifications.  These specifications are the foundations for the development of the  innovation  that  will  be  taken  up  by  the  R&D  teams. Customers  are  also involved in the validation of industrialized solutions before their launch.\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  a  procedure  for  monitoring  innovation applied  to  products,  which  is  initiated  by  the  R&D  and marketing  teams.  The  tool  is  a  sequenced  operational roadmap for the development teams, where every step in the innovation process is reviewed by a committee set up for this purpose.  This  methodology  allows  for  the identification of and  prompt  attention  to  potential problems. Close monitoring of the progress achieved and product performance means that the process of innovation is faster and more secure.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe environment, health and safety checklist, introduced in 2008, is integrated into the innovation process. It enables a  qualitative  assessment  of  the  substances  included  in product  formulations  and  identification  and  reduction  of environmental and health and safety impacts throughout the product  life cycle. With  regard  to  hazardous substances,  the  aim  is  to  prevent  the  use  of  new hazardous  substances  and  reduce  their  use  in  raw materials  while  reducing  and  controlling  exposure  levels. The  innovation  process  incorporates  normative  and regulatory  requirements,  from  the  functional  marketing specifications  stage.  Local  marketing  teams  ensure  that products comply with regulations and standards applicable  in  the  countries  of  commercialization.  The process for launching new products, systems and services is  checked  within  the  framework  of  internal  control  (see 6.2 , p. 230). It is regularly updated to improve the quality management system procedures and associated monitoring  indicators.  Technical  products  are  launched after  sales  force  training  and  reinforced  support  by product  managers  and  technical  trainers.  In  several countries,  they  intervene  directly  on  the  worksites  when installers use a differentiating innovation for the first time, throughout the launch phases until the sales organization reaches  a  sufficient  level  of  maturity.  The  marketing  and sales community, which brings together teams in different countries and  activities, shares best practices and facilitates the integration of newly acquired brands.",

        "page_content": "## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nManaging impacts across the value chain\n\nSaint -Gobain University's Unicampus program (see section 3.2.3 , p. 95) offers five training courses on the innovation  process.  In  2022,  1928  people  were  trained. These training courses are intended primarily for the R&D, the marketing functions of local activities and newcomers in marketing or central R&D teams. A product compliance training module  has  also  been  integrated  into  the program.  Concrete  courses  combining  theory,  practice and experience sharing are offered widely to the principal offices  involved  in  the  innovation  process,  such  as marketing,  R&D,  purchasing,  production  and  industrial efficiency.\n\nA new training course was launched in 2021, 'Derisking a key success factor for your innovations', whose objective is to greatly increase  the  success  and  impact  of innovations while reducing lead times by relying on better anticipation.  Built  around  the  Business  Model  Canvas,  it helps  identify  all  types  of  risks  and  conditions  for  the success of innovation projects at each stage of development, including launch.\n\nFinally,  the  World  Class  Manufacturing  (WCM)  industrial excellence  program  (see  section  3.1.3 , p.  77)  ensures  the deployment  of  best  practices  in  terms  of  quality  and product  compliance  at  industrial  sites,  based  on  the ISO 9001.\n\nAt the European level, the Group contributes to the work of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) in developing standards and regulatory systems. Likewise, its active participation in European interprofessional associations  such  as  EURIMA,  Eurogypsum,  Glass  for Europe and EMO provides input into the Group's vision of standards  development  in  Europe,  in  particular  through exchanges  with  the  European  Commission  and  its institutions  such  as  the  European  Chemical  Agency (ECHA) in charge of the REACH regulation.\n\nWith  regard  to  consumer  information,  the  Group's products  comply  with  current  regulations,  such  as  CE marking  in  Europe  or  the  requirement  for  chemical products  to  have  labels  and  safety  data  sheets  (SDS). Saint -Gobain  also  provides  non-mandatory  information specific to some of its products, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 voluntary safety data declaration sheets for unclassified articles or substances;\n- \u00b7 the declaration of the composition of components and materials via the IMDS database (International Material Data System) in the case of the automotive industry;\n- \u00b7 specific  labels  such  as  the  environmental  and  health data sheet for construction products in France;\n- \u00b7 voluntary  certifications  obtained  through  independent national  laboratories  -  or,  failing  that,  international laboratories  close  to  these  markets  -  when  innovative products or systems are not covered by international or national standards.\n\nSpecific  measures  related  to  the  product  compliance program are presented in section 3.1.3, p. 78.\n\n## B -  Customer satisfaction\n\nKnowledge  of  current  and  future  market  expectations  is essential  in  order  to  achieve  Saint -Gobain's medium- and long-term  targets.  For  this  reason,  the  satisfaction  of  its customers is a priority for the Group, whose objective is to be an organization focused on their expectations.\n\nTo measure customer satisfaction, several practices have been extended to all Group activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Firstly,  a  short  questionnaire  is  sent  to  all  customers and potential customers, both direct and indirect, at the time  of  each  interaction,  in  order  to  identify  the  main points  of  satisfaction  and  dissatisfaction,  and  to determine  the  net  promoter  score,  the  only  measure common  to  all;  this  refined  measure  will  eventually make all customers the Group's primary influencers;\n- \u00b7 Secondly, a more rigorous and responsive measurement  of  compliance  and  punctuality  since these  two  parameters  are  the  two  most  frequent sources of dissatisfaction in all the questionnaires: first and  foremost,  customers  demand  that  their  suppliers' promises be kept.\n\nThus, customer satisfaction measurements are carried out on a regular basis for all activities.\n\nIn  the  field,  brands  are  increasingly  collecting  feedback from  customers  (defined  as  any  person  having  an influence on the purchasing decision) on a relationship and transactional  level,  with  the  dissemination,  internally  and across functions, of best practice in the area. This data is cross-referenced  with  the  context  of  the  relationship,  as well as with the type of customers, in order to assess the degree of satisfaction throughout their journey, i.e., across the  entire  chain  of  interactions  between  them  and  the Group's brands. In this context, the satisfaction questionnaires  already  implemented  have  shown  that compliance and punctuality are the most frequently cited negative points.\n\nOne  of  the  Group's  areas  of  excellence  and  progress  is training  in  order  to  build  a  growing  community  of customer  experience  experts.  Each  year,  more  than  200 people  are  trained  in  customer  experience  methods  and concepts through the Unicampus program. In addition, a platform called 'Pulse' has been created to centralize and make  available  to  Saint -Gobain  countries  and  entities methodologies  and  tools  for  managing  the  customer experience,  such  as  'personas',  i.e.,  the  definition  of groups of customers whose behaviors and preferences are merged into a single predictive model.\n\nIn addition to the measurement of satisfaction itself, all of these  systems  create  the  basis  for  a  co-development approach;  on  the  basis  of  customer  opinions,  a  shared innovation process can be put in place.\n\n## C - A range of sustainable and efficient solutions\n\nSaint -Gobain's ambition is to offer solutions that combine performance  and  sustainability  to  meet  the  expectations of  its  stakeholders,  in  particular  its  customers,  and  to enable acceleration towards a more sustainable and lowcarbon economy.\n\nA standard method has been deployed in the organization. It  is  adapted  to  local  markets  and  circumstances  to identify  the  most  relevant  solutions  and  measure  the provided  benefits.  The  impacts  of  the  solutions  are assessed  across  the  entire  value  chain  and  for  the  main stakeholders involved, right through to the end user.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

The measurement  of  the performance  of  solutions  focuses  on  the  increase  in economic  value  for  the  customer  (productivity  or  other financial benefits) and the user experience.\n\nIn  order  to  standardize  the  measurement of impacts and to accelerate differentiation in its markets, use cases have been  selected  to  illustrate the value provided  by Saint -Gobain solutions. They concern the decarbonization of  industry  through  the  solutions  of  the  HPS,  renovation and new construction Business Units. For each use case, local  teams  identify  solutions  combining  products  and services offered by the brands and distribution networks. The tools developed enable them to measure the benefits and  thus  to  adapt  the  offer  and  the  sales  pitch  to  the expectations of the stakeholders.\n\nThis  program  covers  more  than  90%  of  Saint -Gobain's sales  and  helps  to  orient  Saint -Gobain's  offer  towards sustainable  construction  markets.  The  methodology  used to identify sustainable solutions is available on the Group's website  and  has  been  reviewed  by  an  independent  third party.\n\n## 3.1.5  ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE\n\n## A - Applying Saint -Gobain's Principles of Conduct and Action\n\nThe Principles of Conduct and Action charter is the code of ethics that forms the foundation of all of Saint -Gobain's policies  and  commitments  (see  section  1.2.2,  p.  16).  The principles  define  the  values  and  rules  applicable  to  all Group  entities  and  employees,  across  all  employment contract types (permanent contracts, fixed-term contracts and temporary workers), and also to their subcontractors and  suppliers.  This  applies  in  particular  to  compliance policies,  the  human  rights  policy,  the  environmental, health,  and  safety  charter,  the  purchasing  and  suppliers' charters  of  the  responsible  purchasing  program,  and  the diversity policy.\n\nThe  code  of  ethics  also  sets  out  the  procedures  for working  with  stakeholders,  with  a  particular  focus  on permanent  on-site  subcontractors,  other  subcontractors and  suppliers.  For  this  reason,  it  is  translated  into 31  languages  and  is  available  on  the  Group's  website  for wide distribution to stakeholders. Each employee, including  those  on  fixed-term  contracts  and  temporary workers, receives information during their induction about the  code  of  ethics  in  the  local  language.  This  may  take various forms, depending on the country:\n\n- \u00b7 A welcome brochure with comments from the Human Resources representative;\n- \u00b7 The  code  of  ethics  directly  incorporated  into  the employment contract.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe criteria used to measure environmental benefits are:\n\n- \u00b7 energy efficiency and its carbon impact;\n- \u00b7 optimization  of  natural  resources,  including  water resources;\n- \u00b7 all products and services that support the environmental efficiency of other industries.\n\nThe  criteria  used  to  evaluate  the  benefits  in  terms  of health, comfort and well-being are:\n\n- \u00b7 safety and security, including the reduction of occupational risks in the value chain;\n- \u00b7 ergonomics;\n- \u00b7 indoor air quality;\n- \u00b7 acoustic comfort;\n- \u00b7 thermal comfort;\n- \u00b7 visual comfort.\n\nThe share of revenue generated with sustainable solutions is  73.9%  in  2022  in  line  with  the  target  of  75%  by  2025. Saint -Gobain's  sustainable  solutions  revenue  includes activities  not  assessed  in  the  context  of  compliance  with the  European  regulation  2020/852  Taxonomy  regulation (see  section  9.3.5,  p.  389)  such  as  distribution  activities, impacts and benefits not yet integrated into the regulation such  as  resources  and  the  circular  economy  or  finally benefits  related  to  health,  safety  and  comfort  that  will potentially be eligible for the social taxonomy.\n\nAn  e-learning  course  called  'Adhere'  is  available  for  all employees  and  is  compulsory  for  all  managers.  The Saint -Gobain  University  Management  School  offers  an introduction  to  business  ethics  to  allow  managers  to discuss issues and share their operational experiences.\n\nThe Group has set for itself the goal of training each new manager, within the first year of integration, to the code of ethics,  the  fight  against  corruption  and  compliance  with competition  law  ('Adhere',  ACT  and  Comply).  This objective is included in the CSR dashboard monitored by the Board of Directors (see section 4.2.1, p. 134).\n\n## B - Deploying the ethics and compliance programs\n\nAt Saint -Gobain, the ethics and compliance programs are thus designed and implemented as a natural extension of the Group's values and commitments.\n\nWhile ethics aims to ensure that everyone complies at all times  with  the  values  at  the  heart  of  the  Principles  of Conduct  and  Action,  compliance  aims  to  ensure  that everyone  always  complies  with  laws,  regulations  and international  conventions  applicable  to  the  Group  and internal  rules  derived  from  them,  the  violation  of  which could result  in  penalties  (disciplinary,  civil,  administrative, or  criminal)  for  the  company,  its  executives  and  its employees  and/or  commercial,  financial  and  reputational damage.",

Commitment of the management bodies\n\nIn ethics and compliance, the Board of Directors exercises control  over  general  management.  As  such,  its  role  is twofold:\n\n- \u00b7 It  ensures  that  ethics  and  compliance issues are taken into account in major strategic choices;\n- \u00b7 It  ensures  that  the  ethics  and  compliance  program  is properly implemented.\n\nThe  involvement  of  general  management  is  crucial  for ethics  and  compliance. It promotes and disseminates the culture  of  ethics  and  compliance,  demonstrating  its commitment through the following actions:\n\n- \u00b7 Taking  into  account  ethics  and  compliance  issues  in strategic projects or decisions;\n- \u00b7 Implementing the ethics and compliance program with the support of the Ethics and Compliance Department;\n- \u00b7 Communicating  internally  and  externally  its  overall support  for  the  ethics  and  compliance  program, particularly regarding zero tolerance for corruption and the whistle-blowing system.\n\n## b.  Ethics and Compliance Department\n\nIts  mission  is  to  promote  and  defend  the  Principles  of Conduct  and  Action  and  to  design  and  implement  the Group's  ethics  and  compliance  program  in  the  areas  of business ethics, competition  law,  the  fight against corruption,  influence  peddling  and  money  laundering, economic sanctions and export controls, data protection, the  duty  of  care  and  human  rights.  It  identifies  and assesses risks, proposes policies, procedures and programs  to  mitigate  these  risks  and  conducts  internal whistle-blowing  investigations.  Finally,  it  develops  and provides training and communication for the programs.\n\nThe  department  consists  of  the  central  ethics  and compliance team, which relies on a network of ethics and compliance managers in the regions and activities who are responsible  for  ensuring  the  effective  deployment  of  the programs within their scope.\n\nBeyond that, Business Compliance Correspondents (BCC) in  the  countries  and  Business  Units  have  the  role  of ensuring  the  dissemination  and  knowledge,  within  their scope, of the Group's ethics and compliance program and culture.\n\n## C - Main ethics and compliance policies\n\n## a.  Compliance with anti-corruption and influence-peddling rules\n\nAll  over  the  world,  corruption  undermines  trust  in  public institutions, makes the most vulnerable even weaker and is the breeding ground for violence, slowing the transition to a  more  sustainable  world.  The  active  fight  against  this scourge is of concern to everyone.\n\nSince  2003,  Saint -Gobain  has  expressed  its  commitment to  the  fight  against  corruption  by  signing  the  United Nations Global Compact, the 10th principle of which calls on companies to take action against corruption.\n\nSince  2003,  the  Group  has  set  up  a  program  to  prevent the risks of corruption and influence peddling, including a commitment  from  executives  and  strict  compliance  with the principle of 'zero tolerance'.\n\nIn particular, this program is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 a  mapping  of  the  risks  of  corruption  and  influence peddling;\n- \u00b7 policies and procedures;\n- \u00b7 training,  in  particular  the  digital  training  called  'ACT', which  is  received  by  all  managers  when  they  are onboarded as well as every two years;\n- \u00b7 communication actions;\n- \u00b7 audits  conducted  internally  or  by  external  service providers;\n- \u00b7 a whistle-blowing system open to all Group employees and all other stakeholders.\n\nIn  2020, the Group publicly released a new version of its anti-corruption policy on the fight against corruption and influence peddling.\n\nThe purpose of this manual is to define and illustrate the various  types  of  behavior  to  be  prohibited,  review  the Group's rules  and  the  best  practices  to  adopt.  It  gathers the  procedures  relating  to  all  areas  in  which  corruption and influence-peddling risks are likely to materialize, such as  gifts  and  invitations,  conflicts  of  interest,  recruitment, mergers and acquisitions, or the management  of intermediaries.\n\nAll  Saint -Gobain employees must feel responsible for the fight  against  corruption.  That  is  why  in  2022,  a  digital register  to  collect  employee  declarations  regarding  gifts and invitations (given or received), donations, patronage, sponsorship  and  conflicts  of  interest  was  added  to  the corruption and influence-peddling prevention and detection system. It is accompanied by an update of the corresponding procedures.\n\nThe  anti-corruption  policy  is  fully  committed  to  by  both the  Group's  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group's Executive Committee and was signed by nearly 3,000 senior employees when it was launched.\n\n## b.  Compliance with competition law\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  put  in  place  a  competition  law compliance program based on:\n\n- \u00b7 policies and procedures, especially regarding membership  with  professional  associations,  which  are now declared in a dedicated digital tool;\n- \u00b7 training  and  communication  actions:  practical  guides are  made  available,  in  particular  'The  ins  and  outs  of competition  law'  available  on  the  Group's  website;  an e-learning  training  course  called  'Comply'  is  received for  the  first  time  by  all  managers  when  they  are onboarding,  and  then  repeated  every  two  years; numerous  in-person  training  sessions  are  provided  by the Ethics and Compliance Department and the ethics and  compliance  managers;  lastly,  the  theme  was covered as part of the Principles of Conduct and Action Day;\n- \u00b7 audits conducted by external service providers (see section 6.2.2, p. 231)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Compliance with economic sanctions and export control regulations\n\nSaint -Gobain has implemented a program for compliance with  economic sanctions and export controls. It  is  based on:\n\n- \u00b7 a  Group policy, 'Trade compliance', which is currently being overhauled;\n- \u00b7 a  network  of  people  in  charge  of  these  issues  for  the Group's activities, deployed at the relevant level of the regional  activities,  the  Business  Units,  or  the  country level;\n- \u00b7 tools to monitor the evolution of applicable regulations are available: a screening tool (screening sanctions) of third parties and country files to identify risks and apply the necessary diligence updated in line with changes in regulations;\n- \u00b7 training and communication actions: managers exposed to  these  issues  undergo  training;  in-person  training  is provided by members of the dedicated network;\n- \u00b7 'sanctions  and  export  control'  audits  conducted  by external service providers on Group entities previously identified by the central team.\n\n## d.  Personal data protection\n\nSaint -Gobain  pays  particular  attention  to  personal  data protection.  The  Group  policy  on  this  subject  is  publicly available on its website. The purpose of this policy is to set out data collection, use, communication and confidentiality conditions.\n\nAs  Saint -Gobain's  activities  are  highly  decentralized,  the data  protection  governance  aims  to  support  the  entities by taking into account their needs and the local context in which  they  operate.  Within  the  European  Union,  each Group entity must appoint a Privacy Correspondent who manages the compliance of activities with the support of a Privacy  Advisor  and  in  close  collaboration  with  the business  lines  (IT,  digital  technology,  marketing,  human resources, etc.). This network of employees who dedicate part  of  their  work  to  maintaining  this  approach  (Data Protection  Network)  is  run  by  a  central  team  (Data Protection  Central  Team),  headed  by  the  Group  Data Protection Officer. It is composed of 40 Privacy Advisors approximately  (lawyers  or  auditors)  and  about  400 Privacy Correspondents (operational profiles).\n\n\u00cb\n\nOutside the European Union, the Legal Departments also take  these  issues  into  account.  Each  entity  must  appoint an employee who will be the point of contact dedicated to personal data protection issues. Saint -Gobain encourages the application of key  principles  of  personal  data protection,  regardless  of  the  location  of  the  entity.  As such,  in  the  main  countries  concerned,  these  principles provide protection beyond the local regulations in force.\n\nCommunication  actions  are  implemented  with  the  Data Privacy Network and functions (human resources, IT, etc.). Practical  guides  and  procedures  are  made  available  to them. Training is given, in particular through an e-learning course called 'Data Protection by Saint -Gobain'.\n\nSaint -Gobain  continues  to  roll  out  a  data  protection management platform in its European entities, and also in other  regions  (for  example  in  Brazil).  This  platform facilitates  the  governance  of  personal  data  protection, notably  by  keeping  records  of  processing  activities, assessing  the  guarantees  presented  by  service  providers in  terms  of  data  protection,  carrying  out  related  Data Protection  Impact  Analysis  (DPIAs),  the  management  of incidents involving personal data, etc. Training in the use of this platform is regularly offered to Privacy Correspondents and to Privacy Advisors.\n\nThe  Group  has  developed  a  new  tool  allowing  the  Data Protection Network to better document the management of  these  incidents  and  contribute  to  the  annual  data breach assessment.\n\nLastly, personal data protection is covered by the internal control reference framework for both companies established in the European  Union  and  for  those established outside the European Union (see section 6.2.5 , p. 241).\n\n## e.  Taxation\n\nSaint -Gobain acts in compliance with the tax laws of the countries in which it operates and fulfills its tax reporting and payment obligations in time. The Group has therefore not established structures whose purpose is tax evasion. It applies  tax  laws  and  regulations  with  honesty  and integrity.  Its  intragroup  transactions  comply  with  the arm's-length principle.\n\nEven  if  the  new  rules  related  to  the  reform  of  the international  tax  system  initiated  by  the  OECD  have  not yet all been defined, Saint -Gobain does not anticipate any significant  change  in  its  income  tax  expense  since  it  is correlated  with  its  locations  and  therefore  with  the creation of the value.",

Commitments\n\nSaint -Gobain's  values,  formalized  by  the  Principles  of Conduct and Action, are an essential vector of mobilization  for  human  rights  due  to  their  reference  to international conventions, such as the International Charter on  Human  Rights  or  the  applicable  conventions  of  the International  Labor  Organization  and  in  particular  the conventions  87,  98,  111  and  135  on  the  freedom  of association and protection of the right to organize, on the right to organize and collective bargaining, on discrimination, and on workers' representatives respectively.\n\nSaint -Gobain has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003. The first two principles of the Global Compact invite companies to 'support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed  human rights'  (principle  No.  1)  and  'make  sure  that  their  own companies are not complicit in human rights abuses' (principle No. 2).\n\nIn  2019,  the  Group  published  its  policy  on  respect  for human rights. The policy has been presented to the Board of  Directors.  It  describes  how  Saint -Gobain  takes  into account human rights impacts and outlines the associated due  diligence  process.  The  whole  approach  is  based  on the  recommendations  of  the  United  Nations,  particularly the  guiding  principles  on  business  and  human  rights. Accordingly,  Saint -Gobain  is  committed  to  respecting human  rights  wherever  the  Group  conducts  its  activities and in its supply chain.\n\n## b.  Analysis of human rights risks in the Group's activities\n\nSaint -Gobain's  main  human  rights  issues  are  identified following  the  methodology  proposed  by  the  United Nations  in  the  context  of  the  application  of  its  guiding principles and concern the human rights that are likely to be most seriously affected by the negative impact of the company's activities and its value chain.\n\nThe  method  to  identify  the  risks  of  actual  or  potential negative impacts draws on the United Nations' reference base  and  on  external  sources  recognized  for  their relevance.  These  sources  are  linked  to  international institutions  such  as  the  United  Nations  with  the  Human Development Index, specialist non-governmental organizations  such  as  the  Transparency  International Corruption Perceptions Index, or foundations such as The Global Slavery Index by the Walk Free Foundation to end forced labor.\n\nThe analysis resulted in a mapping of the risks related to the  Group's  activities.  It  includes  the  risks  related  to  the supply chain and respect for human rights described in the section on responsible purchasing (see section 3.1.2, p. 73).\n\nThe risk mapping covers the nature of the risks linked to activities  and  risks  linked  to  the  countries  in  which Saint -Gobain  operates.  The  main  risks  identified  concern four areas: respect for employee rights, health and safety at work, respect for the environment and anti-corruption.\n\nThe management of occupational health and safety risks is described  in  this  chapter,  section  3.1.3 , p.  78,  and  those concerning  respect  for  the  environment  in  this  chapter, section  3.1.3 , p. 81. Corruption  risk  management  is described in this chapter, section 3.1.5 , p. 87.\n\nIn November  2021,  the  due  diligence  process  was undertaken  to  update  the  Group's  assessment  of  human rights risks and  impacts  as  well  as  the  measures implemented  to  manage  these  risks,  limit  the  risks  of negative impacts, provide responses to impacted stakeholders  if  necessary,  and  improve  situations  that need  to  be  improved.  To  this  end,  a  questionnaire  was sent to human resources and operational managers in 35 countries  identified  as  the  most  exposed,  and  the responses  were  analyzed.  This  analysis allows the verification  that  the  Group's  practices  are  in  line  with human rights policy and that the risks are identified.\n\n## c.  Measures to control risks associated with employee rights\n\nRespect  for  people  and  respect  for  the  rights  of employees are essential to ensure a just and fair working environment  for  personal  and  professional  development (see this chapter, section 3.2.2, p. 91). 'Respect for people' and  'respect  for  the  rights  of  employees'  are  two principles  that  make  up  the  Saint -Gobain Code of Ethics, the  first  being  a  principle  of  behavior  and  the  second  a principle of action. In addition, thanks to its human rights policy,  Saint -Gobain  clearly  described  its  commitment  to the following principles: the fight against forced labor, the fight  against  child  labor,  freedom  of  association  and  the fight  against  discrimination.  Since  signing  the  United Nations  Global  Compact,  the  Group  has  published  a communication on progress in these areas. In addition, in 2022,  the  Group  supplemented  its  system  with  the publication of an anti-harassment policy.\n\nSaint -Gobain entities ensure that each employee performs their  work  on  the  basis  of  freely  agreed  terms  of employment  according  to  a  shared  and  accepted document and receives payment of a fair wage according to the hours worked. Freedom  of  association is guaranteed at all industrial sites and sales outlets. The age of the employee is checked by local employees as part of the fight against child labor. An annual analysis of the HR database is performed to verify that employees under the age of 18 are employed under specific contracts related to their education, such as apprenticeship contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Mutual respect and a policy of equal treatment in terms  of  recruitment,  access  to  promotions,  professional training and compensation are the main levers for action. Everywhere  it  operates,  Saint -Gobain  undertakes  to promote  inclusion  and  diversity  in  all  its  forms:  gender, nationalities,  training,  career  paths,  generational  diversity, disabilities and ethnic and social origins.\n\nThe  system  for  collecting  incidents  reported  by  the network  of  local  HR  has  been  improved  to  encourage employees  to  express  themselves  directly  to  their superiors or the human resources network. Entities declare any  incidents  of  discrimination  leading  to  a  complaint  or otherwise, in the course of judgment or finally judged and characterized  as  such.  Every  incident  is  examined  and dealt with in the subsidiaries concerned. Group employees also  have  access  to  a  whistle-blowing  system  allowing them  to  remain  anonymous,  described  in  this  chapter, section 3.2.1, p. 90. Particular attention is paid to ensuring confidentiality and protecting people from all reprisals.\n\nFollowing the analysis of the questionnaires completed by Saint -Gobain's local teams at the end of 2021 as part of the due  diligence  process,  preventive  actions  have  been launched  to  further  limit  the  risks  of  human  rights incidents. The best practices identified in certain countries concerning recruitment agencies, worker accommodation and security forces have been shared within the Group.\n\n## B - Participation in public debate\n\n## a.  Advocacy\n\nSaint -Gobain  participates  in  public  debates  on  the strategic challenges for its business activity and environment.  This  participation  takes  place  directly,  via professional associations, and via global, regional, or local alliances. The Group's advocacy activities aim to constructively  feed  into  discussions  and  bring  together value  chain  players  and  stakeholders.  Inspired  by  its corporate  purpose  'Making  the  World  a  Better  Home', Saint -Gobain  regularly  works  on  the  priority  themes  of decarbonizing the economy  and  circularity in the construction sector (see this chapter, sections 3.3, p. 100 and 3.4, p. 115).\n\nSaint -Gobain  and  most  of  its  subsidiaries  belong  to professional associations representing their industry at the national or supranational level. For example, in France, the Group is involved in professional associations representing companies,  such  as  Afep  or  Medef.  Saint -Gobain's subsidiaries also cooperate with various local associations or organizations involved in regulatory issues, or related to environmental,  social,  societal  or  economic  issues.  The subsidiaries  have  internal  procedures  in  place  to  ensure that  their  participation  in  associations  is  recognized  and referenced,  and  that  employees  who  represent  them  in associations are trained in the rules of antitrust law.\n\nSaint -Gobain  ensures  that  its  advocacy  initiatives  are aligned  with  its  commitment  to  contribute  to  carbon neutrality by 2050. Its actions and positions therefore take into account the ambition to limit the rise in temperatures to below 1.5 \u00b0C.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe  Group  ensures  proper  coordination  of  the  positions taken locally and ensures that these institutional commitments  are  well  known  and  respected  by  the countries.  Saint -Gobain  complies  with  the  transparency obligations applicable to relations between companies and public authorities in all countries where it operates.\n\nA list of the Group's main partnerships and involvements is available  on  the  website  (https://www.saint -Gobain.com/ en/corporate-responsibility/our-responsibility/ourcommitments-partnerships-and-recognitions).\n\nThe Group refrains from financing any political party.\n\n## b.  Multi-stakeholder partnerships\n\nAs  a  member  of  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact, Saint -Gobain regularly reports on its progress in the areas covered by the Compact, to which it adheres at the 'GC Advanced' level, i.e., according to 21 criteria. Saint -Gobain also  encourages  its  partners,  particularly  its  suppliers,  to commit to the Global Compact's ten principles.\n\nLikewise,  the  Group  pays  special  attention  to  the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), so as to make  progress  in  evaluating  the  real  impacts  that companies  can  have  in  working  towards  a  fairer,  more sustainable  world.  These  goals  also  make  possible  new multi-stakeholder  collaborations,  in  which  companies  are engaged locally and globally.\n\nFinally, the Group is a member of the forum of committed companies with the organization Transparency International  France.  Thus,  Saint -Gobain  supports  the association's activities and has committed to rejecting and combating  corruption,  in  all  its  forms.  The  Group undertakes to make its best efforts to implement a solid prevention  mechanism,  inspired  by  the  current  best practices of the business world.\n\n## C - The whistle-blowing system SpeakUp! by Saint -Gobain\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  an  ethical  and  professional  whistleblowing  system  that  is  accessible  to  employees  and  all other  stakeholders  (customers,  suppliers,  shareholders, trade unions, NGOs, local communities, etc.) to report any breaches  of  applicable  regulations  or  internal  rules  and procedures,  in  particular  those  related  to  the  code  of ethics.\n\nA highly secure platform has been in use since June 2020 to  collect  alerts  and  to  exchange  with  whistleblowers, including in an anonymous way. In 2022, a related module was  deployed  to  manage  the  follow-up  of  investigations from  the  time  of  reporting  to  the  implementation  of recommendations. It is accompanied by a practical guide that reminds the 'Alert Examiners' of the main principles of alert processing, describes the necessary  steps (admissibility,  investigation,  and  conclusions)  and  the precautions  to  take  to  conduct  investigations  in  a confidential, professional and impartial manner. Finally, this guide provides documentary support to inform and secure exchanges  with  the  parties,  whether  they  are  alleged victims, witnesses or respondents.\n\nThe  policy  on  the  Group  whistle-blowing  system  and  an explanatory  video  facilitating  the  understanding  and  the use of the platform by stakeholders are published on the Saint -Gobain website.\n\nIn 2022,  more  than  845  alerts  were  received  and processed throughout the Group.",

Beyond the sometimes painful personal situations, each report to\n\nthe organization is also an opportunity to progress. A new communication campaign 'SpeakUp! by Saint -Gobain' was conducted  in  December  2022  to  continue  to  encourage employees to speak out.\n\nAnnual data on the collection of alerts are published in Saint -Gobain's non-financial results (see chapter 4, section 4.2.2, p. 137).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.2.2 A HEALTHY AND ENGAGING WORK ENVIRONMENT\n\n## A - Deploying an engaged HR policy\n\nBuilding on  its history and  its rich social dialog, Saint -Gobain's Human Resources (HR) policy ensures the provision  of  an  environment  that  is  conducive  to  the employee's professional and personal growth and balances  job-related  performance  with  their  well-being. This policy requires a compulsory  buy-in  from  all employees  for  Saint -Gobain's  values  as  expressed  in  its code  of  ethics,  the  Principles  of  Conduct  and  Action. Saint -Gobain's  human  resources  policy  must  allow  for rapid  adaptation  of  the  organization  and,  in  particular, careful  management  of  changes  in  skills  requirements, support for employees in the face of major transformations,  as  well  as  attraction  and  retention  of talent.\n\nTo do this, it incorporates two dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 Global  coordination  tasked  with  defining  a  common framework  for  all  Group  employees,  incorporating ethical values, respect for human rights, the deployment  of  managerial  principles  based  on  trust, empowerment  and  collaboration,  and  the  offering  of training  programs  to  better  handle  major  cultural  and market transformations, the establishment of ambitious and  demanding  health  and  safety  objectives,  social protection,  diversity  or  any  other  subject  that  brings about decent working conditions for all;\n- \u00b7 Local  implementation,  by  the  HR  teams  in  charge  of social  dialog,  wage  policy,  local  adaptation  and  the implementation of action plans to achieve Saint -Gobain's objectives.\n\nThe  Human  Resources  Committee  meets  every  month under the chairmanship of the Executive Vice President in charge  of  Human  Resources  and  Corporate  Social Responsibility.  It  brings  together  the  Directors  of  the  HR support  functions,  in  particular  the  Director  of  Social Affairs  and  the  Director  of  Group  Talent  and  Executive Career  Management,  the  main  Directors  of  Human Resources  of  the  regions  and  the  Human  Resources Director  of  the  HPS  (High  Performance  Solutions)  entity. Regular  monitoring  of  local  and  global  action  plans  and analysis of key HR indicators are carried out.\n\nEach  country  implements  Saint -Gobain's  policies  and major  commitments  (health,  safety,  diversity,  etc.)  by adapting the action plans, stages of attainment and tools to  the  specific  features  and  culture  of  its  region  without compromising  on  the  expected  performance  level.  HR policies  are  disseminated  by  the  global  HR  network.  The local teams have guides to support their deployment, and special training sessions  are  organized  by  the  HR Academy.  Practical  guides  and  training  provided  by  the global support teams are available for the following topics in  particular:  social  dialog,  diversity,  compensation  and benefits, talent management, recruitment and integration, and mobility.\n\nIn  addition,  when  companies  are  acquired,  coordination takes  place  in  order  to  align  the  HR  policies  of  the  new entities  with  the  Group's  principles.  Newly  integrated entities are monitored centrally to ensure that the policies applied  correspond  to  those  disseminated  by  the  Group and applied within the network.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  operational  HR  performance  indicators (see  chapter  4,  section  4.2.2,  p.  137),  the  success  of  this policy  and  the  quality  of  social  dialogue  are  measured each year in a survey of all employees. The proportion of employees  responding  to  the  survey,  their  satisfaction with working conditions, and their confidence in both the strategy  and  its  implementation,  are  signs  of  a  strong commitment  that  reinforces  the  Group's  choice  of  a balance between local and global dimensions. For the past year,  the  number  of  employees  who  responded  to  the survey  was  126,746,  representing  nearly  84%  of  the Group's workforce.\n\nA new leadership style based on trust, accountability and collaboration  is  encouraged,  along  with  new  ways  of working together. To develop this mindset, managers are provided with training programs, tools to implement new collaborative  work  methods,  and  inspiring  examples  to evolve  with  their  teams  (see  section  3.2.3,  p.  95  in  this chapter).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

This is the eighth year in a row  that  the  Group  has  been  ranked  among  the  15 companies  recognized  worldwide.  Saint -Gobain  is  also recognized  as  a  Top  Employer  locally  in  40  countries, corresponding to more than 89% of employees.\n\n## B - Social dialog\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  made  the  quality  of  social  dialog  an essential criterion for the performance of its HR policy. The principle  of  consultation  and  negotiation,  either  directly with  employees  or  through  their  representatives,  is universal,  with  the  aim  of  translating  this  dialog  into collective  agreements.  Freedom  of  association  is  one  of the  values  embedded  in  the  Group's  code  of  ethics  and respect for it is a prerequisite for quality social dialog.\n\nBecause  social  dialog  must  provide  concrete  answers  to the questions of working conditions, the specific expectations  of  employees,  and  the  deployment  of  HR action  plans,  it  is  mainly  carried  out  at  local  level  in accordance  with  Saint -Gobain's  HR  policy  (see  this chapter,  section  3.2.2,  p.  91).  Executives  in  each  country meet  with  employee  representatives  periodically  to discuss  strategy  and  local  issues.  As  such,  more  than 3,000  agreements  signed  with  employee  representative bodies are active, of which 25.9% include criteria related to employee health and safety.\n\nThe various discussions held locally have made it possible -  in  some  subsidiaries  -  to  develop  work  flexibility,  in particular  to  meet  employees'  demands  for  a  better balance  between  their  personal  and  professional  life  and their family needs.\n\nEven  though  Saint -Gobain  encourages  social  dialog  at  a local  level,  Group  coordination  exists.  So  the  Chief Executive  Officer  of  Saint -Gobain  meets  with  the  central union  coordinators  several  times  a  year  and  chairs  the Works Council at least twice a year. At the European level, he  chairs  the  Convention  for  social  dialog,  which  brings together  70  union  representatives  from  28  European countries annually. With the aid of an independent expert, this  Convention  makes  it  possible  to  supplement  the national  dialog  by  dealing  with  subjects  of  common interest such as safety, Corporate Social Responsibility or the  trend  of  employment  on  European  industrial  sites. These subjects are raised in particular by the members of the  Select  Committee,  which  acts  as  spokesman  for  the\n\n\u00cb\n\nConvention, who benefit from specific training to perform their role and met by the Director of Social Affairs at least four times a year.\n\nListening to employees is essential to the success of social dialogue.  The  employee  satisfaction  survey  conducted  in 2022  (see  this  chapter,  section  3.2.3 , p.  97)  shows  that 86% of respondents consider their working conditions to be good and 82% that the balance between personal and professional life was satisfactory.\n\nIn an uncertain economic context, the Group is committed, as far as possible, to implementing solutions to safeguard employment and only to making job cuts as a last resort. The aim is initially to reorganize to deal with situations on a temporary basis, as in the case of temporary lay-off, or to  favor  internal  mobility  agreements  which,  associated with incentive measures, make it possible to maintain jobs within  Saint -Gobain.  When  restructuring  is  inevitable,  the employees  affected  by  workforce  adjustments  benefit from personalized support programs which may result in training associated with retraining, assistance for geographic  mobility  or  support  for  the  execution  of  a personal project, such as the creation of a business.\n\nWhen companies are acquired,  coordination  is  set  up  to align  the  HR  policy  of  the  new  entities  with  the  Group's principles.\n\n## C - Diversity and inclusion\n\nDiversifying its teams ensures that Saint -Gobain is in tune with the world around it and understand its challenges, to be  enriched  by  different  skills  and  experience,  while developing its capacity to innovate. To meet its diversity and  inclusion  targets,  the  Group  is  working  to  create  an environment conducive to fairness and equality, crucial to employees'  professional  growth,  while  fostering  training and the cohesion of high-performance operational teams. The main drivers of this strategy are managers leading by example and the policy of equal treatment in the fields of recruitment, vocational training and compensation. Everywhere  it  operates,  Saint -Gobain  undertakes  to promote  inclusion  and  diversity  in  all  its  forms:  gender, nationalities,  training,  career  paths,  generational  diversity, disabilities and ethnic and social origins.\n\nThe  Group  is  strongly  committed  to  the  themes  of diversity  and  inclusion,  which  are  one  of  its  priority  CSR challenges  (see  this  chapter,  section  3.2.1,  p.  89).  The requirements  to  be  followed  are  defined  at  the  global level,  while  action  plans  to  support  this  vision  are  rolled out  locally.  An  overall  diversity  indicator  incorporating diversity of gender, nationality and professional experience  is  monitored  annually.  It  is  a  performance component  of  Saint -Gobain's  long-term  compensation plans  for  managers  (see  chapter  5,  section  5.2.4,  p.  216). The Group is committed to maintaining a diversity index always  above  90%,  which  is  the  case  in  2022  with  a diversity index of 91.8%.",

They  are monitored each quarter by the Executive Committee. They have been developed by country and Business Units and are integrated into the performance criteria that determine the annual variable compensation of senior executives. At Group  level,  each  monthly  meeting  of  the  Human Resources Committee has a Section dedicated to women with the aim of boosting career opportunities.\n\nThese objectives  were  strengthened  in  2020  to  promote the  access  of  women  to  the  management  bodies  of Saint -Gobain:\n\n- \u00b7 30%  of  women  in  the  Group  Executive  Committee  in 2025;\n- \u00b7 an  average  of  30%  of  women  in  the  Executive Committees of Business Units in 2025.\n\nIn terms of training, an e-learning document on awareness of gender  diversity  issues,  entitled  Gender  Balance Awareness, has been drawn up in several languages and circulated  to  the  human  resources  and  management teams.  This  program  was  updated  at  the  end  of  2020 under a new e-learning format called Unconscious Bias.\n\nIn 2020, Saint -Gobain launched a program to use Big Data to  identify  differences  in  the  situation  between  women and  men  in  the  Group's  organizational  structure.  In addition  to  the  quantitative  indicators  available  in  nonfinancial  reporting,  the  aim  is  to  identify  underlying stereotypes  that  hinder  the  integration  of  women  into management  bodies  or  create  systematic  gaps  in  the situation.  In  accordance with the human resources policy (see  this  chapter,  section  3.2.2,  p.  91),  each  country  has implemented an action plan.\n\nFinally,  in  2020,  the  parenting  component  of  the  social protection program mentioned earlier, CARE by Saint -Gobain  (see  this  chapter,  section  3.2.3,  p.  94),  was rolled out in all countries where the Group operates, with a guarantee  of  at  least  14  weeks  of  maternity  leave  at  full pay.\n\nA systematic evaluation of the pay gap between women and men in equal positions is carried out. The ratios on the average pay gap of Group employees are measured and published  in  chapter  4,  section  4.2.2,  p.  137.  In  2022,  the proportion of women managers rose from 26.3% to 27.4%. The  Executive  Committee  consists  of  37.5%  women members  (six  women  out  of  16  in  2021,  compared  with four out of 16 in 2020 and four out of 17 in 2019). In 2022, Saint -Gobain  was  included  in  the  Bloomberg  Gender Equality Index for the fifth consecutive year, a recognized index in the area of diversity and inclusion.\n\nSaint -Gobain is a signatory to the Women's Empowerment Principles  (WEPs)  since  2021,  confirming  its  commitment to gender equality. Defined by the United Nations Global\n\nCompact, the WEPs are a set of principles that aim to help companies  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women's empowerment in the workplace.\n\nLikewise, insertion and retention of people with disabilities are  important  subjects  for  Saint -Gobain.  First  of  all, disability awareness and training initiatives are in place in the various countries. Several subsidiaries offer workshops in  partnership  with  specialized  bodies.  The  Group  also implements  recruitment  policies  in  partnership  with various specialist agencies, applying a strict nondiscrimination  policy.  For  example,  in  France,  several entities are in contact with ESATs (bodies promoting the inclusion  of  people  with  disabilities  in  society  and  the workplace)  to  support  them  in  their  efforts.  One  of Saint -Gobain's  objectives  is  to  make  everyday  life  easier for  employees  with  disabilities  by  adapting  workstations and  hours.  In  the  United  Kingdom,  Ireland  and  North America,  personal  support  is  in  place  to  adapt  working environments to individual needs.\n\nIn terms of diversity and inclusion, Saint -Gobain's approach  remains  similar  to  that  used  to  deploy  the Group's HR policy: common  values, policies and objectives,  deployed  by  each  country  according  to cultures and situations.\n\nThus, each region or country establishes a diagnosis which then  enables  it  to  set  priorities  and  local  plans.  Potential types  of  discrimination  are  identified,  and  appropriate programs are put into place. Gender, disability, and ethnic and  social  origins  are  taken  into  consideration  in  the diagnosis.\n\nTo encourage pluridisciplinarity and diversity of nationalities,  the  emphasis  is  on  the  valuing  of  diverse career paths in the areas of expertise (marketing, research and  development,  etc.)  and  on  equal  opportunities  for local profiles. In terms of generational diversity, Saint -Gobain  ensures  that  the  age  pyramid  of  its employees  is  balanced,  giving  young  people  as  well  as older employees their full place. Particular attention is paid to integration programs for young people.\n\nPrograms to educate teams about difference and training programs  to  avoid  unconscious  bias  when  recruiting  are also deployed.\n\nFor  example,  since  2019,  the  Latin  America  region  has developed a program called 'diversity and inclusion' that incorporates gender mix, ethnic origins (especially vulnerable populations), disability, and social and economic  inclusion.  A  communication  campaign  has accompanied  the  approach  on  the  theme  'with  respect, we understand each other'.\n\nIn North America, the focus is on raising awareness among HR  teams  and  writing  inclusive  job  descriptions  to promote  diversity  in  recruitment.  Partnerships,  networks and mentoring programs are deployed.\n\nIn  India,  mentoring  programs  for  the  inclusion  of  women and a women's network are active.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

In most of the countries in which Saint -Gobain operates,  minimum  wages  are  set  either  within  the  legal framework or by negotiating collective bargaining agreements.  In  2021,  under  3%  of  employees  were  not covered by one of these provisions. The Group favors the collective bargaining strategy which is a way  of guaranteeing  a  minimum  standard  of  living  for  all employees depending on the local situation.\n\nA general framework called the Framework for wages sets out common  rules  and  principles to ensure fair compensation  for  Saint -Gobain  employees.  It  has  been circulated within the HR network and is published on the Group's website.\n\nIn  2022,  Saint -Gobain  conducted  a  country  survey  to better identify the actions taken to ensure a decent wage, but  also  complementary  elements  to  compensation  such as  individual  and  collective  bonuses  or  social  benefits. Under  3%  of  employees  are  paid  only  the  legal  or negotiated  minimum  wage.  Almost  68%  of  full-time employees have an individual or group bonus program.\n\nThe  survey  also  verified  that  over  99%  of  employees receive retirement benefits under locally defined programs.\n\nAt the same time, employee shareholding offers employees  the  option  to  become  shareholders  under preferential conditions, either directly as individuals or via involvement  in  a  dedicated  collective  fund.  The  Group Savings Plan (PEG) enables them to acquire Saint -Gobain shares at a discount and, in some countries, an additional amount.  In  France,  to  encourage  a  team  spirit  and  to associate  each  person  with  the  success  of  the  Group, Saint -Gobain favors the conclusion of collective incentive agreements.  In  2022,  employee  shareholding  programs were  available  in  53  countries.  96.6%  of  Saint -Gobain employees  have  access  to  these  programs,  and  in  some countries,  retirees  are  also  eligible.  In  addition  to  these programs, Saint -Gobain has set up long-term compensation  plans  including,  depending  on  the  year, stock options, performance shares and performance units (see chapter 5, section 5.2.4, p. 209).\n\nSaint -Gobain  also  seeks  to  offer  its  employees  social guarantees  enabling  them  to  protect  themselves  against the  uncertainties  of  life.  Launched  on  January  1,  2020, CARE by Saint -Gobain is a social protection program for all  Group  employees  and  their  families.  The  coverage  is defined to meet basic daily healthcare needs but also to support key moments of family life:\n\n- \u00b7 Daily medical monitoring of families and access to care, by covering health costs (doctor visits or hospitalization) at a rate of at least 80%;\n- \u00b7 The birth of a child, including adoption procedures, by paying at least 14 weeks of maternity leave with full pay and three days of paternity leave with full pay;\n\n\u00cb\n\n- \u00b7 Fatality,  by  providing  the  family  with  financial  capital representing at least one year of the employee's salary.\n\nThe  program  is  being  implemented  on  a  country-bycountry  basis,  with  the  aim  of  being  applied  worldwide and for all employees by early 2023. Parenthood measures were  rolled  out  in  2020,  and  all  Saint -Gobain  employees currently  enjoy  minimum  guaranteed  parental  leave  at their full salaries. Monitoring of the program's deployment is available in chapter 4, section 4.2.2 , p. 137.\n\n## B - Well-being at work\n\nSaint -Gobain attaches fundamental importance to physical health (see this chapter, section 3.1.3, p. 78) but also to the mental health of its employees, as outlined in the Group's new health policy. The Mental WellBeing (MWB) program was  rolled  out  to  all  Group  managers  and  concerns  all employees. The program takes the form of an interactive app  and  was  designed  to  clarify  the  approach  to preventing  mental  health  issues  and  help  managers optimize the psychological well-being of their teams. Each manager can build a tailored program for his or her team, monitor it and exchange it with other managers or share relevant best practices drawn from their experience. There are  six  action  areas:  management  practices,  change management, interpersonal environment, physical working environment,  work/life  balance  and  personal  well-being skills.\n\nThis  interactive  tool  is  above  all  aimed  at  primary prevention practices and proposes best practices, collects those  identified  by  teams  worldwide  and  provides  key information so that each team can implement them. Thus, specific  programs  can  be  initiated  locally  by  linking specific  issues  and  proposals  for  concrete  actions  to improve well-being at work. This concept was designed on the  impetus  of  the  Medical  and  Workplace  Health Department and a multicultural working group, with a very diverse  range  of  profiles  (HR,  EHS,  communication,  site officers, etc.) and with the involvement of social partners.\n\nThis approach is linked to the 'human resources' pillar of the WCM  excellence program (see this chapter, section 3.1.3, p. 77). It is also embedded in the Saint -Gobain HR  process:  in  the  training  provided  by  the  school  of management, the individual annual reviews for managers' forms, or in the specific questions in the yearly survey to measure employee engagement.\n\nGenerally  speaking,  the  Group  wishes  to  create  a motivating and engaging work environment, respectful of the  work/life  balance  for  all  employees.  As  such,  flexible working and working from home are encouraged.\n\nThis platform is also a source of information on the general workplace  mental  health  approach  in  four  fundamental stages: training, awareness-raising, assessment, workplace best  practices,  support  for  people  in  hardship  and monitoring of indicators and action plans.",

        "page_content": "## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nA better living for all\n\nThis tool does not summarize all the measures put in place to protect and promote the mental health of the Group's employees.  It  is  an  inspiring  guide  to  fostering  the psychological well-being of employees. It is accompanied by  training  sessions,  webinars,  surveys  and  indicator monitoring, a whistle-blowing system, medical monitoring and individual care.\n\nThis individual care can be provided by on-site psychologists,  specialized  external  firms,  or  the  in-house medical teams.\n\n## C - Training\n\nTraining  provided  by  Saint -Gobain  must  guarantee  the employability  and  success  of  all  employees  throughout their working lives. The objective is to facilitate access to training through processes and offers that correspond to their needs and expectations.\n\nTraining is part of the Group's major transformations as it provides  support  for  employees  and  availability  for  the skills necessary for the success of operational teams.\n\nThe training policy is structured as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 To  support  cultural  transformation  and  leadership based  on  trust,  empowerment  and  collaboration,  in order  to  acquire  greater  operational  agility  and  to promote  new  ways  of  working,  offering  greater efficiency and  flexibility. This includes  managerial training and talent development;\n- \u00b7 Accelerate  the  digital  transformation  in  operations, business models and skills;\n- \u00b7 Foster  growth  and  focus  on  customers:  sales  and marketing  performance,  product  innovation,  services and business models;\n- \u00b7 Ensure efficiency and operational excellence: industrial performance,  purchasing  and  supply  chain,  EHS,  and R&D;\n- \u00b7 Deploy mandatory training (compliance, ethics, cybersecurity, etc.) and programs dedicated to Saint -Gobain's major professional sectors (finance, HR, purchasing, marketing, etc.).\n\nAfter  two  years  during  which  all  global  programs  were conducted  digitally  to  comply  with  health  regulations related  to  the  health  crisis  and  protect  employees,  some programs were switched to a hybrid  model,  i.e.,  partially face-to-face, particularly for the long-term talent development programs.\n\nThe  Unicampus  programs  continued  to  be  updated  and enhanced  to  accelerate  skills  development  in  relation  to the  pillars  of  the  'Grow  &  Impact'  strategic  program (see chapter 2, section 2.3.1, p. 57). Training programs on innovation,  Agile  methodologies,  Digital  Technology  and Data Analytics, and sustainability are now available as well as  programs  related  to  the  TEC  culture,  such  as  'Grow your Impact as a TEC  Leader'  and  'Become  a Saint -Gobain Culture Champion to Serve Strategy'.\n\nFor  example,  the  Group  has  launched  a  program  called 'Climate  Academy'  to  introduce  all  its  employees  to  the challenges of the climate emergency. Available on the elearning  platform,  short  modules  present  both  the  risks related  to  climate  change  and  the  actions  that  everyone can take to deal with this challenge.\n\nThe  annual  employee  satisfaction  survey  measures  the perceived adequacy of the training offered with the needs for improving skills, the ease of access to the training offer and the personal feeling of being properly trained.\n\nThe level of satisfaction measured in 2022 was strong and improved compared with 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 90% of employees confirm that they are satisfied with their  training  ('I  feel  adequately  trained  to  do  my work') (2021: 89%);\n- \u00b7 80%  of  employees  are  satisfied  with  the  training  and development  proposals  ('I  have  opportunities  for learning and development within my company') (2021: 78%);\n- \u00b7 88%  of  employees  believe  they  have  improved  their knowledge and skills ('I feel I have improved my skills and abilities') (2021: 86%).\n\n## a.  New leadership\n\nThe effort to revitalize the School of Management, which supports  managers  in  the  major  stages  of  their  career within the Group, was stepped up with the launch of the Talent  Lab,  a  new  identity  for  all  these  programs  that  is more  modern  and  better  reflects  the  focus  on  people development as a leader.\n\nThese programs are continually reviewed in order to best match  the  skills  required  to  support  and  maintain  the Group's  strategy.  They  have  been  redesigned  to  help participants build trust, empowerment and collaboration in their  teams  as  well  as  their  transformational  leadership skills,  essential  to  the  Group's  sustainable  growth.  These programs also favor the attraction and retention of talents.\n\nA  new  360-evaluation  tool  with  debriefing  and  coaching has  been  put  in  place  to  assess  managers  on  their  TEC behavior. This tool is available to all managers and used in the Talent Lab programs. In addition, the group's 150 top executives underwent this assessment in 2022.\n\nTo  supplement  these  programs  for  talents,  digital  tools and  training  programs  specific  to  this  new  managerial culture have been rolled out at Group and country level for all managers.\n\n## b.  Digital transformation\n\nIn  2020, the support programs for teams and employees were reviewed and reorganized according to Saint -Gobain's targets and transformation objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Supporting  people  to  better  understand  new  digital tools and improve efficiency;\n- \u00b7 The  development  of  tools  in  operations,  in  particular the integration of new tools;\n- \u00b7 Digital  culture,  including  the  Data  Analytics  Academy program  launched  to  develop  and  anchor  the  skills required for data processing and their use in operations,  logistics  and  commercial  activities.  New Data  Analytics  programs  have  been  launched  to  raise awareness among managers and for the Supply Chain function;\n- \u00b7 The  new  Business  Models  and  anticipation  of  new technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Growth and customer focus\n\nThe  Unicampus  program  was  launched  to  improve  the sharing  and  circulation  of  knowledge  and  know-how throughout the organization. This program uses the camps format to provide training mostly involving the sharing of practices,  with  a  minority  component  of  theoretical conceptualization.  This  format  promotes  collaboration, networking  and  interactive  learning  methods.  It  enables the  dissemination  of  a  shared  culture  of  operational excellence focused on customer needs and expectations. Thus,  training  sessions  are  mainly  focused  on  marketing, sales  and  service  offering  to  customers  (innovation  and offers, Sales and  Marketing  performance,  Customer Experience,  digital  marketing,  sustainable  construction, etc.) as well as innovation and research and development.\n\nThe  Unicampus  program  quickly  went  virtual.  More  than 136  sessions  during  the  e-camps  were  held  in  2022, involving more than 2,231 people.\n\n## d.  Operational excellence\n\nThe Unicampus program also offers many trainings about management  of  technical  skills  related  to  the  Group's business  lines  (Gypsum,  Insulation,  Mortars,  etc.)  and  to industrial  excellence  (WCM,  supply  chain\u2026).  The  'people development'  pillar  of  the  WCM  program  (see  this chapter, section 3.1.3 , p. 77) helps to identify and monitor key skills.\n\nTraining  programs  organized  by  technical  business  line ensure  the  management  and  updating  of  the  skills required to offer the customers high-performance, competitive  and  innovative  products  and  services.  These programs  are  generally  developed  and  implemented  by training teams organized by business line: glass, gypsum, insulation, mortars, pipe, etc. The Glass Technical Academy  thus  incorporated  all  glass  manufacturing training,  and  also  technical  glass  transformation  training for  construction  and  automobile  applications.  Designed and delivered by around 70 experts, the training sessions provide in-depth technical content, practical exercises and site  visits.  This  constitution  of  a  center  of  excellence around the businesses enables the transfer of knowledge, sharing  of  best  practices  and  the  alignment  of  methods within the business lines.\n\nSimilarly  to  manufacturing,  training  programs  are  set  up for  the  specific  distribution  business  lines  in  countries where the Group has sales outlets.\n\nIn addition, new programs related to product compliance and the supply chain were launched in 2021.\n\n## e.  Offering solutions tailored to individual expectations\n\nPrograms  are  designed  and  implemented  to  promote adaptation to individual preferences. Combining classroom training,  blended  training,  e-learning  modules  or  camps, they enable the dissemination of the Group's policies and processes and the sharing of best practices. Saint -Gobain University  also  offers  individual  development  programs such as coaching and mentoring.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## D - Employee development\n\nSaint -Gobain's  ambition  is  to  grow  the  skills  and  knowhow  of  its  employees  while  still  ensuring  excellence  in each  of  its  businesses,  but  also  to  be  an  employer  of reference, recognized for the richness of the career paths offered.  It  involves  taking  into  account  individual  wishes and the requirements of the organization, offering adapted developing paths, whether individual or collective, specific to  one  business  line  or  cross-functional.  Development  of TEC  culture  (Trust,  Empowerment,  Collaboration)  is  an important catalyst for the success of employee development.\n\n## a.  Listening to employees individually\n\nMore  individually,  Saint -Gobain  has  introduced  an  annual interview procedure which makes it possible to ensure the regularity and quality of dialog with employees. Individual interviews are held at least once a year for management and are gradually being expanded to all employees.\n\nMultiple initiatives (trainings, 'Evolve' platform, etc.) have been  developed  to  increase  feedback  practice  in  the managerial or project management framework.\n\nFinally,  the  Group  has  developed,  with  the  help  of partners,  a  360-degree  assessment  tool.  This  tool  is available  on  request  to  any  manager  and  mandatory before  participation  in  any  Talent  Lab  training  courses (Group  internal offering of leadership development training courses).\n\n## b.  Mobility\n\nEvery  Saint -Gobain  employee,  no  matter  what  their position  in  the  company,  should  benefit  from  career enrichment. Their career path must be a positive marker, so  they  can  feel  they  are  ambassadors  for  the  Group. Promoting and enriching employees' professional mobility, whether  geographic,  functional  or  between  Saint -Gobain activities, is a priority for accelerating the Group's growth:\n\n- \u00b7 It is an essential way of attracting diversity, innovating, developing  the  individual  and  collective  skills  needed for  the  organizational  and  technological  requirements of the Group's activities;\n- \u00b7 This  also  enables  the  sharing  of  market  and  customer knowledge,  the  comparison  of  different  experiences, the development  of  an  open  mindset  and  the enrichment of employees' careers;\n- \u00b7 Mobility should reconcile employees' professional development with the business's needs. Offering more career  development  opportunities  builds  employee loyalty and  intensifies synergies, generating  new solutions for customers.\n\nThe system deployed by Saint -Gobain to support mobility is  based  on  broad  communication  of  the  policy  and related  actions,  including  a  guide  to  support  HR  teams. Global  reporting  is  used  to  monitor  the  mobility  of managers through an HR Information System dedicated to them.\n\nAll employees are invited to consult the job offers that are made  and  to  apply  for  them.  The  new  online  platform 'Moov!' (replacing OpenJob) was developed and deployed in countries to meet this need. This platform is accessible on mobile devices for all employees.",

        "page_content": "## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nA better living for all\n\nIn various Saint -Gobain entities, mobility committees bring together  human  resources  managers  to  share  job  offers and exchange points of view about employees' development prospects. These mobility committees cover all employees  and  are  reinforced  for  managers.  The management  teams  also  encourage  employee  mobility and  include  applications  from  employees  from  other activities in their succession plans.\n\nIn  the  event  of  geographic  mobility,  the  Group  offers  all employees  support  for  themselves  and  their  families. Finally, within  the  scope  of  reorganization  projects, Saint -Gobain favors the conclusion of mobility agreements.\n\n## c.  'SG Talents' program\n\nThe 'Talent' element of the OPEN program is aimed at all employees to anticipate the Group's needs and support its strategy.  It  is  the  subject  of  a  specific  annual  progress update  meeting  with  the  members  of  the  Executive Committee.\n\nThe  'SG  Talents'  program  identifies  managers  with significant development potential or key skills. Defined at all  levels and in all Group business lines, it enables career plans  to  be  drawn  up,  encouraging  diversified  paths. Personal  reviews  and  succession  plans,  mentoring  and relations  with  the  Group's  target  schools  and  universities all feed  into  and  reinforce  this  measure.  A  specific program has also been designed to support and develop experts within the Group.\n\nAs part of the drive to digitize human resources processes, a  project  using  machine  learning  applied  to  the  'SG Talents'  program has been developed. In the first phase, the  use  of  Big  Data  made  it  possible  to  verify  that  the selection of talents was adapted to the defined criteria and that  the  paths  of  the  identified  talents  benefited  from additional  resources  (part  of  mobility,  training,  etc.).  The second  phase  is  more  focused  on  complementary elements  to  the  program:  the  search  for  talent  not identified  by  the  traditional  process,  improving  retention or a focus on soft skills research.\n\nCareer  paths  offered  to  its  employees  are  an  asset  that Saint -Gobain continues to advertise to students and young graduates to attract the most appropriate talent. In 2022, the  Group  rolled  out  its  new  employer  brand  promise, notably through its communication: 'Innovate for a more sustainable world. Think big, act locally. Bring out the best of  your  personality.  Develop  your  career  through  shared trust.'\n\nSpecific  programs  for  young  talent  coordinated  at  the local  level  are  being  developed  in  Germany,  Brazil,  the United States, India, China and the Nordic countries.\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  'Transform  &  Grow'  program required  a  large  review  of  management  positions  at central  and  local  level.  The  principles  applied  in  the 'Talents'  component  of  the  OPEN  program  identified managers  with  the  most  suitable  profiles  and  organized their  mobility in a way that has proven to be particularly active.\n\nAfter  the  year  2021  that  saw  the  consolidation  of  the country/cluster  organizations  (despite  the  constraints related to Covid-19 and its successive variants), the Group returned to the manager mobility level of previous years.\n\nThe  definition  of  'Grow  &  Impact',  the  Group's  new Strategic Plan (2021-2025), has identified as one of its six priorities,  'to  have  the  best  teams  in  a  diverse  and inclusive work environment'.\n\nThe definition  of  the  Group's  corporate  purpose,  like  the definition  of  its  'zero-carbon'  roadmap,  is  a  force  of attraction for young talents, who  are particularly demanding  with  regard  to  the  sustainable  dimension  of Saint -Gobain's  activities.  They  both  constitute  one  of  the foundations of the Group's employer promise.\n\n## E - Employee satisfaction\n\nIncreasing employees' involvement in a context of change, both  generational  and  technological,  is  an  essential challenge for the Group. To meet this challenge, the Group places managerial attitude and involvement at the heart of this approach: managers motivate and develop the loyalty of  employees  by  giving  more  meaning  to  their  everyday work and by favoring a spirit of initiative.\n\nSince  2019,  a  unique  tool  to  measure  employees' commitment has been developed. It makes it possible to conduct surveys targeted on particular populations and/or themes,  for  example,  specifically  listening  to  managers during  the  transformation  phases.  This  platform  is  also used  to  conduct  the  annual  global  survey  sent  to  all employees: me@Saint -Gobain. Employees  are  asked questions  covering  the  five  main  focus  areas  of  the  HR policy and the current transformation programs:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy: an energizing, collaborative working environment;\n- \u00b7 Active: an empowering organization;\n- \u00b7 Talent: an HR organization focused on talent development;\n- \u00b7 Management: a management style based on influence;\n- \u00b7 Inspiration: sharing clear objectives and a factual vision.\n\nWith  a  participation  rate  of  84%  in  2022,  126,746 employees  took  part.  In  particular,  86%  of  them  would recommend Saint -Gobain as a good place to work.\n\nThe level of commitment measured is even higher despite the particular environment of 2021 and the pandemic.\n\nThe  engagement  rate  reached  a  score  of  84%,  an improvement  of  one  point  compared  with  the  survey conducted in 2021. This index groups the results into four themes:\n\n- \u00b7 Pride in working for Saint -Gobain;\n- \u00b7 Short-term retention capacity;\n- \u00b7 Recommendation;\n- \u00b7 The  feeling  of  being  appreciated  and  valued  for  their work.\n\nIn  accordance with the HR organization, each country or Business  Unit  is  able  to  obtain  results  for  its  own  scope and is  responsible  for  circulating  the  results  and  starting dialog with employees to define action plans to work on areas requiring improvement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

To develop these actions, Saint -Gobain relies  on  local  partnerships,  in  particular  with  non-profit organizations and charities.\n\nSaint -Gobain invested \u20ac13.4 million in 2022 for philanthropy and sponsorship actions. This involves either direct  financial  support  or  donations  of  materials.  Each entity and each country makes its own choices to support projects according to local issues. This takes the form of financial  donations,  donations  of  materials,  skill-based sponsorship, or volunteer work. All of these actions with a strong local social impact are not systematically reported by the Group at the global level. Only a portion of financial donations  and  donations  of  materials  is  reported.  The number of beneficiaries is also only partially assessed. The financial  impact  does  not  include  skill-based  sponsorship or employees' participation in voluntary work during their working hours.\n\nIn  2022,  Saint -Gobain  launched  a  program  called  Build Change to federate commitment around two priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Supporting  the  youth  training  in  the  construction sector;\n- \u00b7 Promoting access to decent and sustainable housing.\n\nThis  program  encourages  young  people,  especially  the most  disadvantaged,  to  join  the  construction  industry, which in many countries is facing labor shortages.\n\nSimilarly, there is a chronic lack of decent housing for the most  disadvantaged  populations.  Improving  access  to insulated housing also allows these vulnerable populations to reduce their energy bills and improve comfort.\n\nWhile  the  Build  Change  program  guides  part  of  the actions, each country undertakes supplementary programs  to  support  vulnerable  populations  in  local communities.\n\n## A - A network of actors contributing to inclusive actions\n\nAt a central level, the Saint -Gobain International Corporate Foundation is based on employee commitment. All Group employees - both current and retired - can sponsor acts of solidarity in two areas:\n\n- \u00b7 The  professional integration of young  adults  in difficulty;\n- \u00b7 The  construction,  improvement  or  renovation,  in  the general interest, of living spaces  for  people  in precarious  situations,  contributing  in  particular  to reducing  energy  consumption  and  preserving  the environment.\n\n\u00cb\n\nProjects must be carried out by a non-profit organization and be located near a Saint -Gobain site.  The  Foundation provides direct financial support to the projects selected, thanks to an annual allocation of \u20ac2 million invested in the projects.  In  addition,  employee  and  retired  employee sponsorships help charities access additional partnerships such  as  donations  of  materials,  access  to  technical expertise  in  energy  efficiency  and  other  areas,  and volunteer work.\n\nSince its creation in 2008, the Foundation has supported 351 projects, including 31 in 2022.\n\nEach  country  organizes  its  activities in the most appropriate  way  according  to  the  local  situation.  Some, such  as  the  United  States  or  India  created  local foundations to develop programs to engage employees in philanthropic actions or actions to help vulnerable populations.\n\nOther countries rely on dedicated local teams committed to bringing programs and initiatives to life.\n\n## B - Training for the construction sector to accelerate the transition to sustainable construction\n\n## a. Train our clients' employees\n\nTraining programs for our clients' employees are developed in most countries where Saint-Gobain operates. In  France,  a  complete  training  catalog,  via  e-learning  or face-to-face,  is  available  for  all  clients  of  the  Group.  The Isover,  Placo\u00ae  and  Weber's  teams  offer  programs  led  by experts trained in teaching methods. Some of the courses are certifiable.\n\nIn  Brasil,  a  complete  offer  regrouping  17  programs  is deployed  under  the  form  of  285  sessions  per  year  and trained more than 6,000 professionals in 2022.\n\n## b. Train a qualified workforce\n\nIn North America, the Group has developed a partnership with the NGO YouthBuildUSA to meet a twofold ambition: to  provide training in the sustainable housing industry to young people struggling with the school system, all while enabling them to obtain a high school diploma. Since 2011, the Group has been helping to integrate young people into the construction industry and raise their awareness of the sector.\n\nLikewise, Saint -Gobain UK and Ireland supports Barnardo's YouthBuild  Academy,  which  aims  to  train  unemployed young  people  in  building  trades  at  a  time  when  the construction industry is facing labor shortages.",

This training program,  launched  in  2003  and  financially supported since 2016 by YouthBuild International, aims to share the know-how of Group employees with unemployed  youth  from  disadvantaged  communities, through  a  combination  of  theoretical  courses  and  the achievement of a local renovation project. The 'Saint -Gobain  YouthBuild  Academy'  is  the  only  CETA (Construction  Education  Training  Authority)  accredited training  provider  with  accreditation  to  facilitate  the National Certificate: Ceiling & Partition Installation NQF 3. The Group sustainably supports youth employment while contributing to the dynamism of its business sector. Since its  creation,  about  1,000 people have benefited from this program.\n\nIn November 2021, Saint -Gobain in Morocco developed its own academy with the same objective of training young people  in  the  building  trades  and  in  particular  in  the evolution of techniques related to sustainable construction.  Qualifying  training  courses  are  provided  in three training centers.\n\nIn  France  in  2022,  Saint -Gobain  developed  a  network  of schools  to  train  qualified  workers  for  jobs  in  the construction sector that are in short supply. The specialized banners have formed  partnerships with apprentice training centers (CFA) to develop professional training courses, such as the roofing school for roofers set up  by  Asturienne,  the  Builder's  school  set  up  by  Point.P and  the  thermal  engineering  school  set  up  by  Cedeo. Training programs are deployed region by region.\n\nSeveral  professional  training  programs  are  on  offer  in India. For example, the Gyproc Academy has trained more than 1,150 young people since its creation in 2013, with a placement rate of over 90%.\n\n## C - Actions in favor of education\n\nIn  addition  to  programs  supported  by  the  Saint -Gobain Foundation, many countries have set up partnerships for youth training.\n\nIn  France,  Saint -Gobain  inaugurated  an  apprenticeship training center (CFA)  in 2020, called 'Generation Saint -Gobain'. This center offers training courses focused on jobs in short supply, industrial maintenance, and sales and  marketing.  In  2022,  a  supply-chain  management certifying training course was successfully carried out.\n\nIn India, the Saint -Gobain India Foundation supports more than  9,500  young  girls  in  targeted  education  programs. Saint -Gobain has also developed programs to accompany young people from rural areas.\n\n## D - Actions in favor of decent and sustainable housing\n\nIn  2023,  nearly  35  projects  in  favor  of  access  to  decent and  sustainable  housing  in  over  15  countries  were conducted.  These  actions  are  often  carried  out  in collaboration  with  non-profit  organizations  operating  in the same regions.\n\nPartnerships  with  Habitat  for  Humanity  have  been established  in  many  countries  in  Latin  America,  such  as Argentina and Brazil, and in Europe, such as Poland.\n\n## E - Other actions in favor of communities\n\nIn emergency  situations,  Saint -Gobain's local teams mobilize to support the populations affected. In 2022, for example,  Saint -Gobain  teams  in  Poland  took  action  to welcome  Ukrainian  refugees.  Families  were  taken  in  and are still being supported. A foundation has been set up to provide  financial  assistance  to  the  refugees  and  to  help them with the administrative process. Finally, psychological support is available to employees in Poland to help them cope with this situation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

In concrete terms, the objective is to help the Group's customers reduce their carbon emissions through the use of its solutions, and to reduce the carbon impact of its operations across the entire value chain.\n\n## A - Governance\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe role of the Board of Directors is to determine Saint-Gobain's strategy and to follow up on its implementation, as well as to monitor its proper management.\n\nAll Directors were trained in climate risks by experts (see chapter 5, section 1.2.4). Climate change issues are monitored on a regular basis by the Board of Directors.\n\n## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe CSR Committee ensures that corporate social responsibility issues are taken into account in the definition of Saint-Gobain's strategy and its implementation (see chapter 5, section 5.1.2 for a description of the responsibilities and activities of the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee in 2022).\n\nFinally, as the Group considers climate change to be a strategic issue, the reduction of CO2 emissions is a performance criterion included in long-term compensation plans (see chapter 5, section 5.2.4).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \"CARBON 2030\" ROADMAP\n\nThe \" Carbon Roadmap 2030 \" working group is a response to Saint-Gobain's commitment to contribute to \"net zero emissions\", by 2050. As a result, Saint-Gobain will reduce its CO2 emissions as much as possible by 2050 and implement measures to absorb any residual emissions.\n\nThe success of the \"net zero emissions\" ambition is based on the 2030 targets validated by the Science Based Target initiative and on several action levers. This working group is led by the Sustainable Development Department.\n\n## At Group level:\n\n- \u00b7 the Strategy Department supports Saint-Gobain's ambition to be a leader in sustainability by integrating sustainable development as a key focus of the Group's growth and di/fferentiation strategy.

Two-thirds  of  the  sector's  carbon impact  comes  from  the  operation  of  buildings,  while  the remaining one-third comes from the emissions contained in  building  products.  The  transition  of  the  construction sector  towards  carbon  neutrality  is  therefore  essential  in the  fight  against  climate  change  (see  in  chapter  2, section 3.1.3, p. 43).\n\nSaint -Gobain can help reduce the negative impact of the construction sector. The Group is focusing its action plans around the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Offering solutions that provide benefits during the use of buildings (see in this chapter, section 3.1.4, p. 84): the design, production and distribution of highperformance  solutions  with  a  positive  contribution  to the  environment,  i.e.,  solutions  that  promote  energy efficiency  and  reduce  CO2  emissions  during  the  use phase  of  buildings.  It  is  through  innovation  and  the evaluation of the performance of solutions (see section 3.3.2, p. 112 in this chapter) that the Group is able to increase CO2 emissions avoidance and adapt its  offer  to  new  opportunities,  linked  to  a  fairer,  more sustainable  transition  on  a  trajectory  compatible  with the Paris Agreement;\n- \u00b7 The offer of low-carbon solutions by reducing emissions  in  its  operations  (scopes  1  and  2)  and emissions  linked  to  its  value  chain  (scope  3):  the\n\n\u00cb\n\n'carbon 2030' roadmap represents the Group's action plan  to  achieve  the  CO2  emission  reduction  targets validated  by  the  SBTi  on  the  road  to  global  carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nSaint -Gobain's  objective  is  to  contribute  to  a  FAIR  and sustainable transition towards a low-carbon economy. The implementation and results of this strategy are integrated into  scenarios  that  limit  global  warming  to  below  a  1.5\u00b0C rise, so that they are aligned with the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn  the  face  of  climate  risks,  taking  action  as  closely  as possible to the regions (countries, regions, etc.) makes it possible to rely on resilient local ecosystems that are more favorable to the development of a 'low-carbon' economy. The ability to initiate local partnerships is an asset in risk management.\n\nIn addition,  Saint -Gobain's  organizational  structure  is based on a unique combination of local and global, which makes it possible to benefit from new opportunities that meet  local  needs  while  being  part  of  global  dynamics, especially in terms of energy-efficient building renovation and the development of lightweight construction (see chapter 2, section 2.2, p. 56).\n\nThe fight against climate change requires the cooperation of  all  stakeholders  -  in  particular  states,  businesses  and civil society -around a demanding international framework.",

Analysis of climate scenarios for 2050\n\nFor  strategic  planning  purposes,  Saint -Gobain  has  built  three  qualitative  climate  scenarios  that  incorporate  political, technological, economic and societal assumptions. Each scenario is associated with an increase in average temperature of between 1.5\u00b0C and 4.5\u00b0C before the end of the century. These scenarios help Business Units and the countries in which the Group operates to anticipate the impacts of climate change on their markets and their activities.\n\n| Indicators

The  individual  apartments  are  small,  but  benefit  from  large  shared  spaces  (workspaces,  fitness,  high-tech  kitchens).  A centralized monitoring system automatically adapts heat, lighting, ventilation and cooling. Shared appliances in kitchens and laundry rooms are very efficient and use little energy. The roof is equipped with photovoltaic panels and the insulation has been reinforced with recycled materials.\n- \u00b7 In the United States, the majority of the population lives in apartment buildings and private condominiums in the suburbs of a large  city,  in  buildings  dating  from  the  1970s.  Only  a  minority  of  individual  apartments  have  been  renovated.  Energy consumption is not systematically monitored. However, installations have been put in place to mitigate the effects of climate change on the comfort of residents: the insulation of the walls and roof has been improved and double-glazed windows have been installed. Most devices are programmable, but none are shared.\n\n## Highway to Climate Hell scenario\n\n## SUSTAINABLE CITY\n\n| Model of existing city   | London, Rio de Janeiro, some US cities, Lagos, Lima, New Cairo                                                                                                                            |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Size                     | These  immense  cities  occupy  a  vast  territory  and  are  home  to  3  to  5  million  inhabitants.  In less developed countries, these growing cities are surrounded by large slums. |\n| Mobility                 | The majority of the population lives in the suburbs, and driving is the most used mode of  transportation thanks to the extent of the road network.                                       |\n\n## METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION\n\nSubsidized, affordable but low-quality housing is built to contain the endless expansion of slums in emerging countries. Poor quality is often accompanied by raised living spaces, a lack of daylight, thermal discomfort, high levels of noise pollution and inadequate ventilation of fresh air. Basic insulation solutions are still incompatible with the affordability required for such 'slum sanitation' approaches. Implementation of cooling processes as the only response to global warming. Access to basic services (wastewater,  drinking  water,  electricity,  sanitation,  waste  disposal)  is  an  important  step  towards  achieving  the  fundamental objectives of human development. Recycling, reuse and the circular economy can only be considered when these basic services have been fully realized.\n\n## b.  The 2050 vision\n\n## The '2050 net-zero emissions' contribution program\n\nIn addition to the programs initiated at site level, reducing the carbon footprint of production and thus the impact of the products requires three major strategies:\n\n- \u00b7 Innovation  and  R&D  programs  to  coordinate  and expand  efforts  to  improve  manufacturing  processes, reduce  energy  consumption  and  ensure  the  transition towards the use of decarbonized energies;\n- \u00b7 Scope 3 control to identify the main emissions factors and mitigate the overall impact of the products;\n- \u00b7 Management tools and financial resources to accelerate the transition to low-carbon technologies and a budget of 100 million euros per year by 2030.\n\nIn 2020, and in accordance with the Group's commitment to  contribute  to  carbon  neutrality  by  2050,  Saint -Gobain published a roadmap with an action plan and intermediate targets for the end of 2030 (see section 4.2.1, p. 134).\n\n\u00cb\n\n## An internal carbon price to speed up the transition to low-carbon technologies\n\nSetting  an  internal  carbon  price  enables  the  current  or potential impact  of  a  regulatory  carbon  price  on Saint -Gobain's activities to be assessed, opportunities for growth in low-carbon sectors to be identified, investments in manufacturing and R&D to be refocused, and actions to reduce  CO2  emissions  to  be  ranked.  The  Group  set  two levels  of  internal  carbon  prices  in  2016.  The  first  internal carbon  price  level  per  metric  ton  is  applied  to  industrial investments  above  a  certain  threshold,  investments associated  with  a  change  in  energy  source,  energy investments on an existing or greenfield site with a total annual energy consumption of over 10 GWh. The second carbon  price  level  is  used  for  R&D  investment  in breakthrough technology. This price level is of demonstrable  value in supporting low-carbon R&D projects.\n\nFollowing  the  November  2020  publication  of  the  2030 roadmap,  an  update  of  the  price  levels  was  made  in October 2021. The price level applicable to investments is \u20ac75 per metric ton of CO2 and the level applicable to R&D projects  is  \u20ac150  per  metric  ton.  In  addition,  a  specific approach  applicable  to  significant  acquisitions  has  been defined. It includes any effort required to ensure that the carbon  impact  of  this  acquisition  is  compatible  with Saint -Gobain's direct and indirect emissions target trajectory.",

        "page_content": "## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nA decarbonated home\n\nUnder the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS),  the  rules  defining  the  free  allocation  of  carbon allowances from 2021 have been redefined.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Saint -Gobain Group had a stock of 4.4 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emission allowances allocated  by  the  European  Community.  The  Group therefore  considers  that  it  will  remain  self-sufficient  in allowances in the medium term.\n\n## Innovate to optimize industrial processes and promote the use of decarbonized energies\n\nIn  the  short  term,  the  actions  performed  involve  the reduction of energy consumption and, in the medium and long  term,  the  transition  to  the  use  of  decarbonized energy,  in  particular  the  transition  to  the  use  of  green electricity. The WCM  program  (see  this chapter, section  3.1.3,  p.  77)  and  the  'energy'  and  'CO2'  action plans for continuing improvement (see section 3.3.3, p. 113) provide structure for the action plans.\n\nShort- and medium-term actions also include investments in optimization and energy efficiency processes. Pragmatically, Saint -Gobain identifies and analyzes projects  for  which  rapid  gains  can  be  measured.  The analysis also takes into account the impact on competitiveness  and  applies  the  rules  related  to  the introduction of the internal carbon price. For example, the Group  promotes  the  installation  of  energy  and  heat recovery systems. These low-carbon solutions can address each of the impacts of industrial production: raw materials, energy  use,  energy  efficiency  and  energy  recovery,  and carbon capture and recovery.\n\nRegarding energy, processes that are technically adaptable  to  the  exclusive  use  of  electrical  energy  have been  identified.  For  these  processes,  the  transition  is facilitated by  the  development  of  local  renewable electricity  grids  and  the  growing  share  of  decarbonized electricity in national grids. Energy buyers have therefore been  involved  in  identifying  reliable  and  competitive sources  of  green  electricity  in  the  countries  in  which Saint -Gobain  operates.  This  transition  to  the  use  of decarbonized energies takes the form of investments such as in solar and wind farms, through the installation of solar panels on our sites or the use of market mechanisms such as  green  certificates  or  Power  Purchase  Agreements (PPAs).  In  the  case  of  India,  all  these  commitments together generated a total of about 60 GWh of renewable electricity in 2022. At Group  level, the share of decarbonized  electricity (1) in electricity  consumption reached 52% in 2022.\n\nFor  processes  for  which  the  adaptation  to  the  use  of electrical energy is technically more complex, two axes of innovation are then deployed: one on the development of decarbonized  energies  (biogas,  biomethane  or  hydrogen for  example);  and  the  other,  to  develop  processes  and make  them  compatible  with  an  increasing  use  of  green electricity.\n\nOverall, innovation is a lever used by the Group to reduce the impact of its activities (see in this chapter, section 3.1.4, p. 84).\n\nSaint -Gobain also wants to develop zero-emission productions for scope 1 and 2 as quickly as possible. For example, in May 2021 the Group announced an investment of  \u20ac25  million  in  its  plasterboard  plant  at  Fredrikstad, Norway,  to  increase  its  production  capacity  by  around 40%  and  transform  its  plant  into  the  first  zero-carbon emissions  production  site  in  scope  1  and  2  in  the  world. Saint -Gobain  receives  a  grant  from  the  Norwegian government  agency  Enova;  the  new  facilities  will  be operational in 2023. In June 2022, Saint -Gobain announced that it  is  investing  in  a  second  zero  emission scope  1  and  2  production  plant  near  Montreal,  Canada. After an investment of approximately CAD 90 million, this site will be operational in 2024.\n\nAt the same time, the Group has continued its efforts to develop 'net-zero carbon' industrial process pilots (scope 1  and  2).  For  example,  Saint -Gobain has become the first manufacturer to produce flat glass in a low-carbon way in Aniche (France). This technical feat was achieved by using 100%  recycled  glass  and  100%  energy  produced  from biogas and decarbonized electricity.\n\nTo  support  this  effort  towards  industrial  processes contributing to carbon neutrality, a budget of \u20ac100 million per year has been allocated to CAPEX and research and development investments for the next ten years. In 2022, Saint -Gobain has invested over \u20ac191 million to support its 2030 roadmap.\n\n## c.  Collaboration with stakeholders\n\n## Strong commitments to the climate\n\nSaint -Gobain  supports  the  implementation  of  ambitious political  frameworks  to  remove  technical  and  financial obstacles  and  accelerate  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon economy.  The  recovery  plans  initiated  by  governments following  the  Covid-19  crisis  are  an  opportunity  to combine the fight against climate change with economic development actions through such ways as initiatives that promote  building  renovation  and  energy  efficiency. Indeed, decarbonization of buildings is essential to achieve the  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  targets  that governments have set for themselves.\n\nEuropean  regulatory  projects  related  to  sustainable finance and in particular taxonomy of sustainable activities are  essential  instruments  for  achieving  the  European Union's climate objectives, provided that they are guided by  scientific  criteria  and  developed  in  a  transparent manner.  The  Group  supports  the  work  of  the  European Commission  and  the  'sustainable  finance'  platform  to ensure that the ambition developed in the taxonomy and the  underlying  criteria  better  reflect  the  potential  and specificities of the business sectors concerned.\n\nSaint -Gobain is fully committed as a non-state actor to the implementation  of  the  Paris  Agreement  and  participates with its  partners  in  the  subsequent  COP (Conferences of the Parties).\n\nIn  line  with  the  commitment  taken  to  contributing  to carbon  neutrality,  Saint -Gobain  has  been  involved  in  the 'Race to Zero' initiative since its creation, and in the 'We Mean Business' coalition, which now brings together more than 5,000 companies and 1,000 cities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

This  price  must  allow  for  a  transition  that keeps  the  level  playing  field  between  the  various companies  and  countries,  in  particular  through  the establishment  of  a  mechanism  at  the  borders  of  Europe. Saint -Gobain  has  contributed  to  several  projects  on  the subject  at  the  European  level  within  the  ERT  (European Round  Table  for  Industry)  and  within  the  AFEP  and  the Fabrique de l'Industrie in France. Saint -Gobain also joined the  steering  committee  of  the  World  Bank's  Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition.\n\nThe  European  Union  has  a  leadership  role  on  climate issues  at  the  global  level,  which  is  reflected  in  the establishment  of  an  ambitious  regulatory  framework. Saint -Gobain supports the implementation of the 'Fit for 55' package, which will lead to an increase in ambition by 2030.  As  part  of  the  Global  Climate  Action  Agenda, Saint -Gobain is a member of the Alliance of companies for water  and  climate  change.  This  initiative  supports  the actions of cities and watersheds involved in the sustainable management of water resources and adaptation to the consequences of climate change.\n\n## Actions that support a strong and low-carbon economic growth\n\nSaint -Gobain  belongs  to  the  ETC  (Energy  Transition Commission),  a  group  of  about  fifty  leaders  from  the energy and climate community. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar is  one  of  the  commissioners.  The  aim  of  the  ETC  is  to accelerate the shift towards a low-carbon energy system that enables robust economic growth while limiting global warming  to  1.5\u00b0C.  Because  construction  is  its  primary market, the Group is particularly involved in the promotion of sustainable construction and is involved in initiatives to promote energy efficiency.\n\nAll over the world, an ambitious political framework makes it possible  to  remove  technical  as  well  as  financial obstacles to the transformation of cities and buildings to make them sustainable. For example, this is the case at the European  level:  Saint -Gobain  is  a  member  of  various initiatives  and  coalitions,  and  in  particular  has  been  a member  of  the  LEVEL(S)  steering  committee  since  its inception.  The  committee  is  an  instrument  developed  by the European Commission in conjunction with the industry and  the  public  sector  and  aims  to  establish  a  'common language' for sustainable construction, in order to take it beyond energy efficiency. In December 2017, the European Commission launched the pilot phase of LEVEL(S), which continued in 2021.\n\nTransforming  markets  also  means  changing  the  entire construction  market  value  chain.  The  Group  forges partnerships with many players who share the same desire to promote more sustainable buildings. In this respect, the Green Building Councils (GBC), a unique global network of national  associations  of  professionals  and  players  in  the construction  market,  are  an  essential  partner.  The  GBC network  offers  a  fast  path  for  the  deployment  of sustainable  construction  technologies  and  dissemination of  best  practices,  particularly  via  education  for  market players. It can create a collective momentum involving the various  stakeholders  (investors,  builders,  manufacturers, architects, etc.).\n\n\u00cb\n\nGBCs have a geographical organization  that  allows  each Saint -Gobain entity, at the local, national, and international levels, to actively contribute to their work. The Group is a member  of  40  local  GBCs  worldwide,  a  partner  of  the European network of GBCs (ERN), and serves as the vicechair of the Corporate Advisory Board of the World Green Building Council (WGBC).\n\nSaint -Gobain  is  committed  to  orienting  the  construction industry  towards  a  low-carbon  trajectory.  This  is  why Saint -Gobain is a founding member of the Global Alliance for  Buildings  and  Construction  (GABC).  Saint -Gobain  is also a member of the projects steering committee of the World  Business  Council  for  Sustainable  Development (WBCSD)  for  cities  and  buildings.  Saint -Gobain  is  also involved  in  various  initiatives  to  help  cities  lead  this transition, for example by being a member of the steering committee  of  the  'Zero  Carbon  Building  Accelerator'  of the World Resources Institute.\n\n## Train customers locally, inform the end user\n\nSome of the training courses delivered by local teams (see in this chapter, section 3.2.3, p. 95) cover energy efficiency and  reduction  of  environmental  impact  of  buildings.  The entity  'Building  Distribution'  is  particularly  active  in  that area and plays a key role in supporting craftsmen, thereby facilitating the marketing and use of sustainable products. These services set up by distribution help accelerate the transition  to  a  more  sustainable  construction  and  reduce the carbon impact of buildings.\n\nIn  France,  the  Point.P  network  has  implemented  'Energy Efficiency' counters in over 130 branches. Salespeople are specifically  trained,  and  tools  such  as  a  simulator  to evaluate  a  project's  energy  efficiency  are  made  available to customers. A training program on ways to save energy in the construction industry is offered (FeeBat), along with a  support  mechanism  for  official  recognition  of  the effectiveness of the steps taken called Renoprim +.\n\nBeyond  Building  Distribution,  training  structures  are offered by country. They are open to craftsmen, installers, architects  and  other  actors  of  the  building  sector.  They can  also  be  associated  with  professional  schools.  In France,  the  sales  and  marketing  teams  are  involved  with eight apprenticeship training centers (CFAs) for partnerships  for  training  services  or  support  for  trainers specific  to  the  establishment.  A  website  dedicated  to training (seformeravecSaint -Gobain.com) offers e-learning or  in-person  training  opportunities.  Guides  called  ' Les essentiels  de  l'habitat '  allow  craftsmen  and  professionals to train and learn about topics such as energy efficiency or the  evolution  of  tomorrow's  norms  and  standards  for sustainable construction.\n\nIn  Morocco,  the  Group  has  developed  a  Saint -Gobain academy including three training centers with the aim of training  more  than  3,000  professionals  in  sustainable construction.",

The Climate Academy was conceived in two stages. The first one to understand, the impacts and challenges in the format of modules of no more than five minutes.  As  for  the  second  stage,  the  Climate  Academy\n\n## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nA decarbonated home\n\npresents  eight  themes  describing  the  various  means  of acting  to  protect  the  environment  and  to  contribute  to carbon neutrality in 2050.\n\n## An internal carbon fund for employees\n\nTo  engage  all  its  employees  on  the  road  to  the contribution  to  carbon  neutrality  by  2050,  and  to contribute  to  achieving  the  objective  of  reducing  the Group's  CO2  emissions  between  now  and  2030,  in  April 2021,  Saint -Gobain  launched  an  internal  'Carbon  Fund'. First  implemented  in  a  pilot  region,  Northern  Europe,  it aims  to  accelerate  the  reduction  of  non-industrial  CO2 emissions  through  the  daily  actions  of  employees  and targeted investments in sites. The areas covered by these investments are mainly related to the sustainable mobility of employees, renewable energies and the improvement of comfort and energy efficiency at Saint -Gobain sites. These projects  proposed  and  selected  by  employees  concern their working environment.\n\n## 3.3.2 RISKS, OPPORTUNITIES AND SOLUTIONS\n\nThe challenges related  to  climate  change  represent  both risks  and  opportunities  for  Saint -Gobain.  The  system  for identifying, assessing and managing global and local risks is  detailed  in  Saint -Gobain's response to the CDP climate questionnaire. In this area, the Group follows the principles of due diligence. This process allows us to identify, prevent and  mitigate  actual  and  potential  negative  impacts associated with its business and supply chain, as well as to report on how these impacts are addressed. None of the risks  related  to  climate  change  is  of  material  financial materiality for the Group in 2022.\n\n## A - Risks and opportunities across the value chain\n\nThe identification and assessment of risks and opportunities related to climate change is an integral part of  Saint -Gobain's global risk management and innovation processes. As such, the Group has identified ten risks and five  strategic  opportunities  related  to  climate  change. Each  risk  and  opportunity  affects  each  segment  of  the Saint -Gobain's value chain differently, from the extraction of raw materials to their end of life. The tables below show how the opportunities and risks identified by Saint -Gobain impact each stage of the value chain while being part of global market dynamics and meeting consumer expectations.  This  approach  has  also  been  aligned  with TCFD  recommendations.  The  identified  risks  are  not  of significant financial materiality to the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Risks related to climate change\n\nAs part of the analysis of its exposure to physical risks and to transition risks and opportunities, Saint -Gobain wanted to  identify  the  potential  amplification  effects  of  the  first type of risk on the second. The aim of this exercise is to provide the Group with a global and exhaustive view of its exposure  to  the  risks  and  opportunities  associated  with the impact of climate change on its business.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nThe three major physical risks identified on the basis of the sixth  IPCC  report  are  the  following:  increased  frequency and/or intensity of potentially destructive events, resource scarcity, and global temperature increase.\n\nThe Risk and Insurance Department continuously assesses the risks to which the Group's sites are exposed worldwide and, in particular, the risks related to the effects of climate\n\nchange (see section 3.3.2, p. 107 and section 6.2.2, p. 231). In 2022, a specific study of physical risks was carried out (see this section). The management of these risks is then reflected  in  the  development  and  implementation  of specific  policies  supporting  Saint -Gobain's  environmental commitments, for example in terms of water management and  biodiversity  (see  section  3.1.3,  p.  82  and  p.  84).  In addition,  the  Group  ensures  that  physical  risks  are  taken into  account  throughout  its  value  chain.  As  part  of  its responsible purchasing program, Saint -Gobain relies on a diversity of suppliers and supply sources to reduce the risk of  transportation  difficulties  and  supply  chain  disruptions (see section 3.1.2, p. 74). Finally, the Purchasing Department considers the risk of an increase in the price of  raw  materials  or  of  energy  and  greenhouse  gas emissions  in  its  purchasing  strategies  (see  section  6.1, p. 220).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Two internal carbon prices were set up and increased in 2021 to support the viability of Saint -Gobain's projects and strategy (see section 3.3.1, p. 104).\n\nAt  the  local  level,  monitoring  and  compliance  programs have  been  implemented  in  the  countries  by  the  EHS Department,  while  the  Legal  Department  monitors  new environmental  regulations  (see  section  3.1.5,  p.  88  and section  6.1.1,  p.  220).  In  addition,  the  marketing  teams ensure  that  the  Group's  products  comply  with  local environmental  regulations  (see  section  3.1.4,  p.  84).\n\n\u00cb\n\nSimilarly, the risks of climate change disputes are assessed as  part  of  the  existing  risk  management  process.  In addition, Saint -Gobain  monitors  changes  in  climate reporting requirements in order to meet the expectations of its stakeholders (see section 3.3.1, p. 105).\n\nWhat is more, aware of the impact of a bad reputation on environmental matters, the Group fully integrates reputational risk into its risk management  policy. Saint -Gobain  is  demonstrating  its  commitment  to  the climate  through  concrete  targets  for  reducing  its  CO2 emissions and energy consumption. Finally, the needs and risks  related  to  access  to  water  for  local  populations  are systematically taken into account in its action plans.",

The substitution of  non-renewable  virgin  raw  materials  with  renewable  or recycled raw materials, the extension of the lifespan or use of  our  products  or  systems  and  the  reduction  of  the intensity  of  materials  are  at  the  heart  of  the  Group's innovation process and enable it to ensure the competitiveness of its solutions while anticipating changes in the preferences of its end consumers and legislation.\n\nSaint -Gobain  is  also  working  to  optimize  and  reduce  its energy  consumption  through  such  means  as  investing  in digital  tools  to  adjust  energy  consumption  as  closely  as possible to needs (see section 2.3.3, p. 58).\n\nAnticipation  of  the  increase  in  the  cost  of  high-emission products, which would follow the tightening of regulations and  the  change  in  preferences  expected  by  consumers and  customers,  encourages  Saint -Gobain  to  support  the development  of  low-carbon  materials  and  methods throughout  its  value  chain  (see  section  2.3.5,  p.  64).  In addition to its efforts to contribute to carbon neutrality in its  operations,  the  Group  promotes  renewable  energies and develops solutions to improve the energy efficiency of its  customers  to  enable  them  to  meet  the  climate  and environmental  challenges  they  face  (see  section  2.3.2, p.  64).  Moreover,  thanks  to  its  strong  exposure  to  the renovation market, the Group is ideally situated to play a decisive  role  in  the  national  and  European  'green recovery'  plans  for  the  energy  transition,  which  should support Saint -Gobain's structural growth (see section 2.1.2, p. 47).\n\n## c. Study of the amplification effects of risks and opportunities according to the climate scenarios\n\nAs part of the analysis of its exposure to physical risks and transition risks and  opportunities, Saint -Gobain  has conducted  a  study  in  2022  to  identify  the  potential amplification effects of transition risks due to the intensity of  physical  risks.  The  objective  of  this  exercise  is  to provide the Group with a global and regional view of its exposure  to  the  risks  and  opportunities  associated  with the impact of climate change on its business.\n\nAn identification of the evolution of major physical risks globally  and  by  region  -  was  carried  out  on  the  basis  of the 6th IPCC report. These physical risks were then linked to  the  transition  risks  and  opportunities  identified  by Saint -Gobain and aligned with the TCFD recommendations.  For  each  of  them,  the  potential amplification  effect  caused  by  the  physical  risks  was studied  and  quantified  as  low,  moderate  or  significant according  to  three  scenarios:  SSP1-2.6,  SSP2-4.5  and SSP5-8.5.\n\nThe three major physical risks identified on the basis of the IPCC  report  are:  increased  frequency  and/or  intensity  of potentially  destructive  events,  resource  scarcity,  and global temperature increase. In the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios,  these  three  physical  risks  have  expected amplification  effects  on  the  majority  of  transition  risks  in all  regions.  On  the  other  hand,  a  particular  influence  on market  risks  is  observed,  such  as  the  increase  in production and distribution costs or the disruption of the value chain. This can be explained by various reasons, such as  an  increase  in  production  costs  linked  to  rising temperatures,  which  increases  the  energy  requirements for cooling machines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nA decarbonated home\n\nIn terms of opportunities, the positive amplification effects seem to favor political and legal opportunities as well as technological  opportunities.  Indeed,  the  global  rise  in temperatures could accelerate the evolution of regulations related  to  building  insulation,  thus  favoring  demand.  In addition,  Saint -Gobain's  ability  to  develop  construction alternatives  that  are  more  energy  efficient  and  have  a lower environmental impact could represent an opportunity amplified by the increasing scarcity of certain resources,  making  it  possible  to  reduce  their  additional cost.\n\nSaint -Gobain's  knowledge  of  the  existence  of  these amplification  effects  enables  it  to  include  physical  risks and  transition  risks  and  opportunities  in  its  long-term vision  and  strategy,  thus  fully  integrating  climate  change and its impacts into its decision-making.\n\n## C - Solutions\n\n## a.  Designing innovative solutions incorporating 'carbon benefits'\n\nSaint -Gobain is innovating to develop solutions to reduce the  carbon  footprint  of  buildings  throughout  their  life cycle:\n\n- \u00b7 By  reducing  their  energy  consumption  during  the utilization  phase;  these  are  insulation  and  glazing solutions that improve energy efficiency;\n- \u00b7 By  reducing  the  carbon  footprint  of  its  products  and solutions, particularly by developing lightweight construction solutions, increasing the amount  of recycled  materials  used  to  manufacture  them  or  by using renewable  energy  to  power  its  industrial processes.\n\nAn  online  platform  called  Green  Buildings  Saint -Gobain enables the Group's customers to evaluate the contribution  of  its  products  and  solutions  to  obtaining LEED, BREEAM, WELL or international HQE certifications.\n\nEnergy  efficiency  and  reducing  the  carbon  footprint  of products are two criteria incorporated into the methodology for  evaluating  sustainable  solutions  as  part of the program (see section 3.1.4, p. 85).\n\n## b.  Measuring the 'carbon benefits' of products and solutions\n\nThe  innovative  solutions  developed  by  Saint -Gobain  to improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings  lessen  the negative impacts of the construction sector on the climate and  cut  occupants'  energy  bills,  while  enhancing  wellbeing.  They  therefore  play  an  important  role  in  the  fight against climate change, as they allow through a reduction of energy demand to decrease the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted.  Thus,  the  benefits  offered  by  the  Group's thermal insulation products and glazing exceed significantly the impacts associated to their production in terms  of  energy  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas emissions.\n\n\u00cb\n\nAfter an initial calculation carried out in 2015 at the COP21 conference, Saint -Gobain decided, in 2021, to update and improve the methodology used to calculate the quantity of greenhouse gases avoided thanks to the use of its own solutions, in order to:\n\n- \u00b7 comply with the most recent and recognized international  recommendations  for  the  calculation  of prevented greenhouse gas emissions;\n- \u00b7 extend the geographic coverage of the evaluation.\n\nSaint -Gobain has estimated that nearly 1,300 million metric tons  of  emissions  was  avoided  thanks  to  the  solutions produced and sold in one year. The updated methodology is available  to  all  stakeholders  on  the  Saint -Gobain website.  This  calculation  has  been  reviewed  by  an independent third party.\n\nSaint -Gobain  is  committed  to  promoting  life  cycle assessments (LCA) to better understand and control the environmental impacts of its products. These analyses are useful for guiding innovation, better informing customers and  responding  to  growing  market  demand  for  greater transparency. Saint -Gobain is committed to ensuring that, by 2030, 100% of the Group's sales, excluding distribution activities,  will  be  generated  by  products  covered  by verified LCAs (life cycle assessments) or EPDs (environmental product declarations). By the end of 2022, 47.9%  of  sales  is  generated  by  products  covered  by verified LCAs or EPDs, excluding the distribution activity, a significant increase compared to 2021 (29.1%)\n\nThis represents more than 1,800 verified EPDs published in more  than  36  countries,  the  Group  is  positioned  as  the world's leading provider of verified EPDs - by number - in the construction sector.\n\n## c.  Co-developing solutions for new markets linked to the low-carbon economy\n\nIn  response  to  the  challenges  of  population  growth  and urbanization, it is imperative  to  design  sustainable solutions  and  contribute  to  the  construction  of  resilient cities that ensure the well-being of individuals in a context of resource scarcity and climate change. New lightweight construction  methods  can  be  used  to  meet  these challenges. The development of prefabricated solutions or 'off-site' construction favors the use of lighter construction methods using wood or metal structures, as alternatives to traditional constructions based on cement and brick. Saint -Gobain is also investing in 3D printing (see section 2.3.3, p. 58).\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy is also impacting markets  related  to  mobility  and  energy.  Thus,  the 'Mobility'  Business  Unit  is  working  both  on  solutions  to support  customers  in  the  transition  to  vehicles  that  emit less  and  less  CO2  and  on  adapting  its  offer  to  the development of hybrid or 100% electric vehicles.",

The carbon-related targets are detailed in the 'Carbon 2030' roadmap. It should be noted that the Group's impact on greenhouse  gases  is  limited  to  the  carbon  impact,  given that the emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2 are not significant with regard to the Group's emissions.\n\nAll other objectives and indicators that the Group uses to make  progress  in  mitigating,  managing  and  adapting  to climate change issues are presented in a detailed table in chapter  4.  The  2030  targets  based  on  2017  have  been validated by the independent organization Science-Based Target  initiative  (SBTi).  Details  of  the  methodology  for calculating  the  indicators  and  targets  are  available  in chapter 9, section 9.2.1, p. 373.\n\nThe classification of Saint -Gobain's activities in the context of  the  European  regulation  on  sustainable  finance  and compliance  with  the  European  regulation  '2020/852 Taxonomy  Regulation'  (in  force  since  July  2020),  the delegated  acts  to  the  first  two  objectives  regarding climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation  -  'Taxonomy Climate  Delegated  Act  (EU)  2021/2139'  -  as  well  as  the delegated  act  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EU)  2020/852 and  its  annexes  on  reporting  requirements  ('Disclosures Delegated  Act')  is  disclosed  in  chapter  9,  section  9.3.5, p. 389.\n\nThe  proportion  of  Saint -Gobain's  revenue  linked  to sustainable solutions is estimated at 73.9% in 2022 2 in line with the target of 75% by 2025. It includes activities that have not been assessed in the context of compliance with the  European  Taxonomy  Regulation  2020/852,  such  as distribution activities, and impacts and benefits that have not yet been included in the regulation, such as resources and  the  circular  economy,  as  well  as  benefits  related  to health,  safety  and  comfort,  which  will  potentially  be eligible for the social taxonomy.\n\n## A - 2030 roadmap\n\nSaint -Gobain's CO2 emissions are evaluated at 9.8 million tonnes for scope 1+2 and 21.3 million tonnes for scope 3 at the end of 2021.\n\nIn 2020,  SBTi  validated  Saint -Gobain's  2030  target: 8.4 million tonnes of CO2 for scope 1+2 in 2030, i.e., a 33% reduction in absolute terms between 2017 and 2030 and a 16% reduction in scope 3 over the same period. By the end of 2022, the group had reduced its emissions by 27% on scope  1  and  2.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  a  2030 roadmap has been deployed.\n\nThe  scope  1  and  2  impact  of  Saint -Gobain's  activities  is concentrated on three main sources:\n\n- \u00b7 Fossil fuels;\n- \u00b7 Emissions from raw materials during the process;\n- \u00b7 Electricity.\n\nTo reach its 2030 objectives and contribute in the long run to carbon neutrality by 2050, acts on three main levers:\n\n- \u00b7 Transition towards productions contributing to carbon neutrality;\n- \u00b7 Consumption of decarbonized energy;\n- \u00b7 Evolution  of  raw  material  compositions,  notably  to include more recycled materials.\n\nThe success of this roadmap requires the involvement of everyone  and  a  change  of  mentality.  Carbon  reduction objectives  are  included  in  all  operational  processes:  the WCM  program  for  ongoing  productivity  efforts,  energy purchases that include securing supplies of decarbonized energy (renewable electricity or biogas, for example), and increased use of recycled materials, which  implies developing collection channels in all countries.\n\nTo ensure the transition towards productions contributing to carbon neutrality, Saint -Gobain relies on its R&D teams to  devise  industrial  processes.  Since  2021,  programs  and demonstrators  have  been  set  up  in  most  of  the  Group's businesses: gypsum, glass and insulation.\n\nAlready,  the  first  gypsum  plants  designed  to  emit minimum  levels  of  carbon  are  being  invested  in  Norway and Canada.\n\nA low-carbon flat glass production was also carried out in France  in  May  2022  without  emitting  carbon  during  the production process. Following this successful trial, a 'lowcarbon'  glass  offer  has  been  proposed  to  the  market  in Europe.  This  new  range,  called  Ora\u00e9,  has  a  low-carbon footprint with a reduction of around 40% compared with the European average.\n\nEach  country  is  responsible  for  its  roadmap.  Each  year's financial budgets  include  an  assessment  of  carbon emission  reductions  based  on  planned  investments.  The carbon  roadmap  is  supported  by  a  Capex  and  R&D investment  plan  of  \u20ac100  million  per  year  until  2030.  In 2022, 191 million have been invested in capital expenditure and R&D related to the carbon roadmap.\n\n## B - The carbon impact of energy\n\nMore  than  three  quarters  of  Saint -Gobain's  total  energy consumption is directly linked to purchases of fossil fuels. The  ability  of  industrial  processes  to  move  from  using fossil  fuels  to  decarbonized  energy  solutions  -  electricity (when  it  is  low-carbon),  biogas,  or  even  hydrogen  -  is therefore  crucial.  Action  plans  have  been  drawn  up between the non-trade purchasing teams in the countries, the  Industrial  Departments  and  the  local  environmental managers, in order to identify regular and reliable sources of  renewable  energy.  The  Group  is  also  developing projects  on  its  sites  using  new  energies  (wind  energy, biomass,  biogas,  solar  energy,  etc.).  These  developments may be made in association with external partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Saint -Gobain participates  in  these  debates.  The  Group  is  also  keen  to engage in dialog with expert organizations with a view to improving the measurement of impacts in order to make the fight against climate change more effective.\n\nScope  3  emissions  are  indirect  emissions  that  are generated  in  a  company's  value  chain.  Given  the complexity  of  the  value  chains,  the  assessment  of emissions  is  a  challenge  and  the  improvement  of  data quality  is  essential  in  the  context  of  the  commitment towards  contributing  to  carbon  neutrality  in  the  sector. For this reason, Saint -Gobain's updated scope 3 emissions assessment  in  2021  has  been  accompanied  by  a  more specific  assessment  of  emissions  factors  and  a  more granular analysis of impacts on the three most significant categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Purchases of raw materials (category 1);\n- \u00b7 Transport and logistics (categories 4 and 9);\n- \u00b7 Purchases related to trade activities (category 1).\n\nThus,  in  2021,  the  Group's  scope  3  is  estimated  at 21.3  Mteq  CO2  compared  with  the  2017  base  used  to validate  the  2030  targets  by  SBTi  (17.3  Mteq  CO2). Excluding  the  broader  coverage  of  impacts,  scope  3 would be estimated at 16.8 Mteq CO2 in 2021. Saint -Gobain publishes its  emissions by scope 3 emissions category in the CDP Climate.\n\nIn  line  with  its  commitment  to  contribute  to  the  carbon neutrality  by  2050  and  its  objective  of  reducing  its scope 3 by 16% by 2030 - validated by SBTi - compared with  2017,  the  Group  will  continue  its  efforts  to  increase transparency and improve the assessment of impacts on its value chain through the mobilization of its teams and in collaboration with its suppliers.\n\n\u00cb\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  implemented  digital  tools  to  make assessment of scope 3 more reliable. The methods used to assess  carbon  emissions  and  integrate  emission  factors have been the subject of global coordination. The scope 3 program involves suppliers in  negotiations  conducted  by the trade and non-trade purchasing teams.\n\nThe  objective  is  to  identify  common  approaches  and innovations that Saint -Gobain could support to accelerate their availability.\n\nFive principles are implemented by the purchasing teams and environmental experts:\n\n- \u00b7 A digital tool available to teams at local levels and by categories  to  enable  them  to  estimate  scope  3 emissions;\n- \u00b7 Communication kits to share the challenges and targets of the fight against climate change with suppliers;\n- \u00b7 The  collection  of  information  by  suppliers  on  their emissions on the basis of life cycle analyses verified by independent third parties;\n- \u00b7 The  integration  of  the  maturity  of  suppliers  regarding their  climate  commitment  into  the  overall  assessment of their performance;\n- \u00b7 The  creation  of  joint  action  plans  with  suppliers  to reduce their carbon impact.\n\nThis  systematization  will  continue  to  make  scope  3 assessments more reliable. It  also  structures  action  plans to  accelerate  the  reduction  of  emissions.  Best  practices have been identified and shared with all Group buyers.\n\nIn  2020,  the  top  200  carbon  emitters  supplying  raw materials were identified. A dialogue is being conducted to assess  their  short-,  medium-  and  long-term  emission reduction  plans  and  targets,  which  we  are  compelling them to have validated by SBTi.\n\nLogistics  related  actions  are  based  on  optimizing  loads, optimizing  routes  and  reducing  the  impact  of  transport methods:  use  of  fuels  with  low  CO2  emissions,  river transport, efficient trucks, for example (see in this chapter, section 3.1.2, p. 75).",

Circularity combined with an efficient and reasoned use of resources makes it possible to face the evolutions of society such as urbanization or demographic changes.\n\nThis  model  is  applied  closer  to  the  markets  and  at  the territorial level. A successful transition towards the circular economy  will  make  it  possible  to  offer  solutions  and services  over  the  long  term  which  take  into  account\n\nenvironmental, social and societal expectations and which balance  well-being,  sustainability  and  performance  for stakeholders.

While responsible resources management is the subject  of  a  Group-wide  policy,  action  plans  for  the transition to a circular economy are highly dependent on countries, the maturity of stakeholders and local logistics. Approaches are therefore deployed by activity in order to involve the various sectors, in each country.\n\n## 3.4.2 CHANGING THE PRODUCTS, SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES OFFERING\n\nThe  gradual  emergence  of  the  circular  economy  is changing value chains and ecosystems. From the design of products, solutions and services to the benefits expected by  customers  and  end  users,  and  the  management  of product end-of-life, Saint -Gobain's offering must adapt to new methods: incorporating more recycled or renewable materials  to  reduce  the  consumption  of  virgin  raw materials  and  the  consequences  of  their  use,  particularly on  biodiversity;  extending  the  life  of  products  to  reduce their  environmental  impact;  and  facilitating  the  recycling or reuse of products at the end of their life to successfully meet  market  needs  with  a  limited  impact  on  natural resources.\n\nThus,  the  portfolio  of  products  and  solutions  offered  by Saint -Gobain is analyzed transversally under the responsibility of the marketing teams with three priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 The  substitution  of  raw  materials  by  recycled  or renewable materials, including packaging;\n- \u00b7 The  development  of  formulations  to  reduce  their content  of  hazardous  substances  until  their  complete replacement, thus avoiding the dissemination of materials generated during the recycling process;\n- \u00b7 The improvement of the recyclability and reusability of products  and  systems,  including  their  packaging,  by integrating repairability and ease of disassembly at the end of life.\n\nLikewise, product design incorporates these ecoinnovation principles.\n\nMost of the Group's business lines are working to reduce the  resource  intensity  of  their  products,  by  reducing  the average  weight  for  the  same  unit  of  product,  without affecting  technical  performances.  This  is  the  case,  for example,  for  car  windshields  and  plasterboard.  Several countries have already implemented the BANTAM program, which aims to reduce the weight of plasterboard by working on industrial processes and product formulations.  Some  plants  have  been  able  to  reduce  the weight  of  their  standard  boards  by  more  than  20% compared  with  their  initial  weight.  The  SLIMWOOL program, deployed since 2018 worldwide, aims to optimize the weight of glass wool, while guaranteeing the product's thermal performance.\n\nThe development of a circular economy is also conducive to energy savings and the reduction of carbon emissions. Thus, one of the levers for reducing the carbon impact of glass is the integration of recycled glass. The low-carbon glass range contains around 70% recycled glass.\n\nEach country develops innovations based on the possibilities  of  accessing  new  sources  of  recycled  or  bio based  materials.  For  example,  in  2022,  Isover  in  France launched a new range of insulation called Isocoton, made from recycled clothing fibers. Thus, Isover collects clothing from  French  recycling  channels,  transforms  it  through fraying  and  assembles  it  to  produce  an  insulating  and high-performance panel. For its part, Weber  has developed  a  new  exterior  insulation  made  from  cork,  a natural and renewable raw material.",

    {
        "page_content": "## AN EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIBLE GROUP\n\nMore performance with less\n\nThe actions deployed concern not only the products but also their packaging. Action plans have been deployed to reduce  packaging  globally  and  to  ensure  that  it  is recyclable.  Consequently,  marketing  teams  and  buyers have  been  working  together  to  change  packaging materials  or  design  to  encourage  recycling  in  existing channels. Saint -Gobain has set a target of 100% recyclable packaging  by  2030.  In  2022,  91%  of  packaging  is recyclable.\n\nThe  solutions  proposed  by  Saint -Gobain  as  part  of  its 'Sustainable and Efficient Solutions' initiative (see  section  3.1.4,  p.  84)  are  offerings  that  reduce  the environmental  impact  during  the  use  phase.  This  is  of course  the  case  for  insulation  solutions  that  promote energy efficiency. Some solutions developed by Weber in particular  also  help  to  reduce  water  consumption  on building sites.\n\nSimilarly, the integration of recycled materials in products avoids the extraction of virgin non-renewable natural raw materials with a positive impact on biodiversity.\n\nFinally, because construction already accounts for 40% of the world's resource consumption, Saint -Gobain is actively and  collaboratively involved in discussions on the evolution  of  construction  methods  towards  lightweight construction solutions that use fewer materials for at least the same performance.\n\nThis approach  to  building  design  and  construction methods  anticipates  the  possibility  of  modularity  in buildings so that their use can be adapted during their life cycle.  For  example,  Saint -Gobain's  offerings  include  the ability  to  dismantle  and  reuse  certain  products  such  as plasterboard.\n\nThe criterion of optimizing natural resources is one of the identified benefits as part of the program to develop the offer of sustainable and efficient solutions (see  section  3.1.4,  p.  84).  This  criterion  includes  both limiting  the  use  of  natural  resources  and  incorporating recycled materials into product compositions.\n\n## 3.4.3 CHANGING THE PRODUCTION PROCESSES\n\nReducing the consumption of raw materials per functional unit  produced  and  the  waste  generated  by  industrial processes  are  the  pillars  of  the  sustainable  resources management  policy  initiated  in  2015  (see  this  chapter, section  3.1.3,  p.  83)  with  the  aim  of  moving  towards  the 'zero unrecovered waste'.\n\nSynergies between the Group's various industrial processes are used to optimize the reuse of waste and byproducts.  In  the  countries  where  Saint -Gobain  operates, teams are gradually setting up services to recover waste from  customers'  activities,  in  particular  waste  from renovation or demolition/dismantling. This waste  is collected, sorted and reprocessed before being reused in the industrial process instead of natural raw materials.\n\nOverall  synergies  are  possible  across  the  businesses  for each  process  or  raw  material  to  identify  the  deposits, material  qualities  or  even  best  technical  practices  and favorable technical innovations by country. Cross-business working  groups  including  the  Industrial  and  Technical Departments, purchases, sustainable development experts on  the  collection  and  processing  of  recycled  materials have been set up to develop these synergies.\n\nThe  search  to  replace  as  many  non-recyclable  raw materials as possible is part of the industrial performance improvement  program  (see  this  chapter,  section  3.1.3, p. 77). The aim of these replacements must be to maintain the  quality  and  competitiveness  of  the  products  and solutions  and  even  improving  them  while  reducing  their carbon footprint.\n\nFor flat glass, the recycling of window glass, facade glass or  automotive  glass  is  infinitely  possible  as  long  as  the collected glass elements meet the quality requirements of a  'float'  furnace,  in  particular  that  contaminants  of  all kinds  are  eliminated.  The  integration  into  products  is therefore  mainly  dependent  on  the  existence  of  efficient and  sustainable  collection  networks,  which  are  able  to ensure sorting that meets the desired quality specifications.\n\nFor plaster, once the contaminants have been eliminated, the  reprocessing  of  waste  from  the  building  is  done  by grinding and separating the paper present on both sides of the board. If the plaster itself is indefinitely recyclable, the presence of paper on both sides of the board causes a negative impact on the manufacturing process and must therefore  be  eliminated  as  much  as  possible.  Some Saint -Gobain  plants  now  reach  30%  recycled  content, mainly from construction or demolition plaster waste.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 3 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

The  approaches  are  therefore  deployed  by country to mobilize either global channels for the recovery of  construction  site  waste  or  by  trade,  i.e.,  by  type  of product recovered (glass, plaster, glass wool, etc.).\n\nIn many countries, Saint -Gobain is developing services for its customers, which include waste and construction waste retrieval.  Collected  glass  is  recycled  and  used  to  make glazing or glass wool. Likewise, plaster waste collected can be recycled to make new plasterboard.\n\nThe  presence  in  a  country  of  distribution  activities  adds local  synergies  through  the  option  of  installing  collection points  close  to  sales  outlets,  making  it  easier  to  recycle customers' waste.\n\nAll  of  these  services  are  provided  directly  by  Group companies or in partnership with third-party companies.\n\nThe  principles  of  the  circular  economy  differ  in  each country  and  region  of  the  world.  These  developments depend  on  a  great  variety  of  factors,  such  as  modes  of consumption,  infrastructure  and  the  industrial  fabric,  the legal context and the technical and logistical conditions of waste  management.  Saint -Gobain  organizations  in  the countries  spearhead  or  take  part  in  initiatives  with  local stakeholders: industrial initiatives involving an area, customers and local authorities or communities.\n\nAs  part  of  their  professional  channels,  Saint -Gobain's 'Gypsum'  and  'Flat  Glass  for  Buildings'  entities  have signed commitments with the French public authorities on the recycling of waste plaster and glass.\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  developed  a  network  in  Europe, Saint -Gobain Glass Recycling, to facilitate the recycling of flat glass from dismantling or waste from the industry. The aim  is  to  qualify  independent  companies  capable  of collecting  and  dismantling  glass  products,  and  which  are committed to promoting the recycling of end-of-life glass in  a  closed  loop.  Some  20  independent  partners  have already  joined  the  network  to  offer  treatment  and recycling of glass products.\n\n\u00cb\n\nMoreover,  Saint -Gobain  Distribution  B\u00e2timent  France  has been organized to take back waste from the same types of construction materials, products and equipment that it sells to  professionals,  becoming  the  leading  private network of collection points for construction site waste. In its  CSR  roadmap,  Saint -Gobain  Distribution,  'B\u00e2timent France'  has  included  a  pillar  on  construction  sites  waste management. Various partnerships have been set up with specialized companies or start-ups such as Tri'n'collect to speed  up  the  recovery, sorting and recycling of construction waste.\n\nSaint -Gobain in France also works with an association of the Group's retirees, ' Saint -Gobain Solidarit\u00e9s ',  to provide a  link  between  the  Group's  sites  in  France  and  local associations in order to facilitate the donation of materials, in  particular  unsold  stock.  In  this  way,  the  destruction  of certain stocks is avoided and their use is facilitated.\n\nSince  2019,  the  Group  has  launched  its  I-LOOP  project, supported by the European Union through its LIFE funding program.  This  project  aims  to  contribute  to  gradually recovering  glass  wool  waste  generated  on  building  or demolition sites,  which  currently  goes  to  landfill.  It  offers an  innovative  solution  for  closed  loop  recycling  that  can transform  waste  into  a  high-quality  secondary  raw material that is used to manufacture new glass wool. The project  aims  to  offer  construction  market  players  new value chains to recycle glass wool in France, Benelux and part  of  Scandinavia,  which  will  be  a  cost-effective alternative to landfill.\n\nEcophon, producer of acoustic panels and ceiling systems, has also developed a recycling service called 'SoundCircularity'  to  collect  and  recycle  waste.  This service  is  available  in  Sweden,  Finland  and  France.  The ambition is to extend its availability in Europe.\n\nThe  industrial  sectors  are  also  developing  new  services linked  to  the  circular  economy.

Renovation remained at a good level, supported by stimulus measures and stricter energy performance regulations. The Region's operating  margin  came  in  at  a  new  record  high  of  7.8% (versus  5.6%  in  2018),  thanks  to  an  optimized  business profile and sound management of the price-cost spread.\n\nNordic  countries outperformed  their  market  thanks  to their  successful  presence  across  the  entire  construction value chain.

The operating margin came in at 12.0%, down slightly year-onyear  owing  to  a  negative  mix  effect  and  to  the  gradual catch-up  in  prices  in  Mobility  in  a  strongly  inflationary environment.\n\n- \u00b7 Businesses  serving global  construction  customers achieved  record  sales  and  outperformed  the  market with  19.5%  growth.  They  continued  to  benefit  from upbeat  trends  in  textile  solutions  for  external  thermal insulation  systems  (ETICS).  The  very  strong  trends  in Chryso sales and results continued, driven by decarbonization  in  the  construction  sector,  growth capex  (fifth  additives  plant  in  India)  and  targeted acquisitions  (Matchem  in  Brazil,  IDP  Chemicals  in Egypt).  The  new  Construction  Chemicals  organization integrating GCP has been in place since October 1, 2022 and  will  help  to  accelerate  implementation  of  the expected synergies.\n\nOPERATING INCOME (\u20acM) AND MARGIN (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 The Mobility business  saw  sales  progress  14.9%  over the  year,  with  an  acceleration  in  the  second  half  at 24.4%,  supported  by  both  a  gradual  catch-up  in  sales prices  and  by  a  rebound  in  volumes.  The  business continued to enjoy upbeat momentum in the Americas, India  and  China.  Thanks  to  its  technological  lead  in solutions  for  electric  vehicles  -  which  accounted  for 30% of our sales at the end of the year - and to its high value-added  solutions,  the  Mobility  business  continues to outperform the automotive market.\n- \u00b7 Businesses  serving Industry grew  12.8%,  supported  by activities relating to investment cycles such as ceramics,  which  benefited  from  strong  demand  for innovation in specialty materials and new decarbonization  technologies.  Against  this  backdrop, Valoref,  a  pioneer  in  ceramic  recycling  in  Europe, increased its sales by almost 50% in 2022 by expanding its operations internationally into India and China, and is now targeting North America.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

These  key  challenges  relate  to  risks and opportunities identified in accordance with legal requirements  (see  chapter  2,  section  1.3.3).  They  also consider  the  stakeholder  expectations  identified  in  the materiality analysis and the Group's environmental, social and societal challenges.\n\nA  CSR  roadmap  was  published  in  2019.  It  is  a  tool  for managing  the  Group's  CSR  strategy.  This  roadmap  is based on six key challenges for the Group: business ethics, climate  change,  inclusion  and  diversity,  the  circular economy, health and safety across the entire value chain and inclusive local value creation.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThis roadmap reflects Saint -Gobain's willingness to assess its  performance  in  terms  of  impacts  on  the  environment, human beings and society generated by its activities and the expectations of its stakeholders.\n\nIn  November  2020,  the  Group  implemented  its  CO2 roadmap  to  achieve  carbon  neutrality  by  2050.  New targets  for  reducing  carbon  emissions  in  scopes  1  and  2 and in scope 3 between 2017 and 2030 were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). These targets were  therefore  included  in  the  dashboard  in  2021  to replace  the  targets  for  2025  (based  on  equivalent production levels).\n\nThis  dashboard  update  also  includes  the  action  plans implemented  as  part  of  the  'Grow  &  Impact'  strategic program.",

Considering the impact of energy on carbon emissions, Saint-Gobain favors the transition to decarbonized energies by changing its energy mix.\n\n| Objectives                                                                                                         | Deadline   | 2022 data                | 2021 data                | 2020 data                    | Progress   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|------------|\n| -33% on CO \u2082  emissions scopes 1 and 2 between 2017  and 2030 (in absolute value)                                  | 2030       | -27.0 % (9.8 Mt)         | -23.0%  (10.3 Mt)        | N/A (10.4 Mt)                | 81.8%      |\n| -16% on CO \u2082  emissions scopes 3 between 2017 and  2030 (in absolute value)                                        | 2030       | (21.3 Mt)  (1)           | (21.3 Mt)                | (17.4 Mt)                    | -          |\n| -50% on industrial water withdrawals between 2017  and 2030 (in absolute value)                                    | 2030       | -19.9 % (45.0 M of m \u00b3 ) | -14.0%  (48.1 M of m \u00b3 ) | N/A (45.4 M of m \u00b3 )         | 39.7%      |\n| Zero water discharge in area with extremely high  water risk                                                       | 2030       | (0.6 M of m \u00b3 )          | (0.8 M of m \u00b3 )          | N/A                          | -          |\n| -80% non-recovered waste between 2017 and 2030  (in absolute value)                                                | 2030       | -36.6 % (0.4 Mt)         | -24.0%  (0.5 Mt)         | N/A (0.4 Mt)                 | 45.8%      |\n| +30% of virgin raw materials avoided between 2017  and 2030                                                        | 2030       | -4.7 % (9.4 Mt)          | +1.0%  (10.0 Mt)         | N/A (9.3 Mt)                 | 15.6%      |\n| 100% of revenue generated with products covered  by verified LCA or EPD, excluding distribution  activity, by 2030 | 2030       | 47.9 %                   | 29.1%                    | N/A                          | 47.9%      |\n| 100% of recyclable packaging by 2030 in absolute  value                                                            | 2030       | 91.10 %                  | 69.0%                    | N/A                          | 91.1%      |\n| Bio-sourced or recycled content in packaging   (>30%) in 2030                                                      | 2030       | 86.3 %                   | N/A                      | N/A                          | 287.7%     |\n| Reduce CO \u2082  emissions by 20% (scope 1 +2) at iso- production between 2010 and 2025                                | 2025       | -26.0 %                  | (21.7%)                  | N/A                          | 130.0%     |\n| Reduce SOx emissions by 20% between 2010 and  2025 at iso-production                                               | 2025       | -67.0 % (8,789 t)        | -66.1%  (8,372 t)        | -51.8 % (10,276 t)           | 165.0%     |\n| Reduce NOx emissions by 20% between 2010 and  2025 at iso-production                                               | 2025       | -33.0 % (18,257 t)       | -32.4%  (16,906 t)       | -15.7 % (16,988 t)           | 320.0%     |\n| Reduce dust emissions by 20% between 2010 and  2025 at iso-production                                              | 2025       | -64.0 % (4,705 t)        | -57.1%  (4,731 t)        | -53.0 %                      | 285.0%     |\n| Reduce energy consumption by 15% between 2010  and 2025 at iso-production                                          | 2025       | -6.0 % (41,854 GWh)      | -3.4%  (43,461 GWh)      | (4,817 t) +1.3% (41,020 GWh) | 40.0%      |\n| Reduce liquid water discharge by 80% between  2010 and 2025 at iso-production                                      | 2025       | -41.0 % (45.0 M of m \u00b3 ) | -39.8%  (48.1 M of m \u00b3 ) | -31.5 %                      | 51.3%      |\n| Reduce non-recovered waste by 50% between 2010  and 2025 at iso-production                                         | 2025       | -38.0 %                  | -27.3%                   | (45.4 M of m \u00b3 ) -26.3 %     | 76.0%      |\n| 100% of the Group's active quarries with a  biodiversity management plan by 2025                                   | 2025       | (0.4 Mt)                 | (0.5 Mt)                 | (0.4 Mt)                     |            |\n|                                                                                                                    |            | 28.0 %                   | 31.0%                    | N/A                          | 28.0%      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Saint -Gobain  generally  actively  follows  the debates  on  SDGs  and  reporting,  especially  the  working group initiated by the Global Compact. The 17 SDGs were subdivided  into  different  levels:  SDGs  aligned  with  the strategy,  moderately  aligned  SDGs  (limited  scope  of influence  or  associated  with  a  specific  activity)  and  nonpriority SDGs where the Group has little or no impact.\n\nSDG 9\n\nSDGs aligned with the strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSDG 15\n\nNon-priority SDGs SDGs

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nComposition and operation of the governing bodies\n\n## Independence, diversity policy and representation of employee shareholders and employees on the Board of Directors\n\n## Independence\n\nThe  Board  has  carried  out  the  annual  review  of  each Director's  situation  with  regard  to  the  independence criteria set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code  for  French  listed  companies,  with  which  the Company complies, at the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  of  February  23, 2023, also scrutinized, as it does every year, with vigilance and  with  the  same  attention  as  the  other  criteria,  the business relationships that may  exist  between  the Saint -Gobain  Group  and  the  other  companies  or  groups where  each  Director  holds  office.  In  particular,  Mr.  JeanDominique Senard, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Renault,  Mr.  Gilles  Schnepp,  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors  of  Danone,  Mrs.  Dominique  Leroy,  member  of the Board of Directors and Europe Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche  Telekom  AG,  Mr.  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Cirelli, Chairman of BlackRock France, Belgium and Luxembourg, Mrs. Lina Ghotmeh, Pr\u00e9sidente of Lina Ghotmeh Architecture  and  Mr.  Thierry  Delaporte,  Chief  Executive Officer of Wipro Limited, who hold executive management positions  or  chairmanships  of  board  of  directors  or supervisory bodies. The Board's review, described below, concluded  that,  with  the  exception  of  Mrs.  Dominique Leroy  and  Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Senard,  none  of  these Directors,  nor  any  company  or  group  within  which  they hold  office  as  senior  executives  or  exercise  Board chairmanship  functions  (or  supervisory  board)  has  any business relationship with Compagnie de Saint -Gobain, its Group or its management.\n\nAs  no  business  relationships  exist  between  the  groups Danone, BlackRock, Lina Ghotmeh Architecture or Wipro Limited on the one hand, and Saint -Gobain on the other, the Board conducted a quantitative and qualitative review of  the  situation  of  Mrs.  Dominique  Leroy  and  Mr.  JeanDominique  Senard  and  of  business  relationship  between Deutsche  Telekom  and  the  Renault  Alliance  (Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi), on the one hand, and Saint -Gobain, on the other.\n\nBusiness  flows  between  the  Saint -Gobain  and  Deutsche Telekom  groups  represent  less  than  0.1%  of  their respective  consolidated  revenues,  all  activities  combined and  worldwide.  Between  the  Renault  Alliance  and  the Saint -Gobain  group,  business  flows  represent  less  than 0.1% of Renault's consolidated revenues and less than 0.5% of  Saint -Gobain's  consolidated  revenues,  all  activities combined and worldwide. These figures are well below the\n\n\u00cb\n\n1% materiality threshold set by the Board. In addition, the Board  of  Directors  noted  that,  given  the  organization  of the  Saint -Gobain  Group,  its  size  and  the  diversity  of  its activities,  it  is  not  the  Board's  role  to  intervene  in  the commercial relations of the Group's various business units, which  are  managed  on  a  decentralized  basis  by  the departments  concerned.  Furthermore,  Mrs.  Dominique Leroy and Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard, in their capacity as Directors  of  the  Saint -Gobain  Group,  have  no  direct  or indirect  decision-making  power  in  the  establishment  or maintenance  of  these  business  relationships.  If,  however, such  an  issue  were  to  be  discussed  at  a  Board  meeting, the  Board's  internal  rules  provide  for  rules  on  the management  of  conflicts  of  interest,  under  which  the Director  concerned  would  have  the  duty  to  inform  the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Lead Director of his or her situation and to abstain from participating in the discussions and deliberations on the matter in question (see section 9.1.1.B, p. 370).\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  above,  the  Board  considered  that Mrs. Dominique Leroy and Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard do not  have,  directly  or  indirectly,  any  significant  business relationships  with  the  Group  that  could  affect  their freedom of judgment or independence.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  Mr.  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Cirelli  is  a Director  as  an  individual  and  not  on  the  proposal  of BlackRock which, at December 31, 2022, held 6.02% of the capital  and  5.49%  of  the  voting  rights  of  the  Company. Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli does not represent BlackRock on the Board of Directors.\n\nSee  conflicts of interest and  statements  regarding members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  section  5.1.1  p.  156 regarding conflicts of interest of members of the Board of Directors,  and  the  absence  of  services  contract  between Directors and the Company or any Group entity.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  concluded  from  its  review  of Directors'  independence  against  the  criteria  set  down  by the AFEP-MEDEF Code that, as of February 1, 2023, eight Directors out of eleven (i.e., 73%) completely satisfied the independence  criteria,  and  were  therefore  considered  to be  independent  Directors:  Mrs.  Lina  Ghotmeh,  Mrs.  I\u00eada Gomes Yell, Mrs. Pamela Knapp, Mrs. Agn\u00e8s Lemarchand, Mrs. Dominique Leroy, Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli, Mr. JeanDominique  Senard  and  Thierry  Delaporte.  In  compliance with  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code, Mrs.  Sibylle  Daunis-Opfermann,  representing  employee shareholders,  and  Mrs.  Lydie  Cortes  and  Mr.  Philippe Thibaudet,  representing  employees,  were  not  included  in calculating that proportion.\n\nThe table below summarizes the results of the independence  review  of  each  Director  in  relation  to  the criteria set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code.",

representing  the  employees,  are not  included  to  establish  this  percentage).  Further,  the majority  of  Directors  has,  or  has  had,  very  strong international exposure, managing groups with a significant proportion  of  their  activities,  or  exercising  significant duties,  outside  of  France  (see  biographies  section  5.1.1, p. 156).\n\nIn  addition,  as  part  of  its  assessment  carried  out  during 2022  with  the  assistance  of  a  specialist  consulting  firm (see Assessment of the Board's performance, section 5.1.2, p.  171),  the  Board  of  Directors  assessed  its  composition very  positively  in  terms  of  diversity,  complementarity  of sectoral and functional skills concerning knowledge of the\n\nindustry or the Group's business lines (including construction)  as  well  as  innovation/digital  technology, general  management,  strategy,  finance,  governance  and/ or Corporate  Social  Responsibility (see biographies section 5.1.1, p. 158).\n\nThe  Directors  considered  that  it  would  be  desirable  to continue to reduce the age and broaden the international scope of the Board as part of future renewals, particularly those of Committee Chairmen/Chairwomen, over a threeyear  period,  based  on  the  needs  resulting  from  the analysis  of  the  skills  matrix  by  the  Nomination  and Remuneration  Committee  and  the  Board,  particularly  by promoting  the  following  research  areas:  a  serving executive  corporate  officer  or  one  with  such  experience within  other  major  groups,  a  serving  Chief  Financial Officer, a Director from the construction value chain and/ or a Director with climate change skills.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

In accordance  with the law, Mrs. Sibylle DaunisOpfermann,  who  represents  employee  shareholders,  and employee representatives Mrs. Lydie Cortes and Mr.  Philippe  Thibaudet  are  not  counted  when  calculating this  proportion.  If  they  were  included,  the  Board  of Directors would have 50% women.\n\n## Representation of employee shareholders and employees\n\nMrs.  Lydie  Cortes  and  Mr.  Philippe  Thibaudet  were appointed  as  Employee  Directors  by  the  Company's Works Council ( Comit\u00e9 de Groupe ) in accordance with the Company's bylaws. These were amended by the General Shareholders' Meeting of June 7, 2018 to provide for the appointment of two Employee Directors regardless of the size of the Board of Directors, even though, given its size, the  law  only  required  the  appointment  of  one  Employee Director.  This  initiative,  in  anticipation  of  the  Pacte  Law published  in  May  2019,  is  fully  in  line  with  Saint -Gobain's culture of social dialog.\n\n\u00cb\n\nDigital / Innovation\n\nBenoit Bazin, Sibylle Daunis-Opfermann, Thierry Delaporte, Lina Ghotmeh, I\u00eada Gomes Yell, Dominique Leroy\n\nMrs. Sibylle Daunis-Opfermann,  Director  representing employee shareholders, was also appointed in accordance with the law.\n\nThe  Employee  Directors  and  the  Director  representing employee  shareholders  are  members  of  the  Board  of Directors in the same way as the other Directors and have voting rights.  Subject  to  the  laws  applying  specifically  to them, these Directors are subject to all legal and statutory provisions,  have  the  same  rights  and  are  subject  to  the same duties, as fixed, in particular, by the Board's internal rules, as those applicable to the other Directors.\n\nBy  law,  one  member  of  the  Economic  and  Social Committee (Mr. Vincent Cotrel, elected by the members of the  Economic  and  Social  Committee  and  representing employees)  holds  a  seat  on  the  Board  of  Directors  in  a consultative capacity.\n\nThe  Company  bylaws  and  the  Board's  internal  rules provide  that  each  Director  must  hold  a  minimum  of 800 registered shares, with the law exempting employee Directors,  whether  shareholders  or  not,  from  this  type  of obligation.\n\nOn February 1, 2023, all the shares held by the Directors (including  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin)  represented  0.10%  of  the Company's share capital.",

This  procedure specifies in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 the  scope  of  the  agreements  at  issue  as  well  as  a typology  of  the  agreements  that  may  be  considered current  for  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  (excluding agreements  that  may  be  entered  into  with  Directors); and\n- \u00b7 the determination of the persons in charge, within the Corporate  Secretariat,  the  Treasury  and  Financing Department, the Finance Department and the Corporate  Legal  Department,  of  the  classification  of such  agreements  depending  on  the  nature  of  the agreements in question.\n\nIn  2022,  no  agreement  falling  within  the  scope  of  Article L.  225-38  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  concerning related-party  agreements  was  entered  into  between Compagnie de Saint -Gobain and its Directors.\n\n## Re-election of the Board of Directors and changes in its composition\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors may be re-elected in a staggered and balanced fashion as follows:\n\n| Date of expiration of the term of office                                                                                              | Director and date of first election                                                                                                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Upon completion of the General Shareholders' Meeting  approving the financial statements for the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2022 | Dominique Leroy (November 2017) Lina Ghotmeh  (a)  (November 2021)                                                                              |\n| Upon completion of the General Shareholders' Meeting  approving the financial statements for the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2023 | Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli (June 2020) I\u00eada Gomes Yell (June 2016) Jean-Dominique Senard (June 2012)                                                 |\n| Upon completion of the General Shareholders' Meeting  approving the financial statements for the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2024 | Benoit Bazin (June 2021) Sibylle Daunis-Opfermann (March 2020) Pamela Knapp (June 2013) Agn\u00e8s Lemarchand (June 2013) Gilles Schnepp (June 2009) |\n| Upon completion of the General Shareholders' Meeting  approving the financial statements for the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2025 | Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar (June 2006) Thierry Delaporte (June 2021) Lydie Cortes (May 2018)  Philippe Thibaudet (May 2018)                      |\n\nThe  resolutions  concerning  the  terms  of  office  of  Directors  to  be  presented  to  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  of June 8, 2023 will be examined by the Board of Directors at its scheduled meeting in March 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 5 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nComposition and operation of the governing bodies\n\n## 5.1.2 OPERATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n## Governance structure: changes in governance and succession of General Management since July 1, 2021\n\n## Combination of the Chairman of the Board and CEO roles until June 30, 2021\n\nAt its meeting of June 3, 2010, the Board of Directors of Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  resolved  to  recombine  the roles  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  Chief Executive  Officer  by  appointing  Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de Chalendar as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe combination of the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and  Chief  Executive  Officer, which  were separated in June 2007 to ensure a smooth handover of powers from Mr. Jean-Louis Beffa, was decided following the cessation, by application of the age limit set out in the bylaws, of the role of Chairman of the Board of Mr. JeanLouis Beffa, who subsequently became honorary Chairman of  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain,  to  Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de Chalendar.\n\nHaving discussed the matter on numerous occasions since the  combination of the roles,  the  Board  of  Directors  had concluded that  combining  the  two  roles  was  in  the  best interests  of  the  company  as  it  was  well  suited  to Saint -Gobain and to the experience and highly transparent approach of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and it helped  to  ensure  more  responsive  and  efficient corporate governance and strategy implementation.\n\nThe assessment of the Board's work, repeated every year since  2013,  showed  that  almost  all  the  Directors  were satisfied  with  the  combination  of  functions.  The  Board wanted this to be maintained during this period, including, in  2018,  when  the  term  of  office  of  Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar was renewed.\n\n## Changes in Saint -Gobain governance and succession to the Group's General Management on July 1, 2021\n\nIn  line  with  best  corporate  governance  practices,  the Board  of  Directors  of  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  has been working extensively since 2019 under the responsibility  of  the  Lead  independent  Director  and  the Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee,  and  with  the assistance of an independent  recruitment  firm,  on preparing the succession of Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 2010.\n\nAs a result of this process, the Board of Directors deemed it  essential  for  Saint -Gobain  that  there  is  a  seamless transition,  by  separating  the  roles  of  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer.  On  the  recommendation  of  Mr.  PierreAndr\u00e9  de  Chalendar,  the  Board  unanimously  decided  to appoint  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin  as  Chief  Executive  Officer, effective July 1, 2021.\n\nSince  that  date,  Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de  Chalendar  has continued to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors, the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  June  2022  having renewed his  term  of  office  as  Director  and  the  Board  of Directors  of  June  2,  2022  having  reappointed  him  as Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors.  Note,  however,  that Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de  Chalendar  indicated  to  the  Board  of Directors  that  he  would  only  serve  as  Chairman  for  a maximum period of two years, i.e., no later than until the General Shareholders' Meeting of June 2024.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  decided  to  propose  the appointment of Mr. Benoit Bazin as Director of Saint -Gobain to the General Shareholders' Meeting of June 3, 2021, a proposal that was approved.\n\nThis  corporate  governance  formula  is  recognized  as  the best  practice  to  enable  listed  companies  to  ensure  the transition during the necessary period in the context of the succession of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  vested  with  the  broadest authority to act under all circumstances on behalf of the Company  de  Saint -Gobain  within  the  scope  of  its corporate purpose and subject to the limits set by law, the bylaws  and/or  internal  rules  of  the  Board  of  Directors (see section 5.1.3 p. 182 and section 9.1.1 p. 368).\n\nIt should also be emphasized that the balance of power is assured on the Board, guaranteeing compliance with the rules of governance, by:\n\n- \u00b7 the  specific  role  played  in  respect  of  governance matters  and  management  of  conflicts  of  interests  by the  Lead  independent  Director,  a  position  held  by Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Senard,  an  independent  Director (see below);\n- \u00b7 the  ability  of  the  Directors  to  meet  in  the  absence  of the executive corporate officers during or after a Board meeting (see operating rules of the Board of Directors internal rules, section 5.1.2 p. 171 and section 9.1.1 p. 368); and\n- \u00b7 the limitation of the powers of the executive corporate officers regarding all capital expenditures, restructuring, disposals,  acquisitions  and  financial  investment  and divestment projects in individual amounts greater than \u20ac150  million,  and  any  material  transaction  that  fall outside  the  scope  of  the  Saint -Gobain  Group's  stated strategy,  requiring  the  prior  approval  of  the  Board  of Directors (see operating rules of the Board of Directors -  internal  rules,  section  5.1.2  p.  171  and  section  9.1.1 p. 368).\n\n## To this should be added:\n\n- \u00b7 the  role  played  by  all  members  of  the  Board  especially,  but  not  only,  independent  Directors,  who account  for  73%  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  three quarters of members of the Audit and Risk Committee and  100%  of  the  members  of  the  Nomination  and Remuneration Committee, the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee and the Committee Chairpersons  -  all  of  whom  are  extremely  competent and experienced; as well as\n- \u00b7 the  Director  representing  the  main  shareholder  (the Group Savings Plan Funds); and\n- \u00b7 the Employee Directors appointed by the Saint -Gobain Group Works Council in accordance with the Company's bylaws and in application of the law.\n\n## Lead independent Director\n\nThe Board of Directors, taking into account the development of the  practice  within  companies  in  France chaired  by  a  combined  Chairman  of  the  Board/CEO  and the expectations of certain investors expressed during the Company's  dialog  with  them,  created  the  role  of  Lead independent  Director,  a  position  held  by  Mr.  JeanDominique  Senard,  Lead  independent  Director,  since June 8, 2017.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 5 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Thus, each year, the Chief Executive Officer leaves  the  sessions  of  the  Board  and  the Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee  during  such discussions  (deliberations  and  votes)  on  issues  involving the assessment of his performance and the setting of his variable  compensation  (February  sessions),  as  well  as during the Board's assessment, of governance issues, and on  his  long-term  compensation  scheme  (November sessions).  In  November  2021,  a  meeting  of  the  Board  of Directors was held exclusively without the presence of the Chief Executive Officer, as well as in November 2022.\n\nThe Board intends to continue to meet in 2023 without the presence  of  the  executive  corporate  officers  to  discuss governance  issues  more  generally,  beyond  the  issues  of executive corporate officer compensation and the assessment of the Board. This option applies at the start of every meeting of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Prior and permanent information for Directors\n\nAt each meeting, the Board is provided with an analysis of the  Saint -Gobain group's operating income and net debt situation, prepared as of the end of the month preceding the meeting.\n\nBetween  meetings,  the  Directors  receive  copies  of  all press releases issued by Compagnie de Saint -Gobain and,\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nComposition and operation of the governing bodies\n\nas the case may be, any relevant information about events or transactions that are material for Saint -Gobain. They are entitled  to  request  any  other  documents  they  consider necessary to make an informed contribution to the Board's discussions; requests are put to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, who may submit the request to the Board for a decision.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Lead independent Director ensure that the Directors receive the information  they  need  to  perform  their  duties  under  the best possible conditions.\n\n## Directors' duties\n\nThe  internal  rules  stipulate  the  duties  of  Directors, specifically  with  regard  to  stock  trading  ethics  (status  of occasional  insider,  closed  periods,  reporting  of  trades involving  Saint -Gobain  securities  and  the  obligation  to hold  their  Saint -Gobain  shares  in  registered  form),  with regard to confidentiality and the management of potential conflicts of interest.\n\n## Other provisions in the internal rules\n\nFinally, the internal rules provide for the distribution of the annual  amount  allocated  by  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting  as  compensation  for  the  work  of  the  Directors and  the  right  of  Directors  to  additional  training  on  the specific activities of the Saint -Gobain group, its businesses, business lines, and Corporate Social Responsibility challenges (section 9.1.1, p. 368).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 5 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

In addition, during each of these meetings, including a fullday seminar dedicated to the presentation of the Group's strategy,  the  Board  reviewed  and  approved  the  Group's strategic  orientations  or  examined  its  pipeline  M&A  or  a specific aspect of the strategy such as:\n\n\u00cb\n\n- \u00b7 comparison with the main competitors;\n- \u00b7 the  position  of  a  business  or  a  region  after  having heard,  if  relevant,  an  operational  manager  from  the relevant business lines or regions;\n- \u00b7 a  presentation  of  the  Innovation,  Digital  or  Net  Zero Carbon roadmaps.\n\nThe  Board  also  examined  the  proposed  disposals,  in particular  the  disposal  of  its  distribution  activity  in  the United Kingdom (see section 2.3.7, p. 68). It also reviewed proposed acquisitions, including Kaycan (see section 2.3.7, p. 68).",

        "page_content": "In addition, it examined  the  Group's  geographical exposure,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  war  in  Ukraine and its consequences. Furthermore it looked at the issue of  the  Group's  exposure  to  China,  in  particular  given  the disruption caused by Covid.\n\nThe  Board  also  monitored  the  progress  of  the  Group's cost  reduction  and  operational  excellence  measures  year on year.\n\n## Financial management\n\nPursuant to its legal competency, the Board approved the annual  and  consolidated  financial  statements,  and  the interim  consolidated  financial  statements,  as  well  as  the various reports relating to them, after hearing the opinions of the Chairwoman of the Audit and Risk Committee and the Statutory Auditors. The Board also approved the draft resolutions submitted to the General Shareholders' Meeting  of  June  2,  2022,  in  particular  the  proposed dividend  distribution,  and  the  reports  made  available  to shareholders, and convened the meetings of shareholders and holders of Titres Participatifs. It approved the report on payments made to Governments (extractive industries).\n\nIt approved  the  budget  of  the  Saint -Gobain  group presented  by  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin,  the  various  provisional management reports and documents, renewed the annual authorizations  granted  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  to issue bonds, sureties, and guarantees. It also reviewed the procedure  applicable  to  the  current  agreements  entered into under normal terms and conditions and examined the related-party  agreements  entered  into  during  previous fiscal  years,  the  execution  of  which  was  ongoing  during fiscal year 2022.\n\nIt  approved  the  implementation  of  the  Company's  share buyback program.\n\n## Internal control and risk management\n\nThe Board of Directors undertakes an annual review of the internal  control  and  risk  management  processes  in  force within  the  Group,  following  analysis  of  the  mapping  of major financial and non-financial risks updated in 2022 by the  Audit  and  Internal  Control  Department,  and  after hearing  the  report  of  the  Chairwoman  of  the  Audit  and Risk Committee on these topics.\n\nIn particular, the  Board  of  Directors  examines  and monitors  the  continued  roll-out  of  the  cyber  plan regarding the cybersecurity of the Saint -Gobain group and of  the  post-audit  monitoring  plan.  It  was  decided  to implement,  following  the  2017  NotPetya  cyberattack,  an annual  monitoring  plan  and  a  general  external  audit  of Saint -Gobain  Group's  IT  at  the  request  of  the  Audit  and Risk  Committee.  This  audit  was  conducted  annually  over the period 2018-2021. In 2022, sufficient progress had been made  in  order  to  move  to  a  permanent  and  automated control system. In this context, audits will now be carried out  every  two  years,  with  the  next  audit  taking  place  at the  beginning  of  2023.  In  addition  to  external  audits, Saint -Gobain  has  obtained  certifications  at  the  level  of some  of  its  activities  or  factories  (SOC2  certification  for GCP,  TISAX  certification  for  several  High  Performance Solutions factories).\n\nIt was also informed of the compliance program.\n\nIn addition, it examined  the  Group's  geographical exposure (see above).\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nComposition and operation of the governing bodies\n\nOn  several  occasions,  it  reviewed  the  position  of  the Company  and  Group  with  regard  to  certain  risks (especially  energy  risk),  procedures,  litigation  (notably  in relation to asbestos, competition, the Grenfell Tower fire in the  United  Kingdom,  and  PFOA)  and  the  evolving regulatory environment.\n\nFinally,  the  Board  of  Directors  reviewed  the  services assigned  to  the  Statutory  Auditors  and  their  network  as authorized by the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility/Climate change\n\nOver five sessions, one point on the agenda was dedicated to Corporate Social Responsibility matters, more specifically the following topics:\n\n- \u00b7 'Solutions for Growth', a program that analyzes all the products  and  services  offered  by  the  Group  and quantifies  their  ability  to  provide  customers  with performance and sustainability benefits;\n- \u00b7 non-financial information;\n- \u00b7 CO2  roadmap  and  environmental  strategy  in  line  with the objectives for 2030, validated by the Science-Based Targets  Initiative  contributing  to  carbon  neutrality by 2050,  with  many  levers  including  product  weight reduction, World Class Manufacturing (WCM), circularity,  innovation,  improvements to processes and the use of decarbonized energy (see section 3.1.3 p. 76 and section 3.3 p. 100);\n- \u00b7 responsible  purchasing  with  particular  attention  to scope  3  in  order  to  align  the  value  chain  and  CO2 objectives;\n- \u00b7 review  of  the  compliance  program  (competition, embargoes, anti-corruption) (see section 3.1.5, p. 86);\n- \u00b7 the human resources policy (see section 3.2.2 p. 91 and below)  and  in  particular,  the  non-discrimination  and diversity policies both at Group level and for the Senior Management.  With  regard  to  gender  diversity,  the Board  of  Directors  has  noted  the  progress  made  and new measures were adopted in 2020 and 2022, on the proposal  of  the  General  Management,  setting  gender diversity  targets  within  the  management  bodies  of Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  and  its  subsidiaries  by 2025:  namely  30%  women  executives,  25%  of  women Senior  managers,  30%  of  women  on  the  Executive Committee of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain, and on the Executive Committees of the Business Units, and 40% of women overall on the boards of the Business Units. To achieve these targets, it was decided to require that at least 40% of new hires be women and require gender diversity  among  spokespersons.  The  monitoring  of these objectives was discussed at the Board meeting of November 2022;\n- \u00b7 presentation  of  the  results  of  the  me@Saint -Gobain 2022  survey,  a  tool  for  assessing  and  managing  the Group's transformation, with more  than  125,000 employees responding to this survey in 75 countries;\n- \u00b7 various actions in favor of inclusions, such as solidarity actions  facing  emergency  situations  (war  in  Ukraine), the  implementation  within  the  Group  of  diversity  and inclusion programs with the objective of considering all types  of  potential  discrimination  (gender,  disability, social and ethnic origins, etc.), and the development of training  in  construction  trades  with  multiple  societal and  inclusive  actions  and  operations  adapted  to  the challenges, local needs and cultures.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 5 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nComposition and operation of the governing bodies\n\nIn April 2022, the Directors took part in training organized specifically for them by the group, entitled 'The City of the Future'.  On  this  occasion,  external  experts,  recognized internationally and with complementary  skills gave presentations to the Directors and discussed the following subjects with them:\n\n- \u00b7 major trends for the city of the future;\n- \u00b7 city  and  building  design  -  weather  architecture  healthy architecture; and\n- \u00b7 the transformation of large urban areas facing climate change.\n\nThe purpose of this seminar was to give each Director a better  understanding  of  the  challenges  related  to  urban development  in  the  world  of  the  future  for  the Saint -Gobain Group and the consequences for its strategy.\n\nIt is recalled  that  the  Directors  had  participated  in seminars in February 2018, April 2019, April 2020 and April 2021  devoted,  respectively  to  climate  change  and  its consequences for companies, the circular economy and its challenges  for  companies,  the  transformation  of  energy and  industrial  systems  in  a  zero-carbon  economy,  and biodiversity.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance  Code  for  listed  companies  and  under  the supervision  of  the  Lead  independent  Director,  the  Board formally conducted the annual assessment of its operations,  with  the  help  of  a  specialist  consulting  firm, and discussed the results of this assessment (see assessment of the Board's performance, section 5.1.2, p. 171).\n\nIt  satisfied  itself  that  a  succession  plan  for  the  Chief Executive  Officer,  in  the  event  of  an  unforeseeable vacancy, exists and has been implemented.\n\nThe  Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee  initiated discussions  and  work  on  the  Company's  governance,  as the  terms  of  office  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de  Chalendar  and  that  of  the  Lead independent  Director  Jean-Dominique  Senard  will  expire in June 2024.\n\nThe Board of Directors reviewed the situation of Director independence.  At  the  proposal  of  the  Nomination  and Remuneration Committee, it also discussed changes in its size and composition due to the expiration of the terms of office of certain Directors.\n\nLastly, it  ruled on the training program for the Employee Directors.\n\n## Compensation of corporate officers and long-term incentives for executive corporate officers and employees\n\nAt its meeting of February 24, 2022, the Board approved the general principles of the executive corporate officer's compensation policy (i.e., the one of the Chairman of the Board  of  Directors,  and  the  one  for  the  Chief  Executive Officer), for 2022 and, at its meeting of February 23, 2023, for 2023 (see section 5.2.1, p. 183).\n\n\u00cb\n\nIn particular,  it  reviewed  and  approved  the  various components  of  the  compensation  of  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin (fixed portion, variable portion and long-term compensation instruments) and the respective balance of those various components.\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  November  24,  2022,  the  Board  also decided to implement and approve the main characteristics of the 2022 performance share plan and set the  performance  criteria  of  that  plan  that  may  benefit executive  corporate  officers  and  certain  categories  of employees (see section 5.2.4, p. 209).\n\nAs  part  of  the  ongoing  development  of  employee shareholders,  the  Board  resolved  to  again  offer  its employees  and  former  employees  the  opportunity  to subscribe  to,  under  certain  conditions,  a  share  capital increase reserved for them in 2023, up to a maximum of approximately 8.1 million shares, i.e., approximately 1.6% of the share capital (see section 7.1.6, p. 253).\n\n## Principal activities of the Committees during fiscal year 2022\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has three Committees designed to facilitate its functioning  and  contribute  effectively  to  the  preparation of  its  deliberations:  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee,  the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee  and  the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee.\n\nThese Committees do not have their own decision-making authority  (barring  specific  provision  otherwise  provided for  by  the  internal  rules  of  the  Board  of  Directors  as regards  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee's  approval  of services other than the certification of accounts assigned to  the  Statutory  Auditors),  and  report  to  the  Board regarding their activities, conclusions, and proposals.\n\nThe Board's internal rules incorporate the rules governing the composition, prerogatives, and responsibilities of each Committee, as described below.\n\nThe activities of these three Committees during fiscal year 2022 were regularly presented to the Board in the form of activity reports and proposals.\n\n## Composition of Committees\n\nThe  Board's  practice  is  to  allow  some  time  for  all  new Directors  to  adapt  before  proposing  them  to  join  a Committee,  since  active  participation  on  a  Committee requires  familiarity  with  the  operation  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  the  ability  to  understand  the  major challenges with which the Company is faced.\n\nAt the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  thus considers,  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  the  opportunity  to propose to Directors their participation in one of the three Committees,  depending  upon  the  most  appropriate schedule. Further, in its examination of the composition of the  Committees  and  appointment  of  new  Directors  to these Committees, the Board ensures compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code with regard to  the  proportion  of  independent  Directors  on  these Committees.",

In the event that several Board or Committee meetings  are  held  on  the  same  day,  this  sum  is  paid only once (new);\n- \u00b7 the  amounts  granted  in  respect  of  the  fixed  base amount  are  pro-rated  when  terms  of  office  begin  or end during the course of a fiscal year (unchanged);\n- \u00b7 the compensation is paid in two half-yearly installments in  arrears,  with  any  balance  available  from  the  annual amount  distributed  at  the  beginning  of  the  next  year based  on  the  variable  portions  allocated  to  each Director  (excluding  additional  amounts  to  take  into account the business trip of Directors residing outside France)  for  each  Director's  or  Committee  member's attendance rate at the prior year's Board or Committee meetings (unchanged).\n\nThe  variable portion represents the bulk of their compensation if Directors consistently attend both Board and Committee meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 5 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

They also ensure that it evolves taking into account the Group's performance and market practices.\n\nThe  compensation  package  of  the  executive  corporate officers  is  determined  by  taking  into  account  all  pay components (fixed compensation, annual variable compensation, long-term incentives,  severance  indemnity and pension benefits), with a view to achieving a balanced mix of these components.\n\nWhen setting the various components of the compensation  of  the  executive  corporate  officers,  the Board  of  Directors  also  takes  into  consideration  the benchmarks of CAC 40 industrial companies comparable to Saint-Gobain in terms of revenue, workforce and market capitalization.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  seeks  to  ensure  that  the granting  of  long-term  compensation  instruments  (stock options, performance shares and performance units, as the case may be) to the executive corporate officers in a given fiscal year does not represent a disproportionate share of their maximum total compensation in respect of that fiscal year  and  has  conditioned  these  grants  to  demanding ceiling and holding rules.\n\n## Compensation and benefits allocated to the executive corporate officers\n\n## Summary of the compensation and benefits paid or granted to the executive corporate officers for the 2022 fiscal year\n\nIn accordance with the principles set out above, the Board of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  of  February  24,  2022, approved,  on  the  proposal  of  the  Nomination  and Remuneration  Committee,  the  compensation  policies  for the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Chief Executive Officer for the fiscal year 2022.\n\nThese policies were approved by the General Shareholders'  Meeting  of  June  2,  2022  (twelfth  and thirteenth resolutions).\n\nThe following tables present a summary  of  the compensation,  performance  shares  and  stock  options granted to Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar, Chairman of the Board  of  Directors  from  July  1,  2021,  and  to  Mr.  Benoit Bazin,  Chief  Executive  Officer  from  July  1,  2021,  for  the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.

The  Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee  had  noted  in  2021,  with  the  assistance  of  an external  firm,  that  this  level  was  below  the  median  of compensation paid to non-executive Chairmen of CAC 40 companies who previously held the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (excluding financial companies).\n\n## Fixed compensation of Mr. Benoit Bazin, Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn accordance with the compensation policy approved by the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  June  2,  2022, Mr. Benoit  Bazin's  fixed  compensation  was  set  at \u20ac1,000,000 for 2022, with no increase since 2021, when he took  office  as  Chief  Executive  Officer,  and  even  though the  Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee  found  in 2022,  with  the  help  of  an  external  firm,  that  this  level  is lower  than  the  median  of  CAC  40  industrial  companies comparable  to  Saint-Gobain  in  terms  of  size:  revenue, workforce or market capitalization.\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nThis component of compensation rewards the contribution of the Chief Executive Officer to the Group's results  over  the  past  fiscal  year.  It  is  expressed  as  a percentage of the annual fixed compensation.\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  February  24,  2022,  on  the  proposal  of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board decided, for fiscal year 2022, to set the cap for the annual variable portion of the compensation of Mr. Benoit Bazin, as Chief Executive Officer, at 170% of the fixed portion of his compensation.\n\nFurthermore,  at  its  meeting  of  February  24,  2022,  the Board determined, on the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the components and objectives of the variable compensation of Mr. Benoit Bazin as Chief Executive  Officer  for  2022  (structure  unchanged  since 2019):\n\n- \u00b7 a  quantitative  portion  of  2/3,  based  on  the  following four  objectives,  adapted  to  the  Group's  strategy  by reverting  to  a  weighting  of  25%  of  each  of  the  four quantifiable objectives, depending  on  the  policy prevailing before the start of the Covid-19 crisis:\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nCompensation of the management and governing bodies\n\n- -ROCE (Return on Capital Employed),\n- -the Group's operating income, and\n- -Group recurring net income per share;\n\nThe objectives  for  the  above  quantifiable  criteria  are  not disclosed for confidentiality reasons.\n\nGiven the volatility of the environment in which the Group operates,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  forecast  each indicator,  the  Board  of  Directors,  after  consulting  the Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee,  has  reserved the  right  to  apply  an  'outperformance'  mechanism  that would  make  it  possible  to  partially  compensate  for  the non-achievement  of  quantifiable  objectives  on  certain criteria by an exceptional outperformance on others. In the event  of  outperformance  on  one  or  more  of  the  four criteria beyond the maximum, it is possible to reach up to 20%  of  the  bonus  share  relating  to  the  outperforming criterion/criteria,  in  the  event  of  achievement  above  the maximum and up to 120% of the maximum, with linearity between 0 and 120% (which leads, for example, to 10% of the  bonus  share  relating  to  a  criterion  in  the  event  of achievement  of  up  to  110%  of  the  maximum),  it  being specified  that  the  sum  of  the  four  components  may  not exceed 113% (3) of  the  fixed  portion.  Thus,  in  the  extreme case  of  outperformance  of  more  than  20%  of  the maximum on three criteria and performance equal to zero on  the  fourth,  the  quantifiable  portion  of  the  annual variable will be equal to 102% of the fixed portion (which responds to the concern that the maximum of 113% of the fixed  portion  cannot be reached when one criterion is at zero). In 2022, this mechanism was not applied.\n\n- \u00b7 a qualitative portion of 1/3, based on the following three objectives:\n- -Objective  1:  deployment  of  the  Grow  &  Impact strategic  plan  in  its  6  action  priorities  (1  -  Position ourselves in high-growth markets, 2 - Be solutionsoriented,  combining performance and sustainability, 3  -  Drive  growth  through  customer  innovation  and the  power  of  data,  4  -  Embed  Corporate  Social Responsibility  in  our  decisions  and  actions,  5  Strengthen  our  'TEC'  culture  (trust,  empowerment and  collaboration),  6  -  Have  the  best  teams  in  a diverse and inclusive work environment);\n- -Objective  2:  successful  integration  of  Chryso  and GCP  and  continued  optimization  of  the  Group's scope (acquisitions and disposals);\n- -Objective 3: implementation of the corporate social responsibility policy (including safety, social, environmental and compliance).\n- -the  'FCF'  (Free  Cash  Flow),  which  is  an  indicator published  and  monitored  by  investors  and  which replaces the 'OFCF' objective (Operating Free Cash Flow), which is an internal indicator,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 5 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Position ourselves in high-growth markets, 2 -Be solutions-oriented, combining  performance  and  sustainability,  3  -  Drive growth through customer innovation and the power of data, 4 - Embed Corporate Social Responsibility in our decisions and actions, 5 - Strengthen our 'TEC' (Trust, Empowerment and Collaboration) culture, 6 - Have the best teams in a diverse and inclusive work environment)  the  Group's  actions  are  described  in section  2.3,  p.  57.  The  Board  of  Directors  noted  in particular:\n- -the  pursuit  of  the  allocation  of  Group  resources  to high-growth markets as a priority (notably, geographical rebalancing, acquisitions in the construction chemicals sector);\n- -deployment of the 'Solutions' approach in the main European countries (see section 2.3.2, p. 57);\n- -the  identification  of  major  innovation  priorities,  the acceleration of innovation in net zero-carbon processes, the launch of the world's first commercial offering  of  low-carbon  glass,  and  the  development of  digital  and  IT  initiatives  with  the  pursuit  of  the implementation  of  common  platforms  within  the Group and the intensification of IT projects linked to the CO2 roadmap;\n- -the inclusion of the CSR roadmap in the budgets, the inclusion  of  CSR  criteria  in  bonuses,  the  training  of employees  (in  particular  the  deployment  of  the Climate  Fresque  and  the  Climate  Academy),  the creation  and  management  of  the  COMEX  CSR Committee;\n\n\u00cb\n\n- -the implementation of various TEC actions (creation of  a  360\u00b0  evaluation,  specific  training  program 'Grow  your  impact  as  a  TEC  leader')  (see section 2.3.6 B, p. 66); and\n- -the continuing increase in the proportion of women in  the  organization  (see  section  2.3.6  A,  p.  65)  and the  development  of  numerous  local  initiatives  on inclusion.\n- \u00b7 concerning  successful  integration  of  Chryso  and  GCP and  continued  optimization  of  the  Group's  scope, especially:\n- -numerous  growth  synergies  between  Chryso  and Saint-Gobain;  the  completion  of  acquisitions  by Chryso  with  the  support  of  Saint-Gobain  and  the gradual integration of Chryso's development projects with those of Saint-Gobain (the strengthening  of  the  partnership  between  Ecocem and  Saint-Gobain,  including  Point.P,  Weber,  and Chryso);\n- -the  fast  completion  of  the  acquisition  of  GCP Applied  Technologies  in  September  2022  and  the very  active  integration  (weekly  follow-ups  in  2022 and  very  good  collaboration  between  the  teams); and\n- -the very active pursuit of optimization of the Group's profile, including (i) 20 signed or closed divestments for 3.8 billion in divested revenues, and (ii) 44 signed or  closed  acquisitions  for  1.9  billion  in  acquired revenues, of which 55% in North America (including Kaycan  in  Canada),  23%  in  Asia,  and  61%  in construction chemicals, as detailed in section 2.3.7 B, p. 68.\n- \u00b7 concerning  implementation  of  the  Corporate  Social Responsibility policy:\n- -in  terms  of  safety,  the  frequency  rate  of  accidents with  and  without  stoppage  (TF2)  fell  by  19% between 2021 and 2022 and has been almost halved in the last five years. Once again this year, efforts to raise awareness,  regularly  and  in  response  to accidents have been implemented;",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nCompensation of the management and governing bodies\n\nChief Executive Officer's maximum gross total compensation  for  the  2022  fiscal  year  (fixed  plus maximum  annual  variable  for  the  2022  fiscal  year  or  a value of \u20ac2,700,000).\n\nIn  2022,  the  performance  shares  allocated  to  Mr.  Benoit Bazin  amounted  to  a  total  value  (according  to  IFRS),  at the  time  of  their  grant,  of  \u20ac1,919,924,  corresponding  to 71.1%  of  his  maximum  gross  total  compensation  for  the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nNo stock option or performance unit plan was implemented in 2022.\n\n## Grant cap to the Chief Executive Officer in relation to the overall grant\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  decided,  during  its  meeting  of February  24,  2022,  as  in  previous  years,  that  the  Chief Executive Officer could not receive more than 10% of the overall grants of performance shares under the long-term compensation plan to be set up in 2022.\n\n## Hedging rules\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  formally  committed  not  to hedge  his  risk  either  on  stock  options  or  on  shares resulting from the exercise of stock options, on performance shares or on performance units he has been or  will  be  granted  during  his  term  of  office  as  executive corporate officer, until the cessation of his duties. To the Company's knowledge, the executive corporate officer has not hedged his risk.\n\n## Closed periods\n\nIn  their  capacity  as  executive  corporate  officers  and  by virtue  of  the  applicable  regulations  as  reminded  in  the Board's  internal rules (see section 9.1.1.B, p. 370), Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar and Mr. Benoit Bazin must refrain from carrying out any transactions on Saint-Gobain securities  for  30  days  prior  to  Board  meetings  during which  the  annual  consolidated  financial  statements  and the half-year consolidated financial statements are examined,  for  15  days  prior  to  the  release  of  quarterly consolidated sales and on the day following the release of the full and half-year results. Outside of these periods, they are also required, as are the other Directors, to abide by the provisions on the prevention of insider trading.\n\n## Stock options\n\nThe tables below present the stock options exercised by the  executive  corporate  officers  during  the  2022  fiscal year.\n\nNo stock option plan was implemented in 2022.\n\n- -in  terms  of  diversity:  increase  in  the  gender  mix  in management bodies, both locally and at Group level. Continued  increase  in  the  proportion  of  women managers: 27.4% in 2022, in line with the objective of 30% of women senior managers by 2025;\n- -in  terms  of  team  commitment  and  satisfaction:  the results of the me@Saint-Gobain survey are excellent, with  an  increase  in  all  indicators  compared  to  2021 (see section 3.2.3.E p. 97);\n- -on the environment: deployment of the Group's CO2 emissions  roadmap  ('scopes'  1  and  2),  with  a  27% reduction in emissions since 2017 and a 5% reduction since  2021,  in  line  with  the  Group's  2030  roadmap. Saint-Gobain  has  also  signed  renewable  electricity purchase  contracts  in  many  countries.  In  addition, the  indicators  for  non-recycled  waste  and  water withdrawal are improving. Lastly, the Group's agency ratings have improved or been maintained;\n- -regarding  compliance:  a  very  high  percentage  of training is followed and the anti-corruption system is adapted to the new recommendations of the French Anti-Corruption Agency.\n\n## In total, for the fiscal year 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 pursuant to the compensation policy approved by the General  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  June  2,  2022,  the compensation of Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar was set at \u20ac450,000 gross per annum for the entire duration of his term of office as Chairman of the Board of Directors. The  Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee  had noted  in  2021,  with  the  assistance  of  an  external  firm, that this level was below the median of compensation paid to non-executive Chairmen of CAC 40 companies who previously held the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (excluding financial companies);\n- \u00b7 Mr.  Benoit  Bazin's  total  compensation  (fixed  and variable)  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  amounted  to \u20ac2,700,000. This compensation is an increase of 0.5% compared to that of Mr. Benoit Bazin in 2021 as Chief Executive Officer calculated on an annualized basis.\n\n## Long-term compensation policy\n\n## Grant cap in relation to the total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn addition to the restrictions set out below, the Board of Directors  resolved,  in  accordance  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code,  that  the  long-term  compensation  instruments  that would be allocated in 2022 to Mr. Benoit Bazin could not represent,  at  the  time  of  their  allocation,  a  valuation (according  to  IFRS  standards)  greater  than  100%  of  the\n\nTABLE 4 - STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2022 TO THE EXECUTIVE CORPORATE OFFICERS (AMF NOMENCLATURE)\n\n| Name of the Executive corporate officer                         | Plan date   | Type of  options  (subscription  or purchase)   | Value (based on  method used to  prepare the  consolidated financial  statements)   | Number of  options granted  during the fiscal  year   | Exercise  price   | Exercise period   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar,  Chairman of the Board of  Directors | N/A         | N/A                                             | N/A                                                                                 | N/A                                                   | N/A               | N/A               |\n| Benoit Bazin, Chief  Executive Officer                          | N/A         | N/A                                             | N/A                                                                                 | N/A                                                   | N/A               | N/A               |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

However,  this  holding  obligation  will  cease  to apply if and when the total number of Saint-Gobain shares that  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  personally  holds  in registered form-at the date of delivery of the performance  shares-represents  the  equivalent  of  three years of gross fixed compensation (based on the average opening  prices  quoted  for  Saint-Gobain  shares  in  the\n\n\u00cb\n\n20  trading  days  preceding  the  delivery  date  of  the performance  shares  and  the  amount  of  the  gross  fixed compensation applicable at that time).\n\n## Performance units\n\nNo performance unit plans were set up during fiscal year 2022 and there are no longer any performance unit plans being vested (see section 5.2.4, p. 209). No performance units therefore became exercisable during fiscal year 2022.",

Indeed,  the  pension  rights  vested  annually  in  the  2012/2  Plan  reduce the frozen rights in the 2012 Plan by the same proportion and are capped so  that, when combined as the case may be with the frozen rights of the 2012 Plan, they  do not allow the receipt of a benefit greater than that which could have resulted from |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

the  amount  of  other  defined-benefit  supplementary  pensions received. Thus, the annual pension vested by beneficiaries of the 2012 Plan  under  another  defined-benefit  plan,  such  as  the  2012/2  Plan,  reduces  the  annual                                                                                    |\n|                                                                                    |       | as from that date.

The compensation components and the methodology selected are shown below.\n\n## France scope\n\nThe France scope includes all employees  of  the consolidated subsidiaries of Saint-Gobain Group incorporated in France, on a full-time equivalent basis, and any  changes  thereto  (excluding  executive  corporate officers). Data on the median compensation of employees in the France scope are available for 2020 and 2021. The median  compensation  ratio  (France  scope)  is  therefore presented from 2020 onwards.\n\nThe  France  scope  is  homogeneous  in  terms  of  salary structure  and  the  type  of  contracts  taken  into  account, and  is  not  subject  to  exchange  rate  fluctuations,  which allows a better comparability over time. The workforce in France represented nearly 22.9% of the Group's workforce at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Compensation components used\n\nFor executive corporate officers: all compensation components paid or awarded during or for the fiscal year in question,  submitted  to  the  vote  of  the  General Shareholders' Meeting (ex post Say-on-Pay) (6) , namely:\n\n- \u00b7 the  fixed  compensation  paid  during  the  given  fiscal year;\n- \u00b7 the annual variable compensation granted in respect of the same fiscal year;\n- \u00b7 any  exceptional  compensation  paid  during  the  same fiscal year;\n- \u00b7 long-term  compensation  instruments  granted  during the same fiscal year (stock options, performance shares and/or performance units) at IFRS value on the grant date;\n- \u00b7 benefits in kind (company car) granted during the same fiscal year (book value);\n- \u00b7 it  being specified that executive corporate officers are not  granted  any  compensation  in  respect  of  their Directors' term of office within the Saint-Gobain Group.\n\nThe difference between the ratios on Compagnie de SaintGobain's average compensation and on average compensation in France is mainly due to the distribution structure of the employees in the scopes concerned: thus, while in 2022, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain comprised 83% of  managers  (including  all  members  of  the  Executive Committee of the Saint-Gobain Group except those based in a foreign country) and 17% of administrative employees, the France scope comprised 24.7% of managers, 52.3% of administrative employees and 23% of blue-collar workers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

The  employees who have entered into a part-time employment contract with  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  or  a  consolidated subsidiary of the Saint-Gobain Group registered in France were  not  taken  into  account  when  calculating  the  ratios but  represent  less  than  3%  of  the  workforce  for  the considered scope.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Concept of full-time equivalent\n\nTo determine the average and median compensation paid to  employees  of  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  and  the consolidated  subsidiaries  of  the  Saint-Gobain  Group registered  in  France  on  a  full-time  equivalent  basis,  the methodologies already in use within the Group for social reporting  reviewed  by  the  independent  third  party  in charge  of  reviewing  non-financial  information  were  used (see section 9.2.1, p. 375).\n\n## Changes in scope\n\nWithin  the  French  scope,  the  consolidated  subsidiaries sold during a given fiscal year are excluded from the ratios calculations  of  that  fiscal  year.  The  acquired  companies which  were  in  the  process  of  being  consolidated  on December  31,  2022  are  excluded  from  the  ratios calculations,  but  represent  less  than  3%  of  the  total number of employees of the consolidated subsidiaries of the Saint-Gobain Group registered in France.\n\n## Effect of Covid-19 on the calculation of compensation ratios in 2019 and 2020\n\nOn  the  proposition  of  the  corporate  executives  officers concerned,  the  compensation  of  executive  corporate officers for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 taken into account for the calculation of the compensation ratios for 2019 and 2020  were  impacted  by  the  reductions  of  25%  of  their fixed  compensation  for  2020  and  25%  of  their  variable compensation for 2019 (see chapter 5, section 2.2.2 of the Company's 2020 Universal Registration Document) decided by the Board of Directors for as long as the SaintGobain  Group's  employees  were  subject  to  partial employment  in  the  context  of  the  emergency  measures taken by the French Government to halt the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nCompensation  paid  by  the  French  State  in  2020  to employees  of  Saint-Gobain  Group  entities  subject  to partial  employment  in  the  context  of  the  emergency measures  taken  by  the  French  Government  to  halt  the spread  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic  are  taken  into  account for  the  purposes  of  calculating  compensation  ratios  for 2020 as if that compensation had been paid by the SaintGobain Group.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nCompensation of the management and governing bodies\n\n## 5.2.3 COMPENSATION OF MEMBERS OF THE GROUP'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT\n\nCompensation  paid  to  members  of  the  Group's  Senior Management is set at a level consistent with compensation packages offered by comparable groups. It is determined and reviewed, among other things, based on the results of specific surveys from specialized consultants commissioned  by  Group's  Senior  Management.  They include, in addition to a fixed portion, a reasonable variable portion in relation to the total compensation, the purpose of  which  is  to  reflect  the  CEO's  personal  contribution  to the  results  and  development  of  the  scope,  taking  into account  three  financial  indicators:  cash  flow  generation, operating  margin  relative  to  turnover,  and  Return  on Capital Employed ('ROCE'), qualitative objectives and the results concerning occupational health and safety and CO2 emissions.\n\nThis principle is applied to the whole of middle and senior management.\n\nIn this way, management compensation is clearly linked to performance  and  to  the  achievement  of  objectives  that promotes  a  high  level  of  personal  commitment.  Each manager's  compensation  can  fluctuate  significantly  from one year to the next, based on the results achieved.\n\nTotal  gross  compensation  received  in  2022  from  the Group's French and foreign companies by members of the Executive Committee as composed at December 31, 2022 (excluding the executive corporate officers and excluding long-term compensation components), amounted to \u20ac12.9 million (versus \u20ac10.8 million in 2021), including \u20ac4.4 million (versus \u20ac3.7 million in 2021) gross variable compensation in  respect  of  2022,  an  increase  compared  to  the  gross variable  compensation  in  respect  of  2021.  No  severance payments  were  made  to  members  of  the  Executive Committee as composed on December 31, 2022 (same as in 2021).\n\nPensions  and  other  post-employment  benefits  (DefinedBenefit Obligations in respect of length-of-service awards and pensions) accruing to the members of the Executive Committee as composed at December 31, 2022 (including the  Chief  Executive  Officer)  totaled  \u20ac29.2  million  at December 31, 2022 (versus \u20ac31.0 million at December 31, 2021) (see Note  6.2  of  the  consolidated  financial statements, section 8.1).\n\nCompensation  allocated  to  Directors  representing  the Group (particularly members of Group's Senior Management) in Group companies other than Compagnie de  Saint-Gobain  are  either  reverted  to  their  employer company, or paid directly to that company.\n\n## 5.2.4 LONG-TERM COMPENSATION PLANS (PERFORMANCE SHARES, STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE UNITS)\n\n## Attribution policy\n\nThe  objective  of  the  Group's  long-term  compensation policy  is  to  retain  and  motivate  the  Group's  Senior Management,  officers  and  employees,  and  to  associate them with the Group's performance, in particular through conditional  allocations  of  performance  shares,  stock options or performance units to reflect their fulfillment of the Group's long-term strategy.\n\nAt the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors authorizes  the  features  of  the  performance  share  and stock  option  plans,  as  well  as  the  identity  of  the beneficiaries. These  plans  are  subject  to  a  service condition  and  to  the  strict  internal  and/or  relative performance  criteria  set  by  the  Board  (see  below  for details of each allocation).\n\nIn  2022,  it  was  decided,  as  in  2021,  to  only  implement  a performance share plan. This plan applied to 2,671 of the Group's  managers  and  officers,  in  France  and  overseas: managers  with  outstanding  performance  and  highpotential  managers  (2,540),  the  main  functional  and operational  heads  of  the  Entities  and  Regions  (116), Executive  Committee  (15,  excluding  the  Chief  Executive Officer). Grants to the Chief Executive Officer are detailed in the paragraph 'Long-term compensation policy' in this section 5.2.2, p. 185\n\nThe  beneficiaries  of  this  plan  are  of  59  different nationalities and work in 67 countries.\n\nThe  performance  share  plan  entitles  beneficiaries  to existing  shares  and  therefore  has  no  impact  in  terms  of dilution. No stock option or performance unit plan was set up during fiscal year 2022.\n\nThe  other  instruments  designed  to  associate  employees with business results are presented in section 7.1.6 p. 253 and section 3.2.3 A, p. 94.\n\n## Performance share plans\n\nPerformance share plans have been set up by the Board of Directors every year since 2009.\n\nUnder  the  authorization  granted  by  the  eighteenth resolution of the General Shareholders' Meeting of June 2, 2022, at its meeting of November 24, 2022 the Board of Directors resolved to implement a performance share plan, following analysis and  the  recommendation  of  the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThis plan covers 2,672 managers and officers of the Group in  France  and  abroad,  who  were  granted  a  total  of 1,232,792  performance  shares  (including  the  grant  to  the Chief Executive Officer).\n\nIt should be noted that, as in 2021, no stock option plans or performance  units  were  put  in  place  in  2022,  as  all beneficiaries received performance shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 5 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nCompensation of the management and governing bodies\n\nThe duration of the vesting period was set at four years, with delivery of the shares to occur on the fourth day after the close of this period.\n\nThe  performance  criteria  applicable  to  the  performance share plan implemented on November 24, 2022, applicable for  both  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group's managers and officers, include, as has been the case since 2015,  an  internal  performance  condition  linked  to  SaintGobain  Group's  Return  on  Capital  Employed,  including goodwill,  and  a  performance  condition  linked  to  the performance of the Saint-Gobain stock price compared to the  performance  of  the  CAC  40  stock  market  index. Furthermore,  following  dialog  with  investors,  the  longterm  compensation  plans  put  in  place  since  2017  by  the Board of Directors, on the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, now include a criterion relating to  Corporate  Social  Responsibility.  These  criteria  were deemed relevant by the Board of Directors as they reflect the operational, financial and non-financial performance of the Saint-Gobain Group and ensure that the beneficiaries are aligned with the interests of Saint-Gobain shareholders.\n\nThe vesting of performance shares under the plan set up in  November  2022  is  therefore  subject  to  the  following conditions cumulatively:\n\n- \u00b7 service  condition: to  be  an  employee  or  a  company Director of a Saint-Gobain Group company throughout the  entire  duration  of  the  vesting  period,  without interruption, except in a number of specific cases such as  death,  disability  (as  defined  in  paragraphs  (2)  and\n- (3)  of  Article  L.341-4  of  the  French  Social  Security Code),  no-fault  termination,  negotiated  departure, retirement,  transfer  to  another  position  within  the Group,  or  change  of  control  of  the  grantee's  host company to outside the Group;\n- \u00b7 performance  condition linked  to  the  following  three criteria:\n- -60%  of  the  shares  initially  allocated  are  subject  to the criteria of Return on Capital Employed, including goodwill, of the Saint-Gobain Group (ROCE),\n- -20% of the shares initially allocated are subject to a criterion  linked  to  the  performance  of  the  SaintGobain  stock  price  versus  the  performance  of  the CAC 40 stock market index, and\n- -20% of the shares initially allocated are subject to a criterion  linked  to  Corporate  Social  Responsibility. This  criterion,  resulting  from  dialog  with  investors, comprises the following three indicators, all quantifiable  and  published  each  year  as  key  CSR indicators:  the  rate  of  reduction  of  CO2  emissions (10%  of  the  shares  initially  allocated),  the  total recordable accident rate - more than 24 hours' lost and non-lost time (TRAR), and the senior executives diversity index (5% of the shares initially allocated to each of them).\n\nHowever, the first 100 shares granted to each beneficiary other than Executive Committee members will be exempt from the performance conditions.\n\nROCE performance will be calculated as follows:\n\n| Arithmetic mean of the ROCE for the years 2023, 2024 and 2025   | Percentage of shares initially granted, contingent upon the ROCE  (i.e. 60% of grant), vested   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Greater than 13.5%                                              | All                                                                                             |\n| Between 12% and 13.5%                                           | 50% + 50%*[(Arithmetic mean of ROCE for 2022, 2023 and 2024 -12%)/ (13.5%-12%)]                 |\n| Equal to 12%                                                    | 50%                                                                                             |\n| Between 11% and 12%                                             | 50%*[(Arithmetic mean of 2022, 2023 and 2024 ROCE - 11%)/ (12%-11%)]                            |\n| 11% or less                                                     | None                                                                                            |\n\nThese criteria are the same as those selected for 2021, the Board  of  Directors  considering  that,  despite  the  Group's performances  in  2022,  given  the  worsened  geopolitical and  economic  situation  when  the  2022  plan  was implemented in November 2022 compared to November 2021, it did not wish to increase the limits, but that given the Group's performances in 2022, it also did not wish to reduce  them.  As  a  reminder,  the  reasoning  behind  the criteria used for 2021 to calculate performance was based, for  the  ROCE, on the objective announced at the Capital Markets  Day  on  October  6,  2021,  of  an  average  annual ROCE of between 12% and 15% for the period 2021-2025. Even  though  the  objective  is  reached  from  12%,  an ambitious criterion has been set - i.e. 13.5% - for 100% of the shares initially allocated to vest.\n\nDespite the history of ROCE rates, which only reached 11% in  2019  (excluding  the  2021  situation),  it  was  decided  to grant 0% if the arithmetic mean of ROCE for 2023, 2024 and  2025  is  less  than  or  equal  to  11%.  Finally,  if  the arithmetic  mean  of  ROCE  for  2023,  2024  and  2025  is equal  to  12%,  i.e.  if  the  objective  is  reached  within  the range of 12% to 15% announced at the Capital Markets Day, it  was  decided  to  allocate  only  50%  at  this  level,  with  a linear progression between 11% and 12% and then between 12%  and  13.5%.  The  2021  plan  criteria  reflect  the  Group's performance  conditions,  which  will only definitively allocate  50%  of  the  shares  with  an  ROCE  of  12%  -  and therefore if the target is reached.\n\n\u00cb",

It is therefore exposed  to  risks,  the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on  its  businesses,  financial  position,  results  and  outlook. This  chapter  presents  the  main  risks  to  which  the  Group believes  it  is  exposed  at  the  date  of  this  Universal Registration Document.\n\nDue  to  the  Group's  multiple  geographic  locations,  the diversity of its markets and product ranges, as well as its development,  the  Saint -Gobain  Group  is  exposed  to different  categories  of  risks.  In  the  framework  of  the provisions of Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council,  the  risk  factors considered most important (identified with an asterisk), at\n\nthe  date  of  this  Universal  Registration  Document,  are mentioned  in  the  first  place  within  each  of  the  risk categories mentioned below, in line with an evaluation that takes account  of  their impact  and  probability of occurrence.  Saint -Gobain's  evaluation  of  the  significance of  the  risks  may  be  modified  at  any  time,  particularly  if new internal or external events occur.\n\nThe reader's attention is drawn to the fact that other risks of  which  the  Group  is  not  aware  at  the  date  of  this Universal  Registration  Document,  or  the  occurrence  of which is not currently considered likely to have a material adverse  effect  on  the  Group,  its  businesses,  financial position, results and outlook, may or might exist or arise.\n\n## 6.1.1 RISKS SPECIFIC TO THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESS SECTOR\n\n## Risks related to the economic situation*\n\nA  significant  part  of  the  Group's  activities  is  linked  to investment  in the construction sector, namely  the renovation  markets  (50% (1) of  2022  revenue),  new residential construction (22% (1) of 2022 revenue) and nonresidential  markets  (15% (1) of  2022  revenue)  which  are sensitive to the economic situation, including the effects of the current high inflation and/or the rise in interest rates in the  major  economies.  Consequently,  the  Group's  results are  sensitive  to  the  macroeconomic  conditions  of  the geographic areas, both at regional and local levels, where the  Group  is  active.  Since  the  Group  is  established  in 75  countries  around  the  world  (particularly  in  Northern Europe,  Southern  Europe,  the  Middle  East,  Sub-Saharan Africa,  North  America,  Latin  America  and  Asia-Pacific),  a deterioration in the global economic environment due, for example,  to  a  severe  economic  downturn  or  a  major recession in any of these geographic areas is likely to have a  negative  impact  on  the  consumption  of  the  Group's products  in  the  regions  concerned,  which  could  have  a material  adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  revenues,  results, free cash-flow generation and outlook.\n\n## Risks related to the Group's international activities*\n\nThe Group is active worldwide, including outside Western Europe  and  North  America.  It  is  present  in  particular  in Eastern  Europe,  the  Middle  East,  Africa,  Asia-Pacific,  and Latin  America,  particularly  in  Brazil.  About  23%  of  the Group's  consolidated  revenue  was  generated  in  these regions in 2022. Generally speaking, the Group's activities in  these  regions  carry  higher  risks  than  in  Western European  and  North  American  countries,  due  to  the existence  of  greater  economic  and  political  instability,  as well  as  greater  exposure  to  social  and  infrastructure disruptions than in more mature markets.\n\n(1)\n\n\u00cb\n\nThus,  the  direct  and  indirect  consequences  of  political instability  or  of  an  unstable  economic  or  regulatory environment in which the Group operates, in a country in which the Group is active or markets its products, could have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  investments  in  those countries'  construction  sector,  and  consequently  on  the Group's businesses, financial position, results or outlook.\n\nIn this respect, the war between Russia and Ukraine, which is  a  factor  of  economic  uncertainty  affecting  economic activity and world trade, could have an adverse effect on the Group's activities even though the Group's economic exposure to Russia is not significant (approximately 0.7% of  the  Group's  consolidated  revenue  in  2022  and  about 1,800 employees, some 1,350 of whom are spread over the Group's nine factories).\n\nIn  addition,  while  the  Covid-19  pandemic  appears  to  be less severe than in 2019 and 2020, the implementation of new  restrictive  measures  in  response  to  potential  new waves  of  the  pandemic  could  lead  to  further  economic slowdowns  in  markets  in  which  the  Group  operates,  or affect  global  production  chains,  local  supply  or  transport chains, or, more  generally,  could  affect  the  global economy once again. This could have an adverse effect on the  Group's  financial  position,  results  or  outlook  (see section  4.1.7,  p.  133).  However,  most  of  the  Group's activities  are  local,  with  products  manufactured  and  sold locally, and largely local sourcing.\n\nMoreover,  legal  or  regulatory  changes  applicable  to  the Group's activities (involving, among other things, taxation, restrictions on capital transfers, customs duties, intellectual  property  and  import  and  export  licenses,  the employment system or health, safety or the environment) could  significantly  increase  the  Group's  costs  in  the various countries in which it is active, or limit its ability to freely transfer its capital, and consequently have a material adverse effect on its businesses, financial position, results and outlook.",

        "page_content": "Lastly,  the  Group  operates  in  an  uncertain  geopolitical climate where trade tensions such as those that may arise from  the  war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine  or  those between  China  and  the  United  States,  are  becoming increasingly prominent. The Group mainly operates in local markets (see section 1.4.2.A,  p.  29),  although  some  of  its manufacturing  activities  have  global  value  chains  and could  be  subject  to  political  and  trade  tensions,  such  as the  automotive  industry.  Further  deterioration  of  global trade relations could therefore have an adverse effect on the Group's results and outlook in these business sectors. At  the  date  of  this  Universal  Registration  Document,  the war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine  has  had  no  material adverse effect on the value chains of the Group's activities.\n\n## Risks related to innovation and the digital revolution\n\nThe  Group  has  placed  innovation  at  the  heart  of  its strategy  (see  section  2.3.4,  p.  60)  in  order  to  feed  its competitiveness  and  maintain  a  high  level  of  operational excellence and financial and non-financial performance.\n\nCertain  markets  in  which  the  Group  is  positioned  are evolving  rapidly,  with  the  appearance  of  new  practices, products  and  solutions  (for  instance  pre-fabrication,  3D printing,  light  construction,  digital  services  linked  to  the various phases of construction projects, optimized logistics and management of circularity), new technologies and new communication and distribution channels relying on digital tools and content (see section 2.3.3, p. 58). The success  of  the  Group  depends  on  its  capacity  to  keep pace with these changes at all times and integrate these new  technologies  into  its  product  offerings,  in  order  to respond effectively to customers' needs.\n\nFollowing  the  success,  one  year  in  advance,  of  the 'Transform  &  Grow'  program  set  up  in  November  2018, one of the challenges of which, in terms of innovation and digital  transformation,  was  to  optimally  reconcile,  on  the one hand, initiatives and coordination of marketing policies and  strategic  innovations  on  a  global  scale,  and,  on  the other  hand,  necessary  local  adaptations  or  initiatives  to meet  the  needs  of  local  markets  and  customers  in  the most  pertinent  and  efficient  way  possible  (in  particular sales  channels,  logistics  offering,  etc.),  the  new  'Grow  & Impact' strategic plan announced  to  investors  on October 6, 2021, continues to pursue these objectives and significantly  strengthens  the  ambitions  regarding  the digital  transformation  in  terms  of  both  organization  and resources. The Group's Digital & IT and Innovation entities are  pooling  resources  to  explore  the  potential  and  the possible  scaling-up  of  the  new  digital  technologies.  The Group  might  not  be  in  a  position  to  fully  implement  its digital strategy, which could adversely affect its revenues, results or outlook.\n\nThe  Group's  innovation  policy  notably  also  comprises  an ambitious  marketing  approach  which  seeks  to  better understand, anticipate and respond to customer requirements,  working  where  appropriate  closely  with Research and Development to supply customized solutions. This policy of marketing  innovation  and operational  excellence  is  based  in  particular  on  specific strategic  watches.  Innovation  based  on  Research  and Development  requires  significant investments (\u20ac520 million at December 31, 2022, i.e., 27% of the Group's total\n\n## RISKS AND CONTROL\n\nRisk factors\n\ninvestments)  as  well  as  an  appropriate  recruitment  and training policy, particularly in the  new  occupations resulting from  the  digital  boom  (digital  marketing, occupations linked to the use of data, the development of digital platforms, and Industry 4.0 for example, see  section  2.3.3,  p.  58),  the  expected  benefits  of  which cannot be guaranteed.\n\nThe Group's revenue, operating margins and results could be  affected  if  it  fails  to  invest  or  invests  insufficiently  in appropriate technologies related to the digital transformation,  or  if  is  unable  rapidly  to  bring  new products to market, or if seeks to market products that do not  adequately  address  customer  needs  or  if  competing products are quickly introduced.\n\n## Intellectual property risks\n\nThe  growth  in  the  Group's  activities  relies  on  the protection  of  its  manufacturing  secrets,  patents  (more than 450 patents registered in 2022), brands and models, and other intellectual property rights (for a description of the Group's portfolio of patents and brands, see section 1.4.3, p. 34). If the Group were to be unable to obtain,  protect  and  preserve  its  intellectual  property rights, or its freedom to exploit them, this could result in the  loss  of  its  exclusive  rights  to  use  technologies  and processes, which could have a material adverse effect on its results.\n\nThe  Group  has  an  active  policy  for  the  protection  of  its intellectual property rights but cannot rule out the risk of its products being counterfeited, the appropriation or illicit use  of  its  intellectual  property  rights  or  an  unfavorable ruling by the courts.\n\nThe Group may be forced to take legal action against third parties  suspected  of  breaching  its  rights.  Any  such proceedings may give rise to significant costs and hamper growth  in  sales  of  the  products  manufactured  using  the rights  concerned  or  force  the  Group  to  incur  additional expenses  to  develop  other  technologies  that  do  not  use the disputed technology.\n\n## Risks related to the supply of energy and raw materials and changes in the cost of energy and raw materials\n\nThe Group's industrial  activities,  some  of  which  consume high  levels  of  energy,  such  as  Building  and  Automobile Glass,  Insulation  or  Gypsum  (see  section  1.4,  p.  28  for  a description  of  these  activities),  or  are  dependent  on certain  raw  materials,  could  be  impacted  by  a  significant increase in prices resulting from difficulties in sourcing raw materials and/or energy (e.g., natural gas or electricity), or by  the  occurrence  of  natural  disasters,  extreme  weather conditions, or geopolitical circumstances such as the war between  Russia  and  Ukraine.  By  way  of  illustration,  at December  31,  2022,  the  Group's  irrevocable  purchase commitments  relating  to  raw  materials  and  energy represented \u20ac1.8 billion (see Note 5.5.1 to the consolidated financial statements, section 8.1, p. 290). Inflation in energy and  raw  material  costs  represented  about  \u20ac3  billion  in 2022 versus 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6 6 6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## RISKS AND CONTROL\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe Group's ability to pass on these cost increases to its customers depends to a large extent on market conditions and commercial practices. Even if the Group passes them on, it may do so only in part and/or with a slippage over time. The Group's inability to immediately and/or fully pass on increases in the cost of raw materials and/or energy in the short term could have a material adverse effect on its operations, financial position or results.\n\nThe Group has set up hedging arrangements for some of the  risks  associated  with  the  cost  of  energy  and/or  raw materials (see Note 10.1 Financial Risks to the consolidated financial  statements,  section  8.1,  p.  311).  Nevertheless,  it cannot  guarantee  that  these  hedges,  which  themselves represent  a  cost  for  the  Group,  will  fully  cover  any additional  costs  incurred  as  a  result  of  future  price increases in the cost of energy and/or raw materials; they will  depend  on  the  underlying  assumptions  regarding movements in costs applied by the Group.\n\n## Industrial and environmental risks\n\nThe  Group  could  incur  significant  expenses  and  be exposed  to  environmental  liabilities  as  a  result  of  its operation  of  past,  present  or  future  industrial  sites  (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, section 8.1, p. 307).\n\nThe  industrial  and  environmental  risks  arising  from  the operation of some sites primarily relate to the storage of certain hazardous substances.\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  eight  sites  were  classified  under Directive  2012/18/EU  on  the  control  of  major-accident hazards  involving  dangerous  substances,  known  as  the 'Seveso III' Directive. These industrial sites are subject to specific regulations and close supervision by the competent  authorities  and  the  Group's  Environment, Health and Safety Department.\n\nThese  sites  include  Balsta  (Gypsum)  in  Sweden,  storing liquid  natural  gas,  Etolikon  (Gypsum)  in  Greece  and Stjordal (Insulation) in Norway, storing liquefied petroleum gas,  Billesholm  (Insulation)  in  Sweden  and  Sully-sur-Loire (Sekurit-Transport) and Sermaises (HPS) in France, storing combustive  liquids,  which  fall  under  the  'lower-tier' defined by the 'Seveso III' Directive. Three other facilities are classified as 'upper-tier': the Bagneaux-sur-Loing site (Flat  Glass)  in  France,  which  stores  arsenic  (AS2O3),  the Carrascal  del  Rio  site  (Flat  Glass)  in  Spain,  which  stores hydrofluoric  acid  (HF),  and  the  Boston,  Lincolnshire  site (Building  Distribution)  in  the  United  Kingdom,  which stores petroleum products.\n\nAfter identifying accident risks and their potential impact on the environment, preventive measures were implemented  at  these  facilities,  covering  the  design  and construction  of  storage  areas,  as  well  as  the  manner  in which they are operated and maintained. Internal contingency  plans  have  been  developed  to  respond  to incidents.  The  financial  consequences  of  personal  injury and damage to property that may arise by accident from\n\n\u00cb\n\nplant  operations  are  covered  by  the  current  Group  civil liability  and  environment  impairment  liability  insurance programs (for a description of these programs, see  section  6.1.5,  p.  228),  except  for  the  Bagneaux-surLoing  plant,  which  is  operated  by  a  joint  venture  and which is insured under a specific policy subscribed by such subsidiary. In the event of an industrial accident, compensation  payments  to  victims  would  be  organized jointly  by  the  company,  the  insurance  broker  and  the insurer.\n\nThe Saint -Gobain Group is also exposed to risks of chronic pollution,  and  could  therefore  be  required  to  incur expenses  to  restore  active  or  closed  industrial  sites  or clean  up  the  environment.  At  December  31,  2022,  69 European Group sites are classified as 'IED' installations in the meaning  of  Directive  2010/75/EU  on  industrial emissions, and  are subject to integrated pollution prevention and control regulations.\n\nA breach of these regulations could result in fines or other civil,  administrative  or  criminal  penalties,  specifically  the withdrawal  of  permits  and  licenses  needed  for  the activities  in  question  to  continue  operation,  which  could have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  revenue, results, free cash flow generation and outlook.\n\nLastly,  changes  in  environmental  regulations,  including their  interpretation,  and  consideration  of  climate  change risks  (see  section  3.3,  p.  100)  could  cause  the  Group  to incur significant expenses and/or investments.\n\n## Risks related to external growth\n\nThe Group's strategy is based, in part, on external growth, in  particular  by  acquiring  businesses  or  assets,  taking equity  interests  or  establishing  joint  ventures  in  the Group's  business  lines  and  in  geographic  regions  where the Group  seeks  to  establish  or  strengthen  itself (see section 2.3.7, p. 68). For example on May 31, 2022, the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire  Kaycan,  a  company  that  manufactures  and distributes  outdoor  construction  materials  in  Canada  and the United States, which strengthens Saint -Gobain's status as a world leader in sustainable construction, a transaction that was definitively completed on July 29, 2022.\n\nHowever, the Group may not be in a position to identify attractive  targets  or  to  enter  into  transactions  at  the optimal time and/or under satisfactory conditions (see paragraph B of section 2.3.7, p. 68 for a description of the business portfolio management  strategy). The expected  benefits  of  these  external  growth  operations depend, in part,  on  the  realization  of  expected  synergies and integration of the activities of the acquired companies, and  on  relationships  with  other  participants  in  the  joint ventures.  The  Group  gives  no  guarantees  as  to  these objectives,  which,  if  not  fulfilled  within  the  expected timeframes  and  at  the  expected  levels,  could  affect  the Group's financial position, results and outlook.",

        "page_content": "## Risks related to information systems\n\nDaily management of the Group's activities, specifically the conduct  of  its  commercial,  industrial, logistics and accounting  processes,  particularly  in  its  Distribution activities,  requires  the  proper  functioning  of  all  technical infrastructure  and  computer  applications.  The  risk  of system malfunction or interruption, which may be external or internal in origin (computer viruses or hacking, service provider default, blackouts or network shutdowns, natural disasters,  human  error,  etc.),  cannot  be  ruled  out.  In particular, a cyber attack could affect not only operations, but also the protection of confidential information or lead to the theft, loss or exposure of personal data.\n\nIt  should  be  recalled  that,  in  June  2017,  the  Group,  along with  numerous  other  companies  and  organizations  in France and abroad, was affected by the NotPetya cyberattack,  which  required  IT  systems  to  be  disconnected  in order  to  prevent  the  spread  of  the  virus,  as  well  as  the introduction of alternative processes  in  all of the Saint -Gobain  businesses.  The  impact  of  the  cyber-attack on  operating  income  for  the  2017  fiscal  year  was calculated  to  be  \u20ac80  million.  All  of  the  information systems  were  back  up  and  running  within  ten  days, without any data being lost or compromised.\n\nWith a view to learning from NotPetya and minimizing the probability and the impact of this type of malfunction, the Information  Systems  Department,  as  part  of  a  cyberdefense  plan,  has  introduced  strict  rules  relating  to  the governance  and  security  of  information  systems,  both  in terms  of  infrastructure  and  applications,  data  protection and business continuity plans. This plan was deployed at Group level,  controlled  by  the  Audit  and  Internal  Control Department and by regular external audits (see  section  5.1.2,  p.  174,  on  the  work  of  the  Board  of Directors and the Audit and Risk Committee). Since 2021, the  cyber-defense  plan  has  become  the  cybersecurity continuous  improvement  plan,  and  an  external  audit  is carried  out  on  behalf  of  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee every  two  years.  Furthermore,  a  new  insurance  program covering  the  Group's  cyber  risks  has  been  in  place  and renewed annually since the end of 2017. The implementation  of  these  various  actions  has  made  it\n\n## RISKS AND CONTROL\n\nRisk factors\n\npossible  to  ensure  that  the  cybersecurity  incidents  and cyberattacks that Saint -Gobain Group has had to deal with over the past three years have had no consequences for the Group's operations.\n\nThe occurrence of such malfunctions may adversely affect the  Group's  operations,  the  protection  of  its  know-how and its financial results.\n\n## Risks related to climate change and the energy transition\n\nThe  fight  against  climate  change  involves  both  risk management and the development of the Group's markets (see section 3.3.1, p. 100).\n\nThe Group has placed the fight against climate change at the  heart  of  its  strategy  and  aims  to  contribute  to  a  fair and sustainable transition to a low-carbon economy with the adoption of a 2030 roadmap with a view to attaining its  goal of contribution to carbon neutrality by 2050 and the  implementation  of  the  'Sustainable  Solutions  for Growth' program.\n\nAchieving  its  climate  objectives  requires,  among  other things,  the  Group's  ability  to  access  sufficient  renewable energy  sources  to  meet  its  needs  at  satisfactory  pricing conditions.  The  Group's  failure  to  access  such  energy sources  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  its  ability  to implement  its  strategy  and  meet  the  expectations  of  its customers and investors.\n\nIn  addition,  the  need  for  decarbonization  of  the  Group's industrial customers requires an acceleration of innovation in decarbonization  technologies  for  the  construction industry, green mobility and in specialty materials for the decarbonization of industrial processes. The implementation of new industrial processes and procedures as part of the Group's sustainability roadmap represents a major technical and technological challenge. The  Group's  failure  to  deploy  these  new  processes  or procedures, or a delay in deploying them, could adversely affect  its  ability  to  implement  its  strategy  and  meet  the expectations of its customers and investors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6 6 6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

At  December  31,  2022,  the  total  amount  of pension plan commitments was \u20ac8.8 billion (see Note 6.3 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  section  8.1, p. 291).\n\nThe level of provision for Group pension plans (\u20ac1.7 billion at  December  31,  2022)  may  be  affected  by  adverse changes in the actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected  plan  liabilities,  by  a  reduction  in  the  discount rates  used  to  measure  future  commitments,  a  change  in the assumed mortality rates or an increase in the inflation rates  used,  or  a  fall  in  the  market  values  of  plan  assets, consisting mainly of equities and bonds.\n\n## Risks linked to cost reduction and restructuring\n\nThe  Group  constantly  strives  to  reduce  or  optimize  its costs.  While  further  savings  are  planned,  there  is  no guarantee that the forecast reductions will be achieved or that  the  costs  related  to  possible  restructuring  will  not exceed  forecasts.  In  particular, certain restructuring operations  and  other  initiatives  may  cost  more  than expected, or the cost savings may be less than expected or  take  longer  than  expected  to  achieve.  An  increase  in\n\n## 6.1.3 FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  financial  risks,  and  notably  a liquidity risk on  financing.  In  particular,  in  a  crisis environment,  the  Group  might  be  unable  to  raise  the financing  or  refinancing  needed  to  cover  its  investment plans  on  the  credit  or  capital  markets,  or  to  obtain  such financing  or  refinancing  on  acceptable  terms.  For  more\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Risks linked to goodwill and impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and rights of use\n\nThe  Group  has  a  significant  amount  of  intangible  assets linked, on the one hand, to brands, customer relations and intellectual  property,  and  on  the  other  hand  to  goodwill (respectively \u20ac3.6 billion and \u20ac12.9 billion at December 31, 2022). In line with Group accounting policies, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite use  lives  are  tested  for  impairment  periodically  and whenever there is an indication that their carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. Goodwill and other identified intangible  assets  may  become  impaired  as  a  result  of worse-than-expected  Group  performance,  unfavorable market conditions, unfavorable legal or regulatory changes or  many  other  factors.  The  recognition  of  impairment losses  on  goodwill  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on consolidated net income.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  including  rights  of  use under  leases  (\u20ac14.9  billion  at  December  31,  2022),  could also  be  subject  to  impairment  in  the  event  of  adverse changes in the business (see Note 7 to  the  consolidated financial statements, section 8.1, p. 298).\n\ninformation  on  this  liquidity  risk  and  the  other  financial risks to which the Group is exposed, please see Note 10.1 to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, section 8.1, p. 311.",

        "page_content": "## 6.1.4 LEGAL RISKS\n\n## Risks linked to legal and administrative procedures\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  risks  of  litigation  and  claims arising  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The  most significant  disputes  pending  or  for  which  the  Group  has received notifications are described below. These proceedings  may  result  in  a  conviction,  the  payment  of substantial damages, regulatory or even criminal sanctions,  and  may  tarnish  the  Group's  reputation  and thus  have  a  significant  negative  impact  on  the  Group's image, financial position and  operating  results. At December  31,  2022,  total  provisions  for  Group  litigation amounted to \u20ac251 million (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, section 8.1, p. 307).\n\n## Competition law and related proceedings*\n\nCompetition  laws  apply  to  the  Group  companies  in countries in which it operates. Violation of competition law exposes  the  Group  to  fines  and,  in  certain  countries, potential  criminal  sanctions  on  the  Group  and  the employees involved. Any litigation filed by a competition authority could, in the event of conviction, give rise to the payment of fines and potentially damages, which is likely to  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  Group's  reputation, financial situation and operating results.\n\nThe Saint -Gobain Group is firmly committed to opposing any practice that might violate competition rules and has long applied the principle of zero tolerance. A competition law  compliance  program  has  been  in  place  within  the Group since 2007 (see section 3.1.5, p. 86).\n\n## Investigation by the Swiss Competition Commission in the sanitary products wholesale industry\n\nIn  November  2011,  the  Swiss  Competition  Commission (Commission  suisse  de  la  concurrence)  opened  an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the sanitary products wholesale industry. In May 2014, the Commission Secretariat  issued  a  notice  of  complaints  against  Sanitas Troesch and other wholesalers in the industry alleging that Sanitas Troesch and some of its competitors had, among other  things,  agreed  in  2005  and  2012  to  lower  gross prices.\n\nThe total  fine  imposed  on  all  companies  involved  is  CHF 80 million. For Sanitas Troesch, the fine is CHF 28.8 million. Sanitas Troesch appealed this decision on May 2, 2016 and continues  to  firmly  refute  the  claims  made.  The  hearing took  place  before  the  Federal  Administrative  Court  on January  21,  2020  and  the  date  on  which  the  Federal Administrative  Court  will  issue  its  decision  is  not  yet known. However, a provision for claims and litigation was recognized at December 31, 2015 in an amount equivalent to the fine (unchanged as at December 31, 2022).\n\nRisk factors\n\n## Investigation by the French Competition Authority in the building insulation products industry\n\nAlleged anti-competitive practices in the building insulation  products  market  were  notified  to  Saint -Gobain Isover  and  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain,  which  rejected such  allegations. The  French  Competition  Authority considered  that  the  alleged  anti-competitive  practices were  not  established  and  dismissed  all  the  objections  in January  2021.  Actis  appealed  this  decision  to  the  Paris Court of Appeal.\n\nOn  the  civil  law  front,  Actis  served  in  March  2013  a damages  claim  on  Saint -Gobain  Isover,  the  Centre scientifique  et  technique  du  b\u00e2timent,  and  the  FILMM before  the  Paris  Civil  Court  (Tribunal  judiciaire  de  Paris) based on the facts being investigated by the Competition Authority.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2022,  Actis  withdrew  these  two  actions. Saint -Gobain  Isover  and  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain accepted  these  withdrawals  without  reservation.  The decision  of  the  Paris  Court  of  Appeal  noting  the withdrawal  of  Actis  and  the  fact  that  the  actions  were removed from the Court was made on January 26, 2023. The  judgment  of  the  Paris  Civil  Court  declaring  the withdrawal  of  Actis  and  the  removal  of  the  case  is expected in the first half of 2023.\n\n## Asbestos-related litigation\n\nCurrent  legal  actions  related  to  asbestos  are  described below.\n\n## Asbestos-related litigation in France\n\n## Inexcusable fault lawsuits\n\nIn France, Everite and Saint -Gobain PAM, which in the past manufactured fiber-cement products containing asbestos fibres, are the subject of actions by former employees of these  companies (or persons claiming through them) for recognition of inexcusable fault following diseases recognized as being of occupational origin.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, a total of 850 lawsuits had been issued  against  the  two  companies  since  the  outset  with the  aim  of  obtaining  supplementary  compensation  over and above the amounts paid by the French Social Security authorities in this respect.\n\nAs of the same date, 826 of these 850 lawsuits had been completed and 24 actions are still pending.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  compensation  paid  by  Everite  and Saint -Gobain PAM since the outset of  these  litigations  in settlement  of  these  lawsuits  totaled  approximately  \u20ac9.7 million as of December 31, 2022 (compared to \u20ac6.6 million as of December 31, 2021).\n\nIn  addition,  similar  suits  had  been  filed  against  13  French companies of the Group (excluding suits against companies that are no longer part of the Group) which in the  past  used  equipment  containing  asbestos  to  protect their employees  and  installations  against  heat  from furnaces.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, a total of 282 lawsuits had been filed  since  the  outset  against  these  13  companies. 240 of these  282  lawsuits  had  been  completed  and  42  actions were still pending at the same date.\n\nThe total amount of compensation paid since the outset of the  litigations  by  these  companies  was  approximately \u20ac11.8  million  as  of  December  31,  2022  (compared  to approximately \u20ac10.5 million as of December 31, 2021).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6 6 6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

The matter remains pending. The purpose of the filing is to achieve a certain,  final  and  equitable  resolution  of  all  current  and future  claims  arising  from  asbestos-containing  products manufactured  and  sold  by  the  former  CertainTeed Corporation.\n\nDBMP LLC intends to seek court authority to establish a trust under Section 524(g) of the US Bankruptcy Code - a specific provision that is applicable to companies that face substantial  numbers  of  asbestos-related  claims  -  to achieve  a  fair  and  equitable  resolution  of  its  asbestosrelated liabilities. Upon establishment of the trust, current and future plaintiffs with qualifying claims will be able to receive  faster  payment  of  their  claims  without  the  delay, stress  and  uncertainty  of  litigation  in  the  tort  system;  at the same time, the creation and funding of such a trust will permanently  and  finally  resolve  DBMP  LLC's  asbestos liability.\n\nDuring  the  course  of  this  bankruptcy  process,  which  is expected to take up to approximately five to eight years, all  asbestos  litigation  will  be  stayed  and  all  related  costs suspended,  providing  DBMP  LLC  with  the  time  and protection to negotiate an agreement to be approved on behalf of all claimants and by the court.\n\nThis  action  was  taken  as  a  result  of  the  increasing  risks presented in  the  US  tort  system.  Despite  the  passage  of time, the aging of the population and lessening\n\n\u00cb\n\nopportunity  for  claimants  to  assert  legitimate  claims  of exposure  to  the  asbestos-containing  products  of  the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  naming  practices  in  the tort  system  continued  to  result  in  a  steady  volume  of claims against DBMP LLC, with no foreseeable end in sight. In  addition,  there  has  been,  in  general,  an  escalation  of settlement demands and verdicts in the tort system.\n\nCertain adversary  proceedings  have  been  filed  by representatives  of  current  and  future  asbestos  plaintiffs against DBMP  LLC,  CertainTeed  LLC,  Saint -Gobain Corporation,  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  and  various other  parties.  No  decisions  on  the  merits  of  the  claims have  been  made  and  such  claims  do  not  affect  the Company's financial assessment of the Chapter 11 case.\n\n## Impact on the financial statements\n\nFollowing  the  commencement  of  the  proceeding  under Chapter  11  of  the  US  Bankruptcy  Code  on  January  23, 2020,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  DBMP  LLC  and  its wholly-owned  subsidiary  Millwork  &  Panel  LLC,  and  in particular  the  provision  for  asbestos-related  litigation  in the  United  States,  are  no  longer  consolidated  in  the Group's financial statements.\n\nNonetheless,  because  of  a  funding  agreement  between CertainTeed  LLC  and  DBMP  LLC  by  which  CertainTeed LLC has agreed to fund the costs of the Chapter 11 case and, ultimately, the 524(g) trust, in both cases solely to the extent  DBMP  LLC  is  unable  to  do  so  in  full,  the  Group recorded  in  its  consolidated  financial  statements  a  debt against  DBMP  LLC  amounting  to  $410  million  as  of December 31, 2022 ($417 million as of December 31, 2021).\n\nThe Group's consolidated income for 2022 is not impacted by the ongoing Chapter 11 proceeding described above.\n\nAs a result  of  this  bankruptcy  proceeding,  all  legal  costs and indemnity payments related to DBMP LLC's asbestos tort claims have been suspended, and no further charges in  relation  to  such  claims  have been taken in 2022 (as in 2021).\n\n## Situation in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, former employees  of  Brasilit, that once manufactured fiber cement containing asbestos, suffering from  asbestos-related  occupational  illnesses  are  offered, depending  on  the  case,  either  financial  compensation alone  or  lifetime  medical  assistance  combined  with financial compensation. Around 1,200 contractual instruments have accordingly been signed to date.\n\nTwo class actions were initiated against Brasilit in 2017 by two associations defending former employees exposed to asbestos at the S\u00e3o Caetano (S\u00e3o Paulo state) and Recife (Pernambuco  state)  plants,  asking  for  their  medical assistance  and  compensation  to  be  revised.  First  and second  instance  decisions  were  rendered  in  connection with the suit related to the S\u00e3o Caetano plant respectively in  July  2020  and  July  2021,  rejecting  the  claims  of  the plaintiffs. The  latter  have  nevertheless  appealed  the second  instance  decision.  First  and  second  instance decisions  were  rendered  in  relation  to  Recife  case, respectively  in  February  and  October  2022  rejecting  the claiming party arguments. The plaintiff has appealed such second instance decision.",

A  first  instance  decision  was rendered  in  September  2020  partly  in  favor  of  the plaintiffs.  In  particular,  collective  moral  damages  were granted to the plaintiffs, for an amount reduced to BRL 5 million (\u20ac0.8 million). Brasilit has appealed the decision.\n\nBrasilit is subject to controls by the Ministry of Labor and continues  to  comply  with  all  of  its  legal  obligations  with regard  to  medical  assistance  for  its  current  and  former employees.\n\nIn November 2017, the Supreme Court of Brazil decided to ban  asbestos  definitively  across  the  country.  Brasilit stopped using asbestos voluntarily as early as 2002.\n\n## Environmental disputes\n\n## PFOA proceedings in the United States\n\nLevels  of  PFOA  (perfluorooctanoic  acid)  in  excess  of  US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health advisories or  state  maximum  contaminant  levels  for  drinking  water have been found in municipal water systems and private wells near current Saint -Gobain Performance Plastics (SG PPL) facilities in Hoosick Falls (New York) and Merrimack (New  Hampshire),  and  two  former  facilities  in  North Bennington  (Vermont)  in  the  United  States.  PFOA  and PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) have never been manufactured  by  these  plants.  SG  PPL  is  a  processor  of PTFE  which  it  purchases  from  third  party  suppliers  and which in the past contained some PFOA.\n\nSG PPL has voluntarily provided bottled water in all three communities, installed point-of-entry treatment systems to residents and businesses in all three communities, installed carbon filtration systems on the municipal water supply in Hoosick  Falls  and  funded  the  installation  of  a  carbon filtration system  on  the  Merrimack  Valley  District's municipal  water  supply.  In  addition,  it  has  voluntarily funded  construction  of  water  line  extensions  in  certain communities in the Merrimack and Bennington areas. The investigations are on-going and the scope of responsibility for SG PPL arising from environmental remediation in New Hampshire  and  New  York  and  clean-up  obligations  at these sites has not yet been established. The scope of the remediation in Vermont is defined and largely completed; future  operation  and  maintenance  obligations  remain. Without  admitting  liability,  SG  PPL  has  signed  consent orders  with  the  environmental  regulators  in  New  York  in 2016,  in  Vermont  in  2017  and  2019  with  respect  to  two different areas, and in New Hampshire in 2018, pursuant to which  SG  PPL  has  agreed  to  complete  investigations, implement  interim  or  final  remediation  measures  at  its current  and  former  facilities  and  in  the  case  of  Vermont and  New  Hampshire,  fund  construction  of  water  lines. Responsibility, if any, is expected to be shared with other parties as regards in particular the Hoosick Falls site.\n\nPFOA-related  lawsuits  alleging  both  health-related  and economic damages claims have been filed in civil courts in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, some of which are in the form of proposed or certified class actions. It is difficult  to  predict  the  timing  or  outcome  of  any  such litigation,  or  whether  any  additional  litigation  will  be\n\n## RISKS AND CONTROL\n\nRisk factors\n\nbrought against SG PPL, however, both the New York and Vermont class actions are settled.\n\nOn  December  31,  2022,  the  provision  recorded  by  the Company in respect of this matter amounts to \u20ac201 million (compared to \u20ac116 million as of December 31, 2021). This provision covers both remediation and litigation related to PFOA matters.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\n## Grenfell Tower fire in the United Kingdom\n\nCelotex provides insulation materials for specific applications  for  the  building  and  construction  industry. Insulation materials  from  two  Celotex  ranges  were purchased  via  distributors  and  used  in  refurbishing Grenfell  Tower,  London  in  2015/2016,  including  as  one component  of  the  rainscreen  cladding  system  designed and  installed  (by  third  parties)  on  the  tower's  external facade.\n\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower fire on June 14, 2017, a Public Inquiry was constituted, which is considering, among other things,  the  modifications  made  to  the  building  as  part  of the refurbishment,  the  role  played  by  the  various construction  professionals,  and  the  information  provided by  the  manufacturers  of  the  products  used.  The  Inquiry has  been  conducting  its  work  in  two  phases:  its  phase  1 report  was  published  on  October  30,  2019;  phase  2 commenced  in  January  2020  and  public  hearings continued  until  July  2022,  with  a  final  report  to  follow, most  likely  in  2023.  A  criminal  investigation  into  the circumstances of the fire is also in progress.\n\nThere are a large number of issues and circumstances that need to be explored and the implications for Celotex are unlikely  to  be  known  for  some  time.  Civil  proceedings  in connection  with  Grenfell  Tower  brought  against  Celotex Limited  and/or  Saint -Gobain  Construction  Products  UK Limited (which respectively held the Celotex business until or  after  December  31,  2015)  and  a  number  of  other defendants - who are also core participants in the Public Inquiry  -  have  been  issued  by  bereaved,  survivors  and residents  and  emergency  responders.  Those  proceedings have been stayed prior to the service of full pleadings on the basis that the parties to the litigation are permitted to engage  in  a  confidential  alternative  dispute  resolution process,  which  if  it  succeeds  would  avoid  the  need  for litigation. Celotex and Saint -Gobain Construction Products UK  Limited  are  engaging  with  other  parties  in  such processes.\n\nCelotex  and  Saint -Gobain  Construction  Products  UK Limited are unable to communicate on the status of those confidential  processes,  which  are  ongoing.  However,  the financial  statements  as  at  31  December  2022  include  a provision covering the principal financial implications that may  arise  from  the  process  engaged  with  bereaved, survivors and residents.\n\nThe  extent  to  which  Celotex  may  incur  further  civil  or criminal liability in connection  with  the  production, marketing,  supply  or  use  of  its  products  is  currently unclear and Celotex Limited and Saint -Gobain Construction Products UK are currently unable to make a reliable estimate of their potential liability in this respect.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6 6 6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Apart  from  the  proceedings  and litigation  described  above,  to  the  best  of  the  Company's knowledge,  no  other  government,  court  or  arbitration proceedings  exist  (including  pending  proceedings  or proceedings where the Company and/or the Group might be threatened) which could have or have had, in the last 12 months,  a  significant  impact  on  the  financial  position  or profitability of the Company and/or Group. Please refer to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  note  9  relating  to provisions for litigation, p. 307.\n\n## Risk of regulatory changes\n\nThe Group is not subject to any specific regulations that could have an impact on its financial position, although the Group  companies  that  operate  industrial  sites  are generally  required  to  comply  with  the  specific  national laws and regulations of the country where such sites are located.  Such  is  the  case  for  example,  with  regard  to France, of the regulations applicable to classified sites, and certain regulations relating to the environment.\n\n## 6.1.5 INSURANCE\n\nThe Group transfers its risks to the insurance market when this is the most efficient solution. Default by one or more of  the  Group's  insurers  could  therefore  lead  to  financial losses.\n\nThe  Group's  policy  is  to  implement  preventive  programs and purchase insurance coverage to protect its assets and revenue. This policy is embedded within a Group doctrine, which  takes  into  account  current  conditions  in  the insurance  market.  It  is  determined,  coordinated  and overseen by the Risk and Insurance Department. It defines insurance  criteria  for  the  most  significant  risks,  such  as property and business interruption, as well as general and product  liability.  With  this  in  mind,  a  new  insurance program to cover the Group's cyber risks was implemented at the end of 2017.\n\nFor  other  types  of  coverage,  such  as  automobile  fleet insurance, the Risk and Insurance Department advises the individual operating  units  on  policy  content  broker selection  and  which  market  to  consult.  These  are  called 'high-frequency'  risks,  for  which  claims  are  monitored internally  and  appropriate  action  taken.  The  policies  in force in 2022 are the result of the renewal of the policies for 2021.\n\nThe captive insurance company set up to cover property risks was highly successful and delivered real benefits for the Group.\n\nCompanies acquired during the year have been integrated into existing insurance programs.\n\n\u00cb\n\nA  certain  number  of  legislative  measures  are  already  in place in certain countries and regions in which the Group operates.  For  example  at  European  level,  Directive 2003/87/EC of October 13, 2003, known as the 'Quotas Directive', has set a cap on carbon dioxide emissions and a quota trading system for certain large production sites. Notwithstanding  the  Group's  efforts  to  reduce  CO2 emissions,  and  more  broadly,  the  use  of  best  available techniques  for  its  investments  (see  section  3.3,  p.  100), changes in regulations applicable to the Group's activities could impact the operation of its production sites, which could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  its  operation, financial position or results.\n\nLaws and regulations  applicable  to  the  Group's  activities and  to  the  materials  and  products  that  it  uses  in  its activities may  change  in  a  manner  that  could  be unfavorable  to  the  Group.  The  introduction  of  stricter regulations  or  more  diligent  enforcement  of  existing regulations  may  affect  the  conditions  under  which  the Group  operates  its  businesses,  which  could  increase  its operating expenses, limit the scope of its activities or act as a brake on business growth. More generally, the Group cannot  guarantee  that  there  will  be  no  rapid  and/or significant regulatory changes in the future with a material adverse effect on its business, financial position or results.\n\n## Property and business interruption insurance\n\nThe risks covered are non-excluded property and casualty risks  as  well  as  operating  losses  following  a  sudden accident affecting the insured property. They are covered by a global program.\n\nThe programs meet the insurance criteria laid down by the Risk and Insurance Department, specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 all policies are 'all risks except';\n- \u00b7 limits on compatible coverage with worst-case scenarios where safety systems operate effectively;\n- \u00b7 deductibles  are  proportionate  to  the  size  of  the  site concerned and cannot be considered as self-insurance.\n\nThese  criteria take into account  current  insurance offerings,  which  exclude  certain  risks  and  cover  natural disasters such as floods, storms, earthquakes or tsunamis only up to a certain amount.\n\nIn extreme scenarios, such events could have a substantial uninsured financial impact in terms of both reconstruction costs and lost production costs.",

        "page_content": "The  Risk  and  Insurance  Department's  policy  is  based  on the findings of the annual  audits  carried  out  by independent  prevention  experts  recognized  by  the Group's insurers.  These  audits  give  a  clear  picture  of  the risk  exposure  of  the  main  sites  in  the  event  of  a  fire  or other  incident,  and  provide  an  estimate  of  the  financial consequences in a worst-case scenario.\n\nThe  transfer  of  risk  to  the  insurance  market  takes  place beyond  \u20ac17.5  million  per  claimable  event  for  all  Group entities as from January 1, 2022.\n\nThis  amount  is  self-insured  by  the  Group  through  its captive  insurance  company.  The  latter  has  taken  out reinsurance  protection  to  protect  it  against  an  excessive frequency and/or severity.\n\n## Coverage of the risk of civil liability\n\nA  program  provides  coverage  for  third-party  personal injury  and  property  damage  claims  for  which  the  Group would  be  legally  held  liable.  This  program  comprises several programs for the lower tranches of coverage.\n\nThe  first  program  covers  all  subsidiaries  and  has  a coverage  limit  of  \u20ac100  million.  Those  located  in  North America are subject to a deductible of US$50 million. The program's exclusions are consistent with market practice and concern in particular potentially carcinogenic substances and gradual pollution.\n\nIn order to satisfy local regulatory requirements, a policy is taken  out  in  each  country  in  which  the  Group  has  a significant  presence.  Local  policies  are  backed  up  by  the master policy issued in Paris, which can be activated when local coverage proves inadequate.\n\n## RISKS AND CONTROL\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe second program, with a cover limit of US$50 million, concerns  the  subsidiaries  located  in  North  America.  This program is structured differently to deal with the specific nature  of  liability  risks  in  the  United  States.  It  is  divided into several lines of coverage, requiring it to be placed, if needed, on the London insurance market. Exclusions are in line with current market practice in the United States and primarily concern contractual liability, pollution and thirdparty consequential loss.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  two  programs  described  above,  a number of supplementary programs have been set up in order  to  bring  the  total  coverage  limit  to  a  level considered compatible with the Group's businesses.\n\nWithin  the  operating  units,  action  is  taken  to  raise awareness  of  civil  liability  risks,  and  the  units  are motivated to control costs by assuming a deductible that does  not,  however,  constitute  self-insurance.  The  Group also runs a risk prevention program at its operating units with  the  support  of  the  Environment,  Health  and  Safety Department.\n\nFurthermore, to meet the environmental requirements set out  in  Directive  2004/35/EC  of  April  21,  2004  on environmental  liability  with  regard  to  the  prevention  and remedying of environmental damage, the Group has since 2017  had  a  specific  policy  with  a  limit  currently  set  at \u20ac75  million  per  year.  This  policy  offers  worldwide  cover, excluding  the  United  States,  for  the  Group's  civil environmental  liability  arising  in  relation  to  damage affecting natural resources (protected natural species and habitats, soil and water) as a result of its activities.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nJoint  ventures  not  controlled  by  the  Group  and  minority interests  are  excluded  from  the  scope  of  the  above policies. These insurance policies are taken out separately.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6 6 6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

The three lines of defense model is therefore adopted by Saint -Gobain:\n\n- \u00b7 In  the  first  line  of  defense,  companies  employ  an internal  control  and  risk  management  system  tailored to their situation, at the initiative of the Chief Executive Officers  and  local  managerial  structures  (Regions, countries and activities). The companies have access to Shared Services Centers (Finance, Human Resources Payroll)  and  IT  expertise.  It  is  essential  that  there  is  a segregation  of  tasks  between  these  organizations  for successful skills optimization and transaction security;\n- \u00b7 In the second line, Group Internal Control establishes an internal control reference framework applicable to all, in addition to specific guidelines prepared by the Group's corporate departments; and\n- \u00b7 The  third  line  involves  verification  of  the  proper application  of  the  internal  control  principles  which  is carried  out  in-house  by  the  Audit  Department  and externally by the Statutory Auditors.\n\n## 6.2.1 COMPAGNIE DE SAINT-GOBAIN'S INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n## The aims of internal control and risk management\n\nThe  Saint -Gobain  internal  control  and  risk  management system  is  part  of  the  legal  framework  applicable  to companies listed on the Euronext Paris regulated market, and is inspired by the reference framework on the internal control and risk management system of the AMF (French Financial  Markets  Authority)  and  the  'Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission' (COSO).\n\nSaint -Gobain Group's internal control and risk management  system  is  supported  by  a  continuous improvement  process  and  an  Internal  Control  Reference Framework.  This  is  a  whole  set  of  resources,  behaviors, procedures  and  actions  tailored  to  each  company's specific characteristics which:\n\n- \u00b7 enables it to appropriately address material operational, financial or compliance risks;\n- \u00b7 helps  it  to  manage  its  operations  and  meet  its objectives;\n- \u00b7 improves  the  efficiency  of  its  operations  and  ensure that its resources are used to best effect.\n\nIt  is  more  specifically  designed  to  provide  assurance concerning:\n\n- \u00b7 application  of  General  Management's  instructions  and orientations;\n- \u00b7 compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to the company;\n- \u00b7 the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  internal  operating, industrial, marketing, financial and other processes;\n- \u00b7 of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, in particular the prevention of fraud;\n- \u00b7 the reliability of financial information.\n\nBy promoting constant improvement in all entities, internal control  creates  value  and  supports  the  companies' performance.\n\n## The internal control and risk management environment\n\n## The Group's core values\n\nInternal  control  is  based  on  values  and  rules  of  conduct which are formalized in:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Saint -Gobain  Group  Principles  of  Conduct  and Action:  professional  commitment,  respect  for  others, integrity,  loyalty,  solidarity,  compliance  with  the  law, respect  for  the  environment,  protection  of  health  and safety  at  work  and  employee  rights  (cf.  section  1.2.2, p.  14).  The  Principles  of  Conduct  and  Action  are distributed to all Group employees; the Group's Human Rights policy (cf. section 3.2.1 , p.89);\n- \u00b7 the  Saint -Gobain  Attitudes:  being  close  to  customers, acting  as  an  entrepreneur,  innovating,  being  flexible, building an open and engaging culture;\n- \u00b7 the  Group's  compliance  program:  competition  law, economic sanctions and export control, anti-corruption, influence peddling and fraud, professional associations, conflicts  of  interest,  gift  policy,  etc.  (cf.  section  6.2.5, p. 241).\n\nExecutives leading by example, and control at all levels in implementing  the  Principles  is  essential  in  disseminating these values, which all Group employees must adhere to.",

        "page_content": "## The organizational model\n\nThe implementation of an internal control system requires:\n\n- \u00b7 appropriate  organization  which  provides  a  framework for the planning, execution, monitoring and management of operations;\n- \u00b7 clearly defined roles and responsibilities, according to a human  resources  management  policy  which  recruits people  with  the  knowledge  and  skills  necessary  to perform  their  jobs,  providing  them  with  training  to develop employees' knowledge;\n- \u00b7 rotation  and  succession  plans  for  key  positions  and replacement solutions during temporary absences;\n- \u00b7 powers  of  attorney  granted  to  suitable  people  in  line with the principle of task segregation.\n\n## Dissemination of policies and programs\n\nThe policies and programs devised by the Group's Senior Management  are  disseminated  within  each  corporate department. The Regions, countries and activities formalize  guidelines  and  directives  within  their  scope  of responsibility in line with the Group's own guidelines and directives, ensuring that they are applied when conducting operations.\n\n## Information systems\n\nThe  Group's  organizations  and  their  operations  rely  to  a large  extent  on  information  systems,  information-sharing and  the  digitalization  of  processes.  Information  systems must  therefore  be  efficiently  protected  in  terms  of  both physical  and  logical  security.  The  Saint -Gobain  Group companies thus comply with the security rules set out by the  Group  Information  Systems  Department  and  Internal Control  (automated  controls  described  in  detail  in  the 'ITAC' reference base).\n\n## RISKS AND CONTROL\n\nInternal control\n\n## Internal control and risk management process\n\nWithin  Saint -Gobain,  internal  control  is  a  continuous  and ongoing process that integrates risk management procedures.\n\nDue  to  the  constantly  changing  environment  and  the regulatory  context,  the  companies  must  take  steps  to identify,  evaluate,  process  and  monitor  any  risks  which may affect them.\n\n## At Group entity level\n\nThe internal control and risk management process can be summarized in four stages:\n\n- \u00b7 analysis  of  the  main  identifiable  risks.  The  company analyzes  its  main  risks,  and  thus  identifies  what  could prevent  it  from  meeting  its  objectives,  as  well  as dangers that  could  harm  its  interests  or  have  a  major impact on its internal control situation;\n- \u00b7 developing controls that are proportionate to the risks involved in each process;\n- \u00b7 communicating  the  objectives  of  internal  control  to employees and implementing controls;\n- \u00b7 permanent  oversight  of  and  regular  checks  on  the effectiveness of internal control: a compliance statement  is  signed  each  year  by  the  Chief  Executive Officers according to the scope defined for each annual campaign.\n\nThis process is described in the Internal Control Reference Framework  (cf.  section  6.2.5,  p.  241)  and  applies  to  the entire Group.\n\n## At the level of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain\n\nThe Audit, Risks and Internal Control Department updates the Group's risk mapping every year. These updates draw on  the  contributions  of  the  various  management  levels, and  the  results  are  submitted  to  the  Audit  and  Risk Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nFor  the  various  risks  analyzed,  the  necessary  corrective action is taken.\n\n## 6.2.2 PARTIES INVOLVED IN INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nEveryone within the organization has some responsibility for  internal  control  and  risk  management,  from  General Management  down  to  the  employees  of  the  individual entities.\n\n## The Board of Directors of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain and the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nThe  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  periodically  reviews  the organization  of  the  Group's  internal  control  and  risk management (cf. section 5.1.2, p.171).\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee is specifically tasked with monitoring the process of preparing financial information and  the  effectiveness  of  the  internal  control  and  risk management system.\n\nIt also reviews the risks map prepared by the Audit, Risks and Internal Control Department.\n\nIt  analyzes significant internal control incidents, results of audits  and  oversees  the  corrective  actions  necessary  to address failures.\n\nFinally, it reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its work  and  notifies  the  Board  promptly  of  any  issues encountered (cf. section 5.1.2, p.171).\n\n## Group Management\n\nSaint -Gobain's  Management  oversees  implementation  of the Group's internal control and risk management process and the existence and effectiveness of appropriate internal control monitoring systems within the Group's subsidiaries.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors signed a charter on April 16, 2021 with the Audit, Risks and Internal  Control  Department to reiterate the principles of audit, internal control and risk management which support the Group's teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Each  Managing  Director  is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 the  relevance  and  effectiveness  of  the  internal  control system in place within their entity;\n- \u00b7 its compliance with the Group's internal control system;\n- \u00b7 appropriate  management  of  the  risks  faced  by  their entity.\n\nThis  responsibility  cannot  be  delegated.  Management exercises  this  by  relying  on  the  company's  functional Directors, operational staff and the site Directors.\n\nTo  build  an  internal  control  system  adapted  to  their activity,  the  Chief  Executive  Officers  of  the  companies aim to:\n\n- \u00b7 establish the fundamental bases for internal control and risk management,  and  in  particular  the  controls described in the Internal Control Reference Framework;\n- \u00b7 adapt the internal control and risk management system by  analyzing  specific  risks  and  enhancing  the  internal control  system  to  include  checks  tailored  to  the management of identified risks;\n- \u00b7 roll  out  the  internal  control  and  risk  management system on all of the sites;\n- \u00b7 oversee  the  internal  control  and  risk  management system.\n\n## 6.2.4 THE PROCEDURE FOR MONITORING THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe Audit, Risks and Internal Control Department monitors the  internal  control  and  risk  management  systems  using four main factors:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance statement;\n- \u00b7 internal audits;\n- \u00b7 action plan monitoring;\n- \u00b7 monitoring of fraud and incidents.\n\nThe results of this oversight are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## The compliance statement\n\nThe  Managing  Directors,  for  the  applicable  management levels, report to the Group's General Management on their levels  of  internal  control  via  an  annual  compliance statement.\n\nThe  form  includes  a  certain  number  of  key  checks extracted from the Internal Control Reference Framework.\n\nThe Managing Director must provide assurances that:\n\n- \u00b7 the  controls  selected  are  implemented  in  a  compliant and efficient manner;\n- \u00b7 the action plans arising from the self-assessment have been activated and implemented within the given time frames;\n- \u00b7 significant internal control incidents, fraud and breaches of the Principles of Conduct and Action were reported to the Audit, Risks and Internal Control Department or via the Group whistle-blowing system.\n\nThe Managing Directors make a personal commitment to the accuracy of the self-assessment by signing a letter of commitment at the end of the form.\n\nAt the second level, the Directors of Clusters, Regions and HPS validate all compliance statements belonging to their respective scopes.\n\nThe  compliance  statements  and  the  action  plans  are gathered, summarized and monitored by the Audit, Risks and Internal Control Department. They are covered in an annual  report  to  the  Group's  Management  team  and  the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Internal audits\n\nInternal audits are centralized at Compagnie de Saint -Gobain level. The Vice-President of Audit, Risks and Internal  Control  reports  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors. Internal auditors located at the Group's headquarters  or  in  the  countries  report  directly  to  the Audit,  Risks  and  Internal  Control  Department  and  work under its authority.\n\nThe  audits  are  scheduled  based  on  long-term,  predetermined criteria, in line with a yearly audit plan which is designed  taking  into  account  the  requirements  of  the company's  General  Management,  corporate  departments and operational departments. The audit plan prepared by the  Audit,  Risks  and  Internal  Control  Department  is approved by the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nThe  aim  of  the  audits  is  to  evaluate  the  relevance  and effectiveness of the internal control systems of the Group and  its  subsidiaries  and  to  carry  out  cross-business missions  with  an  operational  benefit.  Generally,  they include an examination of the internal control environment, risk analysis system, internal control organization  and  procedures  and  information  systems  of one or more processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6 6 6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## RISKS AND CONTROL\n\nInternal control\n\nThe auditors use IT tools provided to them to analyze the data systematically (data analytics) and share the results operationally with the entities:\n\n- \u00b7 a  performance-oriented  tool  for  process  analysis  that can  be  used  to  analyze  and  represent  an  entity's organizational  structure  and  its  processes,  to  identify bottlenecks and irregularities in process flows;\n- \u00b7 a  compliance-oriented data analysis tool  that  is  useful in targeted  searches  for  inconsistencies  with  the internal control rules in place.\n\nThese two highly complementary tools thoroughly analyze the  populations  concerned  (transactions,  master  files, access rights, etc.), so that anomalies can be detected and the most reliable conclusions reached.\n\nAt  the  end  of  the  work,  the  internal  auditors  design  a priority  action  plan  in  conjunction  with  the  entity  which should improve the coverage of the risks identified; they also produce a report setting out their main observations and  recommendations.  The  report  is  then  sent  to  the Group's General Management  and  the operational department to which the entity reports.\n\n2022 was also marked by the Covid-19 health crisis, which disrupted the normal course of business.\n\n## Action plan monitoring\n\nThe 'INTERACT' integrated audit and internal control tool centralizes:\n\n- \u00b7 actions taken to correct the non-compliance identified during the annual compliance statement campaign;\n- \u00b7 the  priority  action  plans  defined  following  the  audits carried out;\n- \u00b7 the  main  actions  defined  as  part  of  the  annual  risk mapping campaign.\n\nThe INTERACT tool also enables entities to trigger action plans independently, as part of a dynamic management of their internal control.\n\nThis  means  that  each  Group  company  has  access  to  a centralized operational platform it can use to manage its action  plans  by  reporting  the  corrective  measures  taken and  the  progress  made  compared  with  the  predefined implementation schedule. The corporate departments can also use the system to monitor these action plans.\n\nFurthermore,  a  dashboard  circulated  at  the  Group's different management levels makes it possible to monitor the  results  of  the  compliance  statements,  internal  audit grades and the progress of the related action plans.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Monitoring of fraud and internal control incidents\n\nFraud  and  other  major  internal  control  incidents  are closely monitored by the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Facts to be reported to the Group\n\n- \u00b7 Accounting  anomalies  and  alterations  which  damage the integrity of the financial information, irrespective of whether they are favorable or unfavorable to the entity or the Group;\n- \u00b7 Misappropriation  or  jeopardizing  of  assets,  whether tangible or intangible;\n- \u00b7 Events  likely  to  be  construed  as  acts  of  passive  or active corruption, or influence peddling;\n- \u00b7 Violations of laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 Other  violations  of  the  Principles  of  Conduct  and Action.\n\n## Alert procedure\n\n## Fraud alert procedure\n\nThe Group's Fraud Officer ensures monitoring by applying a  single,  centralized  procedure  which  all  of  the  Group's subsidiaries  must  follow.  The  facts  are  reported  using  a standard form available on the Security Intranet under the fraud section, which describes the facts and the measures taken.  The  declaration  is  updated  by  the  entity  as necessary. These declarations are then communicated by the Fraud Officer to the relevant management bodies.\n\n## Group whistle-blowing system\n\nThe  Group's  internal  whistle-blowing  system  makes  it possible to collect reports from any employee concerning conduct  or  situations  which  are  contrary  to  the  Group's Principles  of  Conduct  and  Action  and  the  Group's  AntiCorruption  policy,  offenses  or  crimes  or  serious  and obvious  violations  of  laws  or  regulations  (for  details,  see the Saint -Gobain Group Alert System policy). The internal whistle-blowing  system  is  accessible  at  the  following address: https://www.bkms-system.com/saint -gobain/fr.\n\nWhen the eligibility conditions for the report are met, the reported  facts  are  investigated  in  a  professional  and independent  manner  and  the  investigations  coordinated by duly trained alert examiners.\n\n## Whistle-blower protection system\n\nThe  whistle-blower  is  protected  under  the  terms  of  the Whistle-blowing policy.",

Each  ICRF  control  is referenced  against  the  relevant  risk  sub-categories.  Each process  contains  a  control/risk  matrix  used  to  refer specifically  to  risk  types  by  control  and  contributing  to understanding the control system.\n\nSection  3  of  the  Internal  Control  Reference  Framework presents the list of mandatory controls to be implemented by  all  Group  subsidiaries  (250  controls  in  the  2022 version).\n\n## The Mini ICRF\n\nThis  framework  has  the  same  structure  as  the  standard ICRF with 17 chapters. It sets out 100 controls, which have been  carefully  selected  and  developed  for  small  entities. The  Mini  ICRF  also  presents  a  practical  tool  for  the consolidation of newly acquired companies.\n\n## ITACs\n\nThe  Automated  Control  Reference  Framework  (ITAC) supplements  the  Group's  Internal  Control  Reference Framework (ICRF) and lists the controls that are wholly or partially  automatable,  the  implementation  of  which  is mandatory. The Group companies are responsible for the implementation  of  this  reference  framework  in  the business applications within their scope (e.g. SAP) in order to  guarantee  the  perpetuation  of  the  control,  limit  its recurring  costs  and  minimize  the  risk  of  human  error  or fraud.\n\nIn the 2022  edition  of  the  ITAC  standard,  which covers  eight  processes,  there  are  97  controls  listed. They  are  divided  into  three  categories:  automated process,  automated  workflow  approval  and  automated reporting (R).\n\nThere are also two thematic manuals.\n\n## ICQRF\n\nThe ICQRF (Internal Control Quality Reference Framework) manual deals with internal control applied to quality.\n\n## ACRF\n\nThe ACRF (Anti-corruption Reference Framework) manual summarizes  the  internal  controls  related  to  the  fight against corruption and influence peddling.\n\nAll of the reference frameworks are available on the Audit, Risks and Internal Control Intranet.\n\nOther tools are also available on the Intranet site to help entities implement the controls (tool box: typical procedures,  flow  diagrams,  library  of  controls)  and  best practices.\n\nThe best practices are compiled by:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Internal  Audit  Department  -  auditors  gather  best practices during their audit missions;\n- \u00b7 the  Internal  Control  Department,  using  a  system  of external  monitoring  (notably  the  French  Audit  and Internal Control Institute, IFACI);\n- \u00b7 entities that agree to share their tools.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6 6 6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

It  is based on the principle of continuous improvement. It takes into account:\n\n- \u00b7 international management standards in the three areas of EHS: ISO 45001: 2018 for health and safety and ISO 14001: 2015 for the environment;\n\n\u00cb\n\nA new version of the EHS standard was published in 2020 and made available in 2021. It is based on the conviction that the implementation of an effective EHS management system  in  the  branches  is  a  necessary  condition  for  the long-term improvement of their EHS performance.\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  requirements  of  the  EHS standard  is  assessed  through  EHS  audits:  ESPR  audit  on the Distribution and ISA (Integrated System Assessment) scope launched in 2018 for the industrial scope. An audit system more suitable for institutions whose management system is not ISO-certified, called the ISA-MINI audit, was developed in 2020 and gradually rolled out since 2021. A new version of the ISA audit was developed and tested in 2022  to  take  into  account  the  evolution  of  the  EHS database  in  2021,  and  will  be  launched  in  2023.  The reflection on the EHS  Saint -Gobain  audits  at  the Distribution  sites  was  conducted  in  2022,  leading  to  the launch of a new audit tool for distribution sites in 2023.\n\nEach country is in charge of defining its multi-year audit program according to the prioritization criteria proposed by the central EHS team. The objective is to target sites and entities that need audit recommendations to progress. The number of EHS audits in the field increased again in 2022,  after  being  significantly  reduced  in  2020  and  2021 due to the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nFurthermore, the EHS Department continues to work with its network to develop and update Group EHS standards, which describe the minimum applicable requirements and/ or  methodologies.  These  standards  help  to  ensure  that risks are assessed and controlled on the same basis in all Group  entities,  irrespective  of  the  country  and  the  local laws  and  regulations  (see  chapter  3).  Among  the documents made available to the sites for the implementation  of  standards,  there  are  implementation guides, examples of procedures, training kits, questionnaires for assessing the implementation of standards and IT tools. Every year and as needed, certain documents and tools are updated or added. In 2020, an appendix concerning the Work Permit was added to the 'Health and  Safety Risk Assessment  and  Control' standard. A new version of the 'Work-Related Road Risks' standard  has  been  made  available,  as  have  updated versions  for  the  guides  for  the  implementation  of  'Work Permits', 'Working Alone' and 'Safety Management Audit Tool  (SMAT)  visits'.  A  standard  on  the  assessment  of environmental  risks  was  disseminated  with  a  guide,  and training  sessions  were  conducted.  Two  guides  on  risk management  in  the  event  of  'isolated  work'  and  when resuming activity to help sites manage the pandemic were also made available. In 2021, the guide on controlling risks linked to 'dangerous energies' (commissioning/decommissioning) was updated and a guide was created to be  referred  to  during  construction  projects.  This  update work  continued  in  2022  with  the  provision  of  a  new standard  on  'machine  safety'  and  'forklifts  and  other rolling  gear'.  A  new  communication  campaign  on  'the minute of reflection' was launched. And has been initiated a  new video training format in particular to focus on the priority  to  be  given  to  managing  potentially  serious events:  the  first  three  modules  relate  to  'SIPs  (Serious Injury Potential', 'SMAT (Safety Management Audit Tool)' and 'LOTO (Lock Out Tag Out)'.",

This framework is implemented in a continuous cybersecurity improvement plan adapted to each Business organization and Group teams. This plan covers global infrastructure,  local  infrastructure,  applications  and websites, and industrial systems.\n\nThese  rules  are  also  supplemented  downstream  by periodically updated  technical  standards  to  monitor technological developments  and  control  application, industrial and infrastructure services.\n\nThe Information Systems Department has notably defined and rolled out:\n\n- \u00b7 a  tool  (GRC,  Governance  Risk  and  Compliance)  for controlling  SAP  user  rights  and  managing  conflicting segregations  of  duties.  This  tool  will  be  gradually integrated into all the Group's SAP systems;\n\n## RISKS AND CONTROL\n\nInternal control\n\n- \u00b7 a technical standard (SAP4SG) to improve the security of SAP environments. A tool is being rolled out across 47 SAP environments hosted by GDI in the Kyndryl (P1) Datacenter to monitor and check the points covered by this standard:\n- -a  technical  standard  (SAP4SG)  to  improve  the security of SAP environments. A tool is being rolled out  across  47  SAP  environments  hosted  by  GDI  in the  Kyndryl  (P1)  Datacenter  to  monitor  and  check the points covered by this standard:\n- -implementing  security  patches  in  SAP  production and non-production environments,\n- -the  technical  configuration  of  the  environments  to improve security,\n- \u00b7 the monitoring of technical roles, profiles and accounts, as well as high privilege accounts;\n- \u00b7 a technical standard to manage technical and business accounts  that  access  to  applications  (ATA/ABA, Application  Technical  Accounts/Application  Business Accounts);\n- \u00b7 a Web  Application Secured Development (3.2) standard (WASD);\n- \u00b7 a  technical standard to Secure the Hosting of Internet Applications (SHIA);\n- \u00b7 a  technical  standard  for  SaaS  systems  which  defines responsibilities and security measures for implementation;\n- \u00b7 a series of security rules for the annual security control of  the  central  and  regional  datacenters  (Datacenter Security  Rules  4  SG)  and  the  Public  Cloud  Security Rules;\n- \u00b7 a  technical  standard  for  the  security  of  applications hosted by Saint -Gobain partners for publication on the internet;\n- \u00b7 the  methodology  for  the  assessment  of  Cybersecurity risks used to assess the measures to be implemented to integrate security into all projects from the first stage, and into contracts with suppliers.\n\nIn  addition,  an  ITAC  (Information  Technology Automated Controls) repository has been published since 2012 and is updated  regularly.  It  is  a  complement  to  the  Internal Control Reference Framework that describes the automatic or semi-automatic IT controls of key purchasing, sales, inventory, production, human resources, treasury and accounting processes. It is valid for all Group ERPs (SAP, Movex, QAD, Exact).\n\n## Industrial and distribution risk prevention manual\n\nThe Group's policy for prevention of property damage and the  resulting  operating  losses,  compiled  as  part  of  an internal  collection  of  standards  and  best  practices,  is defined  by  the  Risk  and  Insurance  Department.  The  Risk and Insurance Department coordinates the implementation  of  the  policy  by  the  Group's  operational entities in its different businesses.\n\nWithin  the  business  and  regional  entities,  Prevention Coordinators  manage  the  application  of  Group  policy within the scope of their activities.\n\nAt  site  level,  those  in  charge  of  Prevention  Management perform  an  annual  self-assessment  of  risks  at  their  sites using  a  risk  rating  software  package.  This  tool  assesses risks as well as the corresponding levels of protection and prevention.  This  self-assessment  is  updated  annually  by the  industrial  sites, the  Research  and  Development Centers and logistical sites. A special assessment is carried out for the points of sale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6 6 6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

The sites  update  their  action  plans  with  a  view  to  improving their level of prevention  and  protection  based  on recommendations prepared by these prevention engineers.\n\n## Tools of the Group's compliance culture\n\nThe  culture  of  compliance  that  drives  the  Group  has developed through its values, which are formally stated in the Principles of Conduct and Action.\n\nThe ethics and compliance program is strongly focused on the  prevention  and  detection  of  risks  and  is  now structured around  the  following  main  themes:  the promotion  and  defense  of  the  Principles  of  Culture  and Action; the fight against corruption and influence peddling; the prevention of money laundering; compliance with the rules on competition law, economic sanctions and export  control;  monitoring  of  the  vigilance  plan  and respect for human rights; and personal data protection.\n\nThe tools used in implementing the program include:\n\n- \u00b7 a  dedicated  intranet,  called  Compliance,  on  which  key messages are posted and tools made available;\n- \u00b7 online  training  modules  such  as  Adhere  (Principles  of Conduct  and  Action),  ACT  (preventing  corruption), Comply  (competition  law),  and  SGU  -  Economic Sanctions and Export Control -Saint-Gobain Embargoes  (rules  relating  to  economic  sanctions  and embargoes, for persons concerned);\n- \u00b7 in-person, hybrid or team training;\n- \u00b7 the  dissemination  and  implementation  of  internal policies such as:\n- -the  policy  on  the  alert  system  in  place  at  the Saint -Gobain Group,\n- -the anti-corruption policy and  its procedures, particularly relating to gifts and invitations, conflicts of interest, or sponsorship and patronage operations,\n- -the Group policy on management of the corruption risk by Human Resources,\n- -sales agents and intermediaries policy,\n- -the 'buyer' and 'supplier' charters,\n- -policy on economic sanctions and control of exports,\n- -membership in professional associations policy;\n- \u00b7 distribution of practical and technical guides:\n- -the Thread of Competition,\n- -20 best practices in competition law for purchasers,\n- -good  human  rights  practices  (child  labor,  forced labor,  worker  housing,  recruitment  agencies  and security forces),\n- -the Lexia video on the alert system;\n- \u00b7 frequent  dissemination  of  messages  by  the  Chief Executive  Officer,  the  Corporate  Secretary  and  the Chief  Executive  Officers  of  the  regions,  countries  and activities  of  the  Saint -Gobain  Group,  via  the  Skyline publication or other forums;\n- \u00b7 a network of compliance and ethics managers present locally and covering, within their respective scopes, all the matters concerned.\n\n## 6.2.6 ORGANIZATION OF INTERNAL CONTROL IN PREPARING AND PROCESSING FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION TO THE SHAREHOLDERS\n\n## Compagnie de Saint -Gobain individual (parent company) financial statements\n\nThe Accounting Department is responsible for producing financial  information  for  shareholders,  partners  and  other third parties in accordance with French legal requirements. This  information  is  prepared  using  the  standards  and principles in force. These are generally accepted principles such  as  the  going  concern  principle,  the  principles  of consistent application of accounting policies, alignment of the  opening  balance  sheet  with  the  prior-period  closing balance sheet, recognition of expenses in the same period as  the  income  to  which  they  relate,  segregation  of accounting periods and substance over form.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Accounting organization\n\nThe  accounting  organization  is  based  on  the  rules, methods and procedures set out in the Group's doctrine memos.  It enables the monthly  reconciliation and substantiation of the accounts and the true and fair view of the events which are represented. The organization also has an advisory role and works upstream to anticipate the accounting impacts of events and the regulatory changes that are likely to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nThe chart of accounts is aligned with the Company's needs in terms of classification of transactions, and complies with the  materiality  principle.

Specifically, cost center managers receive monthly schedules listing the expenses incurred  under  their  signature,  allowing  them  to  check these  expenses  and  also  to  compare  actual  and  year-todate expenses with the initial budget.\n\nA summary of these cost accounting reports is sent to the Finance Department and the Group's General Management at the end of each month.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  measures  are  implemented  to strengthen  the  arrangements  for  managing  accounting risks  and  contributing  to  the  reliability  of  the  financial statements.\n\nFor  this  purpose,  since  2016,  Group  units  have  been subject to a Balance Sheet Review (BSR) procedure under the  direction  of  the  Group  Financial  Control  Department, to increase the level of accounting control by the Finance Department of each entity.\n\n## The Group's consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Group  Consolidation  and  Reporting  Department.  The department is also responsible for updating consolidation procedures, training,  and  integrating  the  subsidiaries  into the  consolidation  process,  processing  information,  and utilizing, maintaining and developing consolidation systems and the Financial Reporting System for the Group and for regions and HPS.\n\n## Group standards\n\nThe  Consolidation  Department  provides  information  and periodic  training  for  the  subsidiaries  in  conjunction  with the  Regions  and  HPS.  To  do  so,  it  has  a  consolidation manual,  several  entry  aid  guides,  an  intranet  site  and  an online training tool in French and English. New consolidation  instructions  are  issued  for  each  monthly closing,  describing  the  changes  compared  with  the previous  period-end  and  enhancements  to  reporting systems,  standards  and  procedures,  in  collaboration  with the Group's Accounting Standards and Pension Liabilities Department.\n\nEach  year,  the  Consolidation  Department  offers  training sessions.\n\n## RISKS AND CONTROL\n\nInternal control\n\n## Processing information and control of the financial statements\n\nEach  subsidiary  submits  its  accounts  in  accordance  with the  timetable  set  by  the  Company.  They  are  processed and  controlled  by  the  Consolidation  Department  and  by each  Region  and  HPS.  The  Consolidation  Department reviews  the  Group's  financial  statements  as  a  whole  and makes  the  necessary adjustments to prepare the consolidated  financial  statements.  These  consolidated accounts  are  submitted  to  General  Management  every month.\n\nThe consolidated financial  statements  are  then  examined by the Statutory Auditors in accordance with professional Auditing Standards.\n\n## Consolidation tools\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared using consolidation software equipped with a powerful, efficient and  highly  secure  database  aligned  with  the  Group's structure. The software is regularly updated to guarantee the  financial  information  system's  sustainability.  A  tightly controlled access procedure has also been put in place to ensure that the overall system  is secure, and  a comprehensive access review is performed once a year.\n\nThis tool manages a common database that contains the data of all of the Group's consolidated entities.\n\nIt feeds data into a secure reporting system accessible on the Group's Intranet, for the Group's General Management and the Region and HPS Management, contributing to the internal control of information output.\n\n## Account reliability through the reporting process\n\nThe  monthly  reporting  process  ensures  that  the  annual and interim consolidated financial statements are reliable. Hard closes  are  performed  at  May  31  and  October  31,  to reduce the workload at June 30 and December 31. These two  closes  are  thoroughly  reviewed  in  accordance  with the  same  principles  as  the  annual  and  interim  financial statements. At this time, the main financial managers from the Company and Regions analyze in detail the net income and  the  hard  close  balance  sheet.  The  entities'  accounts are  then  analyzed  before  the  final  closing  dates  and  are reviewed by the Statutory Auditors. This procedure helps to ensure  early  detection  of  any  errors  and  their adjustment during the actual close.\n\nA  consolidated  report  is  prepared  each  month  for  the Company's General Management, with supporting comments  and  analyses  of  material  events  over  the period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Most recently, on November 16, 2022, the Caisse des  D\u00e9p\u00f4ts  et  Consignations  disclosed  to  the  French Financial  Markets  Authority  (AMF)  that  it  had  exceeded, on November 9, 2022, directly and indirectly, the threshold of 5% of the voting rights of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain, holding,  directly  and  indirectly  through  CNP  Assurances, which it controls, 4.29% of the share capital and 5.15% of the voting rights.\n\nThe Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations specified that this disclosure  threshold  statement  was  the  result  of  the receipt of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain shares as collateral by CNP Assurances.\n\nIt is specified that the Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations disclosed to the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) that  it  had  dropped,  on  February  1,  2023,  directly  and\n\n## CAPITAL AND OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE\n\nCapital stock\n\nindirectly, below the threshold of 5% of the voting rights of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain, holding, directly and indirectly  through  CNP  Assurances  and  LBP  Pr\u00e9voyance, which it controls, 4.09% of the share capital and 4.97% of the voting rights.\n\nThe Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations specified that this disclosure threshold statement was the result of the return of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain shares held as collateral by CNP Assurances.\n\n## Statutory disclosure thresholds\n\nIn  addition,  the  Company  received  several  notifications during the year in respect of the obligation set out in the Company's  bylaws  to  disclose  any  and  all  changes  in interest  to  above  or  below  0.5%  of  the  share  capital  or voting  rights,  or  any  multiple  thereof.  Those  disclosure notifications, upwards  or  downwards,  were  received following the sale of shares or changes in Compagnie de Saint -Gobain's shares and voting rights.\n\n## 7.1.6 EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE\n\nAt December 31, 2022, Group employees held 8.75% of the share capital and 15.23% of the voting rights attached to Compagnie  Saint -Gobain  shares  through  the  Group Savings Plan Funds (1) .  The Group Savings Plan Funds are thus the Group's main shareholder.\n\nThe Group Savings Plan is a key feature of Saint -Gobain's social  contract.  It  represents  an  excellent  mean  of  giving employees a stake in the Group and sharing in its results. By  allowing  employees  to  become  shareholders,  the Group Savings Plan strengthens the motivation and sense of  belonging  of  employees  within  the  Group,  as  well  as aligning their interests with those of shareholders.\n\nEmployee  share  ownership  transactions  have  been  very successful both in France  and  internationally. The ownership  rate  of  the  Group  Savings  Plan  Funds  has remained  stable  over  the  past  10  years,  although  the Company  carried  out  capital  increases  reserved  for employees  each  year  (8.4%  of  the  capital  held  by  the Group Savings Plan Funds ( fonds commun de placement d'entreprise ,  FCPE)  as  at  December  31,  2012  compared with  8.75%  at  December  31,  2022).  This  stability  can  be explained in particular by employees' periodic disposals of available assets.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, approximately 64,000 employees of the  Group  were  shareholders  of  Compagnie  de Saint -Gobain through the Group Savings Plan.\n\nIn  2022,  4,916,097  shares  were  issued  under  the  Group Savings  Plan  offering  Group  employees  two  classic formulae  with  a  five-  or  ten-year  lock-up,  for  a  total  of \u20ac222.2  million  (compared  with  5,562,855  shares  and \u20ac199.2 million in 2021).\n\nIn France, 71% of French employees invested in the Group Savings  Plan  through  a  corporate  mutual  fund  (FCPE). Employees  in  27  other  European  countries  and  25 countries outside Europe were also given the opportunity to  take  part  in  the  Group  Savings  Plan.  In  total,  49,497 present  and  former  Group  employees  participated  in  the Group Savings Plan in 2022.\n\nA new plan has been launched in 2023. It gives employees the  opportunity  to  acquire  up  to  8,083,903  shares, i.e., approximately 1.6% of the share capital, with the classic five- or ten-year lock-up formulas.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

This option is provided for only in the following cases: (i) the rating of the bonds concerned  has  been  lowered  from  investment  grade  to non-investment  grade  by  a  designated  rating  agency;\n\n\u00cb\n\n(ii)  the  rating  of  the  bonds  concerned,  which  was  non investment  grade,  has  been  lowered  by  one  notch (e.g.  from  BB  +  to  BB)  by  a  designated  rating  agency; (iii)  the  rating  is  withdrawn - and, in each of these cases (i)  to  (iii),  the  action  of  the  rating  agency  is  expressly linked to the change of control -; or (iv) at the time of the change  of  control,  the  bonds  concerned  were  not  rated. Total outstanding  of  the  borrowings  concerned  at December 31, 2022 were \u20ac9,776 million.\n\nIn  addition,  the  agreements  relating  to  the  syndicated bank lines of credit in support of the general financing of the Group (dated December 2017 for respective amounts of \u20ac1,520 million and \u20ac2,480 million) also contain change of control clauses.\n\nFinally, certain deferred compensation and defined-benefit pension  plans  of  the  Group's  US  subsidiaries  would  be immediately  terminated  in  case  of  change  of  control, causing beneficiaries' rights to become due in 12 months. The amounts concerned total US$143 million at December 31, 2022.",

In the event of failure to meet specific ESG performance measures set out in the documentation relating  to  this  issue,  one  or  two  increases  (as  the  case may be) in the cost of borrowing (through higher interest rates) would occur in the final year leading up to maturity (for  further  details,  see  Note  10  to  the  consolidated financial statements, section 8.1, p. 311)\n\n## 7.2.4 NON-VOTING PARTICIPATING SECURITIES\n\n## Non-voting participating securities issued in June 1983\n\nIn June 1983, Compagnie de Saint -Gobain issued 1,288,299 non-voting  participating  securities  ( titres  participatifs ), each with a face value of FRF1,000, now fixed at \u20ac152.45, following the conversion to euros in 1999.\n\nSome of those securities have been repurchased over the years.

In addition to the quarterly meetings, numerous  meetings  and  roadshows  were  organized physically  or  virtually,  with  financial  analysts,  institutional investors and journalists. Specific meetings and conferences dedicated to ESG issues were also organized, with the participation of the Vice President for Sustainable Development and the Lead independent Director.\n\n2022  was  also  marked  by  the  announcement  of  several acquisitions  and  disposals  of  businesses  as  part  of Saint -Gobain's  strategy  of  continuing  to  optimize  its portfolio to improve the Group's growth and profitability, in line with its 'Grow & Impact' plan.\n\nThe sanitary conditions allowed the General Shareholders'  Meeting  to  be  held  in  person  on  June  2, 2022.  In  addition,  necessary  resources  were  in  place  to facilitate  remote participation by shareholders, with a full live webcast  on  the  Saint -Gobain  website  and  the possibility  for  shareholders  to  ask  questions  live  via  the webcast platform.\n\nThe  Group  also  favored  a  policy  of  exchanges  with individual  shareholders.  Several  physical  visits  of  the showroom,  with  its  interactive  terminals,  and  of  the Saint -Gobain Tower were organized by the Shareholders' Club,  with  the  help  of  an  expert  guide.  The  shareholders discovered  more  than  80  Group  solutions  used  on  the floors  by  experimenting  with  the  different  comforts  in order to present and demonstrate many building materials\n\n\u00cb\n\ndeveloped by Saint -Gobain. These visits were followed by informal discussions during convivial moments.\n\nBenoit  Bazin,  Chief  Executive  Officer,  participated  in  the 'Investir  Day'  on  November  29,  2022,  to  present  the Group's transformation, recent results and growth prospects,  and  finally  the  strategy  for  2025,  before answering  shareholders'  questions.  On  this  occasion,  we also  answered  questions  from  individual  shareholders throughout the day at our stand.\n\nWe  also  communicate  regularly  on  the  Group's  various initiatives throughout  the  year  on  our  website:  our solutions  for  our  customers,  the  Group's  commitment  to carbon  neutrality,  and  the  web  series  'The  Extraordinary Tower',  which  takes  a  look  behind  the  scenes  of  the Saint -Gobain Tower.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  events  organized  throughout  the  year, the Investor Relations Department continued to communicate regularly with individual shareholders on the Group's many news items via its website, the 'Saint -Gobain  Shareholder'  app  and  the  Letter  to shareholders.\n\nThe 'Saint -Gobain Shareholder' app allows shareholders to follow  the  Group's  financial  news  and  find  essential  and useful  information  (share  price,  financial  calendar,  press releases,  etc.).  Finally,  the  Letter  to  shareholders,  sent twice  a  year  to  Group  shareholders  in  March  and September,  highlights  the  Group's  financial  results  and strategic priorities.\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  privileged  contact,  shareholders  can used the following address:\n\nactionnaires@saint-gobain.com\n\nCompagnie de Saint -Gobain also makes additional services available to holders of registered shares through UPTEVIA, to  improve  the  management  of  their  fully  registered shares.

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\n2022 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1.2 Estimates and assumptions\n\nThe  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in compliance  with  IFRS  requires  management  to  make estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  of assets and liabilities reported in the balance sheet and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the notes to  the  financial  statements,  as  well  as  the  reported amounts of income and expenses during the period. These estimates and assumptions are based on past experience and  on  various  other  factors  in  the  prevailing  economic and  financial  environment  which  makes  it  difficult  to predict future business performance. Actual amounts may differ  from  those  obtained  through  the  use  of  these estimates and assumptions.\n\nThe  main  estimates  and  assumptions  described  in  these notes  concern  the  measurement  of  employee  benefit obligations and share-based payments (see note 6, p. 291), asset  impairment  tests  (notably  the  assumptions  used  in the tests relating  to  the  Group's  commitments to reduce its  net  carbon  emissions)  and  the  determination  of  lease terms  (see  note  7,  p.  298),  provisions  for  other  liabilities (see  note  9,  p.  307),  the  measurement  of  financial instruments  (see  note  10,  p.  311),  and  taxes  (see  note  12, p. 323).\n\n## NOTE 2 IMPACT OF THE RUSSIA -UKRAINE CONFLICT\n\nAmid  the  fast-changing,  complex  environment  of  the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the Group's first priority has been to affirm its support for and solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian  people,  and  to  ensure  the  safety  of  all  its Ukrainian  employees  and  their  families  throughout  the world.\n\nThe Group's teams in Poland and Romania stepped up to provide humanitarian and financial aid to refugees in their countries.  This  was  in  addition  to  the  financial  support provided  by  the  Group,  in  particular  to  the  International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nThe main impacts of the conflict on the Group's strategy and  financial  performance  were  analyzed  from  various standpoints, as discussed below.\n\n## Group operating activities\n\nSince  the  outbreak  of  the  conflict  between  Russia  and Ukraine,  in  addition  to  the  Group's  application  of  the sanctions  imposed  against  Russia,  Saint -Gobain  has decided to halt all its exports to customers in Russia and Belarus, and all its imports from these two countries, and has shelved all new investment projects in these countries.\n\nNevertheless, its local Russian operations, which represent around  0.7%  of  the  Group's  worldwide  sales  and  do  not involve  any  local  partnerships,  continue  to  operate autonomously,  with  locally  produced  solutions  sold exclusively on local construction markets.\n\nIn  Ukraine,  Saint -Gobain  does  not  have  any  industrial operations, and its sales office in Kyiv has been closed.\n\nIn  organizational  terms,  Ukraine  is  now  included  in  a Poland-Ukraine cluster falling under the direct responsibility of the management team in Poland.\n\nOne  of  the  indirect  consequences  of  the  conflict  is  the steep rise in inflation. As a result, the Saint -Gobain Group recorded  a  year-on-year  rise  of  around  \u20ac3  billion  in  its energy  and  raw  materials  costs.  Inflation  concerns  in particular the cost of energy, especially in Europe.\n\nThanks to its policy of hedging energy costs, its efforts in terms  of  pricing,  and  the  value-added  delivered  by  its solutions, the Saint -Gobain Group was able to generate a positive  sale  price/cost  (raw  materials  and  energy) differential  in  2022.  The  Group  has  hedges  in  place  for 2023 covering around 70% of its natural gas and over 60% of its electricity purchases in Europe.\n\nMore specifically,  the  countries  most  sensitive  to  Russian gas  supplies  for  Saint -Gobain  are  Germany,  Poland  and Czechia.  The  Group  has  drawn  up  various  plans  for continuing its operations in these countries, enabling it to significantly mitigate the impact of a scenario in which all or  some  supplies  of  Russian  gas  are  terminated.  Various levers can be used by the Group, such as the classification of  priority  industries,  using  alternative  energy  sources prepared  at  certain  sites,  and  increasing  flexibility  of  its production capacities.\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nInsofar  as  the  Group  continues  to  produce  and  sell  in Russia for the local market, and to ensure its local business can  continue  to  operate  with  complete  autonomy  of management  and  control  of  returns,  Saint -Gobain  still controls its Russian subsidiaries.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS  10,  its  Russian  and  Ukrainian companies  have  not  therefore  been  deconsolidated,  and continue  to  be  included  in  the  Group's  scope  of consolidation for the preparation of the 2022 consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Impairment review in light of the Russia/Ukraine conflict\n\nTotal non-current assets in Russia represent \u20ac207 million, or 0.6% of the Group's total non-current assets.\n\nNo  evidence  of  impairment  was  identified  for  these companies. Consequently, no impairment losses related to the Russia/Ukraine conflict were recognized in 2022.\n\n## Financial risks (credit, liquidity, forex)\n\nGiven the Group's limited presence in Russia and Ukraine, the conflict has not generated any credit or liquidity risks, and forex exposure is also being managed effectively.\n\nSince March 2, 2022, the Group has been using the Russian ruble  exchange  rate  published  by  Reuters  for  the translation of its consolidated financial statements.\n\nWhile  the  Russia/Ukraine  conflict  has  not  had  a  direct material impact on the financial statements for 2022, the situation  remains  unstable  and  complex.  The  Group therefore remains vigilant in analyzing the potential future impacts of the conflict.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 8 8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\n2022 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 3 CLIMATE ISSUES\n\nSustainability is essential in supporting the growth of the Saint -Gobain Group and sustainability issues are therefore an integral part of its growth outlook.\n\nResponding to climate challenges is therefore at the heart of the Group's strategy, and its net-zero-carbon commitment is taken into account in its financial decisions.\n\n## 3.1 The commitment to carbon neutrality is at the heart of the Group's strategy\n\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, Saint -Gobain signed the UN Global Compact's 'Business ambition for 1.5\u00b0C' pledge on September 23, 2019 in New York, thereby affirming its commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nIn  order  to  achieve  this  by  2050,  Saint -Gobain defined a 2030 roadmap in November 2020. The roadmap identifies the levers and action plans that will enable the Group to meet its goal of a 33% reduction in scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions in absolute terms compared to a 2017 baseline, and a 16% reduction for scope 3 emissions.\n\nThe  Group's  capital  expenditure  is  aligned  with  the investment requirements identified in this CO2 roadmap.\n\nSaint -Gobain's  roadmap  and  commitment  to  carbon neutrality by 2050 apply to all of its activities. To date, no activity has been identified as being incompatible with this target.\n\nAs  well  as  its  commitments  to  reduce  its  emissions through to 2030, the Group seeks to develop and propose solutions to help decarbonize the construction sector and its customers' markets.\n\n- \u00b7 After  validating  its  2030  greenhouse  gas  emissions reduction  targets  in  2020,  in  September  2022  the Science-Based  Targets  initiative  (SBTi)  approved  the Group's  commitment  to  being  net-zero-carbon  by 2050, considering its roadmap to be consistent with the new net-zero standard and the Paris climate agreement.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, Saint -Gobain was once again recognized for its leadership  in  the  fight  against  climate  change  by  the CDP, a global environmental non-profit organization. In 2022,  for  the  second  time  in  a  row,  the  Group  was included  in  the  CDP's  'Climate  Change  A  List' comprising  283  companies  out  of  the  more  than 15,000  that  responded  to  the  CDP's  2022  climate change questionnaire.\n- \u00b7 The innovative solutions developed by Saint -Gobain to improve  the  energy  performance  of  buildings  help reduce both the negative impact of construction on the environment  and  their  occupants'  energy  bills,  while also  enhancing  occupant  well-being.  Saint -Gobain's solutions  play  an  important  role  in  the  fight  against climate  change,  since  they  reduce  the  amount  of\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions by reducing energy use. The Group's thermal insulation and insulating glass solutions provide  benefits  in  terms  of  energy  performance  and greenhouse  gas  emissions  that  significantly  outweigh the  carbon  footprint  associated  with  their  production. In  2021,  Saint -Gobain  estimated  that  the  solutions produced  and  sold  by  the  Group  in  one  year  had helped  avoid  nearly  1,300  million  tonnes  of  CO2 emissions over their lifespan.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2022, the Group further strengthened its position in the  construction  chemicals  market  by  acquiring  GCP Applied  Technologies  Inc., a company  operating 50  production  sites  in  38  countries  whose  products play  a  significant  role  in  helping  to  decarbonize construction through innovative admixtures that reduce the carbon footprint of cement.\n- \u00b7 In order to increase the percentage of sales represented  by  its  sustainable  solutions,  Saint -Gobain has developed a method for evaluating the environmental benefits of its solutions for all stakeholders. It aims to generate 75% of its sales from sustainable solutions by 2025.\n\n## 3.2  The commitment to carbon neutrality is taken into account when preparing the Group's financial statements\n\nIn line with these commitments and targets, the Group has taken  into  account  climate  change  and  sustainable development  issues  in  its  financial  statements,  mainly  in the areas cited below.\n\n## A Group-wide commitment\n\nAll  Regions  and  High  Performance  Solutions  (HPS)  have drawn up dynamic CO2 roadmaps through to 2030, based on the principle of a yearly review and consistent with the main  financial  deadlines  (three-year  business  plan  and budget).\n\nThese  CO2  roadmaps  are  broken  down  by  country  or entity,  plant  and  project,  and  together,  will  be  used  to justify  the  Group's  2030  emissions  reduction  target. Specific projects have been identified and evaluated in all countries and are part of an investment plan set out in the 2030  CO2  roadmap,  with  an  average  budget  of \u20ac100 million per year between 2020 and 2030.\n\nThese roadmaps focus on improving operating efficiency, changing  the  energy  mix,  rolling  out  new  technologies, and investing to reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nMarketing  teams  are  also  involved,  adapting  product design to reduce environmental impact.",

It was  implemented  at  Saint -Gobain's  flat  glass manufacturing plant in Aniche, Northern France.\n- -In  Sweden in the first half of 2022, the Balsta plant carried  out  a  zero-carbon  plasterboard  campaign (scopes 1 and 2) powered by biogas and 100% green electricity, with up  to  30%  recycled  content. Elsewhere,  the  Group  is  building  two  fully-electric plants  in  Norway  and  Canada  with  net-zero-carbon production (scopes 1 and 2), powered by hydroelectricity. More than \u20ac90 million in investments  are  needed  to  electrify  these  plants, while more energy efficient processes enable energy savings of up to 30%.\n- -In line with the Group's objectives to accelerate the transition  to  a  circular  economy,  Saint -Gobain  was the  first  manufacturer  in  France  to  produce  and market  a  plasterboard  made  from  more  than  50%recycled gypsum.\n- \u00b7 The  signature  of  new  renewable  power  purchase agreements (PPA - scope 2) in North America (10-year PPA for 200MW of solar energy, which should reduce electricity-related  CO2  emissions  by  33%  for  its  145 industrial  sites  in  North  America),  in  Poland  (15-year contract  for  the  purchase  of  wind  and  solar  power, covering nearly 45% of electricity requirements), and in Spain (11-year contract for the purchase of wind, solar and  hydroelectric  power,  covering  55%  of  electricity requirements).\n\n## Basis of measurement applicable to assets incorporating the cost of emissions per tonne of CO2\n\nThe Group's commitments to carbon neutrality were taken into account when carrying out the sensitivity tests as part of  the  annual  impairment  testing  of  its  cash-generating units (CGUs).\n\nBased  on  information  on  current  CO2  emissions  from production sites, and factoring in projections and assumptions as regards business trends and CO2 emissions reductions (scopes 1 and 2), validated by each of  the  Regions  and  by  High  Performance  Solutions,  a projection  of  future  CO2  emissions  was  determined  for each site up to 2030.\n\nThese projections take into account planned investments to:\n\n- \u00b7 maximize  energy  efficiency  by  exploring  all  energy switching  options  (biofuel,  hydrogen  or  synthetic  fuel, green electricity);\n- \u00b7 make  products  lighter,  replace  them  with  low-carbon alternatives, increase recycled content and significantly rethink formulations and processes.\n\nFor the European Union scope, the Group has calculated projected CO2 emissions reductions up to 2030 based on detailed roadmaps  by  activity,  taking  into  account historical  business  levels,  a  factor  reflecting  exposure  to the risk of carbon leakage, and a cross-sector adjustment factor,  as  well  as  the  stock  of  CO2  emissions  allowances held at the end of December 2022.\n\nIt should be noted that the annual sensitivity tests for 2022 also factored in the assumption dated December 18, 2022 put  forward  by  the  European  Council  and  Parliament regarding carbon market reform, according to which free CO2  emissions  allowances  granted  to  industry  under  the European  Union  Emissions  Trading  Scheme  (EU  ETS) would be gradually phased out between 2026 and 2034 (100%), with 2.5% phased out by 2026, 5% by 2027, 10% by 2028, 22.5% by 2029 and 48.5% by 2030.\n\nThese CO2 emissions were valued on the basis of a euro price per tonne resulting from a panel of 11 analysts as of November 11, 2022 (source: Carbon Market Pulse Limited, an independent private company based in London).\n\n| (in euros/tonne)      |   2023 |   2024 |   2025 |   2026 |   2030 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Average (11 analysts) |     77 |     90 |    103 |    120 |    140 |\n\nFor  the  non-Europe  scope,  tonnes  of  CO2  emitted  were priced in the tests as from 2023 assuming a fixed price of \u20ac75  per  tonne  until  2030  and  no  government  support schemes such as CO2 emissions allowances.\n\nThis  assumption  of  \u20ac75  per  tonne  is  consistent  with  the application of an internal carbon price set by Saint -Gobain, and is  conservative  in  that  few  countries  outside  Europe have so far defined a price per tonne of carbon.\n\nIn addition to the action plans rolled out at its production sites, the Group has set two internal carbon prices:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac75 per tonne for major industrial investment projects and investments related to a change in energy source;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac150  per  tonne  for  R&D  investment  in  breakthrough technology, particularly 'low-carbon' projects.\n\nA similar approach  has  been  adopted  for  major acquisitions,  and includes the work that may be required to  ensure that the carbon impact of these acquisitions is compatible with Saint -Gobain's roadmap.\n\nSensitivity tests were carried on the Group's assets across all of its industrial activities (excluding Distribution and the recent Chryso/GCP and Kaycan acquisitions).\n\nThe discounted future cash flows, calculated on the basis of the three-year business plan (2023-2025)  were extrapolated to 2029 and then impacted by the projected cost of CO2 emissions net of the free emissions allowances received.  These  discounted  cash  flows  were  compared with  the  net  value  of  the  assets  at  December  31,  2022 (property,  plant  and  equipment,  intangible  assets  and working capital).\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\n2022 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nAs a result of the sensitivity tests performed based on the aforementioned  assumptions,  no  impairment  would  be recognized  against  the  Group's  non-current  assets,  since the headroom (\u20ac20.4 billion), i.e., the difference between discounted  future  cash  flows  and  the  net  value  of  the assets tested (\u20ac20.9 billion) is significantly positive.\n\nIt  should be noted that any increase in carbon prices will result in higher demand for Saint -Gobain's solutions, which is  a  driver  of  growth  in  business  volumes  and  cash generation.\n\n## CO2 emissions allowances\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Saint -Gobain Group had 4.4 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions allowances from the European  Commission.  Accordingly,  it  believes  that  its current  level  of  allowances  will  continue  to  cover  its emissions for at least five years.\n\n## Sustainable investments, research and development expenditure, and other expenditure aimed at combating climate change and protecting the environment\n\nInvestments  to  reduce  CO2  emissions  are  reported monthly by each Group company in the Group's financial reporting.\n\nTo  help  accelerate  progress  towards  carbon-neutral production, \u20ac1 billion has been set aside over the ten years from  2021  to  2030  (i.e.,  an  average  of  \u20ac100  million  per year) for investments and R&D.\n\n\u00cb\n\nIn  2022,  the  Group  set  aside  \u20ac128  million  in  capital expenditure  (\u20ac55  million  in  2021)  and  \u20ac63  million  in research  and  development  expenditure  (\u20ac44  million  in 2021) to further its CO2 emissions reduction strategy.\n\n## Sustainability-linked bond\n\nIn  August  2022,  Saint -Gobain  completed  a  debt  issue which  included  a  10-year  \u20ac500  million  SustainabilityLinked Bond (SLB) tranche paying a 2.625% coupon. The SLB is linked to two 2030 targets in relation to the 2017 baseline year: (i) reduce scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions by 33%,  and  (ii)  reduce  non-recovered  production  waste  by 80%. A 0.375% step-up would apply on the 2032 coupon if either of these targets is not met.\n\n## Executive compensation policy\n\nIn stepping up its commitment to carbon neutrality, since 2020  the  Group  has  increased  the  weighting  of  CSR objectives in the criteria determining short- and long-term executive compensation  plans.  CSR  objectives  now determine 20% of amounts paid out under long-term plans (versus  15%  previously),  and  10%  of  amounts  paid  out under  short-term  plans  (5%  previously),  while  CO2 objectives now account for 10% of long-term plans and 5% of short-term plans.\n\n## Consideration of future changes in regulations\n\nThe Group will continue to analyze the potential impacts of future changes in regulations related to climate change and  the  energy  transition  as  part  of  its  commitment  to achieve  carbon  neutrality  by  2050.  In  this  respect, Saint -Gobain closely monitors international and European projects on sustainability reporting.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\n2022 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 4 SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION\n\n## 4.1 Accounting principles related to consolidation\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements include the accounts  of  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  and  of  all companies  controlled  by  the  Group,  as  well  as  those  of jointly  controlled  companies  and  companies  over  which the Group exercises significant influence.\n\n## 4.1.1 Consolidation methods\n\n## Full consolidation\n\nCompanies  over  which  the  Group  exercises  exclusive control, either directly or indirectly, are fully consolidated.\n\n## Joint arrangements\n\nJoint  arrangements  that  meet  the  definition  of  joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method. Balance sheet  and  income  statement  items  relating  to  joint arrangements that meet the definition of joint operations are consolidated line-by-line based on the amount actually contributed by the Group.\n\n## Equity accounting\n\nCompanies  over  which  the  Group  directly  or  indirectly exercises  significant  influence  are  accounted  for  by  the equity method.\n\nThe  Group's  share  of  the  income  of  equity-accounted companies is shown on two separate lines of the income statement.  The  income  of  equity-accounted  companies whose  main  business  activity  is  in  keeping  with  the Group's core operational business is presented in business income  under  'Share  in  net  income  of  core  business equity-accounted  companies',  while  the  income  of  other equity-accounted companies is shown under 'Share in net income of non-core business equity-accounted companies' in pre-tax income.\n\n## 4.1.2 Business combinations\n\n## Step acquisitions and partial disposals\n\nWhen the Group acquires control of an entity in which it already holds an equity interest, the transaction is treated as a step acquisition (an acquisition in stages), as follows: (i)  as  a  disposal  of  all  the  previously-held  interest,  with recognition of any resulting gain or loss in the consolidated financial statements, and (ii) as an acquisition of all of the shares, with recognition of the corresponding goodwill  on  the  entire  interest  (previous  and  new acquisitions).\n\nIn  the  event  of  a  partial  disposal  resulting  in  the  loss  of control  (but  with  the  Group  retaining  a  non-controlling interest), the transaction is also treated as both a disposal and an acquisition, as follows: (i) as a disposal of the entire interest,  with  recognition  of  any  resulting  gain  or  loss  in the  consolidated  financial  statements,  and  (ii)  as  an acquisition  of  a  non-controlling  interest,  measured  at  fair value.\n\n## Potential voting rights and share purchase commitments\n\nPotential  voting  rights  conferred  by  call  options  on minority  interests  are  taken  into  account  in  determining whether  the  Group  exclusively  controls  an  entity  only when the Group has control.\n\nWhen  calculating  its  percentage  interest  in  controlled companies,  the  Group  considers  the  impact  of  cross  put and  call  options  on  minority  interests  in  the  companies concerned. This approach gives rise to the recognition in the financial  statements of an investment-related liability, included within other provisions and non-current liabilities, corresponding  to  the  present  value  of  the  estimated exercise  price  of  the  put  option,  with  a  corresponding reduction  in  non-controlling  interests  and  shareholders' equity.  Any  subsequent  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the liability are recognized by adjusting equity.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nUnder IFRS 10, non-controlling interests are considered as a shareholder category (single economic entity approach). As a result,  changes  in  minority  interests  with  no  loss  of control  continue  to  be  recorded  in  the  statement  of changes  in  equity  and  have  no  impact  on  the  income statement  or  balance  sheet,  except  for  changes  in  cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## 4.1.3 Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale - Discontinued operations\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  that  are  immediately  available  for sale, and for which a sale is highly probable within the next 12  months,  are  classified  as  non-current  assets  and liabilities  held  for  sale.  When  several  assets  are  held  for sale  in  a  single  transaction,  they  are  accounted  for  as  a disposal  group,  which  also  includes  any  liabilities  directly associated  with  those  assets.  The  assets  or  disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount  and  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell.  Depreciation/ amortization ceases when non-current assets are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale  are  presented  separately  on  two  lines  of  the consolidated  balance  sheet,  and  income  and  expenses continue  to  be  recognized  in  the  consolidated  income statement  on  a  line-by-line  basis.  The  reclassified  assets are carried at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and  their  carrying  amount.  At  the  end  of  each  reporting period, the value of the assets and liabilities held for sale is reviewed to determine whether any provision adjustments should be recorded due to a change in their fair value less costs to sell.\n\nAn  operation  is  classified  as  discontinued  when  it represents a separate major line of business for the Group, and when the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale have been met, or when the Group has sold the asset. Discontinued  operations  are  reported  on  a  single  line  in the  Group's  income statement. This line shows the aftertax net income from discontinued operations until the date of disposal and the gains or losses net of taxes realized on the  disposals  of  these  operations.  In  addition,  cash  flows generated by the discontinued operations are reported, by type  of  operation,  on  a  separate  line  in  the  consolidated statement of cash flows for the relevant periods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 8 8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\n2022 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 4.1.4 Intragroup transactions\n\nAll  intragroup  transactions  in  the  balance  sheet  and income statement are eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## 4.1.5 Translation of the financial statements of foreign companies\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented  in euros,  which  is  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain's  functional and presentation currency.\n\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries outside the Eurozone are  translated  into  euros  at  the  closing  exchange  rate, while income and expense items are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.\n\nThe  Group's  share  of  any  translation  gains  or  losses  is included in equity under 'Cumulative translation adjustments'  until  the  assets  or  liabilities  and  all  foreign operations  to  which  they  relate  are  sold,  liquidated  or deconsolidated.  In  this  case,  these  translation  differences are either taken to the income statement, if the transaction results  in  a  loss  of  control,  or  recognized  directly  in  the statement of changes in equity, if the change in minority interests does not result in a loss of control.\n\n## 4.1.6 Foreign currency transactions\n\nExpenses and income from operations in currencies other than the Company's functional currency are translated at the  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  transaction  date. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate and  any  exchange differences are recorded  in  the  income  statement. However,  exchange  differences  relating  to  loans  and borrowings  between  consolidated  Group  companies  are recorded  in  equity,  net  of  tax,  under  'Cumulative translation  adjustments',  as  they  are  in  substance  an integral part of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary.\n\n## 4.1.7 Hyperinflation\n\nUnder  IAS  29,  'Financial  Reporting  in  Hyperinflationary Economies',  financial  statements  prepared  based  on historical  cost  must  be  restated.  This  involves  applying  a general  price  index  that  enables  the  financial  statements to  be  presented  in  the  measuring  unit  in  force  at  the reporting date. All non-monetary assets and liabilities must therefore  be  adjusted  for  inflation  in  order  to  reflect changes  in  purchasing  power  at  the  reporting  date. Similarly,  the  income  statement  is  adjusted  for  inflation during  the  period.  Monetary  items  do  not  need  to  be restated  as  they  already  reflect  purchasing  power  at  the reporting date.\n\n## Argentina\n\nArgentina  has  been  classified  as  a  hyperinflationary economy  since  July  1,  2018.  IAS  29  therefore  applies  to entities  using  the  Argentine  peso  as  their  functional currency  (based  on  the  table  of  indices  issued  by FACPCE).\n\n## Lebanon\n\nLebanon  has  been  classified  as  a  hyperinflationary economy  since  October  2020.  As  from  December  31, 2020, IAS 29 is therefore applicable to entities using the Lebanese pound as their functional currency.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe Group's exposure to Lebanon is not material, as sales and total non-current assets in the country represent less than 1% of the Group's consolidated data.\n\n## Turkey\n\nSince  February  2022,  Turkey  has  had  a  three-year cumulative  inflation  rate  above  100%  and  was  therefore included in the list of hyperinflationary economies in March 2022. The Group's exposure to Turkey is not material, as sales and total non-current assets in the country represent less than 1% of the Group's consolidated data.\n\n## 4.2  Changes in Group structure\n\nSignificant  changes  in  the  Group's  structure  during  2022 and  2021  are  presented  below  and  a  list  of  the  main consolidated companies at December 31, 2022 is provided in note 16, p. 326.\n\n## 4.2.1 Transactions carried out in 2022\n\nIn 2022, Saint -Gobain acquired 36 consolidated companies for a total purchase price of \u20ac3,712 million. The Group also sold  19  consolidated  companies  for  a  net  sale  price  of \u20ac539 million.\n\n## Main acquisitions in 2022\n\nIn 2022,  acquisitions represented  full-year sales of \u20ac1,866 million and EBITDA of approximately \u20ac300 million.\n\n- \u00b7 On  January  2,  2022,  Saint -Gobain  completed  the acquisition  of  Igland  Industrier  AS,  a  manufacturer  of prefabricated  garages  for  villas,  which  also  has  an assembly services network in Norway.\n- \u00b7 On  January  7,  2022,  Saint -Gobain  completed  the acquisition of Fischer Ag, a Swiss  kitchen  and household appliance installation and repair company.\n- \u00b7 On  February  4,  2022,  Saint -Gobain  completed  the acquisition of Rockwool India Pvt Ltd, a major player in the production of stone wool in India. This followed the announcement on December 21, 2021 of the agreement signed by Saint -Gobain with the Alghanim group.\n- \u00b7 On April 1,  2022,  Saint -Gobain finalized the acquisition of Impac, a leading player in the construction chemicals market  in  Mexico.  This  acquisition  consolidates  the Group's leadership in Latin America while accelerating its  growth  in  the  region  by  enriching  its  range  of solutions for light and sustainable construction.\n- \u00b7 On  May  12, 2022, Saint -Gobain announced  the acquisition  of  Global  SFC,  a  major  player  in  nanoceramic window film coatings located in South Korea. The  acquisition,  which  closed  on  April  22,  2022,  will enhance the insulating properties of the Solar Gard film line,  a  world  leader  in  innovative  solar  control  and surface protection film technologies for the sustainable construction and mobility markets.",

This acquisition, which closed on April 20, 2022, will enhance Saint -Gobain's  global  footprint  and  enable  further localization  of  refractory  production  close  to  the  endcustomer.  It  will  enable  the  development  of  high-end glass  melting  applications  and  further  decarbonization of light metal smelting processes.\n- \u00b7 On August 1, 2022, Saint -Gobain announced that it had completed the acquisition of Kaycan on July 29, 2022. Kaycan is a family-owned manufacturer and distributor of exterior building materials in Canada and the United States.  Thanks  to  its  leading  position  on  siding  in Canada, this acquisition reinforces Saint -Gobain's worldwide leadership in light and sustainable construction  by  becoming  the  top  siding  player  in Canada and enlarging its vinyl offer across the United States.\n- The  acquisition  of  Kaycan  represents  pro  forma  fullyear  sales  of  \u20ac409  million  and  \u20ac70  million  in  EBITDA for 2022.\n- \u00b7 On  September  27,  2022,  Saint -Gobain  completed  the acquisition of GCP Applied Technologies, a major global player in construction chemicals. Offering highly complementary geographic and commercial footprints with Chryso, the acquisition of which was completed in September 2021, GCP represents a unique opportunity for  Saint -Gobain  to  establish  a  leading  worldwide presence in the growing construction chemicals sector, and furthers the Group's strategy as a worldwide leader in light and sustainable construction.\n- The acquisition of GCP Applied Technologies represents pro forma full-year sales of \u20ac952 million and \u20ac162 million in EBITDA for 2022.\n- \u00b7 Saint -Gobain completed the acquisition of Matchem in Brazil on December 22, 2022. Together with Quartzolit, a  leading  mortars  company,  TekBond,  a  specialist  in sealants and adhesives, and the recently acquired GCP Applied Technologies, Matchem rounds out Saint -Gobain's  construction  chemicals  line-up  with  a Brazilian  market  leader  boasting  24  production  sites.

The  transaction, which  is  not  subject  to  any  external  conditions,  is expected  to  close  in  the  first  quarter  of  2023,  following which  Saint -Gobain  will  no  longer  have  any  distribution businesses in the United Kingdom.\n\nThese  disposals  are  part  of  Saint -Gobain's  portfolio optimization  strategy,  which  is  designed  to  improve  the Group's growth and profitability profile.\n\nSince  the  assets  and  liabilities  held  for  sale  meet  the qualifying  criteria  (see  note  4.1.3,  p.  279),  the  United Kingdom  distribution  companies'  balance  sheets  were combined and measured as assets and liabilities held for sale  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  at  December  31, 2022, in accordance with IFRS 5.\n\nThese  entities  in  the  process  of  being  sold  were  not considered as discontinued operations within the meaning of IFRS 5 as they do not represent a major line of business for the Group.\n\nHowever, all  companies  classified  as  assets  and  liabilities held for sale in 2021 were disposed of in 2022.\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale break down as follows:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                                                                   | Dec. 31, 2022   |   Dec. 31, 2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and other  non-current assets | 529             |              66 |\n| Inventories, trade accounts receivable and other receivables                                        | 851             |             159 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                                           | 14              |               2 |\n| ASSETS HELD FOR SALE                                                                                | 1,394           |             227 |\n| Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits                                                 | (1)             |               3 |\n| Other current and non-current liabilities and provisions                                            | 50              |              11 |\n| Trade accounts payable, other payables and other current liabilities                                | 603             |              98 |\n| Debt and bank overdrafts                                                                            | 333             |              55 |\n| LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE                                                                           | 985             |             167 |\n| NET ASSETS (LIABILITIES) HELD FOR SALE                                                              | 409             |              60 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\n2022 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 5 INFORMATION CONCERNING THE GROUP'S OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n\n## 5.1 Income statement items\n\n## 5.1.1 Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue  generated  by  the  sale  of  goods  or  services  is recognized net of rebates, discounts and sales taxes when control  of  the  goods  or  services  has  been  transferred  to the customer. Revenue generated by the sale of goods is primarily recognized at the time the goods are delivered. Revenue generated by the sale of services is recognized when the  services  have  been  rendered,  or  based  on  the stage  of  completion  of  the  services,  as  calculated  based on costs incurred. Similarly, within the Distribution entities, estimated  returns  are  recognized  as  a  deduction  from revenue (sales) and reclassified within inventories for their net carrying amount, since there is a possibility that goods will  be  returned  within  the  allotted  timeframe.  A  liability relating  to  future  refunds  for  goods  returned  is  also recognized.\n\nRevenue  generated  under  construction  contracts  is accounted for by the Group's companies on a percentageof-completion basis, as calculated based on costs incurred. The  related  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  When  the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably,  contract  revenue  is  recognized  to  the  extent  of contract  costs  incurred  that  it  is  probable  will  be recovered.  When  it  is  probable  that  total  contract  costs will  exceed  total  contract  revenue,  the  expected  loss  is recognized as an expense immediately.\n\nConstruction contract revenues are not material in relation to total consolidated sales.\n\n## 5.1.2 Operating income\n\nOperating income is a measure of the performance of the Group's  different  reporting  segments  and  has  been  used by the Group as its key external and internal management indicator  for  many  years.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and losses are included in operating income, as are changes in the  fair  value  of  financial  instruments  that  do  not  qualify for hedge accounting when they relate to operating items. The  share  of  income  of  core  business  equity-accounted companies is also posted under operating income.\n\nSupplier  discounts  granted  to  entities  in  the  Distribution business are included in operating income as a reduction of  cost  of  sales.  Contractual  supplier  discounts  are customary  practice  in  the  industrial  goods  distribution sector. These discounts are mostly calculated by applying a  contractually  guaranteed  rate  by  product  type  to volumes purchased. The calculation is made automatically, based  on  the  supplier  invoices.  Consequently,  little judgment is needed when determining the amounts to be recognized  in  the  income  statement  for  these  discounts. Other discounts are calculated based on a step mechanism  linked  to  specified  targets,  whereby  the percentage discount increases as the entity achieves the various targets over a given period. In this case, judgment is required based on historical data, past performance and future  trends  in  order  to  determine  the  discount  to  be recognized  in  the  income  statement.  Such  judgment  is exercised in a prudent manner and consistently from one period to the next.\n\n## 5.1.3 Business income\n\nBusiness  income  includes  all  income  and  expenses  other than  financial  income  and  expense,  the  Group's  share  in net income  of  non-core  business  equity-accounted companies, and income taxes.\n\nBusiness income is detailed by type below:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                                                                                 | 2022     | 2021     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| SALES                                                                                                             | 51,197   | 44,160   |\n| Personnel expenses:                                                                                               |          |          |\n| Salaries and payroll taxes  (1)                                                                                   | (8,995)  | (8,296)  |\n| Share-based payments  (2)                                                                                         | (43)     | (58)     |\n| Pensions and employee benefit  obligations  (2)                                                                   | (189)    | (249)    |\n| Depreciation and amortization of  property, plant and equipment,  intangible assets and right-of-use  assets  (3) | (2,048)  | (1,934)  |\n| Share in net income of core  business equity-accounted  companies                                                 | 61       | 52       |\n| Other  (4)                                                                                                        | (34,646) | (29,168) |\n| OPERATING INCOME                                                                                                  | 5,337    | 4,507    |\n| Other business income                                                                                             | 245      | 176      |\n| Other business expense  (3)                                                                                       | (1,000)  | (747)    |\n| OTHER BUSINESS INCOME AND  EXPENSE                                                                                | (755)    | (571)    |\n| BUSINESS INCOME (EXPENSE)                                                                                         | 4,582    | 3,936    |\n\n- (1) The  year-on-year  increase  in  salaries  and  payroll  taxes  in  2022  is attributable  to  bullish  trading  during  the  year  and  an  unfavorable exchange rate effect.\n- (2) Share-based payments (IFRS 2 expense) and changes in employee benefit expenses are detailed in note 6, p. 291.\n- (3) Total depreciation  and  amortization  of  property,  plant  and equipment,  intangible  assets  and  right-of-use  assets,  along  with amortization charged against intangible assets within the scope of purchase price accounting (PPA), represented \u20ac2,164 million in 2022 versus \u20ac1,986 million in 2021.\n- (4) The 'Other' operating income line relates to cost of sales, supplier discounts  and  selling  expenses  for  Distribution  entities,  and  to transport costs, raw materials costs, and other production costs for the other entities. This item also includes research and development expenditure  recorded  under  operating  expenses,  amounting  to \u20ac520 million in 2022 (2021: \u20ac447 million).\n\n## 5.1.4 Other business income and expense\n\nOther  business  income  and  expense  mainly  include changes in provisions for claims and litigation  (excluding those  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  operations)  and environmental  matters,  disposal  gains  and  losses,  asset impairment, amortization charged against intangible assets  within  the  scope  of  purchase  price  accounting, restructuring costs incurred upon  the  disposal or discontinuation of operations and the costs of workforce reduction measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

The cost of inventories includes purchase costs  (net  of  supplier  discounts),  processing  costs  and other  costs  incurred  in  bringing  the  inventories  to  their present location and condition. Cost is generally determined using the weighted-average cost method, and in some  cases  the  First-In-First-Out  (FIFO)  method. Inventory costs may also include the transfer from equity of  any  gains/losses  on  qualifying  cash  flow  hedges  of foreign currency purchases of raw materials. Net realizable value is the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated completion and selling costs. No account is taken in the inventory valuation process of the impact of below-normal capacity utilization rates.\n\nAt  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  inventories  were  as follows:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                | Dec. 31,  2022   | Dec. 31,  2021   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Gross value                      |                  |                  |\n| Raw materials                    | 2,152            | 1,726            |\n| Work in progress                 | 446              | 367              |\n| Finished goods                   | 5,246            | 5,033            |\n| GROSS INVENTORIES                | 7,844            | 7,126            |\n| Provisions for impairment        |                  |                  |\n| Raw materials                    | (233)            | (191)            |\n| Work in progress                 | (17)             | (16)             |\n| Finished goods                   | (375)            | (321)            |\n| TOTAL PROVISIONS FOR  IMPAIRMENT | (625)            | (528)            |\n| INVENTORIES, NET                 | 7,219            | 6,598            |\n\n## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\n2022 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe  net  value  of  inventories  was  \u20ac7,219  million  at December  31,  2022  compared  with  \u20ac6,598  million  at December  31,  2021.  Impairment  losses  on  inventories recorded in the 2022 income statement totaled \u20ac332 million (2021: \u20ac279 million). Reversals of impairment losses  on  inventories  amounted  to  \u20ac222  million  in  2022 (2021: \u20ac219 million).\n\n## 5.4.2 Operating and non-operating receivables and payables\n\nTrade  accounts  receivable  and  payable  and  other receivables  and  payables  are  stated  at  their  carrying amount,  which  approximates  their  fair  value  as  they generally  have  maturities  of  less  than  three  months. Provisions for impairment are booked to cover the risk of total or partial non-recovery, within the limit of expected credit losses.\n\nThe Group deems that its exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to its diversified business line-up, broad customer base and global presence. Past-due trade receivables  are  regularly  monitored  and  analyzed,  and impairment losses recognized are adjusted where appropriate.\n\nThe  Group  has  various  securitization  and  factoring programs for its trade receivables. Receivables transferred under some of these programs continue to be shown on the  balance  sheet  with  a  corresponding  liability  in  shortterm  debt  if,  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  contracts,  the risks associated with the receivables are not transferred in substance to the financing institutions (further information is provided in note 10.3.8, p. 316 and 10.3.10, p. 316).\n\n## Trade and other accounts receivable\n\nTrade and other accounts receivable can be analyzed as follows:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                            | Dec. 31,  2022   | Dec. 31,  2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Gross value                                                  | 5,597            | 5,449            |\n| Provisions for impairment                                    | (419)            | (345)            |\n| TRADE ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE, NET                              | 5,178            | 5,104            |\n| Discounts obtained from and  advances granted to suppliers   | 529              | 636              |\n| Prepaid payroll taxes                                        | 32               | 35               |\n| Other prepaid and recoverable  taxes (other than income tax) | 484              | 470              |\n| Miscellaneous operating  receivables                         | 299              | 289              |\n| Other non-operating receivables                              | 113              | 81               |\n| Provision for impairment of other receivables                | (7)              | (7)              |\n| OTHER RECEIVABLES, NET                                       | 1,450            | 1,504            |\n\nReceivables at December 31, 2022 were stable compared to end-2021.\n\nThe  impact  of  movements  in  provisions  and  bad  debt write-offs represented an expense of \u20ac119 million in 2022 versus an expense of \u20ac55 million in 2021.\n\nBad  debt  write-offs  fell  to  \u20ac56  million  from  \u20ac78  million in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

The decrease in this item reflects changes during 2021 as well as the transfer of obligations to a third-party insurer falling within  the  scope  of  Article  L.  137-11  of  the  French  Social Security Code, as taken up in the PACTE Law.\n\n## 6.3  Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits\n\n## 6.3.1 Description of defined benefit plans\n\nAfter  retirement,  some  of  the  Group's  former  employees are  eligible  for  pension  benefits  in  accordance  with  the applicable laws and regulations in the respective countries in  which  the  Group  operates.  There  are  also  additional pension  obligations  in  certain  Group  companies,  both  in France and in other countries.\n\nThe  Group's  obligation  for  the  payment  of  pensions  and length-of-service awards is determined at the end of the reporting  period  by  independent  actuaries  using  the projected unit credit method (taking into account changes in salaries until retirement) and the economic conditions in each country. This obligation may be financed by pension funds, with a provision recognized in the balance sheet for the unfunded portion.\n\nWhen plan  assets  exceed  the  defined  benefit  obligation, the excess is recognized in other non-current assets under 'Net pension assets'. The asset ceiling corresponds to the maximum future  economic  benefit.  Changes  in  the  asset ceiling are recognized in equity.\n\nActuarial gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions,  experience  adjustments  and  the  difference between the funds' actual and estimated (calculated) rates of return. They are recognized against equity as and when they arise.\n\nThe  interest  cost  of  these  obligations  and  the  return  on the related plan assets are measured by the Group using the discount rate applied to estimate the obligation at the beginning  of  the  period,  and  are  recognized  as  financial income or expense.\n\nThe  Group's  main  defined  benefit  plans  are  described below.\n\nIn France, employees receive length-of-service awards on retirement  based  on  years  of  service  and  the  calculation methods prescribed in the applicable collective bargaining agreements.\n\nIn  addition  to  length-of-service  awards,  there  are  three defined  benefit  plans,  all  of  which  are  final  salary  plans. These  plans  were  closed  to  new  entrants  by  the companies  concerned  between  1969  and  1997.  Effective March  1,  2012,  a  defined  benefit  plan  complying  with Article L. 137-11 of France's Social Security Code ( Code de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9  sociale ) was  set  up  by  Compagnie  de Saint -Gobain. Pursuant to an order of July 4, 2019 issued in the  wake  of  France's  PACTE  Law  setting  out  an  action plan for business growth and transformation, this plan was closed and any vested rights frozen at December 31, 2019. In  2021,  two  new  plans  were  set  up  pursuant  to  Article L. 137-11-2 resulting from the PACTE Law, effective January 1,  2020. Under these plans, final payments are made to a third-party  insurer  who  takes  on  responsibility  for  the liability.\n\nSince  2021,  the  Group  has  applied  the  IFRIC  agenda decision, 'Attributing Benefit to Periods of Service', which changes  the  method  for  calculating  obligations  under certain defined benefit plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

These  plans  have been  closed  to  new  entrants  since  1996.  Since  January 1997,  new  employees  have  been  offered  pension  plans based on contributions  financed  jointly  by  employer  and employee.\n\nOn  January  1,  2019,  the  main  pension  plan  in  the Netherlands  covering  80%  of  employees  was  converted into  a  defined  contribution  plan  with  a  residual  defined benefit plan for a transitional period of up to 12 years.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, retirement plans provide pensions as well as death and permanent disability benefits. These defined  benefit  plans  -  which  are  based  on  employees' average  salaries  over  their  final  years  of  employment  have been closed to new entrants since 2001. In 2021, the legal  structure  of  the  plans  was  altered,  resulting  in  the closure  of  the  Building  Distribution  Section  to  future accrual as of January 1, 2022.\n\nIn  the  United  States  and  Canada,  the  Group's  defined benefit plans are final-salary plans. Since January 1, 2001, new employees have been offered a defined contribution plan.\n\nIn the United States and Spain, retired employees receive benefits other than pensions, mainly concerning healthcare.  The  Group's  obligation  under  these  plans  is determined using the actuarial method and is covered by a provision recorded in the balance sheet.\n\nProvisions for other long-term employee benefits cover all other employee benefits. These benefits primarily include long-service awards in France, jubilee awards in Germany, deferred  compensation,  provisions  for  social  security benefits  in  the  United  States,  and  termination  benefits  in different countries. The related defined benefit obligation is generally calculated on an actuarial basis using the same rules as for pension obligations. Actuarial gains and losses relating  to  these  benefits  are  recognized  immediately  in the income statement.\n\n## 6.3.2 Actuarial assumptions used to measure defined benefit obligations and plan assets\n\n## Interest rate assumptions\n\nAssumptions related to mortality, employee turnover and future  salary  increases  take  into  account  the  economic conditions specific  to  each  country  and  Group  company. The  discount  rates  are  established  by  region  or  country based on observed bond rates at December 31, 2022.\n\nFor  the  Eurozone  (including  France),  two  discount  rates were  calculated  for  first-half  2022  based  on  the  term  of the  plans  using  a  yield  curve  model  developed  by consulting firm Mercer: one rate for plans with a term of 15 years or less and one for plans with a term of over 15 years (2021: one rate for plans with a term of 14 years or less and one for plans with a term of over 14 years).\n\nThe rates used in 2022 for the Group's main plans are the following:\n\n|                  | France     | France    | France          | Eurozone (excluding France)   | Eurozone (excluding France)   | Eurozone (excluding France)   | United Kingdom   | United  States   | United  States   | United  States   |\n|------------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| (in %)           | Short-term | plans     | Long-term plans | Long-term plans               | Short-term plans              | Short-term plans              | Long-term plans  |                  |                  |                  |\n| Discount rate    |            | 4.16%     |                 | 4.23%                         |                               | 4.16%                         | 4.23%            | 4.85 %           |                  | 5.20 %           |\n| Salary increases |            | 1.90 % to | 5.50%           |                               | 2.70 % to                     |                               | 3.00%            | 2.00 % *         |                  | 3.00 %           |\n| Inflation rate   |            | 2.20%     |                 |                               | 2.20%                         |                               |                  | 2.50 %           | 2.50 %           |                  |\n\nThe rates used in 2021 for the Group's main plans were the following:\n\n|                  | France           | France          | Eurozone (excluding France)   | Eurozone (excluding France)   | United Kingdom   | United Kingdom   |        |\n|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|--------|\n| (in %)           | Short-term plans | Long-term plans | Short-term plans              | Long-term                     | plans            |                  |        |\n| Discount rate    | 1.06%            | 1.42%           | 1.06%                         | 1.42%                         |                  | 1.95 %           | 2.70 % |\n| Salary increases | 1.90 %           | to 5.50%        | 2.10 %                        | to 2.30%                      |                  | 2.00 % *         | 3.00 % |\n| Inflation rate   | 1.70%            | 1.70%           | 1.60 %                        | to 2.00%                      |                  | 2.70 %           | 2.20 % |\n\nAs the above three regions account for substantially all of the  Group's  pension  obligation,  the  revised  actuarial assumptions  (in  particular  discount  and  inflation  rates) contributed to a decrease in the obligation, and therefore in the provision, by an amount of \u20ac3,589 million.\n\nThe actual return on plan assets for almost all plans was lower  than  expected,  at  \u20ac3,506  million,  leading  to  an increase in the provision of the same amount. In addition, a \u20ac95 million rise in the asset ceiling, mainly in Switzerland, generated  an  increase  in  the  provision  in  the  same amount.\n\n\u00cb",

A 0.5-point increase in the inflation rate would lead to an overall increase in defined benefit obligations of around \u20ac320 million.\n\nThe same assumptions concerning mortality, employee turnover and interest rates are used to determine the Group's defined  benefit  obligations  for  other  long-term  employee  benefits.  In  the  United  States,  retirees'  healthcare  costs  are projected to rise between 4.00% and 5.99% per year (under 65 years of age), and between 2.26% and 6.56% per year (older  than  65),  depending  on  the  age  of  the  beneficiary.

Eligible employees must have completed a  minimum  of  three  months'  service  with  the  Group. Eligible  employees  are  able  to  invest  in  Saint -Gobain shares  at  a  preferential  subscription  price.  These  shares are  held  either  directly  or  through  the  employee  saving plan's mutual funds, depending on local legislation, and are subject  to  a  mandatory  five-  or  ten-year  lock-up,  except following  the  occurrence  of  certain  events.  The  Board  of Directors delegates authorization for setting the subscription  price  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain.  The  subscription  price corresponds to the average of the opening prices for the Saint -Gobain share on Euronext Paris over the 20 trading days preceding the date of the decision, subject to a 20% discount, in accordance with applicable laws, the Shareholders' Meeting resolutions and the deliberations of the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Group  makes  a  matching contribution  to  amounts  paid  in  by  employees,  which  is expensed  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The Group  also  records  an  IFRS  2  expense  reflecting  the benefit  offered  to  employees  (\u20ac9.3  million  in  2022, compared with \u20ac13.2 million in 2021).\n\nSaint -Gobain  implemented  a  new  PEG  in  the  first  half  of 2022.  As  approved  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  on March 14,  2022,  the  reference  price  is  \u20ac56.48  (\u20ac44.76  in 2021), representing a subscription price of \u20ac45.19 (\u20ac35.81 in 2021) after a 20% discount.\n\nIn 2022, 4,916,097 new shares with a par value of \u20ac4 were issued  to  employees  under  the  PEG  at  an  average subscription  price  of  \u20ac45.19  (5,562,855  shares  at  an average  price  of  \u20ac35.81  in  2021),  representing  a  share capital increase of \u20ac222 million (\u20ac199 million in 2021), net of transaction fees.\n\n## 6.4.2 Stock option plans\n\nUntil  2018,  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  operated  stock option plans for certain employees.\n\nUnder these plans, the Board of Directors granted options allowing  beneficiaries  to  obtain  Saint -Gobain  shares  at  a price  set,  at  no  discount,  by  reference  to  the  average  of the  opening  prices  for  the  Saint -Gobain  share  over  the 20  stock  market  trading  days  preceding  the  date  of  the decision by the Board of Directors.\n\nFor  all  of  the  plans,  beneficiaries  must  wait  at  least  four years from the grant date to exercise any options. None of the options received may be exercised until this four-year\n\nperiod  has  lapsed.  Options  must  be  exercised  within 10 years of the grant date. Except in specified circumstances, grantees forfeit these options if they leave the Group.\n\nAmong the plans outstanding at December 31, 2022, the 2013,  2015,  2016  and  2017  plans  offer  stock  purchase options. The  2018  plan  was  classified  as  a  stock subscription option plan further to a decision of the Board of  Directors  in  2022,  prior  to  the  start  of  the  exercise period.\n\nA performance condition applies for all beneficiaries under current plans.\n\nNo stock options plan has been launched since 2019.\n\nThe  following  table  presents  changes  in  the  number  of outstanding options:\n\n|                                           | \u20ac4 par value  shares   | Average  exercise price (in EUR)   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| OPTIONS OUTSTANDING  AT DECEMBER 31, 2020 | 844,524                | 40.04                              |\n| Options granted                           |                        |                                    |\n| Options exercised                         | (151,173)              | 38.59                              |\n| Options forfeited                         | (141,862)              | 49.38                              |\n| OPTIONS OUTSTANDING  AT DECEMBER 31, 2021 | 551,489                | 38.03                              |\n| Options granted                           |                        |                                    |\n| Options exercised                         | (28,977)               | 40.97                              |\n| Options forfeited*                        | (36,691)               | 31.71                              |\n| OPTIONS OUTSTANDING  AT DECEMBER 31, 2022 | 485,821                | 38.32                              |\n\n- * Including  15,411  options  granted  under  the  2018  stock  option  plan that lapsed because the performance conditions were not met and 17,000 that lapsed after they had been withdrawn, as well as 4,280 options that lapsed after the exercise period under the 2012 stock option plan expired.\n\nThe  cost  of  stock  option  plans  is  calculated  using  the Black & Scholes option pricing model.\n\nThe following inputs were used:\n\n- \u00b7 volatility assumptions  that  take  into  account  the historical  volatility  of  the  share  price  over  a  rolling  10year  period,  as  well  as  implied  volatility  from  traded share options. Periods of extreme share price volatility are disregarded;\n- \u00b7 assumptions relating to the average holding period of options, based on observed behavior of option holders;\n- \u00b7 expected  dividends,  as  estimated  on  the  basis  of historical dividend information dating back to 1988;\n- \u00b7 a  risk-free  interest  rate  corresponding  to  the  yield  on long-term government bonds;\n- \u00b7 the effect of any stock market performance conditions, which is taken into account in the initial measurement of IFRS 2 share-based payment expense.\n\nThe cost calculated using this method is recognized in the income statement over the vesting period of the options, which is a maximum of four years.\n\nUnder IFRS 2, the expense attributable to the amortization of  stock  options  granted  under  previous  plans  totaled \u20ac0.1 million in 2022 (\u20ac0.4 million in 2021).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

All options are now exercisable.\n\n## 6.4.3 Performance share and performance unit grants\n\nSince 2009, performance share plans have also been set up  for  certain  categories  of  employees.  These  plans  are subject to eligibility criteria based on the grantee's period of  service  (service  conditions)  with  the  Group  as  well  as performance criteria (performance conditions), which are described  below.  The  IFRS  2  share-based  payment expense  takes  into  account  these  conditions.  It  is determined  after  deducting  the  present  value  of  the dividends  forfeited  on  the  performance  shares  and  is recognized  over  the  vesting  period,  not  exceeding  four years.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2015, performance unit plans have been set up for certain  employees in France. These plans are also subject to service and performance conditions. The IFRS 2 share-based payment  expense  therefore  takes  into account these factors, as well as the fact that the units are cash-settled. IFRS 2 stipulates that for cash-settled sharebased payment transactions, the granted instruments are initially  measured  at  fair  value  at  the  grant  date,  then remeasured at the end of each reporting period, with the expense  adjusted  accordingly  pro  rata  to  the  rights  that have  vested  at  the  reporting  date.  The  expense  is recognized over the vesting period of the rights.\n\n## Performance share plans\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  there  were  four  outstanding performance  share  plans,  approved  by  the  Board  of Directors  in  2019,  2020  and  2021  and  on  November  24, 2022.\n\nThe expense recorded for these plans in the 2022 income statement amounted to \u20ac33.2 million (2021: \u20ac44.4 million).\n\n\u00cb\n\nAll plans are subject to service and  performance conditions.  The  vesting  period  for  the  shares  awarded under  these  plans  is  four  years  and  the  shares  will  be delivered  under  all  plans  the  fourth  day  after  the  end  of the  vesting  period  for  the  2019,  2020,  2021  and  2022 plans.\n\nThe  table  below  shows  changes  in  the  number  of performance share rights:\n\n|                                                          | Number of  rights   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARE  RIGHTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2020 | 4,965,834           |\n| Performance share rights granted in  November 2021       | 1,184,475           |\n| Shares issued/delivered                                  | (904,712)           |\n| Lapsed and canceled rights                               | (324,838)           |\n| NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARE  RIGHTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2021 | 4,920,759           |\n| Performance share rights granted in  November 2022       | 1,232,792           |\n| Shares issued/delivered                                  | (1,076,098)         |\n| Lapsed and canceled rights*                              | (141,921)           |\n| NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARE  RIGHTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2022 | 4,935,532           |\n\n- * Including  53,310  rights  that  lapsed  because  the  performance condition  had  only  been  partly  met,  and  88,611  rights  that  lapsed after they had been withdrawn.\n\nThe fair  value  of  the  performance  shares  corresponds  to the  Saint -Gobain  share  price  on  the  grant  date,  less  the value  of  dividends  not  payable  on  the  shares  during  the vesting period.

Directly  attributable  acquisition  costs  are expensed as incurred.\n\nIn  addition,  goodwill  is  recognized  only  at  the  date  that control is achieved. Any subsequent increase in ownership\n\ninterest  (without  change  of  control)  is  recorded  as  a change in equity without adjusting goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as the  difference  between  (i)  the  acquisition-date  fair  value plus  the  amount  of  any  non-controlling  interests  in  the acquiree  -  measured  either  at  fair  value  (full  goodwill method) or at the proportionate interest in the fair value of  the  net  identifiable  assets  acquired  (partial  goodwill method) - and (ii) the net amount of assets and liabilities acquired  at  their  fair  value  at  the  acquisition  date.  The Group generally  applies  the  partial  goodwill  method  and the amount of goodwill calculated under the full goodwill method is not therefore material.\n\nAny excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of  the  Group's  share  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. If the fair value of the  net  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  exceeds their acquisition cost, this negative difference is recognized  in  the  income  statement  in  the  year  of acquisition.\n\nChanges in goodwill in 2022 and 2021 are detailed below:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                          | Dec. 31, 2022   | Dec. 31, 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| At January 1                                               |                 |                 |\n| Gross value                                                | 13,399          | 12,229          |\n| Accumulated impairment                                     | (2,218)         | (2,201)         |\n| NET VALUE                                                  | 11,181          | 10,028          |\n| Changes during the period                                  |                 |                 |\n| Impairment                                                 | (28)            | (30)            |\n| Translation adjustments and restatement for hyperinflation | (37)            | 354             |\n| Changes in Group structure                                 | 1,742           | 815             |\n| Assets held for sale                                       | 0               | 14              |\n| TOTAL CHANGES                                              | 1,677           | 1,153           |\n| At December 31                                             |                 |                 |\n| Gross value                                                | 14,304          | 13,399          |\n| Accumulated impairment                                     | (1,446)         | (2,218)         |\n| NET VALUE                                                  | 12,858          | 11,181          |\n\nIn 2022,  changes  in  scope  of  consolidation  mainly concerned first-time consolidations, in particular following the acquisition of GCP  Applied  Technologies  (see note 4.2.1, p. 280) for \u20ac1,490 million; the finalization of the Chryso  purchase  price  accounting,  which  resulted  in  a \u20ac229 million reduction in goodwill; and the acquisitions of Kaycan  and  Impac  for  \u20ac355  million  and  \u20ac51  million, respectively.\n\nImpairment  losses  were  recognized  for  a  total  of \u20ac28. million, mainly against individual assets in the period.

They  include  mainly  the costs of topographical or geological studies, drilling costs, sampling  costs  and  all  costs  incurred  in  assessing  the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting the mineral resource.\n\nMaterial borrowing costs incurred for the construction and acquisition of property, plant and equipment are included in the cost of the related asset if they are significant.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  considered  as  having no  residual  value,  as  they  chiefly  consist  of  industrial assets that are intended to be used until the end of their useful lives.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  other  than  land  are depreciated  using  the  components  approach  on  a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives, which are regularly reviewed:\n\n- \u2022 Major factories and offices\n\n30-40\u00a0years\n\n- \u2022 Other buildings\n\n15-25\u00a0years\n\n- \u2022 Production machinery and equipment\n\n5-16\u00a0years\n\n- \u2022 Vehicles\n\n3-5\u00a0years\n\n- \u2022 Furniture, fixtures, office and computer equipment\n\n4-16\u00a0years\n\nGypsum  quarries  are  depreciated  over  their  estimated useful  lives,  based  on  the  quantity  of  gypsum  extracted during the year compared with extraction capacity.\n\nProvisions  for  site  restoration  are  recognized  as  a component of assets whenever the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to restore a site in accordance with contractually  determined  conditions  or  in  the  event  of  a sudden  deterioration  in  site  conditions.  These  provisions are reviewed periodically and may be discounted over the expected  useful  lives  of  the  assets  concerned.  The component is depreciated over the same useful life as that used for mines and quarries.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\n2022 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 7.4  Right-of-use assets linked to leases\n\nThe Saint -Gobain Group has chosen to apply IFRS 16 using the full retrospective method at January 1, 2019 (i.e., with effect  from  January  1,  2018)  and  has  restated  all  of  its leases that were identified ahead of first-time application of  the  standard.  Entities'  historical  lease  contracts  were restated  with  effect  from  the  date  on  which  the  entities were first consolidated by the Group.\n\nThe  following  recognition  exemptions  proposed  by  IFRS 16 have been used by the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 leases with a lease term of 12 months or less;\n- \u00b7 leases  where  the  underlying  asset  has  a  value  of  less than US$5,000 when new.\n\n## Property leases\n\nThe lease term corresponds to the non-cancelable period of the lease, plus any renewal (or termination) options that the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise  (or  not  to exercise).  The  Group  determined  whether  or  not  lease renewal (or termination) options were reasonably certain to  be  exercised  based  on  the  location  of,  and  any improvements  inseparable  from,  the  leased  asset.  The lease term at inception for '3/6/9-year' commercial leases in  France  is  generally  nine  years.  The  Group  did  not identify  any  material  leases  with  similar  characteristics  in other countries.\n\nAt  December  31,  2019  and  with  retroactive  effect  from January 1, 2018, Saint -Gobain took account of the IFRIC's November 2019 agenda decision in reviewing the terms of its automatically renewable leases, considering the importance of the underlying assets to its operations.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the lease liability is the incremental  borrowing  rate.  This  rate  is  applied  at  the commencement of the lease or at the date of the decision\n\n\u00cb\n\nto  renew  the  lease.  The  Group  calculated  the  rate applicable  to  each  lease  contract  on  the  basis  of  its duration,  which  reflects  the  payment  profile  of  the  lease liability.\n\nThe  useful  life  of  non-movable  leasehold  improvements cannot exceed the useful life of the right-of-use assets to which they relate.\n\n## Leases other than property leases\n\nThe main leases identified correspond to leases of vehicles, machinery and production equipment.\n\nThe lease capitalization period (lease term) represents the non-cancelable period of the lease. Where leases provide for a renewal  (or termination) option, the Group determined  whether  or  not  that  option  was  reasonably certain to be exercised based on the ease with which the leased asset could be replaced and its criticality.\n\nThe  discount  rate  used  to  determine  the  lease  liability  is calculated using the same approach as for property leases.\n\nThe  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease  is  used  as  the discount rate only in the case of non-property leases and only if this is expressly stipulated in the lease contract.\n\nAlthough  leases  can  generally  incorporate  indexation clauses,  lease  liabilities  are  measured  based  solely  on indexes known at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIn  2022,  right-of-use  assets  linked  to  leases  relate  mainly to land and buildings for \u20ac2,336 million (\u20ac2,419 million at December 31, 2021) and to machinery and equipment for \u20ac416 million (\u20ac540 million at December 31, 2021).\n\nLease payments made under low-value and/or short-term leases,  along  with  variable  lease  payments  or  lease payments  falling  outside  the  scope  of  IFRS  16,  totaled \u20ac195 million in 2022 (\u20ac169 million in 2021).",

These tests consist of comparing the asset's carrying amount to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less disposal costs and its value in use.\n\nGoodwill and other unamortized intangible assets (including brands with indefinite useful lives) are tested for impairment  annually  by  comparing  the  asset's  carrying amount  to  its  recoverable  amount  using  the  EBITDA multiple approach.\n\nIf  the  resulting  recoverable  amount  is  below  the  asset's carrying amount, the Group determines the value in use at the level of the relevant cash-generating unit (CGU).\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale are carried at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and their net carrying amount.\n\nIn 2022, the number of CGUs was reduced from 23 to 18, following various disposals and reorganizations within the Group.\n\nThe value in use is calculated using the net present value of future cash flows excluding interest but including tax. It is  determined  using  assumptions  made  by  management based  on  estimates  and  judgments  including  future changes in sales, profitability, investments and other cash flows arising from the use of the corresponding assets, as well as the discount rate applied to future cash flows. Cash flows  for  the  last  year  of  the  business  plan  beyond  the three-year  forecast  period  are  rolled  forward  over  the following  two  years.  For  impairment  tests  of  goodwill, normative  cash  flows  are  then  projected  to  perpetuity using an annual growth rate (between 1.5% and 2% barring exceptional cases).\n\nThe average cost of capital was 7.2% in 2022 versus 6.85% in 2021. This rate corresponds to the Group's average cost of capital, plus a country risk premium where applicable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\n2022 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 7.5.2 CGU impairment tests\n\nWhen  the  annual  impairment  test  reveals  that  the recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  is  less  than  its  carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded.\n\nImpairment  losses  on  goodwill  can  never  be  reversed through  income.  For  property,  plant  and  equipment  and other intangible  assets,  an  impairment  loss  recognized  in prior  periods  may  be  reversed,  taking  into  account depreciation/amortization  adjustments,  if  there  is  an indication  that  the  impairment  no  longer  exists  and  that the  recoverable  amount  of  the  asset  concerned  exceeds its carrying amount.\n\nDuring the impairment  tests, different assumptions measuring  the  method's  sensitivity  are  systematically tested using the following inputs:\n\n- \u00b7 0.5-point increase in the discount rate applied to cash flows;\n- \u00b7 0.5-point decrease in the annual average rate of growth in cash flows projected to perpetuity;\n- \u00b7 1-point  decrease  in  the  operating  income  rate  for Industry activities and  a  0.5-point  decrease  for Distribution activities.\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  sensitivity  tests  carried  out  at December  31,  2022  (i.e.,  sensitivity  to  changes  in  the discount  rate,  perpetuity  growth  rate  and  profitability rate),  three  CGUs  were  identified  as  sensitive:  the  Brazil Distribution  CGU  and  the  two  Pipe  CGUs  (Europe  and Latin America).\n\nIn  2022,  the  average  cost  of  capital  plus  a  country  risk premium  for  the  CGUs  identified  as  sensitive  is  7.8%  for Pipe  Europe,  13.4%  for  Pipe  Latin  America  and  14.0%  for Brazil Distribution.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, a 0.5-point increase in the discount rate would have led the Group to recognize approximately \u20ac1  million  in  additional  impairment  against  the  Latin America Pipe CGU's non-current assets.\n\nFurthermore, no impairment would have been recognized against  non-current  assets  in  the  event  of  a  0.5-point decrease  in  the  average  annual  cash  flow  growth  rate projected to perpetuity for the three CGUs.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe impact of a 1-point decrease in the operating income rate for the two Pipe CGUs would have led the Group to recognize an impairment loss of approximately \u20ac78 million (of  which  \u20ac69  million  in  Europe  and  \u20ac9  million  in  Latin America),  while  a  0.5  point  decrease  in  the  rate  for  the Brazil Distribution CGU would not have generated material additional impairment.\n\nThe  breakdown  of  asset  impairment  by  region  for  2022 and 2021 is provided in the segment information tables in note 5, p. 285.\n\nIn 2022 the Group reviewed its impairment tests in light of the current situation and  the  outlook  for certain businesses and countries.\n\n2022 saw significant increases in sales prices for the Pipe Europe CGU in order to offset inflation experienced in 2021 and 2022, along with strong volume momentum in the first half of the year, which led to a significant improvement in operating  income.  The  challenges  for  2023  will  be  to remain responsive to market conditions, to streamline and scale  back  product  listings,  and  to  continue  to  improve operating income.\n\nFor  the  Latin  America  Pipe  CGU,  2022  was  shaped  by significant price increases and political instability in Brazil. The outlook for 2023 is for moderate growth with the aim of maintaining sales prices.\n\nFor  the  Brazil  Distribution  CGU,  2022  saw  the  closure  of five  stores  in  a  declining  market.  An  impairment  loss  of \u20ac30  million  was  recognized  in  2022.  The  restructuring, alongside  the  new  sales  policy  aimed  at  optimizing margins  and  developing  new  concepts  ('TelhaNorte  J\u00e1' and  'Boutique')  explains  the  expected  improvement  in performance in 2023.\n\nThe Group's commitments to carbon neutrality were taken into account when carrying out sensitivity tests as part of its impairment testing. Details of these sensitivity tests are provided in note 3 on climate issues (see p. 276).",

outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and (iii) the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\nIf  the  amount  or  due  date  of  the  obligation  cannot  be estimated  reliably,  it  is  classified  as  a  contingent  liability and reported as an off-balance sheet commitment.\n\nProvisions for other material liabilities and charges whose timing can be

These  provisions  are  described  in further  detail  in  note  9.2  'Contingent  liabilities  and litigation'.\n\n## 9.1.2 Provisions for restructuring costs and personnel expenses\n\nProvisions for restructuring costs and personnel expenses amounted  to  \u20ac155  million  at December  31,  2022 (December 31, 2021: \u20ac163 million).\n\nThese provisions cover restructuring transactions (personnel costs and other charges linked to reorganization  plans),  as  well  as  provisions  for  personnel expenses  unrelated  to  restructuring  plans,  in  particular provisions for severance payments.\n\n## 9.1.3 Provisions for customer warranties\n\nThese  provisions  cover  the  Group's  commitments  under warranties  granted  to  customers  mainly  in  the  United States. They are determined on a statistical basis using a range  of  criteria  and  take  into  account  contractual warranty  payments  made  in  prior  years  in  the  business and region concerned. In addition, specific provisions may be set aside for identified contingencies in the context of a specific claim.\n\n## 9.1.4 Provisions for other contingencies\n\nAt December 31, 2022, provisions for other contingencies amounted to \u20ac674 million (December 31, 2021: \u20ac580  million)  and  mainly  concern  the  United  States (\u20ac473 million), France (\u20ac60 million) and Brazil (\u20ac73 million).\n\n## 9.1.5 Investment-related liabilities\n\nInvestment-related  liabilities  correspond  to  commitments to  purchase  minority  interests,  liabilities  relating  to  the acquisition  of  shares  in  Group  companies,  and  minority shareholder puts.\n\nIn  2022, changes in investment-related liabilities primarily concerned  liabilities  relating  to  the  acquisition  of  equity interests.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## 9.2  Contingent liabilities and litigation\n\n## 9.2.1 Antitrust law and related proceedings\n\n## Investigation by the Swiss Competition Commission in the sanitary products wholesale industry\n\nIn  November  2011,  the  Swiss  Competition  Commission (Commission  suisse  de  la  concurrence)  opened  an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the sanitary products wholesale industry. In May 2014, the Commission Secretariat  issued  a  notice  of  complaints  against  Sanitas Troesch and other wholesalers in the industry alleging that Sanitas Troesch and some of its competitors had, among other  things,  agreed  in  2005  and  2012  to  lower  gross prices.\n\nThe total  fine  imposed  on  all  companies  involved  is  CHF 80 million. For Sanitas Troesch, the fine is CHF 28.8 million. Sanitas Troesch appealed this decision on May 2, 2016 and continues  to  firmly  refute  the  claims  made.  The  hearing took  place  before  the  Federal  Administrative  Court  on January  21,  2020  and  the  date  on  which  the  Federal Administrative  Court  will  issue  its  decision  is  not  yet known. However, a provision for claims and litigation was recognized at December 31, 2015 in an amount equivalent to the fine (unchanged as at December 31, 2022).\n\n## Investigation by the French Competition Authority in the building insulation products industry\n\nAlleged anti-competitive practices in the building insulation  products  market  were  notified  to  Saint -Gobain Isover  and  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain,  which  rejected such  allegations. The  French  Competition  Authority considered  that  the  alleged  anti-competitive  practices were  not  established  and  dismissed  all  the  objections  in January  2021.  Actis  appealed  this  decision  to  the  Paris Court of Appeal.\n\nOn  the  civil  law  front,  Actis  served  in  March  2013  a damages  claim  on  Saint -Gobain  Isover,  the  Centre scientifique  et  technique  du  b\u00e2timent,  and  the  FILMM before  the  Paris  Civil  Court  (Tribunal  judiciaire  de  Paris) based on the facts being investigated by the Competition Authority.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2022,  Actis  withdrew  these  two  actions. Saint -Gobain  Isover  and  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain accepted  these  withdrawals  without  reservation.  The decision  of  the  Paris  Court  of  Appeal  noting  the withdrawal  of  Actis  and  the  fact  that  the  actions  were removed from the Court was made on January 26, 2023. The  judgment  of  the  Paris  Civil  Court  declaring  the withdrawal  of  Actis  and  the  removal  of  the  case  is expected in the first half of 2023.",

The matter remains pending. The purpose of the filing is to achieve a certain,  final  and  equitable  resolution  of  all  current  and future  claims  arising  from  asbestos-containing  products manufactured  and  sold  by  the  former  CertainTeed Corporation.\n\nDBMP LLC intends to seek court authority to establish a trust under Section 524(g) of the US Bankruptcy Code - a specific provision that is applicable to companies that face substantial  numbers  of  asbestos-related  claims  -  to achieve  a  fair  and  equitable  resolution  of  its  asbestosrelated liabilities. Upon establishment of the trust, current and future plaintiffs with qualifying claims will be able to receive  faster  payment  of  their  claims  without  the  delay, stress  and  uncertainty  of  litigation  in  the  tort  system;  at the same time, the creation and funding of such a trust will permanently  and  finally  resolve  DBMP  LLC's  asbestos liability.\n\nDuring  the  course  of  this  bankruptcy  process,  which  is expected to take up to approximately five to eight years, all  asbestos  litigation  will  be  stayed  and  all  related  costs suspended,  providing  DBMP  LLC  with  the  time  and protection to negotiate an agreement to be approved on behalf of all claimants and by the court.\n\nThis  action  was  taken  as  a  result  of  the  increasing  risks presented in  the  US  tort  system.  Despite  the  passage  of time, the aging of the population and lessening opportunity  for  claimants  to  assert  legitimate  claims  of exposure  to  the  asbestos-containing  products  of  the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  naming  practices  in  the tort  system  continued  to  result  in  a  steady  volume  of claims against DBMP LLC, with no foreseeable end in sight. In  addition,  there  has  been,  in  general,  an  escalation  of settlement demands and verdicts in the tort system.\n\nCertain adversary  proceedings  have  been  filed  by representatives  of  current  and  future  asbestos  plaintiffs against DBMP  LLC,  CertainTeed  LLC,  Saint -Gobain Corporation,  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  and  various other  parties.  No  decisions  on  the  merits  of  the  claims have  been  made  and  such  claims  do  not  affect  the Company's financial assessment of the Chapter 11 case.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 8 8\n\n9",

Around 1,200 contractual instruments have accordingly been signed to date.\n\nTwo class actions were initiated against Brasilit in 2017 by two associations defending former employees exposed to asbestos at the S\u00e3o Caetano (S\u00e3o Paulo state) and Recife (Pernambuco  state)  plants,  asking  for  their  medical assistance  and  compensation  to  be  revised.  First  and second  instance  decisions  were  rendered  in  connection with the suit related to the S\u00e3o Caetano plant respectively in  July  2020  and  July  2021,  rejecting  the  claims  of  the plaintiffs. The  latter  have  nevertheless  appealed  the second  instance  decision.  First  and  second  instance decisions  were  rendered  in  relation  to  Recife  case, respectively  in  February  and  October  2022  rejecting  the claiming party arguments. The plaintiff has appealed such second instance decision.\n\nA third class action was initiated against Brasilit in 2019 in Capivari  (State  of  S\u00e3o  Paulo)  by  the  Labor  prosecutor asking  for  health  insurance,  as  well  as  collective  moral damages,  in  favor  of  employees,  former  employees  and their  respective  families,  as  well  as  subcontractors  who were  exposed  to  asbestos.  A  first  instance  decision  was rendered  in  September  2020  partly  in  favor  of  the plaintiffs.  In  particular,  collective  moral  damages  were granted to the plaintiffs, for an amount reduced to BRL 5 million (\u20ac0.8 million). Brasilit has appealed the decision.\n\nBrasilit is subject to controls by the Ministry of Labor and continues  to  comply  with  all  of  its  legal  obligations  with regard  to  medical  assistance  for  its  current  and  former employees.\n\n\u00cb\n\nIn November 2017, the Supreme Court of Brazil decided to ban  asbestos  definitively  across  the  country.  Brasilit stopped using asbestos voluntarily as early as 2002.\n\n## 9.2.3 Environmental disputes\n\n## PFOA proceedings in the United States\n\nLevels  of  PFOA  (perfluorooctanoic  acid)  in  excess  of  US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health advisories or  state  maximum  contaminant  levels  for  drinking  water have been found in municipal water systems and private wells near current Saint -Gobain Performance Plastics (SG PPL) facilities in Hoosick Falls (New York) and Merrimack (New  Hampshire),  and  two  former  facilities  in  North Bennington  (Vermont)  in  the  United  States.  PFOA  and PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) have never been manufactured  by  these  plants.  SG  PPL  is  a  processor  of PTFE  which  it  purchases  from  third  party  suppliers  and which in the past contained some PFOA.\n\nSG PPL has voluntarily provided bottled water in all three communities, installed point-of-entry treatment systems to residents and businesses in all three communities, installed carbon filtration systems on the municipal water supply in Hoosick  Falls  and  funded  the  installation  of  a  carbon filtration system  on  the  Merrimack  Valley  District's municipal  water  supply.  In  addition,  it  has  voluntarily funded  construction  of  water  line  extensions  in  certain communities in the Merrimack and Bennington areas. The investigations are on-going and the scope of responsibility for SG PPL arising from environmental remediation in New Hampshire  and  New  York  and  clean-up  obligations  at these sites has not yet been established. The scope of the remediation in Vermont is defined and largely completed; future  operation  and  maintenance  obligations  remain. Without  admitting  liability,  SG  PPL  has  signed  consent orders  with  the  environmental  regulators  in  New  York  in 2016,  in  Vermont  in  2017  and  2019  with  respect  to  two different areas, and in New Hampshire in 2018, pursuant to which  SG  PPL  has  agreed  to  complete  investigations, implement  interim  or  final  remediation  measures  at  its current  and  former  facilities  and  in  the  case  of  Vermont and  New  Hampshire,  fund  construction  of  water  lines. Responsibility, if any, is expected to be shared with other parties as regards in particular the Hoosick Falls site.\n\nPFOA-related  lawsuits  alleging  both  health-related  and economic damages claims have been filed in civil courts in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, some of which are in the form of proposed or certified class actions. It is difficult  to  predict  the  timing  or  outcome  of  any  such litigation,  or  whether  any  additional  litigation  will  be brought against SG PPL, however, both the New York and Vermont class actions are settled.\n\nOn  December  31,  2022,  the  provision  recorded  by  the Company in respect of this matter amounts to \u20ac201 million (compared to \u20ac116 million as of December 31, 2021). This provision covers both remediation and litigation related to PFOA matters.",

Insulation materials  from  two  Celotex  ranges  were purchased  via  distributors  and  used  in  refurbishing Grenfell  Tower,  London  in  2015/2016,  including  as  one component  of  the  rainscreen  cladding  system  designed and  installed  (by  third  parties)  on  the  tower's  external facade.\n\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower fire on June 14, 2017, a Public Inquiry was constituted, which is considering, among other things,  the  modifications  made  to  the  building  as  part  of the refurbishment,  the  role  played  by  the  various construction  professionals,  and  the  information  provided by  the  manufacturers  of  the  products  used.  The  Inquiry has  been  conducting  its  work  in  two  phases:  its  phase  1 report  was  published  on  October  30,  2019;  phase  2 commenced  in  January  2020  and  public  hearings continued  until  July  2022,  with  a  final  report  to  follow, most  likely  in  2023.  A  criminal  investigation  into  the circumstances of the fire is also in progress.\n\nThere are a large number of issues and circumstances that need to be explored and the implications for Celotex are unlikely  to  be  known  for  some  time.  Civil  proceedings  in connection  with  Grenfell  Tower  brought  against  Celotex Limited  and/or  Saint -Gobain  Construction  Products  UK Limited (which respectively held the Celotex business until or  after  December  31,  2015)  and  a  number  of  other defendants - who are also core participants in the Public Inquiry  -  have  been  issued  by  bereaved,  survivors  and residents  and  emergency  responders.  Those  proceedings have been stayed prior to the service of full pleadings on the basis that the parties to the litigation are permitted to\n\nengage  in  a  confidential  alternative  dispute  resolution process,  which  if  it  succeeds  would  avoid  the  need  for litigation. Celotex and Saint -Gobain Construction Products UK  Limited  are  engaging  with  other  parties  in  such processes.\n\nCelotex  and  Saint -Gobain  Construction  Products  UK Limited are unable to communicate on the status of those confidential  processes,  which  are  ongoing.  However,  the financial  statements  as  at  31  December  2022  include  a provision covering the principal financial implications that may  arise  from  the  process  engaged  with  bereaved, survivors and residents.\n\nThe  extent  to  which  Celotex  may  incur  further  civil  or criminal liability in connection  with  the  production, marketing,  supply  or  use  of  its  products  is  currently unclear and Celotex Limited and Saint -Gobain Construction Products UK are currently unable to make a reliable estimate of their potential liability in this respect.\n\n## 9.2.5 Other proceedings and disputes\n\nSome of the Group's companies may also be the subject of other  claims  made  by  their  employees  or  by  the  tax authorities, or in the context of the enforcement of seller's warranties granted by the Group to the buyers of divested businesses  (see  p.  290,  note  5.5.2).  Apart  from  the proceedings and litigation described above, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no other government, court or arbitration proceedings exist (including pending proceedings  or  proceedings  where  the  Company  and/or the Group might be threatened) which could have or have had,  in  the  last  12  months,  a  significant  impact  on  the financial  position  or  profitability  of  the  Company  and/or Group.\n\n## NOTE 10 FINANCING AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## 10.1  Financial risks\n\n## 10.1.1 Liquidity risk\n\n## Liquidity risk on financing\n\nIn a crisis environment, the Group might be unable to raise the financing or refinancing needed  to  cover  its investment  plans  on  the  credit  or  capital  markets,  or  to obtain such financing or refinancing on acceptable terms.\n\nThe  Group's  overall  exposure  to  liquidity  risk  on  its  net debt is managed  by  the  Treasury  and  Financing Department  of  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain,  the  Group's parent  company.  The  subsidiaries  generally  enter  into shortor long-term financing arrangements with Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  or  with  the  regional  cash pools.\n\nThe Group's policy is to ensure that the Group's financing will be rolled over at maturity and to optimize borrowing costs. Long-term debt therefore systematically represents a  high  percentage of overall debt. At the same time, the maturity schedules of long-term debt are set in such a way that  replacement  capital  market  issues  are  spread  over time.\n\nThe  Group's  main  source  of  long-term  financing  is constituted  by  bonds,  which  are  generally  issued  under the  Medium  Term  Notes  program.  The  Group  also  uses lease financing, perpetual bonds, participating securities, a long-term securitization program and bank borrowings.\n\nShort-term  debt  is  composed  of  borrowings  under Negotiable European  Commercial  Paper  (NEU  CP) programs,  and  occasionally  Euro  Commercial  Paper  and US  Commercial  Paper  programs,  but  also  includes receivables  securitization  programs  and  bank  financing. The  Group  also  has  factoring  programs.  Financial  assets comprise  marketable  securities  and  cash  and  cash equivalents.\n\nCompagnie de Saint -Gobain's liquidity position is secured by confirmed syndicated lines of credit.\n\nA  breakdown  of  long-  and  short-term  debt  by  type  and maturity  is  provided  in  note  10.3,  which  also  details  the main  characteristics  of  the  Group's  financing  programs and confirmed credit lines.\n\nSaint -Gobain's long-term debt issues have been rated BBB with  a  positive  outlook  by  Standard  &  Poor's  since  April 26, 2022, and Baa1 with a stable outlook by Moody's since June 15, 2022.\n\nThere  is  no  guarantee  that  the  Company  will  be  in  a position to maintain its credit risk ratings at current levels. Any  deterioration  in  the  Group's  credit  risk  rating  could limit  its  capacity  to  raise  funds  and  could  lead  to  higher rates of interest on future borrowings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

To  reduce  liquidity  and  high  volatility risks,  the  Group  invests  in  money  market  funds  and/or bonds whenever possible.\n\n## 10.1.2 Financial counterparty credit risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of default by the financial institutions  that  manage  its  cash  or  other  financial instruments, since such default could lead to losses for the Group.\n\nThe  Group  limits  its  exposure  to  risk  of  default  by  its counterparties  by  dealing  solely  with  reputable  financial institutions  and  regularly  monitoring  their  credit  ratings. However, the credit quality of a financial counterparty can change rapidly, and a high credit rating cannot eliminate the risk of a rapid deterioration of its financial position. As a result, the Group's policy in relation to the selection and monitoring  of  its  counterparties  is  unable  to  entirely eliminate exposure to a risk of default.\n\nTo  limit Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain's  exposure  to counterparty  credit  risk,  the  Treasury  and  Financing Department  deals  primarily  with  counterparties  with  a long-term rating of A- or above from Standard & Poor's or A3 or above from Moody's. Concentrations of credit risk are  also  closely  monitored  to  ensure  that  they  remain  at reasonable  levels,  taking  into  account  the  relative  CDS ('Credit Default Swap') level of each counterparty.\n\n## 10.1.3 Market risks\n\n## Energy and commodity risk\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  changes  in  the  price  of  the energy  it  consumes  and  the  raw  materials  used  in  its activities.  Its  energy  and  commodity  hedging  programs may  be  insufficient  to  protect  the  Group  against significant  or  unforeseen  price  swings  that  could  result from the prevailing financial and economic environment.\n\nThe  Group  may  limit  its  exposure  to  energy  price fluctuations by using swaps and options to hedge part of its fuel oil, natural gas and electricity purchases. The swaps and  options  are  mainly  contracted  in  the  functional currency of the entities concerned. Hedges of fuel oil, gas and  electricity  purchases  are  contracted  in  accordance with the Group's purchasing policy.\n\nThese hedges (excluding fixed-price purchases negotiated directly with suppliers by the Purchasing Department) are generally  arranged by the Group Treasury and Financing Department  (or  with  regional  treasury  departments)  in accordance with instructions received from the Purchasing Department.\n\nFrom time to time, the Group may enter into contracts to hedge purchases of certain commodities or engage in the CO2  emissions  market,  in  accordance  with  the  same principles as those outlined above for energy purchases.\n\nNote  10.4  provides  a  breakdown  of  instruments  used  to hedge energy and commodity risks.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe  Group's  overall  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  on consolidated  debt  is  managed  by  the  Treasury  and Financing Department of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain.\n\nThe  Group's  policy  is  aimed  at  fixing  and  optimizing  its medium-term  borrowing  costs  by  hedging  interest  rate risk.  According  to  Group  policy,  the  derivative  financial instruments  used  to  hedge  interest  rate  risk  can  include interest  rate  swaps,  cross-currency  swaps,  options  including  caps,  floors  and  swaptions  -  and  forward  rate agreements.\n\nThe  table  below  shows  the  sensitivity  at  December  31, 2022 of pre-tax income and pre-tax equity to fluctuations in the interest rate on the Group's net debt after hedging:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                         | Impact on pre-tax  income   | Impact on pre-tax  equity   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Interest rate increase                    |                             |                             |\n| of 50 basis points                        | 21                          | 6                           |\n| Interest rate decrease of 50 basis points | (21)                        | (6)                         |\n\nNote  10.4  provides  a  breakdown  of  instruments  used  to hedge  interest  rate  risk  and  of  gross  debt  by  type  of interest (fixed or variable) after hedging.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe currency hedging policies  described  below  could  be insufficient  to  protect  the  Group  against  unexpected  or sharper  than  expected  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates resulting from economic and financial market conditions.\n\nForeign exchange risks are managed by hedging virtually all transactions entered  into by  Group  entities  in currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  the particular  entity.  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  and  its subsidiaries  may  use  forward  contracts  and  options  to hedge  exposures  arising  from  current  and  forecast transactions.\n\nThe  subsidiaries  generally  set  up  contracts  through  the Group's  parent  company,  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain, which  then  carries  out  the  corresponding  forex  hedging transactions on their behalf, or through the regional cash pools. Failing this, contracts are taken out with one of the subsidiary's banks.\n\nMost  forward  contracts  have  short  maturities  of  around three  months.  However,  forward  contracts  taken  out  to hedge firm orders may have longer terms.\n\nThe Group monitors its exposure to foreign exchange risk using  a  monthly  reporting  system  that  captures  the foreign  exchange  positions  taken  by  its  subsidiaries.  At December 31, 2022, 98% of the Group's foreign exchange exposure was hedged.",

To reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the share price, the Group uses hedging instruments such as equity swaps.\n\nAs a result, if the price of the Saint -Gobain share changes, any  changes  in  the  expense  recorded  in  the  income statement will be fully offset by the hedges in place.\n\nNote  10.4  provides  a  breakdown  of  instruments  used  to hedge share price risk.\n\n## 10.2 Net financial income (expense)\n\nNet financial income (expense) includes borrowing and other financing costs, income from cash and cash equivalents, interest on lease liabilities, interest cost for pension and other post-employment benefit plans net of the return on plan assets, and other financial income and expense.\n\nNet financial income (expense) in 2022 and 2021 comprises:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                                          | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Borrowing costs, gross                                                     | (250)  | (240)  |\n| Income from cash and cash equivalents                                      | 54     | 7      |\n| BORROWING COSTS, NET, EXCLUDING LEASE LIABILITIES                          | (196)  | (233)  |\n| Interest on lease liabilities                                              | (66)   | (54)   |\n| TOTAL BORROWING COSTS, NET                                                 | (262)  | (287)  |\n| Interest cost - pension and other post-employment benefit obligations      | (247)  | (190)  |\n| Return on plan assets                                                      | 232    | 160    |\n| INTEREST COST - PENSION AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, NET | (15)   | (30)   |\n| Other financial expense*                                                   | (139)  | (106)  |\n| Other financial income                                                     | 12     | 16     |\n| OTHER FINANCIAL INCOME AND EXPENSE                                         | (127)  | (90)   |\n| NET FINANCIAL INCOME (EXPENSE)                                             | (404)  | (407)  |\n\n## 10.3 Net debt\n\n## 10.3.1 Long- and short-term debt\n\n## Long-term debt\n\nLong-term debt includes bonds, perpetual bonds, participating  securities,  long-term  securitization  and  all other  types  of  long-term  financial  liabilities,  including  the fair value of interest rate hedging derivatives.\n\nUnder  IAS  32,  the  distinction  between  financial  liabilities and  equity  is  based  on  the  substance  of  the  contracts concerned  rather  than  their  legal  form.  As  a  result, participating securities are classified as debt.\n\nAt  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  long-term  debt (excluding  interest  rate  derivatives)  is  measured  at amortized cost.

Premiums and issuance costs are amortized using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease  liabilities  represent  obligations  to  make  lease payments in accordance with IFRS 16.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

The difference  between  the  redemption  value  and  the  face value  of  the  bonds  redeemed  (GBP  16.1  million)  was recorded in other financial expense.\n\nOn August 10, 2022, Compagnie de Saint -Gobain issued a \u20ac1.5 billion bond divided into three tranches:\n\n- \u00b7 a  \u20ac500 million  tranche  maturing  August  10,  2025  and paying a coupon of 1.625%;\n- \u00b7 a  \u20ac500  million  tranche  maturing  June  10,  2028  and paying a coupon of 2.125%;\n- \u00b7 a  \u20ac500 million  tranche  maturing  August  10,  2032  and paying a coupon of 2.625%.\n\nThe ten-year tranche is a Sustainability-Linked Bond (SLB) linked  to  two  important  indicators  of  Saint -Gobain's sustainability  roadmap,  with  ambitious  2030  targets  in relation to the 2017 base year:\n\n- \u00b7 reduce  by  33%  the  absolute  scope  1  and  2  CO2 emissions;\n- \u00b7 achieve an 80% reduction in non-recovered production waste.\n\nA  0.375%  step-up  would  apply  on  the  2032  coupon  for each of these indicators if their respective target was not met.\n\n## 10.3.4 Perpetual bonds\n\nIn 1985,  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  issued  25,000 perpetual bonds with a face value of ECU 5,000 (\u20ac5,000 today).\n\nA total of 18,496 perpetual bonds have since been bought back  and  canceled,  and  6,504  perpetual  bonds  are outstanding  at  December  31,  2022,  representing  a  total face value of \u20ac33 million.\n\nThe  bonds  bear  interest  at  a  variable  rate  (average  of interbank rates offered by the four reference banks for sixmonth euro deposits). The amount paid out per bond in 2022 was \u20ac0.\n\nThe bonds are not redeemable and interest on the bonds is classified as a component of finance costs.\n\n## 10.3.5 Non-voting participating securities\n\nIn June 1983, Compagnie de Saint -Gobain issued 1,288,299 non-voting  participating  securities  with  a  face  value  of FRF 1,000. Their face value is now \u20ac152.45, following their translation into euros in 1999.\n\nA  certain  number  of  these  participating  securities  have been bought back over the years. At December 31, 2022, 606,883 securities are still outstanding with an aggregate face value of \u20ac92.5 million.\n\nInterest on the securities ranges from 75% to 125% of the average  corporate  bond  yield  (TMO),  based  on  the Group's  consolidated  income.  The  amount  paid  out  per security in 2022 was \u20ac0.45.\n\nIn  April  1984,  194,633  non-voting  participating  securities were  issued  by  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  with  a  face value of ECU 1,000 (\u20ac1,000 today).\n\nA  certain  number  of  these  participating  securities  has been bought back over the years. At December 31, 2022, 77,516  securities  are  still  outstanding,  with  an  aggregate face value of \u20ac77.5 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

They are treated as variable-rate debt since they are rolled over at frequent intervals.\n\n## 10.3.7 Syndicated lines of credit\n\nCompagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  has  two  syndicated  lines  of credit  that  are  intended  to  provide  a  secure  source  of financing  for  the  Group  (including  as  additional  backing for its NEU  CP,  US  Commercial  Paper  and  Euro Commercial Paper programs):\n\n- \u00b7 a  \u20ac2.5  billion  syndicated  line  of  credit,  maturing  in December 2024 after the exercise of the two one-year rollover options;\n- \u00b7 a  second  \u20ac1.5  billion  syndicated  line  of  credit,  also maturing  in  December  2024  after  the  exercise  of  the two one-year rollover options.\n\nBased on the Group's current credit rating for long-term debt,  the  two  facilities  are  not  subject  to  any  covenants. Neither  of  these  two  lines  of  credit  was  drawn  down  at December 31, 2022.\n\n## 10.3.8 Receivables securitization programs\n\nThe  Group  has  set  up  two  receivables  securitization programs,  one  through  its  French  subsidiary  Point.P Finances  GIE,  and  the  other  through  its  US  subsidiary, Saint -Gobain Receivables Corporation.\n\nThe French program, covering an amount of up to \u20ac500 million,  represented  \u20ac500  million  at  both  December  31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\n\u00cb\n\nBased  on  observed  seasonal  fluctuations  in  receivables included  in  the  program  and  on  the  contract's  features, \u20ac390  million  of  this  amount  is  classified  as  non-current and the remaining balance as current.\n\nUnder the US program, covering a maximum of up to USD 400  million,  a  total  of  USD  157  million  has  been  drawn down  at  December  31,  2022.  Its  value  amounts  to  an equivalent  in  euros  of  \u20ac148  million  compared  to  \u20ac263 million at December 31, 2021.\n\n## 10.3.9 Secured debt\n\nAt December 31, 2022, \u20ac1 million of Group debt is secured by various non-current assets (real estate and securities).\n\n## 10.3.10 Factoring\n\nThe Group has set up several trade receivables factoring programs. Based on an analysis of the risks and rewards as defined by IFRS 9, the Group has derecognized virtually all of  the  receivables  sold  under  these  programs.  A  total  of \u20ac644 million in factored receivables were derecognized at December  31,  2022,  compared  to  \u20ac492  million  at December 31, 2021.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\n2022 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 10.4  Financial instruments\n\nThe  Group  uses  interest  rate,  foreign  exchange,  energy, commodity and equity derivatives to hedge its exposure to  changes in  interest  rates,  exchange  rates,  and  energy, commodity and equity prices that may arise in the normal course of business.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9, all such instruments are recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value,  irrespective  of  whether  or  not  they  are  part  of  a hedging  relationship  that  qualifies  for  hedge  accounting under IFRS 9.\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  both  derivatives  that  are designated  and  qualified  as  fair  value  hedges  and derivatives  that  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting during  the  period  are  taken  to  the  income  statement  (in business  income  and  expense  for  operational  foreign exchange  derivatives  and  commodity  derivatives  not qualifying  for  hedge  accounting,  and  in  financial  income and  expense  for  all  other  derivatives).  However,  in  the case  of  derivatives  that  qualify  as  cash  flow  hedges,  the effective portion of the gain or loss arising from changes in fair  value  is  recognized  directly  in  equity,  and  only  the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair  value  hedge  accounting  is  applied  by  the  Group mainly  for  derivative  instruments  which  swap  fixed  rates against  variable  rates  (fixed-for-floating  interest  rate swaps). These derivatives hedge fixed-rate debt exposed to a fair value risk. In accordance with hedge accounting principles, debt included in a designated fair value hedging relationship is remeasured at fair value to the extent of the risk hedged. As the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item offsets the effective portion of the gain or loss on the fair  value  hedge,  the  income  statement  is  only  impacted by the ineffective portion of the hedge.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nCash  flow  hedge  accounting  is  applied  by  the  Group mainly  for  derivative  instruments  which  fix  the  cost  of future investments (financial assets or property, plant and equipment) and the price of future purchases, mostly gas and  fuel  oil  (commodity  swaps)  or  foreign  currencies (foreign  exchange  forwards).  Transactions  hedged  by these  instruments  are  qualified  as  highly  probable.  The application  of  cash  flow  hedge  accounting  allows  the Group to defer the impact on the income statement of the effective  portion  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these derivatives  by  recording  them  in  a  hedging  reserve  in equity. This reserve is reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction occurs and the hedged item itself  affects  income.  In  the  same  way  as  for  fair  value hedges, cash flow hedging limits the Group's exposure to changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these  derivatives  to  the ineffective portion of the hedge.\n\n## Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for  hedge  accounting  are  recognized  in  the  income statement.  The  instruments  concerned  are  primarily foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities corresponds to their quoted price on an active market (if any):  this  represents  level  1  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy defined in IFRS 7 and IFRS 13. The fair value of instruments not  quoted  in  an  active  market,  such  as  derivatives  or financial  assets  and  liabilities,  is  determined  by  reference to  commonly  used  valuation  techniques  such  as  the  fair value  of  another  recent  and  similar  transaction,  or discounted cash flow analysis based on observable market inputs.  This  represents  level  2  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy defined in IFRS 7 and IFRS 13.\n\nThe fair value of short-term financial assets and liabilities is considered  as  being  the  same  as  their  carrying  amount due to their short maturities.\n\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the main derivatives used by the Group:\n\n|                                                                                                  | Fair value                     | Fair value                          | Fair value     | Nominal amount by maturity   | Nominal amount by maturity   | Nominal amount by maturity   | Nominal amount by maturity   | Nominal amount by maturity   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| (in EUR millions)                                                                                | Derivatives recorded in assets | Derivatives recorded in liabilities | Dec. 31,  2022 | Dec. 31,  2021               | Within 1 year                | 1 to 5 years                 | Beyond 5 years               | Dec. 31,  2022               |\n| FAIR VALUE HEDGES                                                                                | 0                              | 0                                   | 0              | 0                            |                              |                              |                              | 0                            |\n| Cash flow hedges                                                                                 |                                |                                     |                |                              |                              |                              |                              |                              |\n| Currency                                                                                         | 3                              | (7)                                 | (4)            | 6                            | 268                          | 34                           | 0                            | 302                          |\n| Interest rate                                                                                    | 6                              | (47)                                | (41)           | (60)                         | 0                            | 95                           | 362                          | 457                          |\n| Energy and commodities                                                                           | 5                              | (1)                                 | 4              | 6                            | 42                           | 1                            | 0                            | 43                           |\n| Other risks: equities                                                                            | 1                              | 0                                   | 1              | 12                           | 4                            | 10                           | 0                            | 14                           |\n| CASH FLOW HEDGES -

At December 31, 2022, credit value adjustments were not material.\n\n## 10.4.6 Impact on equity of financial instruments qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the IFRS cash flow hedge reserve carried  in  equity  had  a  debit  balance  of  \u20ac8  million, consisting mainly of:\n\n- \u00b7 a  debit  balance  of  \u20ac15  million  in  relation  to  crosscurrency  swaps  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  that are used to convert a GBP bond issue into euros;\n- \u00b7 a credit balance of \u20ac6 million corresponding to changes in  the  fair  value  of  interest  rate  hedges  classified  as cash flow hedges;\n- \u00b7 a credit balance of \u20ac4 million corresponding to changes in  fair  value  of  energy  hedges  qualified  as  cash  flow hedges;\n- \u00b7 a debit balance of \u20ac3 million corresponding to changes in  fair  value  of  currency  derivatives  qualified  as  cash flow hedges.\n\nThe  ineffective  portion  of  cash  flow  hedge  derivatives  is not material.\n\n## 10.4.7 Impact on income of financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting\n\nThe fair value of derivatives classified as 'Financial assets and  liabilities at fair value  through  profit  or  loss' represents a gain of \u20ac2 million in 2022 compared to a gain of \u20ac14 million in 2021.\n\n## 10.4.8 Embedded derivatives\n\nThe Saint -Gobain Group regularly analyzes its contracts in order to separately identify financial instruments classified as embedded derivatives under IFRS.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, no embedded derivatives deemed to be material at Group level were identified.\n\n## 10.4.9 Group debt structure (excluding lease liabilities)\n\nThe  weighted  average  interest  rate  on  total  gross  debt under  IFRS  and  after  hedging  (interest  rate  swaps  and cross-currency  swaps)  was  2.3%  at  December  31,  2022, compared with 2.1% at December 31, 2021.\n\nThe  average  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  main component of the Group long-term debt before hedging (bonds) was 2.0% at December 31, 2022, compared with 2.5% at December 31, 2021.\n\nThe table below presents the breakdown by interest rate (fixed or variable) of the Group's gross debt at December 31, 2022, taking into account interest rate and cross-currency swaps.\n\nGross debt, excluding lease liabilities\n\n| (in EUR millions)                            | Variable rate   | Fixed rate   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|---------|\n| EUR                                          | 861             | 8,807        | 9,668   |\n| Other currencies                             | 644             | 999          | 1,643   |\n| TOTAL                                        | 1,505           | 9,806        | 11,311  |\n| (in %)                                       | 1 3  %          | 8 7  %       | 100 %   |\n| Accrued interest and other                   |                 |              | 134     |\n| TOTAL GROSS DEBT EXCLUDING LEASE LIABILITIES |                 |              | 11,445  |\n\n\u00cb",

Gains  and  losses  on  disposals  of treasury stock are recognized directly in equity and have no impact on net income for the period.\n\nForward  purchases  of  treasury  stock  are  treated  in  the same way.  When  a  fixed  number  of  shares  is  purchased forward at a fixed price, this amount is recorded in 'Other liabilities' against a deduction from equity under 'Retained earnings and net income for the year'.\n\nSaint -Gobain shares held or controlled by Compagnie de Saint -Gobain and Saint -Gobain Corporation are shown as a deduction from equity under 'Treasury stock' at acquisition cost.\n\nThe liquidity agreement signed with Exane BNP Paribas on November  16,  2007  and  implemented  on  December  3, 2007  for  a  period  up  to  December  31,  2007  has  been automatically renewed since that date.\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  4,406,990  shares  were  held  in treasury  (December  31,  2021:  2,746,687  shares).  In  2022, the  Group  acquired  18,011,705  shares  (2021:  16,865,006 shares) directly on the market. The number of shares sold in  2022 was 3,174,316 versus 2,525,353 in 2021. 13,177,086 shares  were  canceled  in  2022,  compared  with  14,243,174 shares in 2021.\n\nFor the purposes of a compensation plan set up in January 2008  for  certain  employees  in  the  United  States, Compagnie de Saint -Gobain shares are held by the trustee, Wachovia Bank, National Association. In the consolidated financial  statements,  these  shares  are  treated  as  being controlled by Saint -Gobain Corporation.\n\n## 11.1.5 Number of shares\n\n|                                       | Number of shares   | Number of shares   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                       | Issued             | Outstanding        |\n| NUMBER OF SHARES AT DECEMBER 31, 2020 | 532,683,713        | 530,033,505        |\n| Group Savings Plan                    | 5,562,855          | 5,562,855          |\n| Stock subscription option plans       | 14,201             | 14,201             |\n| Shares purchased                      |                    | (16,865,006)       |\n| Shares sold                           |                    | 2,525,353          |\n| Shares canceled                       | (14,243,174)       |                    |\n| NUMBER OF SHARES AT DECEMBER 31, 2021 | 524,017,595        | 521,270,908        |\n| Group Savings Plan                    | 4,916,097          | 4,916,097          |\n| Stock subscription option plans       | 12,476             | 12,476             |\n| Shares purchased                      |                    | (18,011,705)       |\n| Shares sold                           |                    | 3,174,316          |\n| Shares canceled                       | (13,177,086)       |                    |\n| NUMBER OF SHARES AT DECEMBER 31, 2022 | 515,769,082        | 511,362,092        |\n\n## 11.1.6 Dividends\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting of June 2, 2022 approved the recommended dividend payout for 2021 representing \u20ac1.63 per share.

Income tax resulting from changes in tax rates is recognized in income, except where it relates to items initially recognized in equity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

In  determining whether  to  recognize  deferred  tax  assets  for  tax  loss carry-forwards, the Group applies a range of criteria that take into account the probable recovery period based on business plans and the strategy for the long-term recovery of tax losses applied in each country.\n\nThe  Group  recognized  deferred  tax  assets  for  tax  loss carry-forwards  for  a  net  amount  of  \u20ac294  million  at December 31, 2022 and \u20ac410 million at December 31, 2021. This principally relates to the United States, for which the recovery  period  is  shorter  than  the  maximum  utilization period  of  20  years,  and  to  France,  Germany  and  Spain, where  tax  consolidation  generally  ensures  that  deferred tax can be recovered. In these countries, tax losses may be carried  forward  indefinitely.  Nevertheless,  after  analyzing each  situation,  the  Group  may  decide  not  to  recognize them.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, deferred tax assets whose recovery is not considered probable totaled \u20ac274 million (December  31,  2021:  \u20ac299  million)  and  a  provision  had been accrued for the full amount. Provisions for deferred tax  assets  chiefly  relate  to  Germany,  Spain,  the  United States, China, France and Belgium.\n\nThe improved deferred tax position in France in 2022 led to  a  reversal  of  provisions  for  losses  of  \u20ac59  million,  in addition to the \u20ac53 million reversal in 2021.\n\n- \u00b7 a \u20ac650 million tranche maturing January 18, 2029 and paying a coupon of 3.5%.\n\nThis  issue  has  no  impact  on  the  financial  statements  at December 31, 2022.",

We  believe  that  the  audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2022, to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Articles  L.  823-9  and  R.  823-7  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (code  de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the  consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, approved in  the  conditions mentioned above, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\n\n## Description of risk\n\nThe  net  carrying  amounts  of  goodwill,  other  intangible  assets  and  property,  plant  and  equipment  were  material  at December 31, 2022, representing \u20ac12,858 million, \u20ac4,026 million, and \u20ac12,163 million, respectively that is to say 52% of total assets.\n\nThese  assets  may  present  a  risk  of  impairment  due  to  internal  or  external  factors,  including  decisions  to  change  the Group's  strategy  in  certain  markets,  a  decline  in  Group  performance,  the  Group's  commitments  to  carbon  neutrality, changes in competition, unfavorable market conditions and changes in legislation or regulations. These changes are likely to have an impact on the Group's forecast cash flow and, consequently, the recoverable amount of assets.\n\nThe impairment tests performed by Management using the method described in Note 7.5 to the consolidated financial statements led to book an impairment losses of \u20ac299 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 (mainly including an impairment on assets held for sale related to the distribution activity in UK), as indicated in notes 4.3 and 5.1.4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  valuation  of  these  assets  is  a  key  audit  matter,  particularly  for  the  cash  generating  units  presenting  a  risk  of impairment,  given  the  materiality  of  their  amount  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  and  the  high  level  of  judgment required  by  Management  in  assessing  impairment  losses.  Judgements  include  multiples  of  a  normative  basis  of performance and assumptions regarding future changes in revenue in volume and value, profitability, investments and other cash flows related to the operation of these assets, as well as the determination of an appropriate discount rate applied to future cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 8 8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\nStatutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe  familiarized  ourselves  with  the  procedures  implemented  within  the  Group  for  impairment  testing  purposes, particularly with regard to the impacts of the Group's commitments to carbon neutrality and exercised our professional judgment to assess the position adopted by Management. We tested the effectiveness of the controls implemented by the Group to ensure the quality and reliability of these procedures and their consistency with data from the budget and the medium-term business plan prepared by Management.\n\nWe also assessed the consistency and relevance of Management's approach to determining the cash-generating units for asset impairment testing. We adapted our audit approach to the risk of impairment, which varies depending on the cashgenerating unit.\n\nOur  valuation  specialists  performed  an  independent  analysis  of  certain  key  assumptions  used  by  Management  for impairment  testing  purposes,  in  particular  the  discount  rate,  the  average  perpetual  growth  rate  or  multiples  of  a normative performance basis deemed appropriate to the valuation of cash-generating units, by referring to both external market data and comparable company analyses.\n\nFor the most sensitive cash-generating units presenting a risk of impairment, we analyzed the consistency of future cash flow projections with regard to past performance and our knowledge of the business, confirmed by interviews with the Heads of the relevant Businesses. We paid particularly close attention to the calculation of the normalized amount of terminal cash flows projected to perpetuity. We performed our own sensitivity analyses of certain key variables of the measurement model, particularly with regard to the inclusion of CO2 emissions when assessing the materiality of potential impacts on the recoverable amounts of the most high-risk assets.\n\nFor the cash-generating unit of the UK distribution for which the Group has retained the fair value less costs to sell, we verified the consistency of the fair value adopted with signed sales agreements and reviewed the method of calculating the impairment loss resulting from the transaction.\n\nWe verified that the disclosures provided in the notes 5.1.4, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 et 7.5 to the consolidated financial statements on the valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, the underlying assumptions and sensitivity analyses were appropriate.\n\n## Measurement of provisions related to asbestos litigations in the United States of America Description of risk\n\nAs indicated in note 9.2.2 to the consolidated financial statements, the risk of being called upon to finance the costs of the bankruptcy proceedings of DBMP LLC, an affiliate of CertainTeed LLC which holds the historical assets of the former entity CertainTeed Corporation, is subject to a provision amounting to $410m (\u20ac385m) at December 31, 2022.\n\nWith  regard  to  this  funding  risk,  determining  and  measuring  the  provision  recognized  for  contingent  liabilities  and litigation  and  assessing  the  appropriateness  of  the  related  disclosures  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements are a key audit matter given the amounts involved and the high degree of estimation and judgment required by Management in determining this provision. Judgment is required, in particular, to assess the status and resolution of the ongoing legal proceedings (in particular the voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11): duration, cost, estimation of the number of current and future cases covered, definition of the damages by the judicial authority, etc.\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nTo obtain an understanding of contingent liabilities and litigation regarding asbestos in the United States and the related judgments made, we held discussions with Management and lawyers chosen by Management, at the Group and country level as well as at the main subsidiaries concerned. We also contacted certain law firms and external experts chosen by Management to assist them with the monitoring of these risks.\n\n## We have:\n\n- \u00b7 examined the minutes of the Board of Directors' meetings and the Group's risk mapping prepared by Management and presented to the Audit and Risk Committee;\n- \u00b7 familiarized ourselves with the procedures implemented by Management when measuring the provisions for asbestosrelated risks in the United States and determining the disclosures thereon in the notes to the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 assessed the permanence of methods and performed a critical review of internal analyses relating to the probability and possible impact of these contingent liabilities and new items of litigation by examining the available information relating to the proceedings (correspondence, judgments, notifications, etc.). We also reviewed the responses to the confirmation  letters  of  the  law  firms  chosen  by  Management,  particularly  in  terms  of  their  experience  at  resolving comparable  situations  in  the  past.  We  also  used  our  professional  judgment  to  assess  the  positions  adopted  by Management, to see where they fell within risk assessment ranges and the consistency of those positions over time;\n- \u00b7 verified the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations of changes in provisions and the consistency of the main items of change in relation to the underlying data, in particular the payments made during the year in respect of these risks.\n\nWe assessed if the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the note 9.2.2 to the consolidated financial statements regarding these items of litigation and contingent liabilities identified.\n\n\u00cb",

This information should be reported on by an independent third party.\n\n## Other Legal and Regulatory Verifications or Information\n\n## Format of presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nWe  have  also  verified,  in  accordance  with  the  professional  standard  applicable  in  France  relating  to  the  procedures performed  by  the  statutory  auditor  relating  to  the  annual  and  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), prepared under the responsibility of the General Manager, complies with the single electronic format defined in  the  European  Delegated  Regulation  No  2019/815  of  17  December  2018.  As  it  relates  to  consolidated  financial statements,  our  work  includes  verifying  that  the  tagging  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  complies  with  the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased  on  the  work  we  have  performed,  we  conclude  that  the  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent to the block-tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to the European  single  electronic  format,  the  content  of  certain  tags  of  the  notes  may  not  be  rendered  identically  to  the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nMoreover, we have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain by the annual general meeting held on June 10, 2004, for KPMG and on June 2, 2022 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s.\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2022,  KPMG  and  Deloitte  &  Associ\u00e9s  were  in  the  19th  year  and  1st  year  of  total  uninterrupted engagement.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Company's  ability  to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  financial  reporting  process  and  the  effectiveness  of internal  control  and  risks  management  systems  and  where  applicable,  its  internal  audit,  regarding  the  accounting  and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 8 8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\nStatutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in  Article  L.  823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (code  de  commerce),  our  statutory  audit  does  not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u00b7 evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant doubt  on  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- \u00b7 evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- \u00b7 obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Risk Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Risk Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were  of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  which  are therefore the key audit matters, that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe  also  provide  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  with  the  declaration  provided  for  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU) N o 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Risk Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, February 23, 2023\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nKPMG S.A.\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nPierre-Antoine DUFFAUD                    Laurent CHILLET\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric GOURD                          B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte MARGERIN\n\n\u00cb",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\nCompagnie de Saint -Gobain 2022 annual financial statements (parent company)\n\nThe financial statements cover the 12-month period from January 1 to December 31, 2022.\n\nThe following notes are an integral part of the annual financial statements.\n\nThese financial statements were adopted on February 23, 2023 by the Board of Directors.\n\n## NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND METHODS\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain have been drawn up in accordance with the French Chart of Accounts,  French  law,  and  accounting  principles generally accepted in France.\n\nThe financial statements include the accounts of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain's German branch.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are carried at acquisition cost (including incidental expenses)  and  are  amortized  over  their estimated useful lives, ranging from three to ten years.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  carried  at  acquisition cost  (purchase  price  plus  incidental  expenses).  They  are depreciated  over  their  estimated  useful  lives  using  the straight-line method. The most commonly used useful lives are as follows:\n\n- \u2022 Buildings\n\n40\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0years  Straight-line\n\n- \u2022 Improvements and\u00a0additions\n\n12\u00a0years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- \u2022 Fixtures and fittings\n\n5 to\u00a012\u00a0years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- \u2022 Office furniture\n\n10\u00a0years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- \u2022 Office equipment\n\n5\u00a0years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- \u2022 Vehicles\n\n4\u00a0years  Straight-line\n\n- \u2022 IT equipments\n\n3\u00a0years Straight-line\n\n## Financial investments\n\nOn  initial  recognition,  investments  in  subsidiaries  and affiliates  are  stated  at  cost  including  incidental  expenses. Periodically, and  particularly when  an  inventory  is performed, the net carrying amount of the investments is compared with their fair value (value in use). Fair value is estimated based on various criteria: the Company's equity in  the  underlying  net  assets,  proportion  of  consolidated net  assets,  net  present  value  of  future  cash  flows, excluding  interest  expense  but  after  tax,  based  on business  plans  (or  long-term  budget  projections),  or  a multiple of a normative performance basis.\n\nWhen  the  fair  value  of  the  investments  falls  below  their carrying  amount,  a  provision  is  set  aside  for  impairment. No  unrealized  capital  gain  is  recorded  if  their  fair  value exceeds  their  carrying  amount,  and  unrealized  capital gains and losses are not offset.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares held by the Company for cancellation are recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  under  'Other  investment securities'. They are carried at acquisition cost and are not revalued or provisioned.\n\nTreasury shares held by the Company for allocation upon exercise  of  stock  options  are  recorded  in  the  balance sheet under 'Marketable securities'.\n\nTreasury shares held by the Company for allocation under performance share plans are also recorded in the balance sheet  under  'Marketable  securities'.  These  shares  are valued  in  accordance  with  the  first  in/first  out  (FIFO) method, and are not revalued or provisioned.\n\nWhere  appropriate,  a  provision  for  contingencies  and charges is recognized in respect of these plans, corresponding  to  the  outflow  of  resources  expected  by the Company. This is calculated based on the number of shares  likely  to  be  delivered  to  the  beneficiaries  and  the acquisition  cost  of  the  shares  at  the  date  they  are allocated to the plan or the likely cost of repurchasing the shares as measured at the reporting date. The provision is recognized on a pro rata basis over the vesting period.\n\n## Receivables\n\nReceivables are stated at nominal value. A provision is set aside  for  impairment  when  their  realizable  value  is  less than their book value.\n\n## Marketable securities\n\nMarketable securities mainly include units in money market funds  (OPCVM  and  FCP)  and  are  stated  at  the  lower  of acquisition cost and market value at year-end.",

Receivables,  payables  and  bank  balances  in  foreign currencies  are  translated  at  the  year-end  exchange  rate, along with the related hedging instruments, and differences  arising  on  translation  are  recorded  under translation gains or losses. Provisions are booked for any exceptional  unrealized  translation  losses  that  are  not hedged.\n\n## Risk management/financial instruments\n\nLiquidity  risk  is  managed  with  the  main  objective  of ensuring the timely rollover of the Group's financing at an optimal  cost.  Long-term  debt  therefore  systematically represents a high proportion of overall debt. At the same time, the maturity schedules of long-term debt are set in such  a  way  that  replacement  capital  market  issues  are spread over time.\n\nCurrency,  interest  rate  and  commodity  (energy  and  raw material price) risks arising from the Group's international operations  are  hedged  by  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain, mainly on behalf of subsidiaries. Currency risk is primarily hedged through forward purchase and sale contracts and currency options, while interest rate risk is hedged mainly through swaps and cross-currency swaps.\n\nCompagnie de Saint -Gobain applies regulation no. 2015-05 of July 2, 2015 issued by the French accounting standardssetter  ( Autorit\u00e9  des  normes  comptables -  ANC)  on forward financial instruments and hedging operations.\n\n## Pension obligations\n\nThe Company's obligations under supplementary pension plans and retirement bonuses are measured by independent  actuaries  using  the  projected  unit  credit method (based on final  salary  and  benefit  obligations  as determined at the measurement date). Pension obligations are  included  within  provisions  for  contingencies  and charges.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  arising  in  the  year  under defined-benefit retirement plans are recognized immediately and in full in the income statement.\n\nSince 2021, the provision for retirement bonuses has been calculated  in  accordance  with  the  November  17,  2021 revision  to  Recommendation  No.  2013-02  issued  by  the French  accounting  standards-setter  (ANC)  regarding  the rules  for  measuring  and  recognizing  pension  and  other benefit obligations.\n\n## Tax consolidation agreements\n\nCompagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  is  the  parent  company  of  a tax  consolidation  group  under  the  group  relief  regime provided for in Articles 223 A and seq. of the French Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ).\n\nThe tax consolidation agreements between Compagnie de Saint -Gobain and its subsidiaries provide for tax neutrality for  consolidated  subsidiaries.  In  their  relationship  with Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain,  the  consolidating  parent company, the subsidiaries discharge their taxes as if they had been taxed on a stand-alone basis. When loss-making companies  leave  the  Group,  they  are  not,  in  principle, entitled  to  any  payments  for  losses  transferred  to  the consolidating  parent  company  during  the  consolidation period.\n\n## NOTE 2 OPERATING INCOME/(LOSS)\n\nThe operating loss improved by \u20ac20 million compared to 2021, due mainly to an increase in discount rates in 2022, which generated  actuarial  gains  on  pension  obligations  (decrease  in  obligations  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  operating income).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 8 8\n\n9",

The  expense  in  2022  mainly  reflects\n\nprovisions  recorded  at  the  level  of  the  German  branch, while in 2021 it was due to an increase in provisions for the Group's long-term compensation plans.\n\n## NOTE 5 INCOME TAXES\n\nThe  Company  recorded  an  income  tax  benefit  of \u20ac253 million in 2022, comprising a \u20ac272 million income tax benefit under the tax consolidation regime in France and a \u20ac19 million income tax expense for the German entity.\n\nThe French tax group generated a tax profit in 2022. 50% of  the  2022  tax  profit  is  therefore  charged  against  tax losses  carried  forward  from  prior  years.  At  December  31, 2022, total cumulative tax loss carry-forwards represented \u20ac459 million.\n\nCompagnie de Saint -Gobain's permanent German establishment is the head of the Group's Organschaft local tax consolidation regime.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, future tax savings corresponding to the branch's unused tax loss carry-forwards amounted to \u20ac15 million.\n\n## NOTE 6 INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\n|                                 | Intangible assets   | Intangible assets   | Intangible assets          | Intangible assets                                   | Intangible assets        | Amortization                    | Amortization   | Amortization   | Net  value                       | Net  value        |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| (in EUR  millions)              | Gross at  Jan. 1,   | 2022 Additions      | Disposals  (retire- ments) | Transfer of intangible assets  under construc- tion | Gross at  Dec. 31,  2022 | Accumu- lated at  Jan. 1,  2022 | Increases      | Decreases      | Accumu- lated at  Dec. 31,  2022 | At Dec.  31, 2022 |\n| Purchased  goodwill             | 1                   |                     |                            |                                                     | 1                        | 1                               |                |                | 1                                | 0                 |\n| Other  intangible  assets       | 56                  | 0                   | -2                         | 1                                                   | 55                       | 50                              | 1              | 0              | 51                               | 4                 |\n| Intangible  assets in  progress | 0                   | 1                   |                            | -1                                                  | 0                        | 0                               |                |                | 0                                | 0                 |\n| TOTAL                           | 57                  | 1                   | -2                         | 0                                                   | 56                       | 51                              | 1              | 0              | 52                               | 4                 |\n\n\u00cb\n\nDividends received from subsidiaries rose by \u20ac210 million to  \u20ac1,025  million  in  2022,  while  2022  profit  transferred from  subsidiaries  of  the  German  branch  increased  by \u20ac64 million.",

Eligible employees must have completed a  minimum  of  three  months'  service  with  the  Group. Eligible  employees  are  able  to  invest  in  Saint -Gobain shares  at  a  preferential  subscription  price.  These  shares are  held  either  directly  or  through  the  employee  saving plan's mutual funds, depending on local legislation, and are subject  to  a  mandatory  five-  or  ten-year  lock-up,  except following  the  occurrence  of  certain  events.  The  Board  of Directors delegates authorization for setting the subscription  price  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain. It corresponds to the average of  the  opening  prices  for  the  Saint -Gobain  share  on Euronext  Paris  over  the  20  trading  days  preceding  the date  of  the  decision,  subject  to  a  20%  discount,  in accordance  with  applicable  laws, the Shareholders' Meeting resolutions and the deliberations of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2022, 4,916,097 new shares with a par value of \u20ac4 were issued  to  employees  under  the  PEG  at  an  average subscription  price  of  \u20ac45.19  (5,562,855  shares  at  an average  price  of  \u20ac35.81  in  2021),  representing  a  share capital increase of \u20ac222 million (\u20ac199 million in 2021).\n\n## 12.6 Potential number of shares\n\nAt the Shareholders' Meeting of June 2, 2022, shareholders authorized  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Compagnie  de Saint -Gobain to:\n\n- \u00b7 grant stock purchase or subscription options exercisable  for  new  or  existing  shares,  subject  in particular  to  performance  conditions,  representing  up to 1.5% of capital stock on the date of the Shareholders' Meeting,  with  a  sub-limit  of  10%  of  this  limit  for corporate  officers  of  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain,  i.e., 7,934,005  options,  including  a  maximum  of  793,401 options  for  corporate  officers  (17th  Resolution/38month  authorization  commencing  June  2,  2022).  It should  be  noted  that  this  limit  of  1.5%  of  the  capital stock will be set off against the threshold set in the 18th Resolution for the performance share grants mentioned below, and that this 1.5% limit represents the aggregate limit  for  shares  resulting  from  the  exercise  of  options granted  under  and  within  the  limit  of  the  17th Resolution  and  shares  granted  under  and  within  the limit of the 18th Resolution;\n- \u00b7 grant  free  existing  shares,  subject  in  particular  to performance conditions, representing up to 1.2% of the capital stock on the date of the Shareholders' Meeting, with a sub-limit of 10% of this limit for corporate officers of  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain,  i.e.,  6,347,204  free shares, including a maximum of 634,720 free shares for corporate officers (18th Resolution/38-month authorization  commencing  June  2,  2022).  The  limit  of 1.2% and sub-limit of 10% are being set off against the limits  specified  under  the  17th  Resolution  of  the Shareholders'  Meeting  referred  to  above  regarding stock options. The Board of Directors made partial use of this authorization by granting 1,232,792 performance shares  (including  75,000  for  corporate  officers)  on November 24, 2022 (see section 12.3).\n\nAt the Shareholders' Meeting of June 3, 2021, shareholders authorized  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Compagnie  de Saint -Gobain to:\n\n- \u00b7 issue,  on  one  or  several  occasions,  up  to  106,500,000 new  shares  or  securities  giving  access  to  the  share capital  of  the  Company  or  its  subsidiaries,  with preferential  subscription  rights,  or  without  preferential subscription rights but with a priority period for existing shareholders, by public offering, or without preferential subscription  rights  by  private  placement,  or  to  issue new  shares  through  the  capitalization of share premiums,  reserves,  profits  or  other  amounts,  or without preferential subscription rights in consideration of  contributions  in  kind  (18th  to  23th  Resolutions/26month authorization commencing June 3, 2021);\n- \u00b7 issue,  on  one  or  several  occasions,  up  to  13,000,000 new  shares  to  members  of  the  Group  Savings  Plan (25th  Resolution/26-month  authorization  commencing June 3, 2021).\n\nIf  all  outstanding  stock  options  whose  type  has  not  yet been  decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  were  to  be exercised  via  the  issue  of  new  shares,  this  would potentially  have  the  effect  of  increasing  the  number  of shares outstanding to 516,015,847 shares. In addition, if the authorizations described above were to be used in full by the  Board  of  Directors,  this  would  potentially  have  the effect  of  increasing  the  number  of  shares  outstanding  to 637,300,963 shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 8 8\n\n9",

These  expenses  are  shown  on  the  'Deferred  charges'  line  of  the  balance  sheet  (see  Note  11 'Deferred charges').\n\n## 15.1  Perpetual bonds\n\nIn 1985,  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  issued  25,000 perpetual bonds with a face value of ECU 5,000 (\u20ac5,000 today).\n\nA total of 18,496 perpetual bonds have since been bought back  and  canceled,  and  6,504  perpetual  bonds  are outstanding  at  December  31,  2022,  representing  a  total face value of \u20ac33 million.\n\nThe  bonds  bear  interest  at  a  variable  rate  (average  of interbank rates offered by the four reference banks for sixmonth euro deposits). The amount paid out per bond in 2022 was \u20ac0.\n\nThe bonds are not redeemable and interest on the bonds is classified as a component of finance costs.\n\n## 15.2  Main changes in bond debt\n\nCompagnie de Saint -Gobain also redeemed the following instruments at maturity:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac900 million worth of 3.625% bonds on March 28, 2022;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac100 million worth of 3.6% bonds on October 10, 2022.\n\n\u00cb\n\nOn  May  18,  2022,  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  partially redeemed a bond for a face value of GBP 183.6 million. The amount outstanding under this bond, originally issued for GBP 300 million, represents GBP 116.4 million maturing on November  15,  2024  with  a  coupon  of  5.625%.  The difference  between  the  redemption  value  and  the  face value  of  the  bonds  redeemed  (GBP  16.1  million)  was recorded in other financial expense.\n\nOn August 10, 2022, Compagnie de Saint -Gobain issued a \u20ac1.5 billion bond divided into three tranches:\n\n- \u00b7 a  \u20ac500 million  tranche  maturing  August  10,  2025  and paying a coupon of 1.625%;\n- \u00b7 a  \u20ac500  million  tranche  maturing  June  10,  2028  and paying a coupon of 2.125%;\n- \u00b7 a  \u20ac500 million  tranche  maturing  August  10,  2032  and paying a coupon of 2.625%.\n\nThe ten-year tranche is a Sustainability-Linked Bond (SLB) linked  to  two  important  indicators  of  Saint -Gobain's sustainability  roadmap,  with  ambitious  2030  targets  in relation to the 2017 base year:\n\n- \u00b7 reduce  by  33%  the  absolute  scope  1  and  2  CO2 emissions;\n- \u00b7 achieve an 80% reduction in non-recovered production waste.\n\nA  0.375%  step-up  would  apply  on  the  2032  coupon  for each of these indicators if their respective target was not met.",

In May 2014, the Commission Secretariat  issued  a  notice  of  complaints  against  Sanitas Troesch and other wholesalers in the industry alleging that Sanitas Troesch and some of its competitors had, among other  things,  agreed  in  2005  and  2012  to  lower  gross prices.\n\nNon-audit services provided by the Statutory Auditors to Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  relate  mainly  to  audit procedures carried out as an independent third party on the management report on CSR information, due diligence in the context of planned acquisitions or divestments, and procedures  related  to  the  issuance  of  comfort  letters  in the case of new bond issues.\n\n## Management compensation\n\nTotal gross compensation and benefits paid in 2022 by the French and foreign companies in the Group to members of the Executive Committee as it stood at December 31, 2022 (excluding  any  long-term  compensation)  amounted  to \u20ac15.3 million (2021: \u20ac14.2 million), including \u20ac5.7 million in gross variable compensation (2021: \u20ac5.5 million).\n\nProvisions  for  pensions  and  other  post-employment benefit  obligations  (defined-benefit  obligations  [DBO]  in respect of length-of-service awards and pensions) accruing to members of the Group's management bodies totaled \u20ac29.2 million (2021: \u20ac31.0 million).\n\nCompensation paid to members of the Board of Directors for 2022 totaled \u20ac1.1 million (2021: \u20ac1.1 million).\n\nThe total  fine  imposed  on  all  companies  involved  is  CHF 80 million. For Sanitas Troesch, the fine is CHF 28.8 million. Sanitas Troesch appealed this decision on May 2, 2016 and continues  to  firmly  refute  the  claims  made.  The  hearing took  place  before  the  Federal  Administrative  Court  on January  21,  2020  and  the  date  on  which  the  Federal Administrative  Court  will  issue  its  decision  is  not  yet known. However, a provision for claims and litigation was recognized at December 31, 2015 in an amount equivalent to the fine (unchanged as at December 31, 2022).\n\n## Investigation by the French Competition Authority in the building insulation products industry\n\nAlleged anti-competitive practices in the building insulation  products  market  were  notified  to  Saint -Gobain Isover  and  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain,  which  rejected such  allegations. The  French  Competition  Authority considered  that  the  alleged  anti-competitive  practices were  not  established  and  dismissed  all  the  objections  in January  2021.  Actis  appealed  this  decision  to  the  Paris Court of Appeal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

Saint -Gobain  Isover  and  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain accepted  these  withdrawals  without  reservation.  The decision  of  the  Paris  Court  of  Appeal  noting  the withdrawal  of  Actis  and  the  fact  that  the  actions  were removed from the Court was made on January 26, 2023. The  judgment  of  the  Paris  Civil  Court  declaring  the withdrawal  of  Actis  and  the  removal  of  the  case  is expected in the first half of 2023.\n\n## 20.2  Asbestos-related litigation\n\nCurrent  legal  actions  related  to  asbestos  are  described below.\n\n## Asbestos-related litigation in France\n\n## Inexcusable fault lawsuits\n\nIn France, Everite and Saint -Gobain PAM, which in the past manufactured fiber-cement products containing asbestos fibres, are the subject of actions by former employees of these  companies (or persons claiming through them) for recognition of inexcusable fault following diseases recognized as being of occupational origin.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, a total of 850 lawsuits had been issued  against  the  two  companies  since  the  outset  with the  aim  of  obtaining  supplementary  compensation  over and above the amounts paid by the French Social Security authorities in this respect.\n\nAs of the same date, 826 of these 850 lawsuits had been completed and 24 actions are still pending.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  compensation  paid  by  Everite  and Saint -Gobain PAM since the outset of  these  litigations  in settlement  of  these  lawsuits  totaled  approximately  \u20ac9.7 million as of December 31, 2022 (compared to \u20ac6.6 million as of December 31, 2021).\n\nIn  addition,  similar  suits  had  been  filed  against  13  French companies of the Group (excluding suits against companies that are no longer part of the Group) which in the  past  used  equipment  containing  asbestos  to  protect their employees  and  installations  against  heat  from furnaces.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, a total of 282 lawsuits had been filed  since  the  outset  against  these  13  companies. 240 of these  282  lawsuits  had  been  completed  and  42  actions were still pending at the same date.\n\nThe total amount of compensation paid since the outset of the  litigations  by  these  companies  was  approximately \u20ac11.8  million  as  of  December  31,  2022  (compared  to approximately \u20ac10.5 million as of December 31, 2021).\n\n## Anxiety claims\n\nEight of the Group's subsidiaries, including six that operate or have  operated  facilities in France  classified as containing  asbestos,  were  the  subject  of  anxiety  claims brought  by  current  or  former  employees  not  suffering from an occupational disease due to asbestos - claiming compensation for prejudice of anxiety suffered as a result of their alleged exposure to asbestos.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, a total of 861 lawsuits had been brought against these companies.\n\nAt the same date, 824 suits out of 861 have been definitely completed and 37 were still pending.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe total amount of compensation paid since the outset of the  litigations  was  \u20ac8.5  million  as  of  December  31,  2022 (unchanged compared to the amount as of December 31, 2021).\n\nIt  should  be  clarified  that  the  above  figures  do  not  take into  account  suits  filed  against  companies  that  are  no longer part of the Group.\n\nLast, the  total amount  registered  as  provision  for asbestos-related  litigations  in  France  -  inexcusable  faults lawsuits  and  anxiety  claims  -  amounted  to  around \u20ac8 million as of December 31, 2022 (compared to around \u20ac7 million as of December 31, 2021).\n\n## Situation in the United States\n\n## Measures taken to achieve an equitable and permanent resolution of the former CertainTeed Corporation's legacy asbestos liabilities in the United States\n\nDBMP LLC, an affiliate of CertainTeed LLC based in North Carolina,  that  holds  the  legacy  asbestos  liabilities  of  the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  filed,  on  January  23, 2020, a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte. The matter remains pending. The purpose of the filing is to achieve a certain,  final  and  equitable  resolution  of  all  current  and future  claims  arising  from  asbestos-containing  products manufactured  and  sold  by  the  former  CertainTeed Corporation.\n\nDBMP LLC intends to seek court authority to establish a trust under Section 524(g) of the US Bankruptcy Code - a specific provision that is applicable to companies that face substantial  numbers  of  asbestos-related  claims  -  to achieve  a  fair  and  equitable  resolution  of  its  asbestosrelated liabilities. Upon establishment of the trust, current and future plaintiffs with qualifying claims will be able to receive  faster  payment  of  their  claims  without  the  delay, stress  and  uncertainty  of  litigation  in  the  tort  system;  at the same time, the creation and funding of such a trust will permanently  and  finally  resolve  DBMP  LLC's  asbestos liability.\n\nDuring  the  course  of  this  bankruptcy  process,  which  is expected to take up to approximately five to eight years, all  asbestos  litigation  will  be  stayed  and  all  related  costs suspended,  providing  DBMP  LLC  with  the  time  and protection to negotiate an agreement to be approved on behalf of all claimants and by the court.\n\nThis  action  was  taken  as  a  result  of  the  increasing  risks presented in  the  US  tort  system.  Despite  the  passage  of time, the aging of the population and lessening opportunity  for  claimants  to  assert  legitimate  claims  of exposure  to  the  asbestos-containing  products  of  the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  naming  practices  in  the tort  system  continued  to  result  in  a  steady  volume  of claims against DBMP LLC, with no foreseeable end in sight. In  addition,  there  has  been,  in  general,  an  escalation  of settlement demands and verdicts in the tort system.",

No  decisions  on  the  merits  of  the  claims have  been  made  and  such  claims  do  not  affect  the Company's financial assessment of the Chapter 11 case.\n\n## Impact on the financial statements\n\nFollowing  the  commencement  of  the  proceeding  under Chapter  11  of  the  US  Bankruptcy  Code  on  January  23, 2020,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  DBMP  LLC  and  its wholly-owned  subsidiary  Millwork  &  Panel  LLC,  and  in particular  the  provision  for  asbestos-related  litigation  in the  United  States,  are  no  longer  consolidated  in  the Group's financial statements.\n\nNonetheless,  because  of  a  funding  agreement  between CertainTeed  LLC  and  DBMP  LLC  by  which  CertainTeed LLC has agreed to fund the costs of the Chapter 11 case and, ultimately, the 524(g) trust, in both cases solely to the extent  DBMP  LLC  is  unable  to  do  so  in  full,  the  Group recorded  in  its  consolidated  financial  statements  a  debt against  DBMP  LLC  amounting  to  $410  million  as  of December 31, 2022 ($417 million as of December 31, 2021).\n\nThe Group's consolidated income for 2022 is not impacted by the ongoing Chapter 11 proceeding described above.\n\nAs a result  of  this  bankruptcy  proceeding,  all  legal  costs and indemnity payments related to DBMP LLC's asbestos tort claims have been suspended, and no further charges in  relation  to  such  claims  have been taken in 2022 (as in 2021).\n\n## Situation in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, former employees  of  Brasilit, that once manufactured fiber cement containing asbestos, suffering from  asbestos-related  occupational  illnesses  are  offered, depending  on  the  case,  either  financial  compensation alone  or  lifetime  medical  assistance  combined  with financial compensation. Around 1,200 contractual instruments have accordingly been signed to date.\n\nTwo class actions were initiated against Brasilit in 2017 by two associations defending former employees exposed to asbestos at the S\u00e3o Caetano (S\u00e3o Paulo state) and Recife (Pernambuco  state)  plants,  asking  for  their  medical assistance  and  compensation  to  be  revised.  First  and second  instance  decisions  were  rendered  in  connection with the suit related to the S\u00e3o Caetano plant respectively in  July  2020  and  July  2021,  rejecting  the  claims  of  the plaintiffs. The  latter  have  nevertheless  appealed  the second  instance  decision.  First  and  second  instance decisions  were  rendered  in  relation  to  Recife  case, respectively  in  February  and  October  2022  rejecting  the claiming party arguments. The plaintiff has appealed such second instance decision.\n\nA third class action was initiated against Brasilit in 2019 in Capivari  (State  of  S\u00e3o  Paulo)  by  the  Labor  prosecutor asking  for  health  insurance,  as  well  as  collective  moral damages,  in  favor  of  employees,  former  employees  and their  respective  families,  as  well  as  subcontractors  who were  exposed  to  asbestos.  A  first  instance  decision  was\n\nrendered  in  September  2020  partly  in  favor  of  the plaintiffs.  In  particular,  collective  moral  damages  were granted to the plaintiffs, for an amount reduced to BRL 5 million (\u20ac0.8 million). Brasilit has appealed the decision.\n\nBrasilit is subject to controls by the Ministry of Labor and continues  to  comply  with  all  of  its  legal  obligations  with regard  to  medical  assistance  for  its  current  and  former employees.\n\nIn November 2017, the Supreme Court of Brazil decided to ban  asbestos  definitively  across  the  country.  Brasilit stopped using asbestos voluntarily as early as 2002.\n\n## 20.3  Environmental disputes\n\n## PFOA proceedings in the United States\n\nLevels  of  PFOA  (perfluorooctanoic  acid)  in  excess  of  US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health advisories or  state  maximum  contaminant  levels  for  drinking  water have been found in municipal water systems and private wells near current Saint -Gobain Performance Plastics (SG PPL) facilities in Hoosick Falls (New York) and Merrimack (New  Hampshire),  and  two  former  facilities  in  North Bennington  (Vermont)  in  the  United  States.  PFOA  and PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) have never been manufactured  by  these  plants.  SG  PPL  is  a  processor  of PTFE  which  it  purchases  from  third  party  suppliers  and which in the past contained some PFOA.\n\nSG PPL has voluntarily provided bottled water in all three communities, installed point-of-entry treatment systems to residents and businesses in all three communities, installed carbon filtration systems on the municipal water supply in Hoosick  Falls  and  funded  the  installation  of  a  carbon filtration system  on  the  Merrimack  Valley  District's municipal  water  supply.  In  addition,  it  has  voluntarily funded  construction  of  water  line  extensions  in  certain communities in the Merrimack and Bennington areas. The investigations are on-going and the scope of responsibility for SG PPL arising from environmental remediation in New Hampshire  and  New  York  and  clean-up  obligations  at these sites has not yet been established. The scope of the remediation in Vermont is defined and largely completed; future  operation  and  maintenance  obligations  remain. Without  admitting  liability,  SG  PPL  has  signed  consent orders  with  the  environmental  regulators  in  New  York  in 2016,  in  Vermont  in  2017  and  2019  with  respect  to  two different areas, and in New Hampshire in 2018, pursuant to which  SG  PPL  has  agreed  to  complete  investigations, implement  interim  or  final  remediation  measures  at  its current  and  former  facilities  and  in  the  case  of  Vermont and  New  Hampshire,  fund  construction  of  water  lines. Responsibility, if any, is expected to be shared with other parties as regards in particular the Hoosick Falls site.\n\nPFOA-related  lawsuits  alleging  both  health-related  and economic damages claims have been filed in civil courts in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, some of which are in the form of proposed or certified class actions. It is difficult  to  predict  the  timing  or  outcome  of  any  such litigation,  or  whether  any  additional  litigation  will  be brought against SG PPL, however, both the New York and Vermont class actions are settled.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 8 8\n\n9",

This provision covers both remediation and litigation related to PFOA matters.\n\n## 20.4  Other contingent liabilities\n\n## Grenfell Tower fire in the United Kingdom\n\nCelotex provides insulation materials for specific applications  for  the  building  and  construction  industry. Insulation materials  from  two  Celotex  ranges  were purchased  via  distributors  and  used  in  refurbishing Grenfell  Tower,  London  in  2015/2016,  including  as  one component  of  the  rainscreen  cladding  system  designed and  installed  (by  third  parties)  on  the  tower's  external facade.\n\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower fire on June 14, 2017, a Public Inquiry was constituted, which is considering, among other things,  the  modifications  made  to  the  building  as  part  of the refurbishment,  the  role  played  by  the  various construction  professionals,  and  the  information  provided by  the  manufacturers  of  the  products  used.  The  Inquiry has  been  conducting  its  work  in  two  phases:  its  phase  1 report  was  published  on  October  30,  2019;  phase  2 commenced  in  January  2020  and  public  hearings continued  until  July  2022,  with  a  final  report  to  follow, most  likely  in  2023.  A  criminal  investigation  into  the circumstances of the fire is also in progress.\n\nThere are a large number of issues and circumstances that need to be explored and the implications for Celotex are unlikely  to  be  known  for  some  time.  Civil  proceedings  in connection  with  Grenfell  Tower  brought  against  Celotex Limited  and/or  Saint -Gobain  Construction  Products  UK Limited (which respectively held the Celotex business until or  after  December  31,  2015)  and  a  number  of  other defendants - who are also core participants in the Public Inquiry  -  have  been  issued  by  bereaved,  survivors  and\n\n## NOTE 21 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nOn January 18, 2023, Compagnie de Saint -Gobain issued a \u20ac1.15 billion bond split into two tranches:\n\n- \u00b7 a  \u20ac500  million  tranche  maturing  July  18,  2024  and paying  a  floating-rate  coupon  of  3-month  Euribor +0.20%;\n\n\u00cb\n\nresidents  and  emergency  responders.  Those  proceedings have been stayed prior to the service of full pleadings on the basis that the parties to the litigation are permitted to engage  in  a  confidential  alternative  dispute  resolution process,  which  if  it  succeeds  would  avoid  the  need  for litigation. Celotex and Saint -Gobain Construction Products UK  Limited  are  engaging  with  other  parties  in  such processes.\n\nCelotex  and  Saint -Gobain  Construction  Products  UK Limited are unable to communicate on the status of those confidential  processes,  which  are  ongoing.  However,  the financial  statements  as  at  31  December  2022  include  a provision covering the principal financial implications that may  arise  from  the  process  engaged  with  bereaved, survivors and residents.\n\nThe  extent  to  which  Celotex  may  incur  further  civil  or criminal liability in connection  with  the  production, marketing,  supply  or  use  of  its  products  is  currently unclear and Celotex Limited and Saint -Gobain Construction Products UK are currently unable to make a reliable estimate of their potential liability in this respect.\n\n## 20.5  Other proceedings and disputes\n\nSome of the Group's companies may also be the subject of other  claims  made  by  their  employees  or  by  the  tax authorities, or in the context of the enforcement of seller's warranties granted by the Group to the buyers of divested businesses  (see  p.  290,  note  5.5.2).  Apart  from  the proceedings and litigation described above, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no other government, court or arbitration proceedings exist (including pending proceedings  or  proceedings  where  the  Company  and/or the Group might be threatened) which could have or have had,  in  the  last  12  months,  a  significant  impact  on  the financial  position  or  profitability  of  the  Company  and/or Group.\n\n- \u00b7 a \u20ac650 million tranche maturing January 18, 2029 and paying a coupon of 3.5%.\n\nThis  issue  has  no  impact  on  the  financial  statements  at December 31, 2022.",

We  believe  that  the  audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce )  and the French Code of Ethics ( code de d\u00e9ontologie )  for  statutory  auditors, for the period from January 1, 2022, to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Articles  L.  823-9  and  R.  823-7  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  ( code  de commerce )  relating  to  the  justification  of  our  assessments,  we  inform  you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the  financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese  matters  were  addressed  in  the  context  of  our  audit  of  the  financial  statements  as  a  whole,  approved  in  the conditions mentioned above, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and advances\n\n## Description of risk\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of the Company's investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and  advances  stood  respectively  at  \u20ac14,093  million  and  \u20ac14,882  million,  representing  81%  of  the  net  assets  of  the company. Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates are initially stated at historical cost including incidental expenses and are impaired, when applicable, based on their value in use.\n\nAs stated in Note 1 to the financial statements, the value in use is estimated periodically, and in particular at the closing date, using a multi-criteria approach: the Company's equity in the underlying net assets, proportion of consolidated net assets, net present value based on a multiple of a normative performance basis or net present value of future cash flows based on business plans (or long-term budget projections) excluding interest expenses but after tax.\n\nWhen the value in use is lower than the book value, a provision for impairment is recorded, the impairment losses could result in particular from a decline in the performance of certain subsidiaries or risks relating to the international locations of those companies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\nStatutory Auditors' report on the financial statements\n\nThe impairment tests performed by Management have led to book a reversal of impairment amounting to \u20ac13 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nWe deemed the measurement of the value in use of the investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and advances to be a key audit matter due to the materiality of these assets in the balance sheets and the high degree of estimation and judgment required from Management to assess impairment losses. Management's judgment is based in part on assumptions relating, on the one hand, to the multiples applicable to the valuation of the investments and, on the other, to future changes in the cash flows relating to the investments, as well as to the calculation of the appropriate discount rate applied to future cash flows.\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nWe  examined  the  impairment  test  procedure  applied  by  the  Company's  financial  management  team,  verified  the consistency of the method used and tested the effectiveness of the controls implemented by Management to ensure the quality and reliability of the procedure.\n\nWith the support of our valuation experts, we carried out an independent analysis of certain key assumptions used by Management to perform the tests, pertaining, as appropriate, to the multiple deemed applicable to the valuation of the investments or to the discount rate and average perpetual growth rate used to project future cash flows, referring both to external market data and analyses of comparable companies.\n\nFor each investment selected for our tests of detail, we corroborated the calculation parameters applied in Management's multi-criteria approach with the accounting and budget data available for that investment. Where projected future cash flows  were  used,  we  analyzed  the  consistency  of  the  projections  with  past  performance  and  our  knowledge  of  the Company's business, supported by interviews with  managers  from  the  various  businesses,  and  in  so  far  as  they  were available, by external data relating to markets or competitors. We paid particularly close attention to the calculation of the normalized amount of the terminal cash flows projected to perpetuity.\n\n## Specific v\u00e9rifications\n\nWe  have  also  performed,  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  specific  verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe  have  no  matters  to  report  as  to  the  fair  presentation  and  the  consistency  with  the  financial  statements  of  the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders.\n\nWe  attest  the  fair  presentation  and  the  consistency  with  the  financial  statements  of  the  information  relating  to  the payment deadlines mentioned in Article D.441-4 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ).\n\n## Report on corporate governance\n\nWe attest  that  the  Board  of  Directors'  report  on  corporate  governance  sets  out  the  information  required  by  Articles L.225-37-4, L.22-10-10 and L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlling and controlled companies. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover  bid  or  exchange  offer,  provided  pursuant  to  Article  L.22-10-11  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  ( code  de commerce ), we have agreed this information to the source documents communicated to us. Based on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n## Other information\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nWe  have  also  verified,  in  accordance  with  the  professional  standard  applicable  in  France  relating  to  the  procedures performed  by  the  statutory  auditor  relating  to  the  annual  and  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), prepared under the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material  misstatement  when  it  exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article  L.823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  ( code  de  commerce ),  our  statutory  audit  does  not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs  and  performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence  considered  to  be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant doubt  on  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 8 8\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND CROSS-REFERENCE TABLES\n\nAdditional information\n\n- \u00b7 one  candidate  is  elected  by  the  employees  holding registered  shares  as  part  of  a  consultation  process defined  by  General  Management.  Voting  may  take place by any technical means that ensures the reliability of  the  vote,  whether  by  electronic  means  or  by  mail, with each employee holding a number of votes equal to the  number  of  registered  shares  they  hold.  The candidate  with  the  highest  number  of  votes  is presented to the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Election of the Director representing employee shareholders\n\nIf  there  is  more  than  one  candidate  for  the  office  of Director representing employee shareholders, the Board of Directors  may  approve  the  appointment  of  one  of  them. The  candidate  with  the  highest  number  of  votes  at  the General  Shareholders'  Meeting  is  appointed  Director representing employee shareholders.\n\nThe  Company's  Works  Council  ( Comit\u00e9  de  Groupe ) appoints two Employee Directors. Employee Directors are appointed within six months of the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe term of office of a Director ends at the conclusion of the  Ordinary  General  Meeting  called  to  approve  the financial statements for the previous fiscal year held in the calendar  year  during  which  this  Director's  term  expires. The duties of an Employee Director (including a Director representing  employee  shareholders)  also  end  if  the employment contract is terminated, as of the date of the termination, subject to intragroup transfer. If the conditions for application of the law are not met, the term of  office  of  the  Employee  Directors  (including  a  Director representing employee shareholders) ends upon completion  of  the  Board  meeting  that  confirms  the Company's exit from the scope of application of the law.\n\nThe Board of Directors determines the Company's overall business strategy and examines any issues relating to its proper functioning.\n\nThe activities of the Board of Directors are organized and led by its Chairman.\n\nBoard meetings may be held using videoconferencing or other interactive telecommunication technology under the conditions stated by law.\n\nEach  Director  appointed  by  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting  must  own  at  least  eight  hundred  shares,  except Employee Directors and the Director representing employee shareholders.\n\n## General Management (Articles 13 and 15)\n\nAt the discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company's General  Management is  assumed  either  by  the  Chairman of  the  Board  of  Directors,  in  this  case  in  the  capacity  of Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  or  by  the  Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer,  chosen  by  the  Board  of Directors,  whether  or  not  from  among  its  members,  is vested  with  the  broadest  authority  to  act  under  any circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company  within  the limits  of  the  corporate  purpose  and  subject  to  such powers  as  the  law  expressly  attributes  to  General Meetings and the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive Officer represents the Company in its relations with third parties.\n\n## General Meetings and voting rights (Article 18)\n\nAny  shareholder  may  participate  in  General  Meetings  in person or by proxy, provided that his/her/its shares have been  formally  recorded  in  the  accounts,  subject  to  the applicable legal provisions.\n\nWhere  decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  shareholders may be convened to and vote at a General Meeting by any form  of  electronic  communication.  Any  shareholder  may be represented under the conditions provided for by law. Shareholding  legal  entities  are  represented  at  a  General Meeting  by  their  legal  representative  or  by  any  person designated by that legal representative for this purpose.\n\nAt  all  General  Meetings,  voting  rights  are  exercisable  by the beneficial owner of the shares. Each shareholder has a number of voting rights corresponding to the number of shares held, without limitation.\n\nHowever, double voting rights are allocated to fully paidup shares registered in the name of the same shareholder for at least two years.\n\nIn  addition,  in  the  case  of  a  capital  increase  through capitalization  of  reserves,  profits  or  share  premiums, registered shares allocated free of charge to a shareholder carry double voting rights from the date on which they are issued  on  the  basis  of  shares  already  held  by  the shareholder carrying such entitlement.\n\nDouble  voting  rights  are  forfeited  when  the  shares  are converted to bearer form or sold. However, double voting rights are not forfeited when title is transferred by way of an  inheritance  or  as  a  result  of  the  liquidation  of  the marital estate or an inter vivos donation to a spouse or a relative in the direct line of succession. The transfer is not considered in calculating the qualifying period indicated in the preceding paragraph.\n\nShareholders  may  vote  by  mail  in  accordance  with applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Allocation and appropriation of net income (Article 20)\n\nAn appropriation of at least five percent is deducted from net  income,  less  any  losses  carried  forward  from  the previous year, and  allocated to the reserve fund prescribed  by  law.  This  appropriation  is  no  longer mandatory once the reserve fund reaches a sum equal to one  tenth  of  the  share  capital.  It  is  reactivated  if  the reserve falls below one tenth.\n\nDistributable  income  corresponds  to  net  income  for  the fiscal year less any losses carried forward from prior years and  less  any  amounts  to  be  credited  to  reserves  in application  of  the  law  or  the  Company's  bylaws,  plus retained earnings.\n\nThe  General  Meeting  may  appropriate  this  distributable net income for the period as follows:\n\n- 1. all or part of this amount to any contingency or special reserves or to retained earnings, based  on  a recommendation of the Board of Directors;\n- 2. if these appropriations do not absorb the total amount of  distributable  income,  shareholders  are  paid  a  noncumulative  first  dividend  equal  to  five  percent  of  the paid-up par value of shares without being entitled to claim  such  payment  from  appropriations  from  the distributable income of subsequent years;\n- 3. if  any  funds remain after paying these appropriations, they are divided among the shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Meetings of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  holds  at  least  seven  scheduled meetings  each  year.  At  each  year-end,  an  annual  work program  is  drawn  up  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors and given to the Directors for the following year. The draft minutes of each meeting are sent to the Directors at the same time as the agenda for the next meeting. They are  approved  at  that  meeting,  and  the  final  minutes  are then sent with the agenda for the next meeting.\n\nExcept  for  meetings  held  to  approve  the  annual  financial statements  of  the  Company,  the  annual  consolidated financial  statements  and  the  annual  management  report, Directors  who  take  part  in  a  Board  meeting  using videoconferencing or other telecommunication technology enabling  them  to  be  identified  and  participate  actively  in the discussion are deemed to be present for calculation of the quorum and voting majority.\n\n## II. Prior and ongoing information for Directors\n\nEach time a meeting is called, Directors are provided with a selection of financial analyses and a range of press articles concerning  the  Group  published  since  the  last  Board meeting.\n\nThe  text  of  explanations  and  presentations  scheduled  on the agenda for a meeting is sent to the Directors before the meeting.\n\nThe draft Universal Registration Document for the Group, the  draft  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  draft annual  and  interim  financial  statements  are  sent  to  the Directors  before  the  meeting  at  which  they  are  to  be considered.\n\nThe  information  file  provided  to  the  Directors  at  each meeting  includes,  among  other  things,  an  analysis  of  the Group's  operating  income  and  its  net  debt  at  the  end  of the previous month, as well as details of the Saint -Gobain share  performance  compared  with  the  CAC  40  and  an industry index.\n\nOne Board meeting is held at a different Group site each year to give the Directors an opportunity to visit that site.\n\n\u00cb\n\nBetween meetings, the Directors receive copies of all press releases  issued  by  the  Company  along  with  any  relevant information about events or transactions that are material for the Group.\n\nDirectors  have  the  right  to  ask  for  any  other  documents that  they  consider  necessary  to  make  an  informed contribution  to  the  Board's  discussions;  the  request  is made to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, who may submit the request to the Board for a decision.\n\nDirectors may  also  ask  to  meet  with  the  Senior Management  of  the  Group  and  to  request  that  no executive corporate officers are present; in the latter case, notice  is  first  given  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  and  the Chairman  may  submit  the  request  to  the  Board  for  a decision.\n\n## III. Deliberations of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors examines all issues that fall within its remit, as specified in the applicable laws and regulations and  the  Company's  bylaws,  particularly  on  the  following subjects:\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  meets  annually  to  review  and approve the budget for the Group.\n\nIt  reviews  and  approves  the  strategic  orientations  of  the Group at least once a year and monitors their implementation,  taking  into  account  the  social  and environmental challenges of its business.\n\nAll capital expenditures, restructuring, disposals, acquisitions  and  financial  investment  and  divestment projects  in  individual  amounts  greater  than  \u20ac150  million must be submitted to the Board for prior approval, along with  any  material  transactions  that  fall  outside  the Saint -Gobain Group's stated strategy.\n\nFor urgent matters where there is not enough time to call a Board  meeting,  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors provides the Directors with all relevant information by the most efficient method to obtain their opinion.\n\nOnce a year, the Board of Directors dedicates an item on its agenda to a discussion about its operation. In addition, an assessment of its organization and operation is carried out  periodically  at  the  initiative  of  the  Lead  independent Director;  this  assessment  is  added  to  the  agenda  of  a subsequent Board meeting.\n\nEvery  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  also  reviews  each Director's situation in relation to the independence criteria set  out  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  based  on  a  report prepared by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. The  results  of  the  review  are  reported  to  shareholders  in the annual report.\n\nNon-executive Directors may meet during or after a Board meeting,  without  the  executive  corporate  officers  being present,  to  assess  their  performance  and  consider  the future line-up of the Group's General Management.",

These consultations assist in developing the Group's CSR reporting and communications.\n\n## A - Reference bases\n\nSaint -Gobain's main reportings include social, environmental, health and safety, and responsible purchasing  indicators.  Each  of  these  reports  and  the associated indicators have been drawn up in accordance with  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  and  applicable French legislation.\n\nThe  choice  of  indicators  is  defined  in  a  logic  of  time stability  and  information  availability.  The  description  and calculation  rules  of  indicators  defined  in  the  Group's governance documents are available for the teams of the different countries in French and in English.\n\n## B - Scope\n\n## a.  The social reporting includes both qualitative and quantitative data on personnel and social issues\n\nCompared  to  the  scope  of  financial  consolidation,  the scope  of  consolidation  of  CSR  data  in  this  report  is composed  of  fully consolidated companies. Newly consolidated companies are accounted for at the rate of their financial integration, with a maximum grace period of two  years,  and  companies  sold  during  the  year  are  not taken  into  account.  An  entity  integrated  in  the  reporting before  the  maximum  period  remains  integrated  until  its disposal.  For  2022,  the  acquisitions  of  Kaycan  Ltd  and GCP Applied Technologies are excluded from reporting.\n\nIn  order  to  have  a  global  reference  framework,  these standards  are  also  based  on  indicators  from  the  GRI (Global  Reporting  Initiative),  SASB  or  other  relevant standards depending on materiality issues.\n\nSocial data from the Smart'R tool is collected either manually or automatically as follows:\n\n| Type of collection                                                              | Frequency   | Scope   | Content                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Social data (IT interface)                                                      | Monthly     | 94.4%   | Basic data on employees, hours and salary costs.

Absenteeism  rate  is therefore calculated over a more limited scope than that of the annual social reporting campaign.\n\nSome  countries  were  excluded  from  the  calculation  of these  indicators  because  of  the  lack  of  data  for  diverse reasons (no interface, priority application of local regulations  over  global  definition,  etc.).  The  following countries  are  concerned  by  this  exclusion:  the  United Sates,  Canada,  Ireland  and  Switzerland,  as  well  as  noninterfaced entities with less than 500 employees.\n\nAbsenteeism  rate  is  expressed  as  a  percentage  and corresponds to the total number of hours of absence over the total number of theoretical working hours. The reasons for  absences  taken  into  account  in  this  indicator  are absences  for  illness,  absences  relating  to  occupational accidents (including traveling to and from work), absences due  to  strikes  and  unjustified  absences.  Authorized  or anticipated absences (e.g. annual leave, family events) are not included in this indicator.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9",

Temporary  employment  does  not include subcontractors and service providers.\n\nDespite  the  entities  excluded  from  the  scope,  the  Group retains sufficient coverage in terms of headcount to enable the reporting of relevant indicators.\n\n## Training indicators\n\nThe  scope  is  that  of  the  Smart'R  entities  interfaced  with payroll, i.e., 94.4% of the total workforce.\n\nThe  indicator  includes  all  employees  trained  during  the year  (including  those  who  left  during  the  year)  reported on the number of employees at December 31, 2022.\n\n## b.  Environmental, health, and safety reporting is organized around three questionnaires with different scopes and frequencies\n\nThe scope of consolidation for environmental, health, and safety  data  includes  all  fully  consolidated  companies. Newly  consolidated  companies  are  accounted  for  at  the rate  of  their  financial  integration,  with  a  maximum  grace period of two years, and companies sold during the year are  not  taken  into  account.  An  entity  included  in  the reporting  before  the  maximum  period  remains  included until it is disposed of. For 2022, the acquisitions of Kaycan Ltd  and  GCP  Applied  Technologies  are  excluded  from reporting.\n\nSome  questionnaires  being  specific  to  one  or  several categories  of  establishments,  the  scope  can  be  more  or less wide.\n\n- \u00b7 Safety:  makes  it  possible  to  summarize  all  accidents and  their  severity,  as  well  as  the  number  of  days  lost from work. The questionnaire includes all the companies  in  the  Group,  which  are  grouped  together by  site,  branch  or  office.  For  example,  an  entity  that produces both plasterboard and plaster will report the data  on  a  single  grouping.  In  addition  to  Group employees,  accidents  relating  to  temporary  workers and permanent subcontractors are also included.\n- \u00b7 Industrial  Hygiene  &  Health:  allows  for  the  results  of internal  audits,  the  follow-up  of  health  programs, certifications,  etc.  to  be  included.  The  questionnaire concerns all group companies by site grouping node.\n- \u00b7 Environment: enables the collection of all data relating to  production,  raw  materials,  energy,  atmospheric emissions, water, etc. It concerns sites with a significant impact  on  the  environment,  such  as  industrial  sites, mines and quarries.\n- \u00b7 Financial  data  related  to  the  environment,  health,  and safety  (expenditure  and  investments)  concern  all  the group's entities. They are tracked in the SIF, the Group's financial reporting tool since the 2013 fiscal year.\n\nThe safety and environment reporting data is entered directly in the EHS reporting system, called Ga\u00efa, for all EHS entities. The various questionnaires sent, as well as their frequency, scope of reporting and content, are shown in the following table:\n\n| Questionnaire       | Frequency   | Scope                                                                                                                                        | Content                                                                               |\n|---------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Safety-on-Line      | When needed | World, all categories of victims                                                                                                             | Instant alert in case of work-related accident  with or without work stoppage, fatal  |\n| Environment-on-Line | When needed | World, environmental events                                                                                                                  | Instant alert in case of major or significant  environmental accidents                |\n| Safety              | Monthly     | World, all categories of employees                                                                                                           | Accidents, numbers of days lost,  worked hours\u2026                                       |\n| General & Health    | Annual      | World (all entities except certain offices or  attached sites)                                                                               | Certification, audit results, monitoring  of health programs\u2026.                        |\n| Environment         | Annual      | 'Environmental concerned scope' sites +  mines and quarries (excluding sites  connected to plants) + other sites at the  region's initiative | Output, raw materials, energy, atmospheric  emissions, water, waste, mitigation plan\u2026 |\n\n## c.  Responsible purchasing reporting\n\nResponsible  purchasing  reporting  is  broken  down  into  a 'trading' and a 'non-trading' scope. All suppliers in these categories  which  carry  out  transactions  with  Group companies are covered by the reporting.\n\nThe scope of 'trade' suppliers is composed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 European partners: strategic suppliers with a European framework contract. These suppliers represent 43% of total purchases;\n- \u00b7 main  suppliers:  annual  transactions  of  over  3  million euros.  These  suppliers  -  mainly  in  France,  Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom - account for  more  than  85%  of  the  total  purchases  of  trading companies;\n\n\u00cb\n\n- \u00b7 own  brands: suppliers with whom  Saint -Gobain Sourcing (India and China) develops products marketed  under  a  Group  brand.  Limited  share  of  the Group's total purchases.\n\nThe  scope  of  'non-trading'  suppliers  considered  in  the indicators  is  made  up  of  suppliers  with  annual  purchases of more than 100,000 euros which have not been subject to an exemption (supplier owned by a State government or in a sole sourcing position) and which do not concern expenses  related  to  sectors  of  activity  not  managed  by the Purchasing function (banks, insurance, legal services).\n\nThis perimeter represents 82% of the total expenses of the Group's non-trading perimeter.",

Social reporting\n\nSocial  reporting  is  mainly  composed  of  Smart'R  data. Depending on the type of  data,  the  data  is  reassembled monthly or annually. The process of data consolidation for the social reporting involves three steps:\n\n- \u00b7 The data is entered into the tool monthly by interface (94.4%  of  headcount)  or  manually  via  questionnaires for other entities (5.6% of headcount);\n- \u00b7 The  reporting  is  enriched  by  annual  social  data gathered  by  questionnaires  such  as  the  number  of signed agreements in effect, etc.;\n- \u00b7 Information is made more reliable by the Social Affairs Direction.\n\nThe  environmental,  health, and  safety reporting is powered  by  the  Ga\u00efa  tool.  Each  of  the  questionnaires  is manually typed into the tool. Information may be reported monthly (e.g., safety) or annually (e.g., industrial hygiene, and health and environment). The process for consolidating  EHS  reporting  data  is  similar  to  that  for social  reporting,  where  the  data  is  entered  and  then verified and consolidated by the Group's EHS Department.\n\n## b.  CO2 emissions evaluation\n\nTo evaluate its CO2 emissions, the Group applies the GHG protocol frame of reference.\n\n- \u00b7 Scope 2 evaluation:\n\nScope 2 emissions evaluation calculations are carried out using a a market-based methodology. Following the GHG protocol,  emission  factors  for  electricity  come  from certified  sources  or  suppliers'  certificates  or  recognized bases (for example, the IEA).\n\nFor  countries  where  data  is  not  available,  the  emission factors  used  are  defined  by  the  environment  team.  In particular, for the majority of European countries, the IAE country  emission  factors  have  been  used.  In  order  to quantify  the  differences  between  the  methodology  used by Saint -Gobain and the one using only the AIB 'residual mix' emission factors, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on the 2022 data and the difference observed represents less than 10% for Scope 2 and less than 1.5% for Scope 1+2.\n\n## c.  Responsible purchasing reporting\n\nResponsible  purchasing  reporting  is  powered  by  the Nazare tool by compiling document reviews and audits of trade and non-trade suppliers. The data is aggregated and reviewed by the Group's Purchasing teams.\n\n## D - The Group's objectives\n\nThe Group has set targets for 2025, based on 2010 results, and targets for 2030, based on 2017 results.\n\n## a. 2010-2025 iso-production objectives\n\nThe  Group  has  set  medium-term  objectives,  up  to  2025, based  on  the  2010  results.  They  are  established  using comparable production for three-year periods. This means, for  instance,  that  2020-2022  emissions  and  consumption are recalculated based on 2019 production.\n\nBased on the results from the baseline year for the threeyear  period,  the  Group  updates  every  three  years  the scope for which environmental results are tracked for the following three years (2011-2013 / 2014-2016 / 2017-2019 / 2020-2022 / 2023-2025).\n\nThe  published  results  for  each  scope  therefore  have  a comparable  scope  for  the  three  years  within  the  period: sites  closed  or  sold  are  removed  from  current  year  and baseline  year,  but  no  acquisition  is  taken  into  account. They  are  included  in  the  subsequent  period.  The achievement of the iso-production objectives will therefore take into account the contribution of sites that opened  or  closed  between  2010  and  2025  in  one  (or more) of the five periods considered.\n\nProgress  achieved  over  these  five  three-year  periods (between  2010  and  2025)  will  be  cumulated  to  assess whether the 2025 objectives have been achieved based on the 2010 results.\n\n## b.  Targets 2017-2030, in absolute terms\n\nThe Group has also set objectives for 2030 based on the results of 2017, including Continental for targets related to CO2  emissions,  water  withdrawals,  avoided  virgin  raw materials  and  non-recovered  waste.  They  are  defined  in absolute value, for the entire Group.\n\n## E - Limitations encountered\n\nAs the Group operates in a variety of countries, a doctrine detailing  the  calculation  method  for  each  indicator  is distributed to the contributors every year for the various reporting  systems.  However,  despite  the  doctrine,  it  is sometimes  possible  that  the  indicators  are  interpreted differently  depending  on  the  local  context  (national legislation or practices).\n\nThe  Group  remains  vigilant  with  regard  to  distortions between countries that may arise in the understanding of indicators  and  may  be  led  to  exclude  from  the  scope  of reporting entities with excessive differences in understanding.\n\nIn addition, the reporting process means that some entities are  not  interfaced  or  have  difficulty  presenting  the necessary  data.  The  Group  remains  attentive  to  the reliability of the information and ensures that the coverage for each  reporting  is  sufficient  to  present  reliable indicators.\n\nAs  payroll  closing  dates  may  differ  from  one  country  to the  other,  some  social  reporting  indicators  are  only calculated on a 12-month rolling basis in order to smooth out  any  timing  differences  due  to  these  different  closing dates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

This  report  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  and  construed  in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\nReport of one of the Statutory Auditors, appointed as independent third party, on the verification of the consolidated nonfinancial performance statement\n\n## Year ended December 31, 2022\n\nCOMPAGNIE DE SAINT-GOBAIN\n\nTour Saint-Gobain\n\n92400 Courbevoie cedex\n\nIn  our  capacity  as  Statutory  Auditor  of  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  SA  (hereinafter  the  'Company'),  appointed  as independent third party ('third party') and accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Cofrac), under number 3-1886 (Cofrac Inspection Accreditation, scope available at www.cofrac.fr), we have conducted procedures to express a limited assurance conclusion on the historical information (observed or extrapolated) in the consolidated non-financial performance statement, prepared in accordance with the Company's procedures (hereinafter the 'Guidelines'), for the year ended December 31, 2022 (hereinafter the 'Information' and the 'Statement', respectively), presented in the Group management report pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles L. 225-102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce) .\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased  on  our  procedures  as  described  in  the  section  'Nature  and  scope  of  procedures'  and  the  evidence  we  have obtained,  no  material  misstatements  have  come  to  our  attention  that  cause  us  to  believe  that  the  non-financial performance statement does not comply with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not fairly presented in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Comments\n\nWithout qualifying the conclusion expressed above and in accordance with Article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code, we make the following comments:\n\n- \u00b7 The Guidelines used for the preparation of information on energy and raw materials consumed could be specified in order to ensure homogeneous application.\n- \u00b7 The 'Absenteeism rate' indicator is based on local laws with regard to the hours to be included in the absences taken into account, leading to differences in approach.\n\n## Preparation of the non-financial performance statement\n\nThe absence of a generally accepted and commonly used reference framework or established practices on which to base the assessment and measurement of the Information enables the use of different but acceptable measurement techniques that may impact comparability between entities and over time.\n\nAccordingly, the Information must be read and interpreted with reference to the Guidelines, summarised in the Statement and available on the Company's website.\n\n## Limits inherent in the preparation of the information relating to the Statement\n\nAs  stated  in  the  Declaration,  the  Information  may  be  subject  to  uncertainty  inherent  to  the  state  of  scientific  and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used.\n\nSome information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the Statement.\n\n## Responsibility of the Company\n\nManagement is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 selecting or determining the appropriate criteria for the preparation of the Information;\n- \u00b7 preparing a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented with respect to these risks as well as the outcomes of these policies, including key performance indicators and the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy);\n- \u00b7 implementing such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been prepared by applying the Company's Guidelines as referred to above.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor appointed as independent third party\n\nBased on our work, our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- \u00b7 the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- \u00b7 the  fairness  of  the  information  provided  pursuant  to  part  3  of  sections  I  and  II  of  Article  R.  225-105  of  the  French Commercial Code, i.e., the outcomes of policies, including key performance indicators, and measures relating to the main risks, hereinafter the 'Information'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  addition,  we  have  implemented  a  system  of  quality  control  including documented policies and procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, ethical  requirements  and  the  professional  guidance  issued  by  the  French  Institute  of  Statutory  Auditors  ( Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes ) relating to this engagement.\n\n## Means and resources\n\nOur work engaged the skills of ten people between September 2022 and March 2023 and took a total of fifteen weeks.\n\nTo  assist  us  in  conducting  our  work,  we  referred  to  our  corporate  social  responsibility  and  sustainable  development experts. We conducted around ten interviews with people responsible for preparing the Statement.\n\nThis work involved the use of information and communication technologies allowing the work and interviews to be carried out remotely, without hindering the good execution of the verification process.\n\n## Nature and scope of procedures\n\nWe planned and performed our work taking account of the risk of material misstatement of the Information.\n\nWe consider  that  the  procedures  conducted  in  exercising  our  professional  judgement  enable  us  to  express  a  limited assurance conclusion:\n\n- \u00b7 We familiarized ourselves with the activities of all  companies in the consolidation scope and the description of the principal risks.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the suitability of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and clarity, taking into account, where appropriate, best practices within the sector;\n- \u00b7 We verified  that  the  Statement  covers  each  category  of  information  stipulated  in  section  III  of  Article  L.  225-102-1 governing social and environmental affairs, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and tax evasion;\n- \u00b7 We verified that the Statement provides the information required under Article R.225-105 II of the French Commercial Code where relevant with respect to the principal risks, and includes, where applicable, an explanation for the absence of the information required under Article L.225-102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code;\n- \u00b7 We verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of the principal risks associated with the activities  of  all  the  consolidated  entities,  including  where  relevant  and  proportionate,  the  risks  associated  with  their business  relationships,  their  products  or  services,  as  well  as  their  policies,  measures  and  the  outcomes  thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the principal risks;\n- \u00b7 We referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:\n- -assess  the  process  used  to  identify  and  confirm  the  principal  risks  as  well  as  the  consistency  of  the  outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented;\n- -corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important; (1) for  certain  risks  or  information,  (for  instance:  supply  chains,  skills  and  talent  management,  etc.),  our  work  was carried out on the consolidating entity, while for other risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

These procedures were conducted for a selection of contributing entities (3) and covered between 20.4% and 31.9% of the consolidated data selected for these tests.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the overall consistency of the Statement in relation to our knowledge of the entire Company.\n\nThe procedures conducted in a limited assurance review are substantially less in scope than those required to issue a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with the professional guidelines of the French National Institute of Statutory Auditors ( Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes ); a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, February 23, 2023\n\nOne of the Statutory Auditors,\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gourd Partner, Audit\n\nOlivier Jan Partner, Sustainability Services\n\nTested  Entities  (Security,  Human  Resources) :  CDL  (St  Brieuc  site  (FR)),  La  Plateforme  (Paris  (FR)),  Optimera  AS  (Oslo  (NR)),  SG Distribution Brazil (Telhanorte Lojas (BR)), SG Mexico Secret (Cuautla (MX)).",

It is the result of a consultation with the Group's  internal  stakeholders  and  it  takes  into  account Saint -Gobain's new organization, effective as of January 1, 2019. It presents the Group's sustainable growth generation process through its key resources and its main pillars of value creation.\n\n## CSR risk and opportunity analysis\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  conducted  its  study  of  the  risks  and opportunities  related  to  corporate  social  responsibility (CSR)  within  the  framework  of  the  priority  challenges presented  in  the  materiality  analysis  (see  section  2.1.3 , p. 54).\n\nAs a result, a universe of the 15 most important CSR risks and opportunities for Saint -Gobain was built by factoring in  the  Group's  strategy,  its  objectives  and  operations  as well as  its main  environmental,  social  and  societal challenges.  In  an  effort  to  harmonize  the  vocabulary  and the vision on these challenges, a table presenting a risk or an opportunity's definition, as well as the potential impacts for stakeholders on the one hand and for Saint -Gobain on the other hand, has been provided.\n\nThese risks  and  opportunities  were  then  rated  according to stakeholders' expectations in order to combine internal and external visions of the organization, according to the methodology shared with internal audit and control. While the  risk  assessment  methodology  follows  the  process developed  by  the  internal  control,  the  value  scales  have been adjusted according to non-financial impacts and to a long-term  time  frame.  The  interviews  were  conducted from May to September 2018 with two assessment criteria: impact and criticality. Members  of the Executive Committee participated in these evaluations.\n\nNine  CSR  risks  and  opportunities  were  identified  as  the most important:\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity within the organization and inclusion;\n- \u00b7 Energy efficiency and carbon intensity of operations;\n- \u00b7 Business ethics;\n- \u00b7 Management of skills and talents;\n- \u00b7 Responsible supply chain management;\n- \u00b7 Integration of recycled materials;\n- \u00b7 Energy  and  carbon  performance  of  products  and services;\n- \u00b7 Health and safety at work;\n- \u00b7 Product safety.\n\nThe  identification  of  these  risks  is  a  key  step  in  the construction of the Group's CSR roadmap (see section 2.1.3 , p. 55).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9",

Manufacture  of  energy-efficient  equipment  for  the  buildings .  Activity  3.5  directly  covers  several  Saint -Gobain product categories, including insulation, glazing for external fa\u00e7ades (windows), plasterboard and mortars that are part of an insulation system;\n- \u00b7 3.6.  Manufacture  of  other  low  carbon  technologies .  Activity  3.6  concerns  Saint -Gobain  products  and  solutions contributing  to  substantial  reduction  (compared  to  the  most  efficient  alternative  on  the  market)  of  GHG  emissions generated by the product or by the manufacturing process to which they contribute. This especially includes activities in  ceramics,  mobility,  construction  chemicals,  or  the  construction  industry.  Some  building  material  systems  that promote lightweight construction are also included.\n\n## Alignment of activities\n\nFor all so-called eligible activities, Saint -Gobain has identified the applicable technical criteria as well as the corresponding performance thresholds:\n\n- \u00b7 for the activities referenced in category 3.5, technical criteria and corresponding performance thresholds have been defined by the regulation;\n- \u00b7 for the activities referenced in category 3.6, in the absence of technical criteria and performance thresholds defined by the  regulation,  these  have  been  identified  and  assessed  by  comparing  the  benefits  and  performance  with  standard products or solutions on the market as required by regulations. Saint -Gobain relied in particular on life cycle analyzes in accordance  with  reference  standards  (ISO,  PEF)  and  assessed  the  thresholds  to  define  a  substantial  reduction according to sectors and product families.\n\nSaint -Gobain's  ambition  is  to  offer  solutions  that  combine  performance  and  sustainability  in  order  to  meet  the expectations of its stakeholders, especially its customers, and to enable the acceleration towards a more sustainable and low-carbon economy (see section 3.1.4.C, p. 85). A standard method for evaluating the benefits of these solutions was defined  in  2020  and  deployed  in  the  organization.  The  benefits  in  terms  of  contributing  to  the  fight  against  climate change are integrated into the approach. This standard profit measurement method has been audited by an independent third  party  and  published  on  the  Group's  website.  Saint -Gobain  relied  on  this  method  to  measure  the  alignment  of product lines for the activities referenced in category 3.6.\n\nThis exercise requires carrying out complex studies on the comparative performance of products and solutions, some of which, given their complexity, will have to be continued during 2023.\n\nThe work carried out also included verification of compliance with the minimum guarantees (see section 3.1.5 Ethics and compliance and table 9.3.4 on the Vigilance plan, p. 86 and p. 388), as well as the analysis of compliance with the criteria of 'Do not significant harm' (DNSH) based on its existing policies and its risk management system. More specifically for DNSHs:\n\n- \u00b7 adaptation  to  climate  change,  see  section  3.1.3.A.b.

The portion relating to entries in the scope is presented in note 4.2.\n\nThe CapEx categories considered in the numerator as eligible (or aligned) are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 CapEx linked to activities whose turnover is eligible, and detailing the CAPEX linked to activities whose turnover is aligned;\n- \u00b7 CapEx linked to individual measures enabling the reduction of CO2 emissions.\n\nSince  2021,  a  financial  reporting  category  has  been  dedicated  for  monitoring  investments  linked  to  CO2  emissions reduction, in line with the Group's CO2 roadmap to contribute to carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\n|                                                                         | 2                                                          | 3                                                          | 4                                                          | 5                                                          | 6 7 8 9 10                                                 | 6 7 8 9 10                                                 | 6 7 8 9 10                                                 | 6 7 8 9 10                                                 | 6 7 8 9 10                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                         |                                                            | Absolute  CAPEX                                            | Proportion  of CAPEX                                       | Climate  change  mitigation                                | Climate  change  adaptation                                | Water  and  marine  resources                              | Circular  economy                                          | Pollution                                                  | Biodiversity  and  ecosystems                              |\n| Economic activities                                                     | Codes                                                      | Currency                                                   | %                                                          | %                                                          | %                                                          | %                                                          | %                                                          | %                                                          | %                                                          |\n| A.
