        "page_content": "## Accelerated renewable energy build-out is more needed than ever\n\nLetter to our stakeholders\n\nOur ambition to reach approx. 50 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030 is more important than ever. The world is facing a climate crisis, and it is indisputable that a transition to a sustainable energy system is needed. In the past decade, global investment in energy supply has slowed down by 2.4 % per year across all technologies, indicating a risk of an emerging energy shortage. Especially in Europe, this risk has been worsened by the war in Ukraine. This development has made it evident that renewable energy is the best solution to secure an independent, locally rooted energy supply, and that investments must be accelerated. We are ready to be part of this much-needed accelerated renewable energy build-out.\n\nOur longstanding industry experience in constructing largescale offshore wind farms and our strong supplier relations give us a competitive edge in the industry, which enables us to maximise joint strengths across our portfolio. We have a well-functioning operating model, which allows us to harvest synergies across markets, regions, and technologies. We want to play a key role in the future energy systems with a focus on three areas: offshore wind, onshore renewables, and P2X (green fuels and e-fuels), and we aim to be a key player in developing multi-technology solutions. Based on our  capabilities and experiences and our unique renewable platform, we are ideally positioned to integrate renewable technologies to help shape the future energy market and to cater for the growing customer demand.\n\nHowever, for the acceleration to be successful, it is crucial that we build green energy right. Our actions should contribute to fully decarbonising the world's energy systems, to revive and rewild our oceans and lands, to respect human rights in everything we do, and to promote just societies and build thriving local communities, based on stable high-quality jobs and local supply chains.\n\n## Significant strategic and operational progress\n\nThe year 2022 underlined our continued leadership in offshore wind. Despite a challenging year for the industry with continued supply chain bottlenecks and increasing costs of raw materials and components, we are in a robust position for weathering the current volatile market conditions. In 2022, we achieved significant strategic results across our business, and it keeps us ahead of our annual build-out targets towards 2030. We were awarded 2.9 GW of offshore wind capacity and added 1.6 GW of onshore renewables through organic growth and acquisitions. Additionally, we advanced seven projects (1.4 GW) to FID and four projects (2.0 GW) to COD.\n\nThis increased our firm capacity to 30.7 GW by the end of 2022 and keeps us well on track to deliver on our 2030 ambition of ~50 GW. Furthermore, we achieved strong operational performance with our assets remaining fully operational and having strong availability rates. Our CHP plants supported the much-needed security of supply in Denmark. Our green share of heat and power generation amounted to 91 %.\n\nThomas Thune Andersen and Mads Nipper in Grimsby, the UK.\n\nIn the UK, we were awarded a contract for difference (CfD) for building Hornsea 3, the world's single biggest offshore wind farm, and we commissioned Hornsea 2, the world's largest operating wind farm.\n\nIn the US, we continued the development of our portfolio of offshore wind projects off the East Coast. We took FID on South Fork, which is well on track to be commissioned as our first US project late 2023. For Ocean Wind 1, BOEM released its draft environmental impact statement (DEIS), and we continued to",

        "page_content": "mature the project boundary conditions and secure key supply chain contracts. In January 2023, we signed an agreement to purchase PSEG's 25 % equity stake in the project. However, due to supply chain bottlenecks, cost inflation, and higher costs of capital, the value of our US projects with non-inflation-adjusted contracts are under pressure. For our Sunrise Wind project in New York, this led to an impairment. We remain committed to our portfolio, and we are confident we can create value.\n\nThe early construction work of two of our German offshore wind farms, Borkum Riffgrund 3 and Gode Wind 3, are both progressing according to plan. In Taiwan, despite challenges, we continued the progress in all areas of the construction of Greater Changhua 1 & 2a and expect to commission the wind farm in H2 2023. We decided not to participate in the third Taiwanese auction as it did not meet our financial threshold.\n\nBy partnering with the offshore project developer Simply Blue Group and the minority JV partner Subsea 7 on the 100 MW floating project Salamander in Scotland, we are taking tangible steps into floating offshore wind. Likewise, we signed an agreement and entered into a partnership with Repsol, a global multi-energy company, to explore the joint development of floating offshore wind in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nWe also formed a new partnership with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners to develop up to 5.2 GW of offshore wind in Denmark across four projects. The partnership aims to accelerate the green transformation, create value in the offshore wind industry, and create a Danish business and export stronghold within renewable hydrogen.\n\nIn our onshore business in the US, we took FID on three projects, the wind farm Sunflower in Kansas, the solar PV project Mockingbird in Texas, and the combined solar PV and storage project Eleven Mile in Arizona. The wind part of Helena Energy Center in Texas and the wind farm Haystack in Nebraska were successfully commissioned.\n\nAdditionally, we are constructing the solar farm Old 300, which is 78 % commissioned, and the solar part of Helena Energy Center. We expect full commercial operation before the end of 2023 for both projects. Furthermore, we acquired the onshore wind farm Ford Ridge in Illinois.\n\nWe have taken yet another step within onshore renewables in Europe by completing the acquisition of Ostwind. This acquisition expands our portfolio into Germany and France with a development project pipeline of more than 1.5 GW. In Spain, we marked our entry into the onshore market with four partnerships to pursue early-stage solar and onshore wind projects.\n\nTo support our growth ambitions, we effectively recycled our capital by signing and completing two new farm-downs. The farm-down of Hornsea 2 was one of the largest renewable energy M&A transactions ever with a valuation that underpins the attractiveness of our offshore wind assets. In our onshore business, we closed our first-ever agreement to farm down 50 % of a portfolio of four onshore projects in the US to Energy Capital Partners. Both transactions secured a NPV retention of around 100 % and crystalised value up front, while providing proceeds, which we can reinvest in value-creating growth.\n\nIn our P2X business, we took FID on and acquired the remaining 55 % of FlagshipONE, a late-stage development project in Northern Sweden. The facility will have an electrolyser capacity of 70 MW and is expected to produce 50,000 tonnes of e-methanol per year based on renewable hydrogen and biogenic carbon. This is \u00d8rsted's first commercial-scale final investment decision within its P2X business and represents a significant milestone in the realisation of our P2X ambitions. It is also the largest e-methanol project under construction in Europe.\n\nWe also signed a landmark letter of intent with A.P. Moller Maersk to deliver 300,000 tonnes of e-methanol to power Maersk's newly ordered e-methanol-powered vessels.\n\n## /three.tf/zero.tf./seven.tf GW\n\nWe increased our firm capacity to 30.7 GW by the end of 2022, which keeps us well on track to deliver on our 2030 ambition of ~50 GW renewable capacity.\n\nThis has enabled us to accelerate the development of a 675 MW facility on the Gulf Coast.\n\nFinally, both our 'Green Fuels for Denmark' project and our Haddock P2X project in the Netherlands received IPCEI funding in 2022.\n\n## Financial results\n\nEBITDA including new partnership agreements totalled DKK 32.1 billion in 2022, our highest EBITDA to date, of which the gain from the 50 % farm-downs of Hornsea 2 and Borkum Riffgrund 3 amounted to DKK 11.0 billion in total.\n\nEBITDA excluding new partnership agreements amounted to DKK 21.1 billion, an increase of DKK 5.3 billion compared to 2021. We benefitted from our diverse portfolio and achieved significantly higher earnings from our onshore wind and solar PV business, our combined heat and power plants, and our gas activities than expected at the beginning of the year, while earnings in Offshore decreased. The unexpected decrease in Offshore was primarily due to adverse impacts from hedges and delays at our Hornsea 2 and Greater Changhua 1 & 2a construction projects. During the year, we have had to recognise a DKK 1.3 billion negative impact from hedges, which does not fulfil the requirements for hedge accounting under IFRS 9. The effect is temporary and will improve EBITDA in later periods.\n\nThe return on capital employed (ROCE) was 17 %, and profit for the year amounted to DKK 15.0 billion.",

We remain confident in our long-term financial estimates and growth ambitions.\n\n## Continued sustainability leadership\n\nIn 2022, we launched additional commitments, initiatives, and pilots, which are needed to deliver on our mediumand long-term targets. In addition to initiatives related to our net-zero emissions target, we have acted on our commitment to deliver a net-positive biodiversity impact from all our new energy assets from 2030 at the latest and our aspiration to drive a just transition. Our 98 % carbon reduction target for 2025 remains unchanged. However, we will not see steep emission reductions from energy generation in 2023-2024, since we have been ordered by the Danish authorities to continue operations of our coal-fired power stations until June 2024.\n\nWe are proud founding members of the First Movers Coalition steel and concrete sectors. In 2022, together\n\n## /three.tf/two.tf./one.tf\n\n/two.tf/four.tf./three.tf\n\nwith only four other leading companies, we agreed to further accelerate the decarbonisation of our supply chain, by procuring at least 10 % 'near-zero' concrete by 2030. With this, we aim to pool our purchasing power and create early market demand for near-zero concrete.\n\nSince 1970, 70 % of the world's wildlife have been lost, and projections show that biodiversity will  continue to decline if we maintain business as usual. We have started a range of initiatives, and in 2022, we launched an international partnership with WWF. The partnership will help us achieve our ambition and develop innovative ocean projects across our markets. In an ambitious new project, we have partnered with the Lincolnshire and Yorkshire wildlife trusts to restore biodiversity around the  Humber in Northern England. Additionally, we will protect almost 1,000 acres of native prairie as part of our Mockingbird solar PV project in the US together with The Nature Conservancy.\n\nBuilding renewable energy comes with the opportunity to provide high-value jobs and drive a socially just transformation of our industry. We want to do both.\n\nWe are expanding our thriving communities programme to make sure we have a robust impact management system in place, which is geared towards delivering local, social, and economic value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Selected events /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf\n\n## February\n\n## August\n\nOffshore wind farm South Fork, New York, FID (/one.tf/three.tf/zero.tf MW), COD expected in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf\n\n## March\n\nLetter of Intent signed with A.P.

        "page_content": "As a first in the US, together with North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU), we announced an agreement to construct offshore wind farms with an  American workforce. In Choczewo in Poland, we have set up a community fund to support local sustainable development opportunities, and as part of Sunrise Wind in New York, we will recruit and train workers from marginalised communities for union construction careers.\n\nTo support our journey, we will ensure that sustainability is embedded in the core of how we do business. This entails a corporate governance that enables the right decisions. In 2022, we took this further. Following implementation for the leadership team in 2022, we adjusted our short-term incentive (STI) scheme for all participating employees, effective from 2023. The new STI supports a stronger link to our 2030 aspirations, including global sustainability leadership, and ensures that sustainability is further integrated in our operating model.\n\n## Our employees and our organisation are the backbone of our success\n\nIn a challenging and highly volatile year, our skilled and valued employees have navigated this complexity well and managed to deliver strong strategic progress and record results for \u00d8rsted. Our success is only possible through them, and we care deeply about all our colleagues and our joint safety. In 2022, our employee satisfaction survey showed a motivation and satisfaction score of 76 out of 100. Although this is a high score well above our external benchmark for comparable companies, we aim even higher, and we will continue to improve the well-being of our employees.\n\nHaving a strong focus on safety is anchored in our organisation in terms of both protecting the physical conditions of our employees and securing a psychologically safe workplace.\n\nIn 2022, our total recordable injury rate (TRIR) reached 3.1, up from 3.0 in 2021, mainly due to recordable injuries for contractors' employees. We are not satisfied with this development. Consequently, we have implemented several initiatives to improve safety, and we remain focused on our ambition of reaching a TRIR of 2.5 in 2025.\n\nAs we expand our global footprint, we experience increasingly different local market requirements. Therefore, as of November 2022, we implemented a new organisational structure, which is rooted in local regions while leveraging the synergies of a global organisation. With this new structure, integrating our offshore and onshore renewables organisations and making P2X a stand-alone business, we are moving closer to our markets and our customers. Consequently, there were changes to our Group Executive Team, including new regional executives.\n\n## Committed to our ambition\n\nIn 2022, an energy crisis was added to the global climate and biodiversity crises. Renewable energy has proven to be significantly cheaper than any fossil fuel alternative, even with higher prices, and it has furthermore proven to be the best possible insurance policy to avoid future energy price increases like those seen last year.\n\nTherefore, action must be taken to increase the pace of the necessary investments in renewable energy. In the US, an important step has been initiated by introducing the US Inflation Reduction Act. It provides USD 385 billion in funding for renewable energy generation, renewable hydrogen production, and climate risks over the next ten years. In the EU, the European Commission is planning a Net-Zero Industry Act, which will be aligned with the 2050 climate targets and provide significant opportunities for the renewable energy sector.\n\nWe need to push regulatory and political barriers to focus on fast and streamlined permitting processes, which today continue to represent a major bottleneck within our industry. We are pleased to note that discussions around permitting are ongoing in our major markets.\n\nIn light of supply chain bottlenecks, inflation, and increasing cost of capital, it is also essential that countries and states are willing to pay realistic long-term prices for renewable power. We will uphold the necessary financial discipline to ensure our projects are profitable. Furthermore, we need to push for increased focus on the  societal value provided by renewables to secure a sustainable build-out of the industry and for future auction frameworks to include factors like efficient system integration, biodiversity, and the restoration of nature to the benefit of local communities.\n\nWe believe it can be done, and we, at \u00d8rsted, are wellpositioned to continue to play a pivotal role in the accelerated build-out needed in the coming years.\n\nMads Nipper Group President and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThomas Thune Andersen Chair of the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2023, we expect earnings to be fairly limited, reflecting normal margins on these activities, lower volumes, and a negative timing impact related to our Danish gas storage activities.\n\n## Gross investments\n\nGross investments for 2023 are expected to amount to DKK 50-54 billion, mainly driven by:\n\n- -   Offshore (Greater Changhua 2b & 4, Greater Changhua 1 & 2a, Borkum Riffgrund 3 and Gode Wind 3, Ocean Wind 1, and our US North-ast cluster projects)\n- -   Onshore (Eleven Mile, Mockingbird, and projects from our substantiated pipeline in both the US and Europe)\n- -   timing effects between years (lower level in 2022, postponed to 2023).\n\n## Uncertainties, prices, and hedges\n\nOur offshore wind farms are largely subject to regulated prices, implying a high degree of revenue certainty. This means that we know the price per generated MWh for most wind farms in Denmark and Germany, our first Dutch wind farm, and the CfD wind farms in the UK. For our British ROC wind farms, we also know the subsidy per generated MWh which we will receive in addition to the market price.\n\nThe part of our generation from offshore and onshore assets which is exposed to market prices has, to a large extent, been hedged for 2023. The same applies to our currency risks. Generation from our CHP plants is partly hedged. On a Group level, we hold a hedge level of around 70 % for 2023.\n\nThe most significant uncertainty to the operating profit in 2023 is the power generation, which depends on wind conditions, ramp-up of new wind and solar assets, asset availability, timing of possible farm-downs, and the attractiveness of spreads on our CHP plants. In addition, high gas and power price volatility could impact earnings for the year through optimisation possibilities at our gas storage and sourcing contracts as well as higher balancing and intermittency costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThe annual report contains forward-looking statements, which include projections of our short- and long-term financial performance and targets as well as our financial policies.\n\nThese statements are by nature uncertain and associated with risk. Many factors may cause the actual development to differ materially from our expectations.\n\nThese factors include, but are not limited to, changes in temperature, wind conditions, wake and blockage effects, precipitation levels, the development in power, coal, carbon, gas, oil, currency, inflation rates, and interest rate markets, changes in  legislation, regulations, or standards, the renegotiation of contracts, changes in the competitive environment in our markets, and reliability of supply.\n\nRead more about the risks in the chapter on 'Risks and risk management' and in note /six.tf.",

Together with the Group Executive Team, CEO Mads Nipper will present a progress update on our long-term strategy.\n\n## Financial estimates\n\nAt our Capital Markets Day in June 2021, we presented four key financial estimates to support our ambitious self-funded build-out of approx. 50 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. The financial estimates cover (see details in the table to the right):\n\n- -   spread to WACC on investments\n- -   EBITDA CAGR for operating offshore, onshore, and P2X assets\n- -ROCE\n- -   share of EBITDA from regulated and contracted activities.\n\nAs a consequence of supply chain disruptions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, cost inflation, and prolonged permitting processes, especially in the US, the gross investments from 2020 to 2027 to enable our 50 GW build-out are currently trending higher than the approx. DKK 350 billion we had planned for. However, if the inflation and energy price levels remain at elevated levels, these factors will positively impact our EBITDA CAGR and ROCE in the period and lead to an increase in the relative share of EBITDA that is merchant. Notwithstanding the higher trending CAPEX, we remain committed to our CMD plan.\n\n## Financial policies and capital allocation\n\nThe Board of Directors will recommend to the annual general meeting that a dividend of DKK 13.5 per share be paid for 2022, equating an increase of 8.0 % and a total of DKK 5.7 billion.\n\nSupported by the expected increase in cash flows from future offshore and onshore assets, we still intend to increase annual dividends paid by a high single-digit percentage compared to the previous years' dividends, covering the period up to 2025.\n\nWe will continue to invest our capital according to the following principles, in order of priority:\n\n- -   We will maintain our strong commitment to our credit ratings (BBB+/Baa1).\n- -   We will honour our dividend commitment to our shareholders.\n- -   We will invest in value-creating growth opportunities.\n\n## Authorisation to increase share capital\n\nAt the annual general meeting in 2022, we were authorised to increase our share capital on one or more occasions until April 2027. The authorisation allows for a capital increase of up to 20 %, which can significantly expand our capacity to invest in green growth beyond the ~50 GW of installed renewable capacity towards 2030.\n\n| Financial estimates                                                              | Target                                                | Year                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fully loaded unlevered lifecycle spread   to WACC at the time of bid/FID         | /one.tf/five.tf/zero.tf-/three.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf bps | Continuous                                                     |\n| Average yearly increase in EBITDA from  offshore and onshore assets in operation | ~/one.tf/two.tf %                                     | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf |\n| Average return on capital employed  (ROCE)                                       | /one.tf/one.tf-/one.tf/two.tf %                       | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf |\n| Average share of EBITDA from long-term  regulated and contracted activities      | ~/nine.tf/zero.tf %                                   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf |\n\nRead more about our key metrics, financial targets, and policies in the presentation from our Capital Markets Day at orsted.com/en/ capital-markets-day-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf\n\n## Financial policies\n\nRating Capital structure Dividend policy\n\nMin.

Therefore, we have set a bold strategic aspiration, supported by our strong multitechnology growth platform.\n\n## Strategic aspiration\n\nIn 2021, we set our strategic aspiration to become the world's leading green energy major by 2030. Our strategic aspiration is not just about gigawatt capacity. Rather, it means reaching leading positions across five pillars.\n\nThe first pillar is our aim to be one of the world's largest green electricity producers. This will require us to significantly increase our installed renewable energy capacity. Our ambition is to reach approx. 50 GW by 2030, which is more than three times our current installed capacity of 15.1 GW (across offshore wind, onshore wind, solar PV, P2X, energy storage, and combined heat and power plants). As part of this ambition, we want to maintain our global leadership in offshore wind, and we want to be a significant player globally within onshore renewables (which includes onshore wind, solar PV, and energy storage). Furthermore, our ambition encompasses a leading position in the global P2X market; renewable hydrogen and green fuels are central to resolving the most challenging elements of the energy transition, decarbonising hard-to-electrify sectors. Our renewable energy\n\ndevelopment expertise, customer relationships, and proven experience in managing complex projects will be a significant advantage in this rapidly evolving market.\n\nThe second pillar relates to capital deployment. Our ambition is to be one of the world's largest and most valuecreating deployers of capital into the green transformation. While offshore wind remains our largest investment area, onshore renewables and P2X will gradually take up a larger share.\n\nThe third pillar is our ambition to be the world's leading talent platform in renewable energy. We want to bring together a diverse combination of perspectives and competences to help us deliver on our vision. We believe that talent is diverse by nature, and it is essential to foster an inclusive culture to reap the benefits of a diverse talent  pool.\n\nThe fourth pillar covers our ambition to be a globally recognised sustainability leader. Sustainability is at the core of our business. Both because renewable energy is crucial for tackling climate change and protecting our environment, and because we insist on a renewable build-out that is done right. We want to leverage the full potential of renewable energy to create lasting positive impact that contributes to reviving nature, promoting just societies, and creating resilient jobs. We want to do so because it is the right thing to do, but also because it\n\n## Vision\n\nLet's create a world that runs entirely on green energy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/zero.tf aspiration\n\nBecome the world's leading green energy major\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOne of the world's largest green electricity producers\n\nSignificant player in onshore renewables\n\nA global leader in P/two.tfX\n\nGlobal no. /one.tf in offshore wind\n\nOne of the world's largest and most value-creating deployers of capital into the green transformation\n\nThe world's leading talent platform in renewable energy\n\nA globally recognised sustainability leader\n\nA core contributor and catalyst for change towards a world running entirely on green energy",

To build a truly resilient business and supply chain, we need to integrate sustainable and reliable solutions into everything we do. And we need to do it now.\n\nFinally, we have set an ambition to be a core contributor and catalyst for change towards reaching our vision of a world that runs entirely on green energy.\n\nWe want to set new and ambitious standards for what it means to be a green energy major, and we want to lead by example in the energy industry and beyond. As part of this, we will continue to engage with stakeholders and decision-makers to build support for and promote action towards our vision.\n\n\u00d8rsted is already working across the industry and playing a vital role in finding common ground for decarbonisation, for example by linking suppliers and offtakers.\n\nTo help us track our progress, our strategic aspiration is supported by eight strategic targets, as described under 'Strategic targets' on the next page. For each target, it is also illustrated how the target supports our pillars.\n\nOur work towards our strategic aspiration spans our entire business, and we continue to drive forward our efforts alongside the progress on our strategic targets.\n\n## An expanded and diversified growth platform\n\nTo reach our 2030 strategic aspiration, we are expanding and globalising our growth platform. Over the last year, we have identified new opportunities, and we now have a strong growth platform for onshore and P2X in both\n\nEurope and the Americas. We remain a global leader in offshore wind across Europe, the Americas, and APAC. We are continuously identifying new opportunities with both short- and long-term potential across our growth platform.\n\nIn offshore wind, we have expanded our market presence since 2021. We commissioned the world's largest offshore wind farm, Hornsea 2 in the UK, and we are acting to expand our market footprint in growth markets, such as the Nordics, the Baltics, Spain, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and Australia. As part of our expansion, we want to play a significant role in enabling the commercialisation of floating offshore wind, which we see as an important technology for the build-out of renewables in deep water geographies. In order to reach our 2030 target of 30 GW installed offshore capacity, our annual build-out target is 2 GW per year towards 2025 and 3 GW per year towards 2030.\n\nIn onshore renewables, we have taken significant steps over the last year. In the US, we took FID on three new projects. With our acquisition of Ostwind (with an attractive pipeline covering Germany and France) as well as multiple new partnerships in Spain, we have built a strong growth platform in Europe. We are continuing to identify opportunities to further scale our onshore presence and build our onshore renewables capacity. In order to reach our 2030 target of 17.5 GW installed onshore capacity, our annual onshore build-out target is 1.5 GW per year towards 2030.\n\nOur P2X business is the most recent addition to our growth platform. We see hydrogen and e-fuels as a key component of the green transition and a major growth area for our business. We are continuously developing and maturing our +3 GW global pipeline of renewable hydrogen and e-fuels projects, and in 2022, we took FID on FlagshipONE and expanded into North America.",

Yet, we must also build green energy right to ensure we deliver a low-emission energy system that contributes to a just and thriving planet. At \u00d8rsted, we aspire to run a business that gives more to nature and society than it takes, and we will continue to partner with companies, customers, NGOs, and others who share our aspiration to create lasting positive impact.\n\n## Build green energy right, now\n\nA massive acceleration of the renewable energy build-out is the single biggest contribution that countries can make towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately tackle the dramatic and damaging impacts of global heating.\n\nYet, it is increasingly apparent that a simplistic approach focusing purely on quick wins and gigawatt numbers will unreasonably stress nature, local communities, working conditions, and supply chains. This is because the build-out requires access to land and sea, which relies heavily on coexistence with other users, nature, and local communities. It requires materials for construction - some of which are scarce or in high demand - and people with the right skills, necessitating a larger workforce and reskilling and upskilling to meet demand. In other words, focusing only on getting the cheapest possible clean power increases the risk of negative impacts on nature and society.\n\nUltimately, the success of the green transition heavily relies on how we go about it. The world needs a speedy, scalable, and progressive sustainable build-out. One that fully acknowledges and addresses the impacts that climate change and the build-out itself have on nature and societies to create a truly sustainable world that runs entirely on green energy. We need to build green energy right, now.\n\n## Giving up business as usual\n\nThe acceleration of renewable energy has already made huge strides. Solar and wind power are already the most affordable options for generating electricity in two thirds of the world, and renewables are set to replace coal as the world's leading source of power generation by 2027. But in order to stay below the 1.5\u00b0C threshold and avoid catastrophic and irreversible damage, it is time to give up business as usual.\n\n## Time to give back more than we take\n\nAt \u00d8rsted, we aspire to run a business that gives more to nature and society than it takes. This requires us to integrate solutions to the root causes of some of our biggest societal challenges into our green energy projects, ensuring that the green transformation creates a lasting positive impact on our environment, biodiversity, and social structures.\n\nOur end goal is to build practices that regenerate nature and society. Our actions should contribute to fully decarbonising the world's energy systems - including the more difficult\n\nCod are top marine predators, making them vital for maintaining the marine ecosystem's delicate balance.

But also to ensure we have a strong organisation, fit for the future and able to navigate in the constantly evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nOn the following pages, we unfold this work across our four interlinked strategic priority areas: climate, nature, people, and governance. To the right, our full portfolio of sustainability programmes is presented, spread across the four priority areas.\n\n\u2192\n\nEvery year, we identify the sustainability themes that are material to our stakeholders and the success of our business.\n\nWe compare the material themes with our capability to address impacts and expectations, we develop actions to close gaps, and we update our portfolio of sustainability programmes.

An important step to achieving this is our commitment to reduce the emissions intensity in our own energy generation and operations (scope 1-2) by at least 98 % by 2025 compared to 2006.\n\nWith our long-term target in place, we have focused our efforts in 2022 on launching the next set of initiatives needed to decarbonise our supply chain. Many of our core materials, such as steel, concrete, and fuels, face a steep road towards full decarbonisation. We do not have all the answers, but to get on track for 2040, we need to move now - to pilot and lean into innovative solutions.\n\n## Plans to meet scienced-based /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/five.tf target unchanged\n\nWe had a set-back in 2022, with our absolute scope 1-2 emissions increasing by 17 %, as we temporarily had to resume coal use at our Studstrup Power Station. This was due to global scarcity of wood pellets following a ban on imports from Russia and a wood pellet fire at Studstrup. Moreover, following orders from the Danish authorities to temporarily extend operation of three of our coal- and oil-fired power stations in order to ensure the security of the electricity supply in Denmark, we had to delay our 2023 zero-coal target to 2025.\n\nWe maintain that coal has no place in the future energy system, and our 98 % target for 2025 remains unchanged. However, we will not see steep emission reductions from\n\nenergy generation in 2023-2024, until we are allowed to completely phase out coal.\n\nBy 2025, our primary remaining emissions will be from the fuels used for offshore wind logistics and the natural gas used at our power stations for back-up capacity. We have initiated several initiatives to reduce offshore logistics emissions - an area where green options are not yet widely available. This includes our pioneering agreement with a supplier on investing in the world's first service operation vessel (SOV) that can operate entirely on green fuels. This is a big step towards decarbonising offshore logistics, and together with our systematic approach to fuel saving initiatives, it helps to create critical demand signals to the industry to accelerate the green transition.\n\nIn addition, we continue to explore ways to further reduce emissions from the remaining gas used at our power stations.\n\n## Realising net-zero in /two.tf/zero.tf/four.tf/zero.tf\n\nLooking towards 2040, our approach to realise net-zero emissions in our value chain is twofold. First, we will gradually phase out our natural gas sales. Second, we will work to decarbonise our renewable energy supply chains, which will be the most challenging part of meeting the target.\n\nWe took three important steps in 2022:\n\n- -   We expanded the expectation to use 100 % renewable electricity by 2025 to all our suppliers - an industry first.\n- -   We made a new commitment on 'near-zero' concrete through the First Movers Coalition to procure at least 10 % 'near-zero' concrete by 2030.\n- -   Together with Climate Group, we hosted the inaugural SteelZero summit, a crucial step in our promotion of policies to decarbonise the steel industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTogether, these commitments are important ways for us to operationalise our 2040 target in the short to medium term. Based on them, we can learn and test different solutions together with partners, and we can push the market to develop and mature green technologies already now.\n\nWe expect our scope 3 emissions to increase again in 2024 once the Tyra gas field is reopened, and deliveries under our long-term gas sourcing contract with DUC are resumed. We remain on track to meet our 2032 target.\n\nTo read more about our decarbonisation efforts, including how we now use site-specific life cycle assessments to report on scope 3 emissions, please see pages 14-17 in our sustainability report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Taking credible climate action\n\nOn our journey towards net-zero, we face the challenge that for many of the low-carbon solutions we urgently need, a fully sustainable option does not yet exist or is not competitive at scale and cost. Navigating these less mature areas of sustainability can be difficult for all companies; however, not acting is an option we do not have.\n\nWe seek to be a catalyst for change and try to tackle the challenge by developing clear guidelines and outlining sustainability ambition levels for our own approach, which we also share with suppliers and partners. In this way, we continually work to strengthen our approach, and we aim to communicate transparently about it.",

        "page_content": "## Environment\n\n## Green energy that revives nature\n\nIf built right, renewable energy holds the potential for enhancing biodiversity and improving ecosystems. We want to do just that, and we are dedicated to delivering projects that contribute to reviving our nature. We have set the ambition that all our green energy assets will deliver a netpositive biodiversity impact from 2030 at the latest.\n\n## Leading a build-out with a net-positive impact on biodiversity\n\nWe are facing a global biodiversity crisis with 70 % of the world's wildlife having been lost since 1970. Climate change is one of the main reasons, and the two crises are deeply interconnected. However, if done right, the green energy transition can play a key part in tackling both. To do so, we need to start addressing climate and biodiversity goals together. That is why we set our net-positive biodiversity ambition in 2021, stating that with every asset we build, we want to leave the surrounding ecosystems and wildlife in a better condition than it was before.\n\n## Moving towards net-positive\n\nSince setting our target, we have worked hard to progress. In 2022, we took several exciting steps to move us from ambition to action:\n\n- -   We launched an innovative five-year global partnership with WWF. In this partnership, we want to set a new standard for biodiversity protection and restoration in offshore wind development by showing what can be done. Jointly, we will identify, develop, and advocate initiatives and approaches that can enhance ocean biodiversity. Read more here.\n\n- -   We have strengthened our dedicated biodiversity programme. We have onboarded full-time regional biodiversity leads and taken the first steps to introducing net-positive considerations early in our projects. We are also integrating our Onshore business to the programme, and as a first exciting initiative, we will protect almost 1,000 acres of native prairie as part of our Mockingbird Solar Center in the US together with The Nature Conservancy.\n- -   We continued to develop and pilot innovative biodiversity projects. We do so to gain experience and learn from our successes and failures with the aim of scaling successful solutions. These include our 3D-printed reefs at the Danish offshore wind farm Anholt (read more here), restoring biodiversity in the UK's Humber estuary (read more here), and our ReCoral project in Taiwan (read more here).\n\n## Measuring our impact\n\nA key challenge we face today is that no clear frameworks exist for measuring and reporting on biodiversity impacts across both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. This is challenging not only when we wish to measure our own impact, but also for ensuring global alignment on how companies act and report.\n\nTo succeed, close collaboration is needed. We support framework developers like the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) and work with them to develop an industry standard for measuring biodiversity impacts at a corporate level. In the meantime, we are also developing our own framework so that we can already now begin to align on how we measure and report on biodiversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mitigating impacts through a circular economy\n\nRaw materials are being extracted, produced, and used at a pace and scale that is damaging to our nature. Transitioning to a circular economy - through which we can reduce waste, circulate materials, and regenerate nature - can play a key role in tackling this.\n\nWe are currently building a strategic approach to circularity across our entire value chain. We do so with the aim of reducing our use of raw materials, increasing asset lifespan, and reusing and recycling materials. In /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, we adopted a commitment to reuse or recycle all solar PV modules from our Region Americas' solar farms. We also built a circularity roadmap for our monopile foundations to reduce their environmental footprint, including the use of scrap steel. Read more in the sustainability report, page /two.tf/two.tf.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting the transition towards a water-secure world\n\nPressure on global water systems and clean freshwater supplies is increasing. Therefore, in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, we developed a programme on water to ensure that our continued build-out supports the transition to a water-secure world with sufficient and clean supplies.\n\nThis includes our target to reduce our total freshwater withdrawal intensity measured in l/kWh by /four.tf/zero.tf % from /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf to /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/five.tf. We also work systematically to identify opportunities to reduce or substitute our freshwater use. For our P/two.tfX pipeline, we have established guiding water principles that restrict the use of freshwater resources in areas with elevated levels of water stress, instead prioritising the use of alternative sources.

The challenge is to translate this commitment into concrete action. How do we deliver a rapid build-out of renewable energy that leaves no one behind?\n\n## Delivering a just transition\n\nTo succeed with our renewable energy ambitions, we must drive a build-out that works for people. A build-out that is just. This means going beyond ensuring that workers from declining industries are brought into the green economy. It demands that we respect fundamental human and labour rights, promote a diverse and inclusive sector, take active part in developing skills and talent, and support thriving communities where we construct and operate assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more than ten years, we have built experience on what a just build-out can bring.

As we globalise our business, and our projects impact more and more people, we are keen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto build on this experience and define the actions necessary for us to keep contributing to a just transition.\n\n## We are strengthening our social sustainability programmes\n\nIn 2022, we defined six social sustainability programmes that are essential for delivering a just transition, see table to the right. Some were already familiar to us. Thus, we have built solid practices regarding e.g. safety for years. For others, however, we recognise that we have more work to do. Over the next two years, we will strengthen each programme with longterm targets and detailed roadmaps. Here, we outline how we will work with two of the prioritised areas. To read more about each programme, see our sustainability report pages 26-34.\n\n## Respecting human rights wherever we operate\n\nIn 2022, we published our 'Global human rights policy', which outlines our commitment and approach to respect human rights standards in everything we do. At the core of the approach is the integration of human rights due diligence in all key business processes. A first step was to perform a corporate human rights impact assessment, which identified \u00d8rsted's salient human rights impacts and gaps in our existing human rights management system. The findings will inform our continuous efforts to strengthen our human rights due diligence approach.\n\n## Being a trusted partner to our local communities\n\nWe recognise that we have a responsibility to bring economic opportunities to the communities where we operate, and that thriving and supportive communities are critical for a successful build-out. Therefore, in 2022, we began expanding our local communities programme to make sure we have a robust impact management system in place to shape\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Social programmes                               | Objective                                                                                                                    |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Thriving communities                            | Deliver socio-economic benefits to our local  communities in a fair and inclusive way                                        |\n| Skills and talent for the  green transformation | Develop talent inside and outside our company  to be the future leaders of the green transition                              |\n| Human rights   management and  integration      | Ensure that human rights are respected in   our operations, supply chains, and local  communities                            |\n| Responsible sourcing   of minerals and metals   | Ensure that our minerals and metals are  sourced in a socially responsible way                                               |\n| Diverse and inclusive  energy sector            | Improve diversity, equity, and inclusion   in our own company and help our suppliers   do the same                           |\n| Safe and better   ways of working               | Maintain our strong safety performance and  foster a working environment that enables our  employees to live fulfilled lives |\n\nand implement initiatives.

As part of Sunrise Wind in New York, we have committed to recruit and train workers from marginalised communities. And, at the Port of Taichung in Taiwan, we have inaugurated the largest local operations and maintenance (O&M) facility in Asia in terms of offshore service capacity, supporting the development of local jobs and supply chains.\n\nGoing forward, we will define a community impact approach, further strengthen our cross-market knowledge sharing, start integrating social impact assessments into early project planning, and track impact data to evaluate initiatives.",

This will further unleash the potential from having everyone in \u00d8rsted pulling in the same direction towards our ambitions.\n\nMoreover, the reporting and regulatory space is rapidly developing. Sustainability is migrating from the sidelines and into the heart of company reporting. We need to ensure a strong organisation, fit for the future, with still more distinct and complex sustainability reporting requirements and regulation.\n\n## Embedding sustainability into our operating model\n\nTo continuously embed sustainability throughout our operating model, we have defined three strategic pillars: i) decisionmaking & accountability, which focus on using sustainability criteria as one of the key decision drivers in relevant parts of our asset project model, ii) competences & governance, which focus on ensuring that we have the right sustainability competences at the right places in our organisation, and iii) culture & leadership, which focus on building behaviour, mindsets, and awareness that are driven by sustainability improvements.\n\nDuring recent years, we have taken steps to systematically integrate sustainability across our operating model, for\n\nexample through our responsible business partner, conduct, and tax practice programmes.\n\nFollowing the changes in our short-term incentive (STI) scheme for the leadership team in 2022, we have adjusted our STI scheme for all participant employees, effective from 2023. The new STI supports a stronger link to our 2030 sustainability aspirations. We will assess leadership performance through a combination of group level KPIs and by inspiring individual goals. This approach to set individual sustainability-linked goals will be expanded to all eligible \u00d8rsted employees in 2023. Read more in the sustainability report, page 38.\n\nWe also built sustainability considerations further into Offshore and P2X. From 2022, all our new Offshore operations and maintenance (O&M) facilities will have a LEED certification, improving the buildings' environmental and social aspects. In our P2X market development activities, we developed an ESG risk assessment framework that supports systematic screening for decision-making on new market opportunities. To guide us going forward, we have defined a roadmap towards 2025 with activities spanning across the three pillars.\n\n## A transparent, credible, and future-fit organisation\n\nWe have increased our engagement with investors through calls and dialogues on our sustainability performance and next steps. It has been an enriching experience to dive further into expectations from a key stakeholder group.\n\nWe continued advocacy efforts in our industry and beyond, including efforts to deliver credible climate action. At the UN COP27, we called for giving up business as usual and giving way to a build-out of renewables that create value through positive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nimpacts on biodiversity and local communities. We also took part in the formal launch of the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA) where we will continue to play an active role in advising governments and share best practice on how to speed up the deployment of offshore wind power to more countries across the world. We have endorsed the Corporate Knights' Action Declaration on Climate Policy Engagement to close the say-do gap on countries' emissions reductions, working with policy-makers and industry associations to Paris-align climate policy activities.\n\nFinally, in 2022, we continued to align with EU taxonomy KPIs to show that we not only have activities that contribute mitigating the effects of climate change, but also performing them in a way that respects nature and people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We endorse and align with existing and upcoming regulation\n\nWe are at a pivotal moment in the reporting sphere, which is rapidly expanding. We fully welcome this development, which will significantly improve data accuracy and transparency and place ESG reporting on a par with financial. We endorse and align our practices to relevant regulatory requirements and standards and welcome the upcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) from the EU. Across our various reports, we show the risks and opportunities climate change can have on our business (TCFD), our greenhouse gas emissions (GHG Protocol), the extent to which our business activities are defined as sustainable according to the EU taxonomy, and how we are advancing in respect of the /one.tf/seven.tf UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nWe will continue our pro-active participation in various phases of the regulatory process, engaging with peers, industry groups, and regulators to help shape the legislation.",

        "page_content": "## The markets where we operate\n\nWe operate across multiple adjacent markets that all have substantial growth potential in the coming years and offer attractive opportunities for us to expand our market presence.\n\nGiven recent geopolitical developments and the actions and targets set by governments to limit global climate change, we expect that the transformation of the global energy system will accelerate in the years to come. This will bring us significant growth opportunities across all our business areas.\n\nIn the past year, Russia's propensity to use energy for geopolitical leverage has underscored how dependence on fossil fuels cannot deliver the security of supply Europe needs. As a result of Russia's decision to limit gas flows to Europe, many countries have decided to continue to use or reinstate fossil energy sources that negatively affect our climate. The solutions to the objectives of reducing our energy dependence and mitigating climate change are the same: replace fossil fuels with renewables,  directly and indirectly electrify energy use, and use energy as efficiently as possible.\n\nTo decarbonise the global energy system and to increase our energy independence, a large-scale renewable buildout is needed. We believe this build-out will be based on increasingly larger renewable energy projects, which will require a significant scale-up of the transmission infrastructure, both onshore and offshore. To support the significant build-out of offshore wind, we expect to see new types of\n\ncross-national renewable hybrid transmission infrastructures and energy islands, which will be linked to several markets. Such new types of transmission infrastructure will enable significant cost savings and a more efficient use of the energy produced by balancing intermittent electricity generation with demand across two or more markets.\n\nIn addition to widespread green electrification, an important driver of global decarbonisation will be P2X. Renewable hydrogen will become the main decarbonisation vector for heavy industry, long distance transportation, and other hard-to-electrify sectors such as steel, refineries, and chemicals. When renewable hydrogen is processed further into e-fuels, it is expected to be the key instrument in decarbonising heavy transport, such as deep-sea shipping and aviation. The scale-up of P2X is expected to spark the development of entirely new industries and value chains, with companies from various offtake sectors engaging in strategic partnerships with renewable energy developers. This trend, too, will generate significant market opportunities for us, both in the P2X value chains and in the associated required build-out of renewable energy.\n\nBy 2050, it is expected that nearly 90 % of global electricity generation will come from renewables, with almost 70 % from wind and solar PV alone (IEA).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Mainland China GW\n\n- Europe US APAC Rest of the world\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Renewable H /two.tf & green fuels\n\nInstalled electrolyser capacity GW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis will require a smart and highly digitalised energy system that can integrate and balance multiple renewable generation sources as well as P2X and energy storage solutions. Digital technologies will play a critical role in optimising energy production to meet real-time needs across offtake segments.\n\nThe future customer landscape is also expected to change. Companies are increasingly setting ambitious decarbonisation targets, seeking green solutions directly from energy providers and becoming key drivers of green energy demand alongside governments. An increased corporate demand is contributing to the development of multi-product renewable solutions, combining corporate purchasing of green electrons from a variety of technologies with more sophisticated storage solutions to enable different offtake profiles. In addition, strategically advanced shipping companies such as A.P. Moller - Maersk are leading the development of P2X assets, acting ahead of anticipated EU decarbonisation obligations, to execute direct long-term offtake agreements for e-methanol, which is accelerating the P2X build-out.\n\n## Substantial market growth\n\nThe global renewable energy market is forecast to grow exponentially towards 2030. This is partly due to the rising political momentum behind the green energy transition, which is resulting in ambitious new renewable energy buildout plans around the world.\n\n\u2190\n\nSource: BNEF New Energy Outlook /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf for Onshore, Solar PV and Batteries; BNEF Offshore Wind Market Outlook H/two.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf for Offshore; H/two.tf Council; EU; IRENA; BNEF Global Hydrogen Strategy Tracker /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf.\n\nSome of our core markets are at the forefront of this development, with multiple countries and regions announcing considerably accelerated ambitions. In addition, renewables have become more cost-efficient compared to fossil energy sources, and renewables can play a key role in securing energy supply.\n\nThe global renewables capacity (offshore wind, onshore wind, solar PV, and energy storage), excluding Mainland China, is expected to increase by a combined average growth rate (CAGR) of 15 % to around 4,000 GW in 2030. Offshore wind is expected to show the fastest growth (23 % CAGR), partly driven by significant build-out of offshore wind in the US and APAC, though Europe will remain the largest region by far.\n\nOnshore renewables (wind, solar PV, and energy storage) are more established and have the highest installed capacity. Within onshore renewables, forecasts show a CAGR of approx. 15 % towards 2030. Again, this is driven particularly by the US and APAC, but Europe is expected to maintain its position as the biggest onshore region.\n\nGlobal targets for P2X now exceed 70 GW of installed electrolyser capacity by 2030. Delivering on these will require a very significant global ramp-up from developers, offtakers, and the supply chain since installed electrolyser capacity globally at present is less than 500 MW. The development of infrastructure investment, in particular pipelines, will be an essential element for facilitating this expansion, particularly for transporting renewable hydrogen within Europe. These are in planning stages and expected to be constructed in the second half of the decade.\n\n## The growing role of multi-technology projects\n\nWith governments around the world raising their ambitions and targets for renewable energy build-out, there is an ever-growing need for integrating multiple renewable energy technologies.",

However, we also see a role for multi-technology energy hubs in various other forms, with the potential to combine (among others) wind energy, solar PV, P2X, carbon capture, and energy storage.\n\n\u00d8rsted is positioned ideally to develop multi-technology projects and cater for the growing customer demand.\n\nOur capabilities and experience span offshore wind, onshore wind, solar PV, energy storage, P2X, and combined heat and power plants. On top of this, our existing assets (both operational and under development) provide a strong position from which to integrate additional renewable energy technologies. With our recent reorganisation, structuring our business areas into a regionally organised set-up, we are even better placed to integrate our work across technologies. A multi-technology platform will help us optimise energy systems, drive cost reductions, and realise portfolio synergies.\n\n## Main industry challenges to solve in the coming years\n\nAlthough we expect a significant build-out of renewable energy in the coming years, the renewables industry is presently facing several challenges. With rising inflation and interest rates and with global supply chain challenges (such as bottlenecks and scarcity of green materials), increased pressure is placed on developers and manufacturers alike.\n\nAs offshore wind has been commoditised and has become cost-competitive to fossil energy sources, governments are now moving away from competition on lowest required subsidy and towards competition on either 1) pure concession payment or 2) a combination of concession payment and other value elements (sustainability, local content, ability to deliver, etc.). Competition based only on the highest concession payment incentivises developers to narrowly focus on how to drive further aggressive cost reductions of the offshore wind technology. This puts additional pressure on the supply chain and leaves no room to invest in project-specific solutions that otherwise could have created a positive impact on biodiversity, advanced social sustainability, and stimulated innovation and system integration.\n\nIn 2022, some regulators proposed energy price caps or windfall taxes to protect business and consumers against increasing energy bills. In the EU, a price cap of EUR 180 per MWh was proposed, and the UK implemented a 45 % windfall tax on power utility profits above GBP 75 per MWh from January 2023.\n\nIn our 'Need for speed' white paper published in April 2022, we outlined the urgency of speeding up regulatory processes and tenders to meet the ambitious decarbonisation and renewable build-out targets set by governments around the world. We believe this is crucial to ensuring sufficient renewable energy build-out to secure Europe's energy supply and help keep the global temperature increase below 1.5 \u00b0C by 2100.\n\n## Increasing political momentum\n\nGovernments are raising renewable energy ambitions\n\nPolicies & legislation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| New targets & initiatives in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf                                                                  | To be achieved by                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| REPowerEU /four.tf/five.tf % renewable energy                                                                               | /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/zero.tf |\n| Increased renewables investments                                                                                            |                                  |\n| Esbjerg declaration (North Sea)                                                                                             |                                  |\n| /six.tf/five.tf GW installed offshore wind capacity                                                                         | /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/zero.tf |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf GW renewable hydrogen production capacity                                                                   | /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/zero.tf |\n| /one.tf/five.tf/zero.tf GW installed offshore wind capacity                                                                 | /two.tf/zero.tf/five.tf/zero.tf  |\n| Marienborg declaration (Baltic Sea)                                                                                         | /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/zero.tf |\n| /one.tf/nine.tf./six.tf GW installed offshore wind capacity Pursuing faster permitting processes                            |                                  |\n| Inflation Reduction Act Tax credits to incentivise investment in renewable  energy, P/two.tfX, and energy storage in the US |                                  |\n| OFW capacity build-out target /two.tf/zero.tf GW installed offshore wind capacity                                           | /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/five.tf |\n| /three.tf/zero.tf GW installed offshore wind capacity                                                                       | /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/zero.tf |\n| OFW capacity build-out target                                                                                               |                                  |",

We were awarded a new project in Europe, corresponding to a fifth of the total awarded offshore capacity in 2022 (excluding seabed lease auctions), took final investment decision (FID) on a development project in the US, commissioned the world's largest operational offshore wind farm, and advanced the construction of our other projects, including generation of first power from Greater Changhua 1 & 2a. We also successfully farmed down two of our projects in accordance with our farmdown strategy.\n\nWe remain the world leader in offshore wind, having developed around a third of the global capacity installed, excluding Mainland China. We have played a key role in maturing the industry and have built more offshore wind farms worldwide than any other company. By the end of 2022, we had 8.9 GW of capacity installed, 2.2 GW of capacity under construction, and further 11.2 GW of capacity awarded resulting in a firm capacity of 22.2 GW. This aligns with our annual build-out targets to reach 30 GW installed capacity by 2030.\n\n- /two.tf Refers to early-stage projects which we are actively pursuing through tenders.\n- /three.tf Refers to the combination of capacity installed or under construction which we have contracted or have been awarded.\n\nThe additional 7.8 GW needed will be based on our substantiated pipeline of around 16 GW and our opportunity pipeline of around 57 GW. The oversized opportunity pipeline provides us with the flexibility we need to select only projects that are truly value-creating.\n\n## Strategic progress and expansion of our portfolio\n\nDuring 2022, we commissioned our Hornsea 2 project in the UK, now being the largest operational offshore wind farm in the world, and we were awarded the Hornsea 3 project, with an expected commissioning in 2027, if FID'ed. If Hornsea 3 is built, the Hornsea zone, including Hornsea 1, 2, and 3, will have a total capacity of more than 5 GW, making it the world's largest offshore wind zone and providing power to approx. five million homes in the UK.\n\nIn Denmark, we formed a new partnership with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners to develop up to 5.2 GW of offshore wind across four projects. The partnership aims to accelerate the green transformation, create value in the offshore wind industry, and create a Danish business and export stronghold within P2X.\n\nIn the Americas, we took FID on our 130 MW US project South Fork Wind, which is part of the Northeast Programme with a total contracted capacity of 1.8 GW. The project has started offshore construction and is expected to be operational in 2023. In our Ocean Wind 1 project, we continued to mature the project boundary conditions and secured key supply chain contracts. The Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management (BOEM) published the project draft environmental impact statement in June 2022, a major milestone in the federal permitting process. In January 2023, we signed an agreement to purchase PSEG's 25 % equity stake in the project. The transaction is expected to close in H1 2023.\n\n## Offshore wind build-out plan\n\nGross renewable capacity\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additionally, we expect FID on Greater Changhua 2b & 4 (0.9 GW) in Taiwan during 2023, with expected commissioning in 2025.\n\n## Farm-downs to free up capital for future projects\n\nFarm-down agreements continue to be strategically important for \u00d8rsted as an essential part of our efforts to raise capital for accelerating new renewable energy projects across our markets. During 2022, we completed the divestments of two major assets. The agreement to farm down 50 % of the 0.9 GW Borkum Riffgrund 3 project in Germany to Glenmont Partners, one of Europe's largest fund managers exclusively investing in clean energy infrastructure, was completed in February. The farm-down of Hornsea 2 in the UK was completed in September, following the commissioning of the 1.3 GW wind farm. The 50 % divestment to a consortium comprising AXA IM Alts and Credit Agricole Assurances was one of the largest renewable energy M&A transactions ever. Both transactions secured a NPV retention of around 100 %.\n\n## Further expansion into floating offshore wind\n\nFloating offshore wind is a rapidly maturing technology with an enormous potential for expanding offshore wind generation in existing markets and deploying offshore wind in new geographies. We are partnering with the offshore project developer Simply Blue Group and Subsea 7 on the 100 MW floating project Salamander in Scotland. The project will be developed in a joint venture, with \u00d8rsted owning 80 %, and is located off the east coast of Scotland.\n\nWe have also signed an agreement that sets up a partnership with Repsol, a global multi-energy company, to explore the joint development of floating offshore wind in Spain. The agreement marks our next step into floating offshore wind. Due to the country's deep waters, this will allow Spain to unlock the potential of its extensive coastline and transform Spain into a European floating offshore wind hub. With \u00d8rsted's three decades of experience in global offshore wind and Repsol's insights into the local market conditions, we are strongly positioned to support Spain's continued energy transition.\n\n## Growing our usage of e-methanol\n\nAs part of our continued efforts to decarbonise, we signed a ten-year lease in 2022 for the world's first green fuel vessel for offshore operations. Esvagt, a market leader in service and support for offshore wind, will deliver the service operation vessel (SOV), which will be powered by batteries and dual-fuel engines, capable of sailing on e-methanol produced from wind energy and biogenic carbon, which will lead to an annual carbon emissions reduction of approx. 4,500 tonnes.",

We took a major step to expand our geographic footprint through the acquisition of Ostwind in Europe and strengthened our market positions in the Americas and in Europe by commissioning assets under construction and taking FIDs. In total, we added 825 MW of capacity to our operating portfolio by commissioning three projects and acquiring a German and French platform and an operational wind farm in the US.\n\nBy the end of 2022, we had 4.2 GW of capacity installed and 2.1 GW of capacity under construction. To reach our ambition of 17.5 GW installed onshore capacity by 2030, we will need to add an additional 11.2 GW to our firm capacity of 6.3 GW. The additional capacity will be based on our substantiated pipeline of around 12.6 GW and other opportunities that may arise.\n\nStrategic progress and expansion of our onshore portfolio In the US, we commissioned Haystack in Nebraska (298 MW wind), and the wind phase of Helena Energy Center in Texas (268 MW wind). Both projects qualify for 100 % of the production tax credit. Most of the production from Haystack is contracted under long-term power purchase agreements with Pepsi, Hormel, and Target, while the wind phase of Helena Energy Center is contracted with Henkel.\n\n- /two.tf Refers to the combination of capacity installed or under construction which we have contracted or have been awarded.\n\nThe contracts for both projects have upside sharing structures on the power price. These structures reduce downside risks and allows for the capture of additional revenue compared to traditional PPAs.\n\nIn addition to commissioning our own assets, we finalised the acquisition of Ford Ridge, a 121 MW operational wind farm in Illinois. This is our second project in the Midcontinental Independent System Operator (MISO) area, which is an attractive market and one of the largest in the US. The project is eligible for 100 % of production tax credits, and its production is contracted under long-term PPAs with Mars and its suppliers.\n\nWe took FID on three US projects. The first, Sunflower, is a 201 MW wind project in Kansas, which we acquired as an early-stage development project together with Lincoln Land in 2021. The project was matured and significantly advanced towards final investment decision in April 2022. The project is eligible for 100 % of the production tax credit and is on track to reach commercial operation before the end of 2023. The second, Mockingbird, is a 471 MW AC solar PV project in Texas, which we expect will be the first solar project in our portfolio to qualify for 100 % of the production tax credit, as this scheme was recently expanded by the US Inflation Reduction Act to include solar PV projects. The third, Eleven Mile, is a combined solar PV (300 MW AC ) and storage (300 MW) project in Arizona. Both Mockingbird and Eleven Mile are expected to reach commercial operation before the end of 2024.\n\nIn addition, we are constructing Old 300 and the solar phase of Helena Energy Center. Both are US projects and have been subject to delays due to the Uyghur Forced\n\n## Onshore wind build-out plan\n\nGross renewable capacity\n\n<!-- image -->",

During 2022, however, we installed around 78 % of project capacity at Old 300 with modules already cleared and delivered to the site. The remaining modules are expected to be delivered during 2023, and we expect full commercial operation before the end of 2023. For the solar phase of Helena Energy Center, we are also planning for commercial operation before the end of 2023.\n\nWe expanded our footprint across Europe, entering multiple new markets. In September, we closed the acquisition of Ostwind and added 152 MW wind and solar capacity in operation and under construction and 526 MW of advanced development projects to our portfolio. The acquisition marked our entry into the German and French onshore markets. In 2022, we took FID on three German and French wind farms with a total capacity of 68 MW. Following \u00d8rsted's acquisition of Ostwind, Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations, a co-investor in parts of Ostwind's operating portfolio in France, decided to exercise an option to acquire Ostwind's shares (totalling 87 MW) of the projects that Ostwind and Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations co-owned.\n\nDuring 2022, we commissioned Kennoxhead 1, a 62 MW wind farm in Scotland, the UK. In Spain, we entered into four partnerships to pursue early-stage solar and onshore wind projects.\n\n## Farm-downs to free up capital for future projects\n\nIn October, we closed a transaction with ECP to divest 50 % of our ownership interest in a US project portfolio consisting of Plum Creek, Willow Creek, Lincoln Land, and Muscle Shoals. The four projects all have tax equity partners, who will remain partners following the divestment. The farm-down is a first for the Onshore business and entailed a NPV retention of around 100 %. We expect to continue to leverage farm-downs to help raise capital to fund new value-creating growth.\n\n## Growing our corporate customer portfolio\n\nDuring 2022, we announced offtake contracts with seven companies globally. The majority of the PPAs signed in the US was for projects we either commissioned during the year or are planning to bring online during 2023.\n\nAt the end of 2022, a significant part of the energy generation from our asset portfolio of onshore wind and solar projects across the US and Europe, including the UK, were contracted with external counterparties with an average duration of 12 years. The contracted share for most individual projects ranges from 65 % to 100 % and is dependent on the market, project risk profile, attractiveness of the contract terms, and the risk-reduction potential.\n\nMost of our PPA counterparts are strategic customers whose businesses span geographies and technologies. In this sense, our diverse Onshore asset platform is commercially attractive and positions us as a trusted partner for companies seeking to offtake green energy solutions.",

They are the most promising routes to decarbonise hard-to-electrify sectors, such as heavy road transport, deep-sea shipping, aviation, and the chemical industry. We have ambitious plans for accelerating development of renewable hydrogen production and e-fuels, and we made noteworthy progress across several projects during 2022.\n\nStrategic progress and expansion of our P/two.tfX portfolio In December, we took FID on the FlagshipONE project, a late-stage development project in Northern Sweden. We expect to commission it in 2025. The facility comprises a 70 MW electrolyser and is expected to deliver 50,000 tonnes of e-methanol from the renewable hydrogen synthesised with biogenic carbon derived from the host CHP plant. Once completed in 2025, this is expected to be the largest e-methanol facility in Europe and will catalyse the decarbonisation of the maritime sector.\n\nDuring the past year, we expanded our P2X geographical footprint to the US by agreeing on a landmark fuel supply concept with A.P. Moller - Maersk to deliver 300,000 tonnes of e-methanol to supply Maersk's newly ordered e-methanol vessels. The facility will comprise a 675 MW electrolyser located on the US Gulf Coast, powered by approx. 1.2 GW of dedicated renewable energy from onshore wind and solar PV.\n\nOur 'Green Fuels for Denmark' project reached an important milestone in 2022, as it was identified as an 'Important Project of Common European Interest' (IPCEI). IPCEI projects contribute to sustainable economic growth, job creation, and the competitiveness of the EU economy and are key enablers\n\nfor maturing the European and global P2X industry to being a genuine alternative to imported fossil fuels. The Danish government has subsequently awarded DKK 600 million in funding towards realising the first phases of 'Green Fuels for Denmark', developing electrolysis capacities of 10 MW, 100 MW, and 300 MW, respectively. Once it is fully developed, the project aims to reach a total installed electrolyser capacity of 1.3 GW for producing green fuels for shipping, aviation, and heavy road transport.\n\nAnother valuable step in 2022 for our 'Green Fuels for Denmark' project was that we signed a letter of intent with the Danish district heating transmission companies. The agreement is to utilise surplus heat from carbon capture and P2X at Aved\u00f8re Power Station for district heating purposes. Aved\u00f8re Power Station has been designated to capture and deliver part of the carbon for the first phases of 'Green Fuels for Denmark'. In addition, the power station is also expected to supply carbon for storage and serve as a hub for other actors with carbon emissions in the Greater Copenhagen area.\n\nWe continue to work closely with Green Hydrogen Systems, the electrolyser supplier, on their rectification of equipment shortcomings to finalise the execution phase of our 2 MW H2RES pilot project at Aved\u00f8re Power Station funded by the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP). The ongoing delay to first hydrogen, expected in H2 2023, is an important reminder that although the P2X industry has a lot of potential, there are also significant challenges in scaling up equipment manufacturing and maturing the suppliers to meet society's demands. Given our experience in doing this within offshore wind, we consider that this plays to our strengths, and we are extracting valuable learnings from this early project.\n\nLastly, we have continued to mature the rest of our portfolio of P2X projects. Notably, our Haddock Project in the Netherlands has been selected as one of the recipients of funding in the Dutch government's IPCEI tender, and Lingen Green Hydrogen Project in Germany has been shortlisted as an IPCEI project.\n\nOur hydrogen test facility at Aved\u00f8re Power Station, Copenhagen, Denmark.",

Our combined heat and power (CHP) plants not only filled the gap in production from renewable generation, but also benefitted from high power prices and attractive spreads.\n\nIn October, the Danish authorities ordered us to continue operation of Esbjerg Power Station beyond Q1 2023 and to resume operations of a coal-fuelled unit at the Studstrup Power Station and an oil-fuelled unit at Kyndby to ensure the security of electricity supply in Denmark. The order applies until 30 June 2024.\n\nTo help secure the Danish gas supply for the 2022/2023 winter period, we took all possible measures to inject gas into Danish gas storages under our capacity contracts during the summer period. We also entered into a gas agreement with Equinor under which Equinor will supply 8 TWh of Norwegian gas to Denmark via Baltic Pipe from 1 January 2023 until April 2024, covering the period when the Tyra field is not supplying gas to Denmark. The agreement strengthens the security of supply in Denmark and will be supplementing our purchase of biogas and gas from the South Arne field. Together, these offtake agreements will more than cover the consumption of our Danish and Swedish B2B customers.\n\nGazprom Export suspended its deliveries under the sourcing contract from 1 June 2022. The contract with Gazprom Export has subsequently been terminated pursuant to the provisions in the contract due to long-term force majeure on the part of Gazprom Export.\n\nWe initiated a process for identifying the right owner of our Renescience business, including our waste treatment facility in Northwich in the UK. The Renescience technology has great potential to help solve the increasing global waste challenge, and \u00d8rsted has been a successful incubator for the technology.

We aim to mitigate our risks and reduce them to an acceptable level through risk management.\n\nThe purpose of our risk management is to identify and quantify our risks and decide how best to manage and mitigate them. We assess the extent to which individual risks are acceptable or perhaps even desirable as well as the extent to which these risks can be reduced to ensure an optimum balance between risk and return. Besides business risks (incl. financial risks), we are exposed to risks in connection with legal compliance, climate change, ESG, and sustainability, both at a strategic and operational level.\n\nA large part of our earnings is generated from offshore wind, with the UK and Continental Europe being the key contributors. However, with our expansions into the US and Asia Pacific and into onshore wind, solar PV, and P2X, our future earnings continue to be spread across more geographical regions and technologies. Therefore, political and other macroeconomic factors play an important role in our risk management. When we invest in new assets and activities or divest assets, the consolidated risks associated with our portfolio change. Therefore, we assess the impact of a given decision on the portfolio upfront.\n\nWe work systematically with risks. All business segments, regions, and selected staff functions identify and prioritise business risks. An assessment is made of the potential financial impact of individual risks, and whether they are\n\nof a short-term (0-2 years), a medium-term (2-5 years), a longterm (5+ years), or a recurring nature. All our risks are then consolidated and evaluated at Group level. The ultimate responsibility for all individual risks rests with a member of the Group Executive Team.\n\nThe top six business risks identified are shown to the right where they are illustrated based on their potential impact (post-risk mitigation) on our value and credit metrics over the next years. You can read more about these risks on the following pages.\n\nWe have similar processes in place for identifying and prioritising risks related to ESG, sustainability, and legal compliance. However, as these are assessed using different parameters, we do not show them in a consolidated picture together with the business risks. A description of the most significant ESG and sustainability risks can be found in our sustainability report.\n\n\u2192\n\nQuantification of risks is based on a scenario where the risk occurs with /one.tf/zero.tf % probability (P/nine.tf/zero.tf). Our Internal Audit function has examined the process for identifying and measuring the accompanying portfolio risks.\n\n## Top 6 business risks\n\nEffect on our value and credit metric\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| /five.tf   | /two.tf /one.tf /three.tf   |\n|------------|-----------------------------|\n|            | /four.tf                    |\n| Low        | High                        |\n\n- /one.tf (#/one.tf in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf) Financial markets risks\n\n/two.tf\n\n(#/four.tf\n\nin  /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf)\n\nPower prices and energy markets\n\n- /three.tf (#/three.tf in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf) Cost inflation and supply chains\n- /four.tf (new in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf) Regulatory intervention\n- /five.tf (#/two.tf in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf) Competition\n- /six.tf (#/six.tf in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf) Cybersecurity\n\nImpact on v al ue",

        "page_content": "In addition to our ordinary business risks, we are exposed to risks which have a very small probability of occurring, but which could potentially impact our finances and/or reputation substantially. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\n- -  fatal injuries\n- -   strong hurricanes, typhoons, hailstorms, arctic blasts, or earthquakes, especially in Taiwan, which may lead to the partial loss of offshore and onshore wind farms, solar PV farms, and storage assets\n- -   broken pipes at the Nybro Gas Treatment Plant in Denmark, which may lead to personal injury and damage to the environment\n- -   breakdowns at power stations that may lead to personal injury and partial loss of assets.\n\nAfter risk-reducing measures are implemented, the Group Executive Team assesses whether the level of each risk is appropriate, or if it is higher than the desired level. If the risk level is still too high, further risk reducing measures are initiated to the extent possible.\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\nClimate change presents financial risk to the global economy. To mitigate the impacts of climate change, it is important to understand the risks (both physically and transitional) and opportunities presented by rising temperatures, climate-related policies, and emerging technologies in our changing world.\n\nAs climate-related risks and opportunities are directly linked to our green vision and strategy, we address them as an integral part of our daily business, and we report on them as recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Read more about our climaterelated risks on page 41.\n\nDuring the year, we have assessed whether our taxonomyeligible activities are taxonomy-aligned by determining if they: 1) contribute substantially to climate change mitigation, 2) do no significant harm to the other environmental objectives, and 3) comply with the minimum safeguards. Our assessment showed that all our eligible activities were aligned.\n\n## Development in risks during /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf\n\nWe have introduced 'Regulatory intervention' as a new top 6 risk in 2022 and have seen changes in the relative importance of our top risks from last year.\n\n'Financial markets risks' (previously 'Inflation and interest rates' and 'Currency risks') remain our number 1 risk. During the year, we have seen a substantial increase in inflation and interest rates across the regions where we operate as well as volatility in the foreign exchange markets.\n\n'Power prices and energy markets' (previously 'Currencies and energy prices') have been moved up as our second largest risk in 2022. The recent surge in energy prices have led to an increase in this risk assessment. As a response to the unintended impacts from hedges, we have established and are in the process of implementing a new risk management framework to reduce the volatility from financial instruments and bring back the inherent predictability of earnings that our contracted and regulated activities possess.\n\n'Cost inflation and supply chains' remain our third largest risk in 2022. The still increasing cost inflation and, to some extent, COVID-19-related delays remain in the market.\n\n'Regulatory intervention' is placed as our fourth largest risk. With the increasing power prices throughout Europe, the\n\ngoverning bodies have started to implement price caps or windfall taxes to help businesses and consumers with their increasing power bills. This could have an adverse impact on our revenue from power generating activities if implemented without consideration of fixed-price contracts and hedged volumes.\n\n'Competition' remains in our top six risks, but has dropped down to our fifth largest risk, mainly because the other risks have increased in magnitude.\n\n'Cybersecurity' remains our sixth largest risk. The geopolitical development over the past year has shown that cyberattacks remain a threat to our operations. It is of the utmost importance that we protect our infrastructure and systems from malicious attacks.\n\n## COVID-/one.tf/nine.tf\n\nDuring the year, we have seen some adverse impacts of the pandemic, mainly related to our supply chain. While COVID-19-related lockdowns among our suppliers had some adverse impact on the construction timeline for some of our projects, we expect these delays to only result in a limited overall impact on the project economics.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Financial markets risks\n\n## Description\n\nOur financial markets risks are related to volatility in the macroeconomic environments where we operate. Changes to inflation rates, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates all have an impact on the value of our assets.\n\nTo a certain extent, our medium- to long-term earnings can be expected to follow the development in consumer and market prices, thereby protecting the real value of our assets and equity. This is the case for earnings related to our UK wind farms. However, we are exposed to inflation risk on projects with fixed nominal cash flows, as an increase in inflation will erode the expected real value of the revenue.\n\nOur largest currency exposure stems from offshore wind farms in the UK, but activities in the US and Taiwan have increased our exposure to USD and NTD significantly.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFluctuations in interest rates, inflation, and foreign exchange rates may adversely impact our earnings and the value of our assets.\n\nBased on our GBP exposure after hedges, a /one.tf/zero.tf % decrease in the GBP/DKK exchange rate will result in a loss of DKK /one.tf./four.tf billion over the period /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf, all else remaining unchanged.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nOur inflation and interest rate exposures are managed by matching assets and liabilities in the same currency and with similar payment structures.\n\nOur currency exposure is managed by actively hedging within the first five years.\n\nRead more about inflation and interest rate risks in note /six.tf./four.tf and currency risks in note /six.tf./two.tf.\n\n## 2. Power prices and energy  markets\n\n## Description\n\nPower price risks primarily originate from the sale of our renewable power generation in the UK, the US, and north-western Europe. Our CHP plants entail a spread risk due to the difference between the prices of the power generated and the fuel consumed.\n\nFurthermore, we are exposed to second-order risks arising from power price hedges not fully matching our actual revenue exposure (ie. position, intermittency, and regulatory risks). We are also exposed to liquidity risks, as we are required to post collateral at exchanges if our positions are 'out of the money'.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFluctuations in energy prices and energy policies can have an adverse effect on our earnings and/ or liquidity.\n\nDuring /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, we saw negative effects from volumerelated overhedging of DKK /three.tf./eight.tf billion due to lower generation combined with soaring energy prices. There is a risk that we could see the same effects in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf if our power generation falls short of the hedged volumes, and the energy prices increases.\n\nBased on our power price exposure after hedges, a /one.tf/zero.tf % decrease in the power price will result in a loss of DKK /four.tf./zero.tf billion over the period /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf, all else remaining unchanged for our offshore and onshore assets.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nTo keep cash flows stable, we have historically hedged energy prices for up to five years.\n\nBased on a review of our hedging needs and learnings over the recent /one.tf/eight.tf months of unintended impacts of high hedge levels together with significant changes in market prices and volatility, we have adjusted our hedging policy to encompass a shorter hedging horizon and lower hedge levels.\n\nRead more about energy price risks and our new hedging framework in notes /six.tf./one.tf and /six.tf./three.tf.\n\n## 3. Cost inflation and supply chains\n\nDescription\n\nAs a global renewable energy developer, we are exposed to risks related to cost inflation, supply chain bottlenecks, performance of new suppliers, and suppliers' financial positions, including from derived consequences of COVID-/one.tf/nine.tf.\n\nAmong other things, we are exposed to highly volatile prices, which are influenced by high global demand with widespread application in various sectors. As the industry grows with continuous new technological developments, we are exposed to potential bottlenecks in parts of the supply chain if there is only a limited number of suppliers capable of meeting the future demands. Therefore, it is important that new suppliers enter and stay in the market. We are also exposed to counterparty risks if one of our suppliers should default or deliver unsatisfactory products.\n\nFurthermore, we are exposed to import restrictions and price increases related to trade restrictions.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nDisruptions in the supply chain or sudden inflation in key materials could result in project delays and budget overruns.\n\nAn example of a supply chain bottleneck is the limited number of vessels with sufficient lifting capacity due to the increase in wind turbine and foundation size. These technical limitations coupled with an increased demand for offshore wind have increased the market price for installation vessels with up to /seven.tf/five.tf %.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nTo combat cost inflation, we have implemented a hedging programme for steel and other commodities, which will be rolled out to our asset projects. Furthermore, we enter into volume agreements and source wind turbines from key suppliers in a timely manner to reduce uncertainty.\n\nOur process for vetting new suppliers is thorough, and we have strict credit risk policies in place to manage credit and counterparty risks.\n\n## 4. Regulatory intervention\n\n## Description\n\nFollowing the recent spike in European energy prices, regulators have introduced energy price caps and windfall taxes to alleviate the financial burden of higher energy prices for businesses and consumers. A new regulation, still subject to national implementation, is one of the regulatory initiatives being issued. It will be aimed at temporarily capping revenues for electricity producers - notably wind, solar PV, and nuclear.\n\nHence, in the EU, a revenue cap of EUR /one.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf/MWh will initially be in place from /one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf until /three.tf/zero.tf June /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf. Important for \u00d8rsted, the revenue cap regulation should reflect actual revenue by taking hedges and other risk mitigation measures properly into account. We are in constructive dialogue about this with governments in the markets where we operate.\n\nIn the UK, regulators have announced the 'Electricity Generator Levy', which entails a /four.tf/five.tf % additional levy on revenue above GBP /seven.tf/five.tf/MWh, effective from /one.tf January /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf to /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/eight.tf. Furthermore, in Ireland, a EUR /one.tf/two.tf/zero.tf/MWh cap was implemented on /one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nAfter hedges, fixed-price contracts, and the guaranteed German subsidy levels have been considered in the final regulation, the potential impact on \u00d8rsted is significantly reduced. However, given the complexity associated with hedging strategies, including in which countries and legal entities these activities are performed, there is a risk that national implementation of any such regulation is counterproductive. Hence, an effect on revenue from our UK ROC wind farms, our offshore assets in Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark, and our onshore assets in Ireland may occur. Our Danish multi-fuelled combined heat and power plants will to a large extent be exempted from the cap.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe are in constructive dialogue with governments in the markets where we operate.",

        "page_content": "## 5.  Competition\n\n## Description\n\nGlobal renewable energy markets are expected to grow rapidly over the next decade in all the technological areas where we are present. Key drivers for this growth are ambitious government policies and targets, the push from corporates for the green transition, and significant cost reductions.\n\nCompetition in the renewable energy industry is intensifying, driven by the increasing market opportunities. New players are entering the market, not least the oil majors, who are increasingly setting high targets for their build-out of renewable energy.\n\nLately, we have seen some of the consequences of the new competitive landscape. Many auctions, tenders, and lease rounds have been awarded to bidders at extreme prices (i.e. Japan's first fixedbottom offshore wind auction, the New York Bight seabed lease sale, and the Crown Estate's UK seabed leasing round /four.tf).\n\n## Potential impact\n\nThese extreme awarded prices propose a risk for the entire renewable build-out where it will not be possible to sustain a healthy and sustainable renewable global business.\n\nIn addition, there is a risk that we will not win the targeted capacity in the auctions and tenders in which we participate.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nTo ensure our competitive edge, we will continue to utilise portfolio-scale advantages and knowhow gained from previously executed projects to develop supply chain solutions and reduce costs and risks.\n\nOver the last years, we have established a dedicated P/two.tfX business and entered into key strategic partnerships in new markets to ensure our competitiveness.\n\n## 6.  Cybersecurity\n\n## Description\n\nThe cybersecurity risks are a product of individuals, groups, and nations actively working to harm and profit off of \u00d8rsted. As a green energy major, we are exposed to several different cyberattack threats: ransomware attacks, data exfiltration attacks, cyber-physical impact attacks, and more. Our adversaries' capacities and capabilities are constantly improving, and we must strive to stay ahead.\n\nFurthermore, the energy crisis and ongoing war in Ukraine have resulted in an increased cyber threat from a geopolitical context where Russian hackers have been known to target energy grids and assets.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nMinor digital risk events, such as viruses and attempted break-ins, are everyday risks without significant impact. However, major cyberattacks or events may impact all or part of our assets or, in the event of a ransomware attack, have an impact on our financial position.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe face different types of cyber risks. Some are related to our assets and some to our systems. Thus, we mitigate cyber risks with several different initiatives, which are continuously assessed and prioritised based on our strategic cybersecurity risk assessment with the aim of lowering our risk exposure.\n\nAt our operating assets, we have deployed production cyber defences to enhance protection against onsite and offsite attacks. In addition, we have a top-level 'Information and cybersecurity policy' supported by our global governance model, we have regular trainings, and we participate in fora on information and knowledge sharing.\n\nThis way, our cyber capability is continuously improved in order to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover across the enterprise and production sites.\n\n## Legal compliance\n\n## Description\n\nRisks associated with legal compliance are assessed based on financial and reputational significance and probability. Our most significant risks are /one.tf) tax law, /two.tf) financial regulation, and /three.tf) offshore grid code compliance. (/one.tf) We operate in tax regimes with different tax rules and rates, and our tax affairs span over corporate tax compliance, transfer pricing, and indirect taxes. (/two.tf) We are subject to several financial regulations, such as REMIT, MAR, EMIR, Dodd Frank, MiFID, SFTR, and AML/one.tf. The financial regulations are relevant for a large part of our activities. (/three.tf) In every country where we operate, we have to meet certain grid code requirements set by the transmission system operator (TSO) to be allowed to generate and supply electricity to the grid.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFailure to comply with the above-mentioned rules and regulations may result in severe legal sanctions, such as imprisonment, fines, and damage claims, but also in possible disconnection from the grid or loss of generation license.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n(/one.tf) We have implemented a comprehensive tax control framework and mandatory compliance, including transfer pricing documentation, in line with the OECD recommendations and local requirements. This has been prepared on a contemporary basis to mitigate our tax risks. (/two.tf) We have implemented comprehensive policies, procedures, training, and controls for relevant parts of our business to ensure compliance with financial regulations. (/three.tf) We have implemented grid code governance to provide clear responsibility, and we have a 'compliance critical systems' project underway to help our sites identify what systems are critical and ensure suitable measures for reliability.\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\n## Description\n\nChanges in the world's climate constitute both a risk and an opportunity for us. In October, the International Energy Agency (IEA) launched their World Energy Outlook report, which supports the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) conclusion that it is unequivocal that human activity causes global warming, and that we are on course to reach the critical point of /one.tf./five.tf \u00b0C of warming already in the early /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/zero.tfs. IEA now puts us on a path towards /one.tf./seven.tf \u00b0C.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFailure to adhere to the /one.tf./five.tf \u00b0C limit may cause severe changes in the worlds' climate and make catastrophic events more severe and frequent. This could not only have an adverse effect on our planet, but on our operating assets as well.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations set out by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we seek to exploit climate-related opportunities and be a part of the solution through development and generation of renewable energy.\n\nAt the same time, we seek to reduce the risks related to climate change by encouraging regulators and public authorities to set ambitious renewable energy targets, improving the competitiveness of green technologies, assessing acute and chronic weather development, and taking extreme weather conditions and events into account when designing and building our assets.\n\nFurthermore, we take climate-related risks and opportunities into account when we prepare business cases for investment in new assets or activities. By doing this, we seek to avoid ending up with stranded assets or assets and activities with a significantly lower value than originally expected.",

We also saw higher balancing costs and BSUoS/ TNUoS tariffs than expected. Further delays in the installation process and with the commissioning of turbines at Greater Changhua 1 & 2a resulted in lower ramp-up generation and lower partnership earnings. This was partly offset by a lower-than-expected DEVEX and positive effects from reversal of provisions incl. CPS issues.\n\nEarnings in Onshore ended up significantly higher due to higher achieved prices in both the US and Europe. Furthermore, the acquisitions of Ostwind and Ford Ridge contributed positively.\n\nEarnings from our CHP plants increased due to the higher power prices. As we only hedge the power we cogenerate with heat, we benefitted from the high prices on our condensing power generation.\n\nIn 'Gas Markets & Infrastructure', we achieved higher earnings from our gas storage activities and release of a provision related to the close-down of our B2B business in the UK.\n\n## Q/four.tf EBITDA\n\nNeither the development in nor the composition of our earnings mix were as expected in our 9M report.\n\nIn Offshore, we had to recognise a negative effect from ineffectiveness related to inflation-indexed contracts with partners, a reduction in the value of intermittency hedges (part of volume-ineffective hedges), and we saw higher balancing costs. In addition, the delays at Greater Changhua 1 & 2a had a negative impact.\n\nIn Bioenergy & Other, we realised significantly higher-than-expected earnings from our gas storage activities and released a provision related to our B2B business.

        "page_content": "## Results\n\n## Financial results\n\n## Revenue\n\nPower generation from offshore and onshore assets increased by 34 % and totalled 29.6 TWh in 2022. The increase was due to ramp-up of generation from Hornsea 2, Western Trail, Haystack, Lincoln Land, Old 300, the wind part of Helena Energy Center, the acquisition of Ford Ridge, the full-year effects from I&UK assets acquired during 2021, and higher wind speeds, partly offset by the 50 % farm-down of Borssele 1 & 2 in May 2021.\n\nHeat generation amounted to 6.4 TWh, 19 % lower than last year, mainly due to warmer weather. Thermal power generation decreased by 13 % and amounted to 6.0 TWh.\n\nLower CHP generation (warmer weather) was partly offset by higher condensing power generation.\n\nOur renewable share of generation was 91 % in 2022, 1 percentage point higher than last year, driven by a higher share of generation from offshore and onshore renewables, partly offset by higher CHP generation on coal due to scarcity of sustainable biomass and as we had to switch to coal at Studstrup 3.\n\nRevenue amounted to DKK 132.3 billion. The increase of 70 % relative to 2021 was primarily due to the significantly higher power prices across all markets.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nOperating profit (EBITDA) totalled DKK 32.1 billion, of which the gain from the 50 % farm-downs of Hornsea 2 and Borkum  Riffgrund 3 amounted to DKK 9.4 billion and DKK 1.6 billion, respectively. Thus, EBITDA excluding new partnerships amounted to DKK 21.1 billion, an increase of DKK 5.3 billion compared to last year.\n\nEarnings from Offshore sites amounted to DKK 9.9 billion, a decrease of DKK 3.1 billion compared to last year.\n\n'Wind impact' was positive with DKK 1.7 billion due to higher wind speeds than last year (DKK -0.2 billion versus a normal wind year).\n\nImpact from 'hedges' was negative with DKK 3.7 billion in 2022 compared to last year (2022 was negatively impacted by DKK 5.6 billion, whereas 2021 was negatively impacted by DKK 1.9 billion). This was due to ineffectiveness related to inflation-based contracts with partners\n\n## Financial results\n\n| DKKm                                     | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf                     | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf                | %                                  |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Revenue                                  | /one.tf/three.tf/two.tf,/two.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf | /seven.tf/seven.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/three.tf | /seven.tf/zero.tf %                |\n| EBITDA                                   | /three.tf/two.tf,/zero.tf/five.tf/seven.tf        | /two.tf/four.tf,/two.tf/nine.tf/six.tf       | /three.tf/two.tf %                 |\n| New partnerships                         | /one.tf/zero.tf,/nine.tf/nine.tf/three.tf         | /eight.tf,/five.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf          | /two.tf/nine.tf %                  |\n| EBITDA excl. new partnerships            | /two.tf/one.tf,/zero.tf/six.tf/four.tf            | /one.tf/five.tf,/seven.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf   | /three.tf/three.tf %               |\n| Depreciation and amortisation            | (/nine.tf,/seven.tf/five.tf/four.tf)              | (/seven.tf,/nine.tf/seven.tf/two.tf)         | /two.tf/two.tf %                   |\n| Impairment                               | (/two.tf,/five.tf/two.tf/nine.tf)                 | (/one.tf/two.tf/nine.tf)                     | /one.tf,/eight.tf/six.tf/zero.tf % |\n| Operating profit (loss) (EBIT)           | /one.tf/nine.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/four.tf        | /one.tf/six.tf,/one.tf/nine.tf/five.tf       | /two.tf/two.tf %                   |\n| Gain (loss) on divestment of enterprises | /three.tf/three.tf/one.tf                         | (/seven.tf/four.tf/two.tf)                   | n.a.                               |\n| Financial items, net                     | (/two.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/six.tf)                | (/two.tf,/one.tf/six.tf/six.tf)              | /one.tf/seven.tf %                 |\n| Profit before tax                        | /one.tf/seven.tf,/six.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf          | /one.tf/three.tf,/two.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf   | /three.tf/three.tf %               |\n| Tax on profit (loss) for the year        | (/two.tf,/six.tf/one.tf/three.tf)                 | (/two.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf)          | /nine.tf %                         |\n| Tax rate                                 | /one.tf/five.tf %                                 | /one.tf/eight.tf %                           | (/three.tf %p)                     |\n| Profit (loss) for the year               | /one.tf/four.tf,/nine.tf/nine.tf/six.tf           | /one.tf/zero.tf,/eight.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf  | /three.tf/eight.tf %               |\n\nEBITDA excluding new partnerships DKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was partly offset by ramp-up of generation at Hornsea 2, higher achieved prices from one-sided German CfD sites, and from value-creating market trading activities.\n\nEBITDA from partnerships amounted to DKK 12.3 billion and was mainly related to the DKK 9.4 billion and DKK 1.6 billion gains from the 50 % farm-downs of Hornsea 2 and Borkum Riffgrund 3 (new partnerships), respectively. Earnings from existing partnerships amounted to DKK 1.3 billion compared to a loss of DKK 1.0 billion in 2021. In 2022, we had positive earnings from finalised projects and construction work for partners at Greater Changhua 1. In addition, we reversed DKK 0.5 billion of the DKK 0.8 billion warranty provision towards our partners we recognised in 2021 related to cable protection system issues at some of our offshore wind farms.\n\nEBITDA in Onshore increased by DKK 2.3 billion to DKK 3.6 billion, driven by ramp-up of generation and higher achieved prices across the portfolio.\n\nEBITDA from our CHP plants amounted to DKK 5.9 billion, an increase of DKK 2.6 billion compared to last year. The increase was mainly due to higher power prices. As we initially only hedge the power we cogenerate with heat, we have been able to benefit from the high power prices on our condensing power generation.\n\nEBITDA from our gas business contributed with earnings of DKK 3.1 billion in 2022, DKK 1.3 billion higher than last year, with some offsetting effects. We saw a positive effect from optimising our north-western European gas activities, where we were able to lock in gains from the offtake flexibility in some of our sourcing contracts and at gas storages. In addition, we had a positive effect from our B2B activities in the UK, where we released part of the provision for closing down the business. In contrast, our decision during the spring to unwind gas hedges related to the Gazprom Export contract to balance our risk, if gas supplies from Russia were ceased, led to a net loss on the  Gazprom Export sourcing contract in the first half of the year. Furthermore, 2021 was positively impacted by renegotiation of gas purchase contracts and earnings from optimising purchase via our long-term gas contracts.\n\n## Impairment\n\nImpairment losses amounted to DKK 2.5 billion in 2022 and was related to our Sunrise\n\nWind project in the US, driven by supply chain bottlenecks, cost inflation, and higher costs of capital.\n\n## EBIT\n\nEBIT increased by DKK 3.6 billion to DKK 19.8 billion in 2022. The higher EBITDA was partly offset by impairment losses and higher depreciation from more assets in operation.\n\n## Financial income and expenses\n\nNet financial income and expenses amounted to DKK -2.5 billion compared to DKK -2.2 billion in 2021. The higher net expenses were mainly due to higher interest expenses and capital losses on the bond portfolio (net of related interest rate swaps) due to increasing interest rates and higher agreed returns on tax equity contributions due to more onshore assets in operation, only partly offset by positive exchange rate adjustments.\n\n## Tax and tax rate\n\nTax on profit for the period amounted to DKK 2.6 billion, DKK 0.2 higher than 2021. The effective tax rate was 15 % and was impacted by the tax-exempt gains of DKK 10.9 billion from the 50 % farm-downs of Hornsea 2 and Borkum Riffgrund 3, the recognition of deferred taxes related to tax equity contributions in the US, and by prior year adjustments.\n\n## Profit for the year\n\nProfit for the year totalled DKK 15.0 billion, DKK 4.1 billion higher than in 2021. The increase was mainly due to the higher EBIT.",

DKK 2.0 billion of the outflow in 2022 related to power hedges in Offshore, and DKK 8.4 billion related to gas hedges in Bioenergy & Other.\n- -   The initial margin payments were a cash inflow of DKK 3.5 billion vs a cash outflow of DKK 7.3 billion in 2021.\n- -   During the second quarter, we issued parent company guarantees in total of EUR 1 billion, which reduced our initial margin payments.\n\nThe negative impact from variation margin payments included in 'Change in derivatives' was partly offset by the reversal of unrealised market trading results and ineffective hedges.\n\nIn 2022, we had a net cash inflow from work in progress of DKK 4.3 billion, mainly from the farm-down of 50 % of the offshore transmission asset at Hornsea 2 and milestone payments received at Borkum Riffgrund 3,\n\npartly offset by construction work at Greater Changhua 1. In 2021, we had a net cash inflow of DKK 4.5 billion, mainly from the divestment of the Hornsea 1 offshore transmission asset and milestone payments received at Greater Changhua 1, only partly offset by construction work regarding the offshore transmission asset at Hornsea 2.\n\nIn 2022, cash inflows from tax equity contributions were more than offset by tax equity reversals, whereas we had a large inflow of tax equity contributions in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the positive effect in 'Change in other working capital' from lower initial margins was partly offset by higher fuel inventories and lower payables.\n\n## Investments and divestments\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 37.4 billion in 2022. The main investments were:\n\n- -   offshore wind farms (DKK 26.7 billion), including Greater Changhua 1 & 2a in Taiwan, Hornsea 2 in the UK, and our portfolio of US and German projects\n- -   onshore wind and solar PV farms (DKK 10.4 billion), including the acquisitions of Ostwind and Ford Ridge as well as the construction of Old 300, Sunflower Wind, Helena Energy Center, Eleven Mile, and our portfolio of European projects.\n\nDivestments amounted to DKK 25.6 billion in 2022 and were mainly related to the 50 % farm-downs of Hornsea 2 and Borkum Riffgrund 3 with proceeds (NIBD impact) of

In 2021, divestments amounted to DKK 21.5 billion and were mainly related to the 50 % farm-downs of Borssele 1 & 2 and Greater Changhua 1. In addition, we completed the divestment of a portfolio of four onshore projects in 2022, with no impact on EBITDA, divestments cash flow, or NIBD.\n\n## Interest-bearing net debt\n\nInterest-bearing net debt totalled DKK 30.6 billion at the end of December 2022 against DKK 24.3 billion at the end of 2021. The increase was mainly due to dividend payments of DKK 5.7 billion and higher net lease obligations of DKK 1.6 billion, partly offset by net issuance of hybrid capital in 2022. Free cash flow was positive with DKK 0.1 billion. At the end of 2022, we had posted DKK 14.0 billion as collateral at exchanges.\n\n## Equity and capital employed\n\n## Equity\n\nEquity was DKK 95.5 billion at the end of December 2022 against DKK 85.1 billion at the end of 2021. At the end of 2022, the posttax hedging and currency translation reserve amounted to a loss of DKK 26.5 billion. The reserve will be matched by higher future revenue from the underlying activities when the contracts fall into delivery. Approx. 30 % of the reserve will materialise before 31 December 2023.\n\n## Capital employed\n\nCapital employed was DKK 126.1 billion\n\nat the end of December 2022 against DKK 109.4 billion at the end of 2021, mainly due to new investments.\n\n## Financial ratios\n\n## Return on capital employed (ROCE)\n\nReturn on capital employed (ROCE) was 16.8 % in 2022. The increase of 2.0  percentage points compared to last year was attributable to a higher EBIT.\n\n## Credit metric (FFO/adjusted net debt)\n\nThe funds from operations (FFO)/adjusted net debt credit metric was 42.7 % in 2022 against 26.3 % last year. The increase was mainly due to higher FFO.\n\nDuring the year, we updated the definition of our FFO/adjusted net debt ratio. We have excluded variation margin payments in our FFO definition to reflect the changes implemented by the rating agencies. Furthermore, we have excluded 'other interest-bearing debt' and 'other interest-bearing receivables' from our adjusted net debt to align with the common methodology used by the rating agencies. We have restated comparison numbers for 2022 and 2021 accordingly. See note 5.1 for definitions.\n\n## ESG results\n\n## Green share of heat and power generation\n\nThe green share of heat and power generation amounted to 91 % in 2022 compared to 90 % in 2021. The 1 percentage point increase\n\nwas driven by more wind and solar assets in operation and higher wind speeds, partially offset by higher coal-based generation and lower sustainable biomass-based generation.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nOur greenhouse gas emissions from heat and power generation (scope 1 and 2) increased by 17 % compared to 2021 to 2.5 million tonnes CO 2 e due to increased use of coal in our thermal heat and power generation due to scarcity of supply of biomass in the first part of the year and a switch from biomass to coal at Studstrup 3 due to a fire in a wood pellet silo.\n\nGreenhouse gas intensity from our heat and power generation and other operating activities increased to 60 g CO 2 e/kWh in 2022 against 58 g CO 2 e/kWh in 2021. The increase was driven by the increased use of coal in the thermal heat and power generation, partly offset by higher wind and solar generation.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from our supply chain and sales activities (scope 3) decreased by 40 % to 11.0 million tonnes in 2022. This was primarily due to a 48 % decrease in gas sales and a 10 % reduction in emissions from commissioning of renewable assets.\n\n## Safety\n\nIn 2022, we had 78 total recordable injuries (TRIs), of which 52 injuries were related to contractors' employees. This was an increase of 4 injuries compared to last year. The number of hours worked was 24.8 million hours, same as in 2021. The total recordable injury rate (TRIR) increased from 3.0 in 2021 to 3.1 in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned KPIs\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned share of revenue was /seven.tf/three.tf %, EBITDA was /eight.tf/five.tf %, gross investments was /nine.tf/nine.tf %, and OPEX was /eight.tf/zero.tf % in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf. The non-eligible part of our revenue primarily concerned our long-term legacy activities related to sourcing and sale of gas (/one.tf/six.tf % of revenue in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf), coal-based generation, and non-eligible power sales. We expect the share of taxonomy-aligned revenue to increase in the coming years.\n\nRead more about our EU taxonomyaligned KPIs in notes /two.tf./one.tf-/two.tf./five.tf in the ESG performance report for /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf.\n\nSee our full EU taxonomy reporting in our ESG performance report: orsted.com/ESGperformance/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf.",

In Q4 2021, we completed the 50 % farm-down of Greater Changhua 1 with a gain of DKK 3.2 billion. Adjusted for new partnerships, EBITDA increased by DKK 1.6 billion compared to the same period in 2021.\n\nEarnings from offshore sites were DKK 0.2 billion lower than the same period last year and amounted to DKK 3.7 billion.\n\n'Wind impact' was positive with DKK 0.2 billion due to higher wind speeds than last year.\n\nImpact from 'Hedges' was negative with DKK 0.7 billion in Q4 2022 compared to Q4 2021 (Q4 2022 was negatively impacted by DKK 1.7 billion, whereas Q4 2021 was negatively impacted by DKK 1.0 billion). This was due to ineffectiveness related to inflation-indexed contracts with partners (DKK 0.7 billion) and negative effects from volume-related overhedging due to a reduction in the value of intermittency hedges, only partly offset by lower underlying overhedging Q-Q (DKK 0.3 billion). This was partly offset by a net positive change in IFRS 9-related ineffective hedges (DKK 0.3 billion).\n\nEarnings from 'Sites, other' increased by DKK 0.2 billion, mainly due to ramp-up generation at Hornsea 2 and gains from value-creating market trading activities, partly offset by negative effects from high ROC recycle settlements in Q4 2021 not repeated in 2022, high prices and volatility (higher balancing costs), and from expanding our portfolio (higher OPEX, and BSUoS tariffs).\n\nEarnings from existing partnerships were DKK 0.1 billion lower than the same period last year and amounted to DKK -0.8 billion. Due to further delay with commissioning of the turbines at Greater Changhua 1, total costs for the project have increased and consequently reduced earnings under the construction agreement.\n\nEBITDA from our Onshore business increased by DKK 0.3 billion to DKK 0.9 billion, driven by ramp-up of generation and higher achieved prices across the portfolio.\n\nEBITDA from our CHP plants stayed at the same level as Q4 2021 and amounted to DKK 1.7 billion.\n\nEarnings from our gas business were DKK 2.1 billion, a DKK 1.3 billion increase compared to the same period last year, mainly driven by a positive effect from our\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| DKKm                           | Q/four.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf    | Q/four.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | %                           |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Revenue                        | /three.tf/five.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf | /three.tf/zero.tf,/six.tf/six.tf/six.tf   | /one.tf/six.tf %            |\n| EBITDA                         | /six.tf,/six.tf/nine.tf/six.tf             | /eight.tf,/two.tf/five.tf/three.tf        | (/one.tf/nine.tf %)         |\n| New partnerships               | /seven.tf/seven.tf                         | /three.tf,/two.tf/one.tf/one.tf           | (/nine.tf/eight.tf %)       |\n| EBITDA excl. new partnerships  | /six.tf,/six.tf/one.tf/nine.tf             | /five.tf,/zero.tf/four.tf/two.tf          | /three.tf/one.tf %          |\n| Impairment loss                | (/two.tf,/five.tf/two.tf/nine.tf)          | (/one.tf/two.tf/nine.tf)                  | n.a.                        |\n| Operating profit (loss) (EBIT) | /one.tf,/three.tf/seven.tf/five.tf         | /five.tf,/nine.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf        | (/seven.tf/seven.tf %)      |\n| Profit (loss) before tax       | /four.tf/six.tf/zero.tf                    | /four.tf,/three.tf/six.tf/one.tf          | (/eight.tf/nine.tf %)       |\n| Tax                            | (/seven.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf)               | (/one.tf,/one.tf/zero.tf/three.tf)        | (/two.tf/eight.tf %)        |\n| Tax rate                       | /one.tf/seven.tf/two.tf %                  | /two.tf/five.tf %                         | /one.tf/four.tf/seven.tf %p |\n| Profit (loss) for the period   | (/three.tf/two.tf/nine.tf)                 | /three.tf,/two.tf/five.tf/eight.tf        | n.a.                        |\n\n## EBITDA excluding new partnerships\n\nDKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->",

Supply chain bottlenecks, cost inflation, and higher costs of capital led to an impairment.\n\n## Profit for the period\n\nProfit for the period totalled DKK -0.3 billion, DKK 3.6 billion lower than Q4 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the gain from the 50 % farm-down of Greater Changhua 1 in Q4 2021 and from the impairment loss in Q4 2022.\n\nCash flows from operating activities Cash flows from operating activities totalled DKK 20.9 billion in Q4 2022 compared to DKK 0.7 billion in Q4 2021.

In Q4 2021, we had a net cash inflow of DKK 1.3 billion, mainly due to milestone payments at Greater Changhua 1.\n\n## Investments and divestments\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 9.8 billion in Q4 2021 and related to the construction of offshore and onshore assets. Divestments amounted to DKK 1.0 billion and mainly related to payments from our 25 % partner in Ocean Wind 1.",

The increase was due to ramp-up at Hornsea 2 and slightly higher wind speeds.\n\nWind speeds amounted to a portfolio average of 10.7 m/s, which was higher than in Q4 2021 (10.6 m/s), but below the normal wind speeds expected in the fourth quarter (11.0 m/s).\n\nAvailability ended at 95 %, in line with the same period last year.\n\nRevenue increased by 28 % to DKK 24.9 billion.\n\nRevenue from offshore wind farms in operation increased by 80 % to DKK 10.8 billion, mainly driven by higher generation and higher PPA revenue following our 50 % farm-down of Hornsea 2. The Hornsea 2 PPA will run until CfD start.\n\nRevenue from power sales increased by 7 % to DKK 13.2 billion due to an increase in power sales, partly offset by lower power prices.\n\nEBITDA decreased by DKK 3.2 billion and amounted to DKK 2.1 billion.\n\nEBITDA from 'Sites, O&M, and PPAs' amounted to DKK 3.7 billion in Q4 2022. Despite a positive impact from ramp-up of generation at Hornsea 2, value-creating market trading\n\nactivities, net-positive changes in IFRS 9- related ineffective hedges (DKK 0.3 billion), and higher wind speeds than last year (DKK 0.2 billion), earnings decreased by DKK 0.2 billion. This was primarily due to ineffectiveness related to inflation-indexed contracts with partners (DKK 0.7 billion) and negative effects from volume-related overhedging due to a reduction in the value of intermittency hedges, only partly offset by lower underlying overhedging Q-Q (DKK 0.3 billion). Furthermore, we saw negative effects from high ROC recycle settlements in Q4 2021 not repeated in 2022, from generally high prices and volatility (balancing costs), and from expanding our portfolio (higher OPEX, BSUoS, and TNUoS tariffs).\n\nEBITDA from partnerships amounted to DKK -0.7 billion in Q4 2022 and mainly related to the construction of Greater Changhua 1. Due to further delay with commissioning of the turbines, total costs for the project have increased and consequently reduced earnings under the construction agreement. In Q4 2021, EBITDA from partnerships mostly related to the 50 % farm-down of Greater Changhua 1 with a gain of DKK 3.6 billion.\n\nEBITDA from other activities, including project development, amounted to DKK -0.9 billion, DKK 0.3 billion less than in Q4 2021, and was mainly related to lower expensed project development costs.\n\n| Results                                      | Q/four.tf

The increase was due to the  commissioning of Haystack, Ford Ridge, the wind part of Helena Energy Center, and ramp-up of generation at Old 300. In Q4 2022, the wind speeds across the portfolio were 7.7 m/s, which were higher than last year (7.5 m/s for the entire portfolio) and 1 % higher than a normal wind year.\n\nAvailability for wind farms was lower during the quarter due to minor technical issues, mainly at Willow Springs.\n\nRevenue was up by DKK 0.3 billion compared to Q4 2021 and amounted to DKK 0.7 billion. The increase was mainly due to increased power generation as a result of the newly commissioned assets and higher achieved prices across the portfolio.\n\nIn the US, we benefitted from the higher power prices during the ramp-up phases of assets under construction, where PPAs do not start until COD. Furthermore, some of our PPAs have upside share structures that allow for capture of additional revenue in periods of high pricing compared to traditional PPAs.\n\nEBITDA for Q4 2022 amounted to DKK 0.9 billion, DKK 0.3 billion higher than in the same period last year. The increase was due to higher generation and higher prices across the portfolio. This was partly offset by higher fixed costs due to the expansion of the business and project development.\n\n| Results                                     | Q/four.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf

Power generation decreased by 33 %, mainly due to lower CHP generation and less attractive spreads for condensing power generation.\n\nGas sales and power sales decreased by 71 % and 56 %, respectively, due to no volumes being delivered under the Gazprom Export sourcing contract and a gradual phase-out of our remaining B2B activities in the UK.\n\nRevenue decreased by 23 % compared to Q4 2021 and amounted to DKK 10.3 billion. The decrease was driven by significantly lower gas and power sales, partly offset by higher prices.\n\nEBITDA amounted to DKK 3.6 billion compared to DKK 2.4 billion in Q4 2021.\n\nEBITDA from 'CHP plants' was in line with Q4 2021. The decrease in generation and lower spreads was offset by a positive adjustment on ineffective hedges (DKK 0.2 billion).\n\nEBITDA from 'Gas Markets & Infrastructure' increased by DKK 1.3 billion relative to the same period last year, amounting to DKK 2.1 billion in Q4 2022. The increase was mainly driven by a positive effect from our gas storage activities and release of a provision related to the close-down of our B2B business in the UK. This was partly offset by lower volumes sold in 2022 and strong earnings from optimising purchase from our long-term gas contracts in 2021.\n\n| Results                             | Q/four.tf

        "page_content": "## Message from the Chair\n\nWe continued strengthening our corporate governance model for the next step in \u00d8rsted's growth journey.\n\nIn the Board, we firmly believe that corporate governance is fundamental for \u00d8rsted's growth journey towards becoming the world's leading green energy major. In 2022, the Board continued to strengthen the corporate governance model, which is based on three pillars: enabling the right decisionmaking, having the right competences in the right places, and fostering a company culture of inclusiveness and integrity. These pillars are the foundation for our ways of working across the organisation.\n\nAs part of our commitment to continuously improve our ways of working, the Board completed its evaluation with the support from an external advisor in 2022. This evaluation highlighted development areas, which we consolidated into two primary projects going forward: revisiting our approach to the split of mandates between the Board and leadership team and strengthening our processes for talent management and retention.\n\n## Strengthening decision-making across our footprint\n\nIn 2022, we implemented a new organisational structure with three regions: the Americas, Europe, and APAC,  complemented by global capabilities. Our aim is to strengthen simpler and faster decision-making, to secure customer and market centricity, and to realise synergies between our onshore and offshore businesses. The Board is confident that this new structure will assist \u00d8rsted in seizing unprecedented market opportunities while meeting customer demands for integrated energy solutions.\n\nWe formed a new executive leadership team, the Group Executive Team (GET), which reflects the new organisational set-up and consequently includes the Americas, Europe, and APAC regions, P2X, Legal, and Global Stakeholder Relations. The Board welcomed new senior executives, who bring varied skills and experiences to the team.\n\nIn early 2023, we will implement new delegated authorities across the organisation to scale our governance model for future growth while supporting simpler and faster decision-making.\n\n## Securing the right competences\n\nWe want to ensure the right competences to successfully drive our business forward. To further improve talent management and retention, we have introduced a recurring 'People' update on the agenda for each ordinary meeting, an annual update on GET member successors with opportunities for the Board to meet talents, and a process for better involvement of all Board members in recruitment to the Board.\n\nWe welcomed the four employee-elected Board members, who won the elections early in 2022 for employees based in Denmark. The election process had a high level of engagement and a diverse representation of nationalities, backgrounds, ages, and genders. Following approval at our annual general meeting in 2022, the 2024 election will be open to all employees across our footprint. This will further solidify our global presence and bring perspectives from all locations where we are present.\n\n## Fostering a culture of inclusiveness and integrity\n\nDiversity was among the key criteria when filling the leadership positions of the new \u00d8rsted organisation. This resulted in a more diverse leadership composition in terms of nationality, ethnicity, background, age, and gender. We recognise that we need to move our diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) efforts further and farther, and this will continue to be a priority area for the Board.\n\nWe believe that all Board members should be role models for integrity. We do so by being open and trustworthy while upholding high ethical standards. In the Board, we will continue to promote a good culture, purpose, and sound values through our meetings and offsite activities.\n\n## Efforts for the future\n\nWe welcome and follow the recommendations prepared by the Danish Committee on Corporate Governance.\n\nOn the following pages, you can read more about our corporate governance and our continued efforts to strengthen \u00d8rsted's governance procedures and culture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThomas Thune Andersen Chair",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\nThe overall and strategic management of the company is anchored in a board of non-executive directors appointed by the shareholders.\n\nThe Board of Directors appoints the Executive Board, consisting of the Group President and CEO, the CFO, and the Chief HR Officer (CHRO), who undertake the day-to-day management of \u00d8rsted through the Group Executive Team. None of our executives are members of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Shareholders and general meeting\n\n\u00d8rsted is a publicly listed company with the Danish State as majority shareholder with a 50.1 % ownership share. The Danish State exercises its ownership interest in \u00d8rsted in accordance with the ordinary governance set-up in Danish companies, where a board of non-executive directors (the Board of Directors) and executive directors (the Executive Board) are responsible for the management of the company. The Danish State exercises its interest at the general meeting. The Danish State's ownership policy is available here (only in Danish): fm.dk/udgivelser/2015/ april/statens-ejerskabspolitik/.\n\nAll our shareholders may exercise their rights and vote at the general meeting through a one-share-one-vote principle. The general meeting adopts decisions, such as the election of the Board of Directors and the auditor, in accordance with the ordinary Danish rules. Due to our majority ownership by the Danish State, we have a bespoke quorum requirement, as proposals to amend\n\nour articles of association or dissolve the company require that the Danish State participates in the general meeting and supports the proposals.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nEach year at the annual general meeting, the shareholders elect six to eight board members. In addition, our employees may elect members corresponding to half of the board members elected by the general meeting pursuant to Danish mandatory rules. Employee elections are ordinarily held every four years, most recently in 2022. As our general meeting after the employee election in 2022 approved to expand our scheme for employee-elected board members to also cover employees outside Denmark, the current election period is only two years to allow for the first international election to be held already in 2024. For the time being, our Board of Directors comprises 12 members, eight members elected by the general meeting and four members elected by the employees.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the overall and strategic management of the company. The Board of Directors lays down the company's strategy and makes decisions concerning major investments and divestments, the capital base, key policies, control and audit matters, risk management, and significant operational issues.\n\nOur governance model\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The evaluation was based on input from board members and executives. It consisted of in-depth personal interviews, a customised online questionnaire, an analysis of how time is spent during board meetings, board composition mapping, and board composition benchmarking.\n\nThe external advisor also observed a board meeting. As part of the evaluation, board members and executives were provided with feedback on their individual performance regarding how they add value to the board. The board evaluation was discussed at a board meeting in June.\n\nThe Board of Directors was evaluated by the external advisor to be a very well-functioning board. The board members are highly professional, knowledgeable, and passionate about the company purpose. They understand their stewardship role and cooperate with the Executive Committee (now Group Executive Team) in an engaged and transparent way. Led by the Chair, the tone is open, respectful, and very encouraging. Meetings are run in a structured way, board members feel they can say what they mean, and the operation of the board meetings and the committees works well. Going forward, the external advisor suggested that the board first and foremost reviews how it spends it time.\n\nWhile the number of investment projects continue to increase, there will be a delicate balance to strike, ensuring investments will continue to be appropriately discussed, while also allocating sufficient time for discussing other key strategic questions.\n\nEach year, the general meeting approves the remuneration for the members of the Board of Directors for the coming year. In the separate remuneration report, you can read more about the remuneration of the Board of Directors. Furthermore, we have considered the recommendations prepared by the Danish Committee on Corporate Governance. As further described in our corporate governance report, we comply with all recommendations except that we, due to lack of shareholder interest in observing general meetings virtually, do not offer this option to our shareholders unless special circumstances require it, like COVID-19 (recommendation 1.2.1).\n\n## ' Led by the Chair, the tone is open, respectful, and very encouraging\n\nSee link to the remuneration report below.

        "page_content": "## Board committees\n\nThe Board of Directors has appointed two committees from among its members: an Audit & Risk Committee and a Nomination & Remuneration Committee, which assist the Board of Directors within selected areas.\n\n## Audit & Risk Committee\n\nDieter Wemmer (Chair), J\u00f8rgen Kildahl, and Peter Korsholm are the members of the Audit & Risk Committee.\n\nThe committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing the financial and ESG reporting process (including key accounting estimates and judgements), liquidity and capital structure development, financial and business-related risks, compliance with statutory and other requirements from public authorities, internal controls, IT security in operational and administrative areas as well as cybersecurity.\n\nMoreover, the committee approves the framework governing the work of the company's external and internal auditors (including limits for non-audit services), evaluates the external auditors' independence and qualifications, and monitors the company's whistle-blower scheme.\n\nIn 2022, the committee reviewed the continued material impact from the volatile energy prices on the risk management procedures and the financial statement, the current and future hedging framework, the financial impact of the acquisition of Ostwind, impairment on our property, plant and equipment, as well as the continued implementation of the EU taxonomy reporting framework. Furthermore, the committee continued to assess the claim made by the Danish Tax Agency requiring further Danish taxation of certain of our British offshore wind farms, and lastly, it reviewed the progress in IT security.\n\nOur Internal Audit function reports to the Audit & Risk Committee and is independent of our administrative management structures. Internal Audit enhances and protects the organisational value by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice, and insight. The focus for Internal Audit is to audit and advise on our core processes, governance, risk management, control processes, and IT security.\n\nThe Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for managing our whistle-blower scheme. Internal Audit receives and handles any reports submitted. Our employees and other associates may report serious offences, such as cases of bribery, fraud, and other inappropriate or illegal conduct, to our whistle-blower scheme or through our management system. In 2022, eight substantiated cases of inappropriate or unlawful behaviour were reported through our whistleblower scheme. Six cases related to Good business conduct policy violations, while one case concerned IT security, and one case concerned the workplace environment. None of the reported cases were critical to our business, nor caused adjustments to our financial results. One case required a police report.\n\nWhistle-blower cases are taken very seriously, and we continuously enhance the awareness of good business conduct through education and awareness campaigns to minimise future similar cases.\n\nYou can read more about the Audit & Risk Committee and the terms of reference for the committee at orsted.com/ audit-risk-committee.\n\n## Nomination & Remuneration Committee\n\nThomas Thune Andersen (Chair), Lene Skole, and Lynda Armstrong are the members of the Nomination & Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe committee assists the Board of Directors in matters regarding the composition, remuneration, and performance of the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Team.\n\nIn 2022, the committee reviewed the remuneration policy for the Board of Directors and the Executive Board and proposed certain updates to the policy, which were approved at our annual general meeting in April 2022. The updates of the remuneration policy include an amendment of the short-term incentive scheme (STI) for the Executive Board by increasing the weight of shared KPIs, including an explicit link to our sustainability ambitions, an extension of the shareholding build-up period in respect of our share-based longterm incentive scheme from three to five years, and a board authorisation to temporarily deviate from the remuneration policy by offering a compensation to new external executives for any former incentive-based remuneration forfeited upon joining \u00d8rsted.\n\nThe committee also discussed the appointments of Daniel Lerup as new CFO, of CHRO Henriette Fenger Ellekrog as new member of the Executive Board, and of a new 'Group Executive Team' replacing the previous 'Executive Committee'.\n\nYou can read more about the Nomination & Remuneration Committee and the terms of reference for the committee at orsted.com/nomination-remuneration-committee.",

We provide a more detailed description of the accounting policies applied in the specific notes. Key accounting estimates and judgements as well as new and  amended IFRS standards and interpretations are discussed in detail later in this note.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act (\u00c5rsregnskabsloven).\n\n## Measurement basis\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis, except for derivatives, gas in non-Danish storage facilities, financial instruments in the trading portfolio, and carbon emission allowances in the trading portfolio, which are measured at market value.\n\nThe accounting policies have been applied consistently in the financial year and for comparative figures.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of \u00d8rsted A/S (the parent company) and subsidiaries controlled by \u00d8rsted A/S. See more in note 7.4 'Company overview'.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared as a consolidation of the  parent company's and the individual subsidiaries' financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nIntra- group income, expenses, shareholdings, balances, and dividends as well as realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nUnrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of our  ownership interest.\n\nEnterprises are accounted for as associates if we hold or have the ability to exercise, directly or indirectly, 20-50 % of the voting rights and do not exercise control. However, we carry out a specific assessment of our ability to exercise influence, including our ability to influence financial and operational decisions and thus our return. Enterprises that satisfy the criteria for joint control\n\nare accounted for as investments in joint ventures, unless the nature of the joint arrangement is considered a joint operation. See our key accounting judgement for 'Consolidation method for partnerships' in the next column.\n\nOur shares in joint operations are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet through recognition of the Group's own assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The proportionate share of realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions between fully consolidated enterprises and joint operations is eliminated.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe financial statements are presented in\n\nmillion Danish kroner (DKKm), unless other-\n\nwise stated.\n\nExchange differences arising between the exchange rate on the transaction date and on the date of payment are recognised in profit (loss) for the year as financial income or expenses.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency defined for each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Receivables,  payables, and other monetary items in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. The difference\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key accounting judgement\n\n## Consolidation method for partnerships\n\nOn establishment of partnerships and in connection with any restructuring of existing partnerships, we assess whether the structure is a joint arrangement under shared control. For joint arrangements, we subsequently assess whether they are joint ventures or joint operations.\n\nIn assessing joint operations, we look at:\n\n- -   the corporate form of the operation\n- -   whether we are only entitled to the net profit (loss) or to income and expenses resulting from the operation.\n\nIn addition, the fact that the parties buy or are  assigned all output, for example the power generated, will lead to the structure being considered a joint operation if we have joint control.",

Balance sheet items are  translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date.\n\nAll exchange differences are recognised in profit (loss) for the year, except for exchange differences arising on:\n\n- -   translation of the opening equity of these entities at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date\n- -    translation of the statements of comprehensive income of these enterprises from 'the average-for-the-month exchange rates' to 'the exchange rates on the balance sheet date'\n- -    translation of balances accounted for as part of the total net investment\n- -   translation of the portion of loans and derivatives that has been entered into to hedge the net investment in an enterprise, and that provides an effective hedge\n\nagainst corresponding foreign exchange gains (losses) on the net investment.\n\nThe above types of exchange differences are recognised in 'Other comprehensive income'. Such exchange rate adjustments are divided between the equity of the parent  company and the equity of the  non-controlling  interests.\n\nOn full or partial divestment of the net investment, the accumulated exchange rate adjustments are recognised as follows:\n\n- -   Disposal resulting in loss of control: The accumulated exchange rate adjustments, including any associated hedges, are recognised in the profit (loss) for the year if a foreign exchange gain (loss) is realised by the selling enterprise. Any foreign exchange gain (loss) is transferred to the item in which the gain (loss) from the disposal is recognised. The part of the foreign currency translation reserve that relates to non- controlling interests is not transferred to profit (loss) for the year.\n- -   Disposal not resulting in loss of control: A proportionate share of the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred from the parent company shareholders' share of equity to the minority shareholders' share of equity.\n\nRepayment of balances that are considered part of the net investment does not constitute a partial disposal of the subsidiary.\n\n## iXBRL reporting\n\nWe are required to file our annual report in the European Single Electronic Format ('ESEF')  using the XHTML format and to tag the consolidated financial statements including notes using Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL). The iXBRL tags comply with the ESEF taxonomy. Where a financial statement line item is not defined in the ESEF taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy has been created.\n\nThe annual report submitted to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority consists of the XHTML document together with certain technical files, all included in a ZIP file named Orsted-2022-12-31-en.zip.\n\nAlternative performance measures We present financial measures in the consolidated financial statements which are not defined according to IFRS. We use these alternative performance measures (APM) as we believe that these financial measures provide valuable information to our stakeholders and management.\n\nThe financial measures should not be considered a replacement for the performance measures as defined under IFRS, but rather as supplementary information.\n\nThe alternative performance measures may not be comparable to similar titled measures presented by other companies, as the definitions and calculations may be different.\n\nThe alternative performance measures most commonly presented in the \u00d8rsted annual report are:\n\n- -    EBITDA and EBITDA excluding new partnerships\n- -    funds from operations (FFO)\n- -  adjusted interest-bearing net debt\n- -    free cash flow (FCF)\n- -ROCE.\n\nOur definitions of the financial measures are included in note 7.3 'Alternative performance measures'.",

None of them required a change in our accounting  policies.\n\nNew standards and interpretations IASB has issued new or amended accounting standards and interpretations that have not yet become effective and have consequently not been implemented in the consolidated financial statements for 2022. \u00d8rsted expects to adopt the accounting standards and interpretations as they become mandatory.\n\nThe new or amended standards or interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe use of reasonable estimates and judgements is an essential part of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nGiven the uncertainties inherent in our business activities, we make a number of estimates and judgements. The estimates and judgements are based on assumptions concerning future developments, which affect our application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, sales, costs, cash flows, hedge reserve, and  related disclosures. Actual amounts may  differ from the amounts estimated and judgements made, as more detailed  information becomes available.\n\nWe regularly reassess these estimates and judgements based on, among other things, historical experience, the current situation\n\nin the financial markets, and a number of other relevant factors, i.e. the updates in the annual estimated production. Changes in  estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate in question is revised.\n\nAccounting estimates, judgements, and assumptions which may entail a risk of material adjustments in subsequent years are listed in the table above.\n\nIn addition, we make judgements when we  apply the accounting policies.\n\nReference is made to the specific notes for further information on the key accounting estimates and judgements as well as the assumptions applied.\n\n- \u2191  Key accounting estimates and judgements and their level of potential impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe impact relates to objectivity and business practice.\n\n- Very objective/market-conforming Objective/partially conforming\n- Partially subjective/partially distinctive\n- Subjective/distinctive for \u00d8rsted",

  long-term contracts with customers to deliver gas, heat, or power.\n\nRevenue for the year increased by 71 % to DKK 132,277 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to the significantly higher power and gas prices across all markets and more assets in operation.\n\nRevenue from construction agreements was DKK 11,640 million. The increase of DKK 5,596 million was mainly related to the divestment of 50 % of the offshore transmission assets at Hornsea 2 in  September and the construction of Greater Changhua 1 for partners.\n\nIncome from government grants  decreased significantly in 2022 due to power prices being above subsidy prices, leading to a lower subsidy per MWh produced.\n\n## Backlog\n\nOrder backlog for the construction of wind farms and offshore transmission assets.\n\n## Order backlog\n\n| DKKm                      | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf      | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf      |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| /three.tf/one.tf December | /five.tf,/nine.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf | /five.tf,/nine.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf |\n| Within one year           | /four.tf/three.tf %                | /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf %          |\n| In more than one year     | /five.tf/seven.tf %                | /zero.tf %                         |\n\nThe transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation.",

We recognise revenue when we transfer control over a product or service to a customer or a partner.\n\nIf a part of the transaction price is variable, i.e. bonus payments, incentive payments for unmissed deadlines, etc., the variable consideration is recognised in revenue when it is highly probable that the revenue will not be reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nWe adjust the transaction price for the time value of money if the payments exceed twelve months.\n\n## Generation of power\n\nGeneration of power is the sale of power produced at our own wind farms, solar farms, and power stations as well as the sale of ancillary services. We recognise revenue as the power is produced, since this is when delivery to the customers occurs.\n\nFees for having CPH plants on standby and/or ready to increase or decrease the generation of power to balance the demand and supply in the system is considered one performance obligation fulfilled over time.\n\nThe consideration for the power is due when the actual power is delivered to the customer.\n\n## Sale of power\n\nRevenue from sale of power sourced from other producers. This includes the sale of power sourced from investor power purchase agreements, third-party balancing contracts, and other sales contracts.\n\nThe sale is recognised when the power is delivered to our customer.\n\nSales contracts for a fixed amount of power at a variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to\n\nthe customer at a variable price, are considered one performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be satisfied over time. For such contracts and for longterm agreements on selling power at a fixed price, we recognise revenue in the amount up to which we have a right to invoice.\n\nThe consideration for the power is due when the actual power is delivered to the customer.\n\n## Revenue from construction of offshore wind farms\n\nRevenue from construction of offshore wind farms includes development and construction. The construction agreements cover the construction phase from design to delivery of an operational asset. The agreement consists of two performance obligations:\n\n- -  Offshore wind farms.\n- -  Offshore transmission assets, if applicable.\n\nThe construction agreements cover our partners' shares of the construction of the wind farm and offshore transmission assets, if applicable. If our contracts include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. Where these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on the expected cost-plus margin.\n\nWe recognise revenue over time, using an input method to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation because the customer gains control of the offshore wind farm during the construction process. The input method reflects the ongoing transfer of control.\n\nThe consideration for the construction of an offshore wind farm consists of a fixed fee and a relatively minor variable fee, depending on when the wind farm can be put into operation. The consideration for an offshore transmission asset is a fixed fee.\n\nAfter signing the construction agreement, we carry out an assessment determining when the wind farm is expected to be completed. We calculate the size of the variable payment on this basis. We only recognise the variable fee when it is highly probable that a subsequent reversal will not take place.\n\nOur partner pays the fixed consideration based on a payment schedule. The payment schedule is determined and based on the expected progress of the construction and transfer of control to the customer.\n\n## Generation and sale of heat and steam\n\nHeat is sold under long-term heat contracts and recognised when the heat is delivered to our customer.\n\nThe heat customer makes a prepayment to finance the majority of our CAPEX associated with the biomass conversion of the CHP plant. The prepayment is recognised as a contract liability, and it is also recognised as revenue in step with the transfer of heat to the customer.\n\nPayment for the sale of heat consists of fixed costs associated with operations and maintenance of a CHP plant, fuel costs for the generation of heat, and a financial return. The consideration is due when delivered.\n\n## Sale of gas\n\nSale of gas is our gas sourced from other producers, and it is recognised when the gas is transferred to our buyer. The transfer of control occurs either when the gas is injected into the distribution system or delivered to the customer.\n\nSales contracts for a fixed amount of gas at a variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to the customer at a variable price, are considered one performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be satisfied over time. For such contracts, we recognise revenue in the amount up to which we have a right to invoice. Some long-term gas sales contracts include\n\nclauses which give the right to renegotiate the fixed sales prices. Expectations for the outcomes of renegotiations are not included in revenue before we know the outcome of the individual renegotiations.\n\nThe consideration for the gas is due when the gas is injected into the distribution system or delivered to the customer.\n\n## Distribution and transmission\n\nFees for distribution and transmission of oil is recognised when the oil is delivered to the buyer, or when the capacity is made available.\n\nRevenue is calculated as the amount to which we are entitled when the service is delivered to the customer, and consideration is payable when invoiced.\n\n## O&M and other services\n\nRevenue from providing services is recognised over time as our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided.\n\nFor fixed-priced contracts, revenue is recognised based on the actual service rendered at the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be rendered. This is determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total labour hours expected.\n\nFixed-price contracts are invoiced on a monthly basis, and consideration is payable when invoiced. Variable fee services are due after the services are rendered.",

We treat the subsidies as a government grant, as it is paid by the Danish state.\n\nIn the UK, we receive subsidies under two schemes:  contracts for difference (CfD) and the Renewable Obligation scheme (renew able obligation certificate (ROC) regime). The  Burbo Bank Extension,  Walney Extension, Hornsea 1, and Hornsea 2 offshore wind farms are under the CfD regime, while our other UK offshore wind farms as well as our Renescience plant are under the ROC regime. We treat the payments from the schemes as government grants.\n\nFeed-in tariffs from our Irish, Dutch, and German wind farms are also recognised as government grants.\n\nIncome from government grants decreased significantly in 2022 due to power prices being above subsidy prices, leading to a lower subsidy per MWh produced.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nGovernment grants comprise grants for environmentally sustainable power generation, grants for the funding of development projects, investment grants, etc.\n\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is  reasonable assurance that the grants will be received.\n\nAs grants for power generation are intended as a compensation for the price of power, we system atically recognise the grants under revenue in step with the power generation and thus the related revenue.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nResearch costs are costs incurred to find new or improve existing technologies (e.g. improving offshore foundations, optimising blade stability and performance for wind farms, developing new ways of converting renewable electrons to renewable molecules and synthetic fuels).\n\nResearch costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs primarly comprise salaries as well as internal and external costs which can be directly or indirectly attributed to design and development of offshore and onshore wind farms,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expensed research and\n\n| development expenditures /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf DKKm   | Offshore                           | Onshore               | Bioenergy  & Other   | Total                            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Research                                                      | /one.tf/two.tf/two.tf              | -                     | -                    | /one.tf/two.tf/two.tf            |\n| Development                                                   | /one.tf,/seven.tf/three.tf/six.tf  | /two.tf/six.tf/six.tf | /one.tf/zero.tf      | /two.tf,/zero.tf/one.tf/two.tf   |\n| Total                                                         | /one.tf,/eight.tf/five.tf/eight.tf | /two.tf/six.tf/six.tf | /one.tf/zero.tf      | /two.tf,/one.tf/three.tf/four.tf |\n\n## Expensed research and development expenditures /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf\n\nDKKm\n\nResearch\n\n/eight.tf/two.tf\n\n-\n\n-\n\n/eight.tf/two.tf\n\nDevelopment\n\n/one.tf,/nine.tf/two.tf/four.tf\n\n/one.tf/four.tf/one.tf\n\n/one.tf/five.tf\n\n/two.tf,/zero.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf\n\nTotal\n\n/two.tf,/zero.tf/zero.tf/six.tf\n\n/one.tf/four.tf/one.tf\n\n/one.tf/five.tf\n\n/two.tf,/one.tf/six.tf/two.tf\n\nthe Renescience Northwich plant, P/two.tfX production facilities, and energy storage facilities.\n\nDevelopment costs are expensed until the capitalisation criteria are met.

A build-up period of up to five years is allowed.\n\n## Executive share programme\n\nThe Group Executive Team and a number of other senior executives participate in the share programme (approx. 120). As a condition for the granting of performance share units (PSUs), the participant must own a number of shares in \u00d8rsted corresponding to a portion of the individual participant's annual fixed salary. The portion depends on the employee category, and it makes up 75 % of our CEO's fixed salary. See the table above for more information. The participants in the programme must invest in \u00d8rsted shares prior to the first granting. A build-up period\n\nfor the shareholding requirements of up to five years is allowed. If the participants fulfil the shareholding requirement at the time of granting, they will be granted a number of PSUs each year, representing a value of 15-20 % (15-40 % in the US) of the annual fixed salary on the date of granting.\n\nThe granted PSUs have a vesting period of approximately three years. Then, each PSU entitles the holder, without payment, to receive a number of shares corresponding to 0-200 % of the number of PSUs granted. The vesting is conditional upon continued\n\nemployment. Assuming no share price development since the grant, the value would correspond to 0-30 % or 0-40 % (0-80 % in the US) of the fixed salary on the date of grant. The final number of shares for each participant will be determined on the basis of the total shareholder return delivered by \u00d8rsted, benchmarked against ten comparable European energy companies.\n\nThe highest rate (200 %) will be triggered if \u00d8rsted's results, measured as the total return to  shareholders, outperform those of the com parable companies. For each lower ranking, the number of shares granted will fall by 20 percentage points. If, for example, \u00d8rsted ranks third, the participants will be entitled to 160 % of the target.\n\nIf \u00d8rsted ranks 11 in the comparison, no shares will be granted to the participants. The right to shares is conditional upon continued  employment.\n\n## Retention share programme\n\nThe target group for the share-based retention agreements will typically be employees responsible for vital, long-term projects. The use of these share-based retention agreements will be limited to 25 concurrent agreements with an individual time frame of up to five years. Members of the Executive Board (CEO, CFO, and Chief HR Officer) cannot be granted such retention agreements.\n\nThe number of retention share units (RSUs) to be granted will be determined on the basis of the price of \u00d8rsted's shares at the time of the grant and will be limited to an amount corresponding to a maximum of six months' base pay for the employee in question. At vesting, each RSU will entitle the employee to one \u00d8rsted share free of charge. However, the total value of the shares to be received at vesting will be capped at a maximum of twelve months' base pay for the employee in question.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe share programme is classified as an equity-based programme as the programme is settled in shares. The market value of the PSUs/RSUs and the estimated number of PSUs granted are measured at the time of granting and recognised:\n\n- -   in the income statement under employee costs over the vesting period\n- -   as an offset in the balance sheet under equity over the vesting period.\n\nThe valuation of the PSUs/RSUs and the estimate of the number of PSUs/RSUs expected to be granted are carried out as a probability simulation based on \u00d8rsted's expected total shareholder return relative to ten comparable European energy companies. The expect ations are factored into the market value and are not adjusted subsequently. The participants are compensated for any dividend payments by receiving additional PSUs/RSUs.",

Under this method, assets and liabilities as well as contingent liabilities of the acquired enterprise are measured at fair value on the date of acquisition.\n\nThe fair values of production assets and assets under construction are normally determined using an income approach where they are valued at present value based on the expected cash flows they can generate, including any  non- separable power purchase agreements, and on income, such as production tax credits.\n\nThe fair value of derivatives is determined using our normal approach for such items, which is based on market prices or expectations for prices over the term of the derivatives.\n\nThe fair values of other assets and liabilities are valued using the approach we find most relevant for the individual item, which can be either a market approach, an income approach, or a cost approach.\n\nAn acquired enterprise is included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, which is the date when we obtain control.\n\nWhen an acquired enterprise has entered into a power purchase agreement classified as a derivative, the fair value of the agreement will be included in the opening balance. Post-acquisition, this fair value is recognised as an adjustment to revenue over the duration of the contract, based on the fair value calculation at the time of the acquisition.",

KG, OSTWIND International S.A.S., and OSTWIND Engineering S.A.S.\n\nThe acquisition of Ostwind constitutes \u00d8rsted's entry into the sizeable and growing German and French onshore markets and substantially expands \u00d8rsted's onshore footprint in Europe. Together with the acquisition of Brookfield Renewable's Ireland and UK onshore wind platform in 2021 and the  recent entry into the Spanish onshore market, \u00d8rsted's onshore renewables platform now covers the US market and four of the largest growth markets in Europe at scale.\n\nThe total purchase price was DKK 4,065 million, including an accrued purchase price of DKK 260 million. Of the purchase price allocation, DKK 2,342 million is allocated to 'Property, plant, and equipment', consisting of operating wind and solar farms and projects under construction or in advanced development. DKK 1,718 million is allocated to 'Goodwill' related to greenfield wind and solar development.\n\nSince the acquisition date, the contributed revenue and result after tax from Ostwind has been immaterial.\n\nIf the acquisition had been made on 1  January 2022, the revenue would have been DKK 318 million, and profit after tax would have been DKK 246 million. As part of the acquisition process, we have incurred costs of DKK 30 million, which have been expensed in our income statement in the Onshore segment.\n\nThe fair values of the assets and liabilities are not considered final until 12 months after the acquisition date.\n\nFollowing \u00d8rsted's acquisition of Ostwind, Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations, a co-investor in part of Ostwind's operating portfolio in France, in December decided to exercise an option to acquire Ostwind's shares (corresponding to a total of 87 MW) in the projects that Ostwind and Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations co-owned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Purchase price allocations in business combinations\n\nWhen we apply the acquisition method for business combinations, by nature this involves judgement in assessing the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities.\n\nFor property, plant, and equipment, our assessment of fair value is based on a number of estimates regarding WACC and expected cash flows, which both have a large impact on the fair value.\n\nOur assessment of fair value for derivatives is dependent on expected future prices. See note /six.tf./six.tf 'Fair value measurement' for our valuation principles.",

Further, we repaid DKK 183  million to Andel for the settlement of the divestment of the Danish power distribution, residental customer, and city light businesses in 2020.\n\nThe gain on divestment of enterprises was affected by a DKK 818 million increase in our indemnification provision towards INEOS in relation to the divestment of our upstream oil and gas business in 2017. The provision regarded a transfer pricing case with the Norwegian Tax Administration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWe recognise income from divested enterprises in the income statement up until the date of divestment.\n\nThe date of divestment is the date on which we relinquish control of the divested enterprise.\n\nGains or losses on the divestment or discontinuation of subsidiaries and associates are determined as the difference between the selling price and the carrying amount of the net assets divested.\n\nMoreover, we deduct any provisions made for obligations related to sales and purchase agreements and the fees of advisers, etc., in connection with the divestment or discontinuation of the enterprise.",

The obligations are measured at nominal value.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe mainly lease office buildings, service and installation vessels, seabeds related to offshore wind farms, and plots of land related to onshore wind farms, solar farms, and battery storage facilities.\n\nSeabed leases include variable lease payments, which depend on the number of megawatt hours generated. However, we have typically agreed on minimum lease payments for the seabeds, and these minimum payments are included in the lease liabilities.\n\nExpenses for the year relating to  variable lease payments not included in lease liabilities were DKK 609 million in 2022 (2021: DKK 352 million). Interests on lease debt expensed in profit (loss) were DKK 256 million in 2022 (2021: DKK 261 million).\n\nTotal cash outflow for leases were DKK 1,447 million in 2022 (2021: DKK 1,133 million).\n\nWe have not entered into lease liabilities which are not commenced per 31 December 2022 and consequently not included in the balance sheet.\n\nFor maturity analysis of leases liabilities, we refer to note 5.5 'Maturity analysis of financial liabilities'.\n\n## Contractual obligations\n\nOur contractual obligations for property, plant, and equipment at 31 December 2022 related mainly to wind turbines, foundations, and cables, etc., for the construction of offshore wind farms (primarily Greater Changhua 1 & 2a, Hornsea 3, Ocean Wind 1 and 2, Revolution Wind, Sunrise Wind, and South Fork).\n\nThe obligations in Onshore mainly related to purchases of wind turbines and solar PV modules.\n\n## Useful lives\n\n| Battery storage                                            | /one.tf/five.tf years                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Buildings                                                  | /two.tf/zero.tf-/five.tf/zero.tf years  |\n| Fixtures and fittings, tools,   and equipment              | /three.tf-/one.tf/zero.tf years         |\n| Gas transportation system  (marine pipelines)              | /two.tf/zero.tf-/four.tf/zero.tf years  |\n| Offshore wind farms                                        | /two.tf/zero.tf-/three.tf/zero.tf years |\n| Onshore wind farms                                         | /two.tf/four.tf-/three.tf/zero.tf years |\n| Production assets, power   (thermal), and district heating | /two.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/five.tf years   |\n| Solar farms                                                | /three.tf/five.tf years                 |\n| Goodwill                                                   | Indefinite                              |",

Sunrise Wind, \u00d8rsted's 50 % owned US offshore wind development project, has been particularly impacted by general market trends, as well as project specific challenges.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the project cost has increased substantially since bid. In the past year, further acute cost increases, specifically driven by the prices for installation vessels and the associated services, have occurred. Rising interest rates have had a corresponding impact on the discount rate\n\nin calculating the recoverable amount of the future cash flows of the project. These challenges have been partially offset by anticipated increased tax benefits from recently enacted tax legislation in the US.\n\nAs a result of these factors, \u00d8rsted recognised an impairment of DKK 2.5 billion on Sunrise Wind in 2022. \u00d8rsted remains committed to Sunrise Wind and the rest of its US offshore wind portfolio. We will continue our work to mature and develop these projects, with an aim to ensure that we can deliver renewable energy to the states.\n\nThe recoverable amount of DKK 1.8 billion was calculated based on the value-in-use method.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Key assumptions in impairment tests\n\nValue-in-use calculations are based on the leadership team's expectations to future cash flows from financial budgets and forecasts and include a number of assumptions and estimates.\n\nThese assumptions include construction schedules, estimates of future market conditions, CAPEX, market prices of energy and commodities, inflation, discount rates, useful lives of the projects, tax incentives, including the ability to qualify for tax credits from the US Inflation Reduction Act, etc.\n\nThe market prices applied are based on available forward prices for a period of up to five years and our best estimate of long-term prices for the remainder of the period.\n\nAs goodwill relates to greenfield onshore wind and solar development, an assumption included in the value-in-use calculations for goodwill is the ability to develop new sites. This assumption is based on current and future build-out plans for renewable energy in Central Europe.\n\nWhile there are inherent uncertainties in the assumptions, the assumptions reflect the leadership team's best estimate over the life of the Group's CGUs.\n\nThe base discount rate for value-in-use calculations is in the range of /five.tf-/eight.tf % after tax.\n\n## Sensitivities to impairment tests\n\nThe assessment of indications of impairment of property, plant, and equipment is based on the expectations applicable as of /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf.\n\nSignificant adverse developments in interest rates, energy prices, tax incentives, and CAPEX assumptions could result in impairment losses on certain operational and development assets in our portfolio, while an opposite development could lead to impairment reversals.\n\nAs a result, we may face adjustments to the recognised impairment of property, plant, and equipment in future reporting periods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nRights are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated future useful lives, which are /five.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf years.\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired company. The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the Group's cash-generating units, which are the operating segments at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not tax deductable.\n\nAnnual impairment tests are carried out for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.\n\n## Property, plant, and equipment\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment which is not a lease is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost of property, plant, and equipment is depreciated by using the straight-line method, the diminishing-balance method, or the reducing-fraction method. The diminishing-balance method and the reducing-fraction method result in decreasing depreciation over the useful life. These methods are used for some of our offshore wind farms.\n\nThe residual values, useful lives, and methods of depreciation of property, plant, and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.\n\nCosts comprise purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date the asset is available for use. The costs of self-constructed assets comprise direct and indirect costs of materials, components, sub-suppliers, and labour. Borrowing costs relating to both specific and general borrowing directly attributable to assets under construction with a lengthy construction period are recognised in costs during the construction period. Costs are increased by the present value of the estimated obligations for demolition and decommissioning of assets to the extent that the obligations are recognised as provisions. Subsequent costs, for example in connection with replacement of parts of an item of property, plant, and equipment, are recognised in the carrying amount of the asset in question when it is probable that future\n\neconomic benefits will flow to the Group from the expenses incurred. Any residual value of the replaced parts is recognised in the income statement as loss on disposal of non-current assets. Other repair and maintenance expenses are recognised in profit (loss) for the year as incurred.\n\n## Impairment\n\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment losses, intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units (CGUs)).\n\nCGUs are assessed for indication of impairment on a quarterly basis. The value of a CGU is impaired if the net book value exceeds the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the estimated value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in the income statement and, except in the case of goodwill, reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the CGU's recoverable amount. Reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income in the income statement net of depreciation if no impairment loss has been recognised for the CGU.\n\nThe discount rate applied when calculating value in use takes general risks into account and is based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) after tax, whereas the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the asset. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a nominal post-tax discount rate.\n\n## Leases\n\nOur lease assets are classified alongside our owned assets of similar type under property, plant, and equipment. Initially, we measure a lease asset at cost, being the initial amount of the lease liability. We depreciate our lease assets over the lease term. The depreciation method used is the straight-line method for all our lease assets, except for seabed leases where the depreciation method is aligned with the depreciation method for the related offshore wind farm. Therefore, seabed lease assets are depreciated using either the straight-line method or the reducing-fraction method.\n\nOur lease liabilities are initially measured at the net present value of the in-substance fixed lease payments for the use of a lease asset. If, at inception of the lease, we are reasonably certain about exercising an option to extend a lease, we will include the lease payments in the option period when calculating the lease liability. We measure the lease asset to the value of the lease liability at initial recognition.\n\nContracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. We allocate the consideration in a contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. We account for non-lease components in accordance with the accounting policy applicable for such items. Non-lease components comprise building services and operating costs of leased vessels, etc.\n\nVariable lease expenses are recognised in other external expenses in the period when the condition triggering those payments occurs. Interests of lease liabilities are recognised in financial expenses.\n\nEach lease payment is separated into repayment of the lease liability and payment of interests of the lease liability. Debt repayments are classified as cash flows from financing activities, and payment of interests are classified as cash flows from operating activities.",

We measure green certificates (earned and bought) at cost using the first in, first out (FIFO) principle.\n\nOther inventories are measured at cost, determined on a first in, first out basis or net realisable value, if net realisable value is lower.\n\nInventories are written down to the lower of net realisable value and cost price. For offshore transmission assets, it is the expected final transfer value announced by Ofgem.\n\nThe net realisable value is the sum (discounted) which the inventories are expected to generate through a normal sale.",

During 2022, we commissioned the onshore wind farm, Haystack, and the wind portion of our combined onshore wind and solar PV project,  Helena Energy Center. We received tax  equity contributions from our partners related to both projects. We also partly commissioned and received tax equity contributions from our partner for the solar PV farm, Old 300. In addition, we acquired Ford Ridge, an operational onshore wind farm, including a tax equity liability.\n\n## Description of tax equity partnerships\n\nTax equity partnerships are characterised by a tax equity partner, who contributes an upfront payment as part of the initial project\n\ninvestment and does not have an operational role in the project. The partner receives a contractually agreed return on the contribution. In order to 'repay' the initial contribution and the return, a disproportionate share of the production tax credits (PTCs) or the investment tax credits (ITCs) and other tax attributes (accelerated tax depreciation and other taxable results) are allocated to the partner during the first part of the project's lifetime. The partner also receives some cash payment-based percentages  specified in the partnership agreements. Once the partner receives the agreed return, the agreement flips, and the partner is typically entitled to a minor part of the cash distributions from the project, unless we repurchase this right from them, which is highly likely.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWhen a tax equity partnership is formed, we evaluate if the company should still be fully consolidated based on our right to variable returns as well as our ability to exercise influence on financial and operational decisions impacting those returns. Due to the operational and financial nature of the projects and the influence normally given to tax equity partners in such agreements, we normally have the influence to fully consolidate companies that have tax equity partners.\n\nThe terms of the tax equity partner's contribution are evaluated to determine the accounting treatment. The contribution generally has the characteristics of a liability as the initial contribution is repaid, including an agreed return, and the partner does not share in the risks of the project in the same way as a shareholder. As such, the contribution is accounted for as a liability and measured at amortised cost. The liability is based on the expected method of repayment and is divided into:\n\n- -   a net working capital element to be repaid through PTCs/ITCs and other tax attributes\n- -   an interest-bearing debt element expected to be repaid through cash distributions.\n\nThe partner's agreed return is expensed as a financial expense and is recognised as an increase of the tax equity liability. PTCs and other tax attributes transferred to the tax equity partner are recognised as other operating income. Tax attributes allocated to the tax equity partner are deferred and recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated contractual length of the partnership structure, while PTCs are recognised in the periods earned, similar to recognition of our own PTCs. ITCs, typically associated with solar farms, are recognised on a straight-line basis over the flip period (partner's ITCs) or over the lifetime of the asset (our own ITCs).\n\nIn addition to the above, we recognise a liability for the expected purchase price for the partner's post-flip rights to cash distributions. This liability is recognised at fair value, and adjustments are expensed as a financial item. This recognition reflects the intention and high likelihood that we will purchase the partner's post-flip rights, and they are part of the financial costs of the arrangement.\n\nIf we choose not to buy the partner's post-flip rights, the tax equity partner will be entitled to part of the company's returns in the post-flip period. At that point, the partner will share in the risks and rewards in the company as a shareholder. We will continue to classify the tax equity investment as a liability after flip.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key accounting judgement\n\n## Recognition of tax equity partnerships\n\nOn formation of a tax equity partnership, we assess the appropriate recognition of the partner's contribution as well as the method of recognition for the elements used to repay the partner, such as PTCs and tax attributes.\n\nIn assessing the recognition of the partner's contribution, we look at:\n\n- -   the expected flows of PTCs, tax attributes, and cash payments to the partner\n- -   the rights and obligations of both us and the tax equity partner.\n\nThe deferral of the income related to tax attributes and the recognition of the contribution as working capital or interest-bearing debt are affected by our expectation to the size, method, and timing of repayments.",

When we construct offshore wind farms in cooperation with partners, they are liable for their share of the decommissioning costs. Therefore, we have only included the decommissioning obligations associated with our ownership interest in the offshore wind farms.\n\nDecommissioning obligations increased by DKK 5,225 million from 2021 to 2022, primarily due to the update of decommissioning scope and methodology and the construction of new wind and solar farms.\n\nDecommissioning methodology was reviewed to incorporate changes in permitting, biodiversity, and sustainability requirements as well as changes in new technologies and vessels.",

        "page_content": "## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions comprise primarily:\n\n- -   offshore partnership provisions, including warranty obligations\n- -   obligations in relation to the divestment of our oil and gas business in 2017\n- -   obligations in respect of our own carbon emissions\n- -   provisions for onerous contracts\n- -   other contractual obligations.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\n## Liability to pay compensation\n\nIn case of any environmental accidents or other types of damage caused by our gas and oil transport, the companies \u00d8rsted Salg & Service A/S and Danish Oil Pipe A/S are liable to pay compensation according to legislation. This also applies if there is no proof of negligence (strict liability). We have taken out insurance to cover any such claims.\n\n## Secondary liability\n\nAs part of the divestment of our oil and gas business in 2017, we assumed a secondary liability regarding the decommissioning of offshore installations.\n\n## Litigation\n\nWe are party to a number of court cases and legal disputes. In our assessment, none of these will significantly impact \u00d8rsted's financial position, neither individually nor collectively.\n\nWe have been party to actions relating to the Danish competition authorities' claim that the former Elsam A/S and Elsam Kraft A/S ('Elsam'), now part of \u00d8rsted, charged excessive prices in the Danish wholesale power market in the period 1 July 2003 to 31 December 2006.\n\nThere are no longer any outstanding cases with the competition authorities claiming Elsam infringed competition law, but in connection with the former cases, some energy trading companies, some of their customers, and others have filed claims for damages, which are still pending. The biggest claim was filed in 2007 before the Copenhagen Maritime & Commercial Court, amounting to approx. DKK 4.4 billion with addition of litigation interest. The case is at the moment under preparation for the Maritime & Commercial Court.\n\n\u00d8rsted is involved in ongoing transfer pricing disputes. For further information, we refer to section 4.1 'Approach to taxes'.\n\n## Change of control\n\nSome of our activities are subject to consents, permits, and licences granted by public authorities. We may be faced with a claim for acceptance of any transfer, possibly with additional terms and conditions, if the Danish State holds less than 50 % of the share capital or voting rights in \u00d8rsted A/S. Read more in note 5.1 'Interest-bearing debt and FFO'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Assumptions for provisions\n\nWe continually assess our provisions recognised to cover contractual obligations and claims raised against \u00d8rsted. Timing, probabilities, amounts, etc., which have a bearing on our provisions' estimates are updated quarterly based on our expectations.\n\nEstimates of provisions are based on our expectations of, for example:\n\n- - timing and scope of obligation\n- - future cost level\n- - legal assessment.\n\nIf deemed material, non-current provisions are discounted using either the structural risk-free interest rate or the incremental borrowing rate. The structural risk-free interest rate is used for decommissioning liabilities and onerous contracts. It is calculated as the sum of real return (gross domestic product growth rate), inflation, and inflation premium for other risks. Separate structural risk-free interest rates are calculated for Europe, the US, and Taiwan.\n\nThe outcome of our contractual obligations and claims may depend on future events, which are uncertain by nature.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProvisions are recognised when the following criteria are fulfilled:\n\n- -  We have a legal or constructive obligation as a result of an earlier event.\n- -  The settlement of the obligation is expected to result in an outflow of resources.\n- -  The obligation can be measured reliably.\n\nDecommissioning obligations are measured at the present value of the future liability in respect of decommissioning as expected at the balance sheet date. The present value of the provision and changes in estimate are recognised as part of the cost of property, plant, and equipment and depreciated together with the associated asset. The addition of interest on provisions is recognised in the income statement under financial expenses.\n\nFor onerous contracts, a provision is made when the expected income to be derived from a contract is lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting our obligations under the contract.\n\nProvisions concerning carbon emissions are recognised when our actual emissions exceed our holding of carbon emission allowances.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## /four.tf./one.tf Approach to taxes\n\nAt \u00d8rsted, we want to provide user-friendly and transparent information about our global tax positions.\n\nWe are committed to paying the right amount of tax, at the right time, in the right place - in accordance with the tax laws of the countries where we operate. We seek to comply not only with the letter of the law, but also with the underlying tax policy intent.\n\nWe believe that taxes are a core part of our corporate social responsibility.\n\nWe are committed to conducting our business in a way that contributes to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Taxes are a key contribution to the SDGs, in particular target 16.6 on the development of effective, accountable, and transparent institutions.\n\nFor more details on our approach to taxes, we refer to our tax policy, which can be found here: orsted.com/taxpolicy.\n\n## Transparency and sustainability\n\nFor the third year in a row, we have drawn inspiration from the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) 207: Tax standard when presenting our approach to and reporting of tax.\n\nIn line with our tax policy, we engage constructively in national and international dialogue with governments, business groups, and civil society to support the development of effective tax systems, legislation, and administration. We want to help create a tax framework supporting the green transformation.\n\nDuring 2022, we have engaged with the OECD and European Union on the implementation of Pillar 2 and submitted our response to a public consultation by the UK treasury on the UK capital allowances regime. Further, we have met with representatives from the Belgian Cabinet to discuss how tax regulations can support the green transformation and facilitate investments in renewables. We have met with representatives from the Greenlandic government to discuss the compatibility of the Greenlandic tax regime with international tax regulations. Upon request, we have provided input to the Alternative Minimum Tax introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act in the US.\n\nWe continuously engage with policymakers and authorities to ensure that windfall taxes and similar measures only target actual excess revenues on a net basis, including related hedges.\n\nThe impact of the energy cap regulations and windfall taxes for 2023 will depend on not yet finalised legislation.\n\nThe purpose of our engagement is to promote the development of tax regimes that support the green transformation by contributing to an informed discussion. By engaging with civil society and gathering input on, for example, how we share information, we believe we can contribute to increasing the public's confidence in the corporate tax system. Further, we are committed to creating certainty for our stakeholders, such as investors and the local communities where we pay our taxes.\n\n## Tax governance\n\nTaxes are overseen by the Board of Directors, and within the Board, the Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee is accountable for our tax policy. The responsibility for tax risk management lies with the CFO and is overseen by the Audit & Risk Committee. The day-to-day tax management is handled by a centralised global tax team.\n\nOur tax function is involved in the planning, implementation, and documentation of all significant business decisions and processes to ensure coordinated assessment of all tax compliance and risks. The tax function also regularly monitors and updates tax risks and related controls.\n\nComplying with tax rules can be complex, as the interpretation of legislation and case law may not always be clear cut and may change over time, giving rise to tax risks. We have implemented a governance framework, which ensures appropriate processes and organisational structures to identify, assess, monitor, and manage tax risks at different levels of the Group. We manage our tax risks by preventing unnecessary disputes, which we strive to achieve through strong technical positions, thorough documentation and explanations of our positions, robust compliance procedures, and by engaging in up-front dialogues with tax authorities.\n\nWe define a tax risk as any consequence relating to the application of our tax policy, day-to-day operations, compliance, or external reporting that impacts the business in the form of cash liabilities, financial reporting misstatements, or reputational damage.\n\nWe have a standardised review process in place, and our controls are continuously reviewed, assessed, and, where applicable, substituted by automated processes. Tax decisions in relation to matters which are subject to approval by the Group Executive Team or the Board of Directors are approved by the Head of Tax.",

        "page_content": "Our tax risk management work includes considering uncertain tax positions, e.g. when we have taken a position where there is an uncertainty created by a comparison of the wording of the law, the expressed policy intent or lack thereof, or fluctuating or divergent application by tax authorities or judicial systems in the countries where we operate.\n\nOccasionally, a multinational enterprise like \u00d8rsted faces potential double taxation. This occurs when two or more tax jurisdictions seek to tax the same business income. We believe that profit should only be taxed once, and where the value is created in line with the position of the OECD.\n\nIn response to the tax risks connected to cross-border activities, including the controversies described in this section, we have made tax-related provisions in accordance with IAS 12, IAS 37, and relevant interpretation, such as IFRIC 23. The provisions have been calculated based on differences in tax rates and statistical risks of suffering economic or legal double taxation.\n\n## Tax controversies\n\nDuring 2022, the Danish Tax Agency has opened further enquiries on development of non-Danish wind farms. The Danish Tax Agency also closed an enquiry relating to\n\ndevelopment services performed by \u00d8rsted Wind Power A/S to our German offshore wind farm Borkum Riffgrund 2 without any adjustments. No information was provided from the Danish Tax Agency on why the enquiry on Borkum Riffgrund 2 was closed. If the principles applied by the Danish Tax Agency in the tax audits on the Hornsea 1, Walney Extension, and Race Bank offshore wind farms had been consistently applied in the Borkum Riffgrund 2 case, this would have resulted in a downward adjustments of the taxable profits in Denmark.\n\nTo date, \u00d8rsted Wind Power A/S has received final administrative decisions from the Danish Tax Agency in relation to the development of the offshore wind farms Hornsea 1, Walney Extension, and Race Bank. In all its decisions, the Danish Tax Agency claims that \u00d8rsted Wind Power A/S has not acted at arm's length terms when charging fees for technical development services provided to the project companies. In its decisions, the Danish Tax Agency has increased \u00d8rsted Wind Power A/S's tax payment to Denmark by DKK 7.6 billion for the income years 2015, 2016, and 2017.\n\nWe have appealed the administrative decisions to the Danish Tax Tribunal. In December 2020, we lodged a successful\n\napplication for a mutual agreement procedure (MAP) between Denmark and the UK under the EU Arbitration Convention for Hornsea 1 and Walney Extension. On Race Bank, we continue to consider our further options, including an elaborated appeal to the Danish Tax Tribunal, a direct appeal to the court system, or a request for a MAP under the double tax agreement between Denmark and the UK. The Danish Tax Agency has accepted a deferral of the tax payment until the case has been finally decided.\n\n## Tax planning and use of tax incentives\n\nWe only use business structures that are driven by commercial considerations and aligned with our business activities. We do not use so-called secrecy jurisdictions or tax havens to avoid taxes. If we establish an entity in a low or nil-rate jurisdiction, it will be for substantive and commercial reasons. In order to remain competitive, we make use of incentives and tax relief implemented by governments where we have commercial substance, and our business activities are the intended beneficiaries of such incentives and relief.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UN sustainability goal\n\nWe are transparent about our approach to tax. We actively participate in the development of effective, accountable, and transparent legislation by our engagement with the OECD on Pillar /two.tf.\n\nWe endorse the B Team Responsible Tax Principles. The B Team is a group of business leaders working to redefine the culture of accountability in business, for companies, communities, and future generations by creating and cascading new norms of corporate leadership that can build a better world.\n\n## ISRS /four.tf/four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf - AUP on application of GRI /two.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf:Tax\n\nWe have drawn inspiration from the GRI /two.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf: Tax standard when presenting our approach to and reporting of tax. The leadership team has been provided with a statement (ISRS /four.tf/four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf - Agreed Upon Procedures) from our auditors on our application of GRI /two.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf: Tax.\n\nThe Fair Tax Mark accreditation scheme seeks to encourage and recognise businesses that pay the right amount of corporation tax at the right time and in the right place. We seek to pay tax responsibly and transparently and are proud to have qualified for the Fair Tax Mark in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf.",

The effective tax rate was 15 % in 2022 against 18 % in 2021.\n\nThe effective tax rate was primarily affected by the largely tax-exempt divestments of the offshore wind farms Hornsea 2 and Borkum Riffgrund 3. Another primary factor derived from the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in connection with capitalisation of project costs in the US where we have\n\nentered into tax equity agreements on the following projects:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHelena Energy Center\n\nOld  300\n\nAnd the continued recognition of deferred tax  liabilities on:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNorth-East  cluster\n\nOcean Wind 1\n\nSee more regarding tax equity partnerships in notes 3.8 'Tax equity liabilities' and 4.3  'Deferred tax'.\n\nThe adjustment of tax concerning previous years primarily relates to a tax equity adjustment on the 2021 Texas winter storm that was not accounted for in 2021. This was partly offset by adjustments to provisions in Danish companies, a partial derecognition of tax loss carryforwards in the US, and adjustments related to the UK consortium relief in accordance with our agreements with our joint venture partners.\n\nThe effective tax rate in 2021 was primarily affected by the largely tax-exempt divestments of the offshore wind farms Borssele 1 & 2 and Greater Changhua 1 and changes to the corporate tax rate in the UK, which impacted our net deferred tax assets. Another primary factor in 2021 was the recognition of a tax liability in connection with tax equity partnerships in the US related to Haystack, Western Trail, Muscle Shoals, Permian Energy Center, the NorthEast cluster, and Ocean Wind 1.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTax for the year consists of current tax, changes in deferred tax, and adjustments in respect of previous years. Tax on profit (loss) for the year is recognised in the income statement. Tax relating to other items is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nOur uncertain tax positions are measured by using either of the following two methods, depending on which method we expect to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty:\n\n- -   The most-likely-outcome method is applied in cases where there are only two possible outcomes.\n- -   The weighted-average method is used in cases where there are more than two possible outcomes.\n\nOur uncertain tax positions are recognised under 'Income tax' or ' Deferred tax', depending on how the realisation of the tax position will affect the financial statement.",

This differs from taxes paid as a result of payments or refunds regarding prior years and residual payments for the current year.\n\nBecause of the high level of investments and the subsequent deferrals of payable tax as a consequence of accelerated tax depreciation, our current tax is generally lower than the statutory corporate tax rates during construction and the initial years after first power from a wind farm.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Estimates regarding recognition of income taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in all the countries where we operate. Significant judgement and estimates are required in determining the worldwide income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including provisions for uncertain tax positions.\n\nIn the course of conducting business around the world, tax and transfer pricing disputes with tax authorities may occur due to the complex nature of the tax rules related to the business. Judgement is applied to assess the possible outcome of such disputes. We apply the methods prescribed in IFRIC /two.tf/three.tf 'Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments' when making provisions for uncertain tax positions, and the provisions made are based on different scenarios of possible outcomes. We consider the provisions made to be adequate. The actual obligation may deviate and might lead to tax in excess of the uncertain tax provisions included. This  depends on the result of litigations and settlements with the relevant tax authorities.\n\nOngoing tax disputes, primarily related to transfer pricing cases, are included as part of 'Income tax' and 'Deferred tax'. Estimates in respect of transfer pricing cases depend, among others, on whether corresponding adjustments can be obtained in the relevant jurisdictions, and, in terms of disputes regarding project companies with partners, whether compensation can be obtained from these partners. Any expected compensation from partners are included as part of 'Other receivables'.",

The unrecognised tax asset is primarily due to ring-fenced tax losses and other losses not meeting the criteria for recognition under IAS /one.tf/two.tf. There is no expiry of our unrecognised tax assets. No provision for withholding tax on dividends has been included as the amounts where a concrete dividend distribution is planned are considered immaterial in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf. Other activities/eliminations primarily consist of eliminations between segments.\n\n## Significant movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTax loss carryforwards due to the accelerated depreciation for tax purposes.\n\nCurrent tax transferred to deferred tax in Denmark because of the net losses on hedges.\n\n- Difference between tax and accounting treatment of financial instruments.\n\nAdjustments to previous year's tax returns in Denmark.\n\nUtilisation of tax loss carryforwards and surrender of consortium relief in the UK.\n\n## Deferred tax liabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRecognition of tax liabilities in connection with tax equity partnerships related to the onshore wind part of Helena Energy Center, Old /three.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf, the North-East cluster, and Ocean Wind /one.tf in our US offshore portfolio.\n\nAcquisition of the shares in Ostwind.\n\n- Adjustment to prior-year classification of property, plant, and equipment related to our onshore wind farm Lincoln Land.",

As the accelerated depreciation is larger than our taxable profits when we make large investments, our tax loss carryforwards increase when more wind farms enter into operation. The tax loss carryforwards are either offset against deferred tax liabilities on the same wind farm or jurisdiction or offset against expected future profits from the very same wind farm or jurisdiction. Our decommissioning liability increases as we expand operations. In most tax jurisdictions, the cost is not tax-deductible until it incurs.",

The distribution of net investments is affected by the sale of assets constructed by \u00d8rsted in Denmark for operations outside Denmark where \u00d8rsted only has part ownership. Jurisdictions not yet material are excluded from the overview.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised in respect of temporary differences relating to:\n\n- -   the acquisition of joint operations, including licence interests\n- -   other items where differences arise at the time of acquisition, affecting neither the profit (loss) for the year nor the taxable income. However, this does not include differences arising in connection with company acquisitions. Except for right-of-use assets, lease liabilities, decommissioning, restoration, and similar liabilities where the corresponding amounts are recognised as part of the cost of the related assets.\n\nDifferences arising in connection with company acquisitions are recognised.\n\nDeferred tax is measured depending on how we plan to use the assets and settle the liabilities. We offset tax assets and liabilities when the tax assets can be offset against tax liabilities in the year in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be used. Intra-group gains and losses are eliminated when calculating deferred tax. In countries where taxes can be offset between companies due to joint taxation schemes, we have netted within a tax jurisdiction. Where no such possibility is feasible, the deferred tax is included with the gross amount on a companyby-company level.\n\nTax losses carried forward in jurisdictions where we have a history of losses are recognised based on other convincing evidence of future profits. The other convicing evidence is based\n\non our long-term forecast model approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nAdjustments to unrecognised tax assets are recognised on profit (loss) or other comprehensive income depending on the underlying source of the adjustment.\n\nDeferred tax is measured based on the tax rules and rates applying when the deferred tax becomes current tax. Changes in deferred tax as a result of changes in tax rates are recognised in profit (loss) for the year.\n\nDeferred tax (net liabilities) related to tax equity structures are recognised as tax expense in the income statement when the tax equity partnership agreement is effective, and we start to or have capitalised the corresponding assets. The liability recognised is the amount that we expect to take over once the contribution from the equity partner is repaid, and the tax equity structure flips.\n\n## US tax equity partnerships\n\nWe have entered into several tax equity partnership agreements in the US.\n\nThe expected value of the deferred tax liability related to property, plant, and equipment at the flip date in the tax equity partnership agreement is included in our accounts when the tax equity partnership agreement is effective, and we start to or have capitalised the corresponding assets. The deferred tax liability from existing tax equity partnerships will be gradually reduced based on accounting depreciation after the flip date.

Again in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, corporate taxes in Denmark are affected by the high volatility of power prices. This affects the Danish corporate taxes due to how we manage our risk. Our corporate taxes in Taiwan derive from gains in our local service companies as well as withholding taxes paid on behalf of the Danish lender.\n\nOur tax footprint is an effect of how and where we conduct our business.\n\n## Local corporate taxes paid\n\nWe have made significant investments in offshore wind farms in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, the US, and Taiwan, resulting in the accumulation of large tax assets in recent years. Historically, we have not paid significant taxes in these countries besides the UK. This is changing as the offshore wind farms are being commissioned and generating positive taxable income, resulting currently in paid taxes in more countries.\n\nWe are also continuously investing in the US. We do, however, not expect to pay material corporate taxes in the US in the near future due to the commercial structures in the US. The funding in the US is carried out applying the US tax equity set-up, which effectively means that tax attributes are transferred to the tax equity partner as repayment and return on investment.

The design of the individual tax regime in each jurisdiction impacts the tax over the life cycle of our investments and thereby\n\nthe timing of our tax payments. A wind farm life cycle begins with the  development phase. This includes opportunity screening, if applicable, bid preparation and obtaining land rights, grid connection, and permits. The latter  activities are further  matured\n\nif an investment decision is made, and the construction phase commences, which includes construction of the wind farm. During both phases,  product, people, and property taxes are borne or collected (see our total tax contribution section).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen the wind farm is commissioned and put into operation, income and positive cash flows are generated. In many cases, the effect of tax incentives results in a deferral of taxable income compared to profit before tax for accounting purposes. Conversely, once the deferral ends, the taxable income related to the wind farm will exceed the accounting profit.\n\nFor this reason, the applicable corporate tax rate and cash tax paid will always differ, but accumulated over the lifetime of the wind farm, they will be very similar.\n\nAlso, in some of the jurisdictions where we operate, there are mandatory or voluntary tax groupings. This means that we will only pay tax on the consolidated result of all of our activities in that country. As a result, continued significant investments in such a country may further defer the time when we pay taxes in that country.\n\nDevelopment activities results in negative cash flows in the beginning of the project life cycle. During construction, the capital employed accelerates materially. Positive income begins when the project enters operation.\n\nSome corporate income taxes may be paid during development if internal development services are provided between tax jurisdictions.\n\nAlso, corporate income taxes may be paid during late-life development subject to deductibility of decommissioning costs and joint taxation legislation.",

Tax does not result in a return of value to \u00d8rsted for a right or asset used in the business.\n\nTaxes borne by us are those that represent a direct cost and are reflected in the financial result. Taxes borne are charged to the profit and loss account.\n\nTaxes collected are those which are generated by our operations, but do not constitute a tax liability for \u00d8rsted. \u00d8rsted generates the commercial activity that gives rise to the  taxes and then collects and administers them on behalf of the tax authorities in the countries where we operate.\n\n## Country-by-country reporting\n\nIn order to increase transparency, we present key figures on tax jurisdiction levels below. Our country-by-country reporting content widely follows the GRI 207: Tax standard. The standard is based on guidance from OECD. In order to ensure internal  coherence throughout the annual report, corporate income tax is calculated based on IFRS reporting standards instead of GRI methodology. The tax incentives provided on green investments defer our tax payments, resulting in a difference between profit (loss) in the accounts and taxable income during the life cycle of a wind farm. This is applicable in most of the countries where we operate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/six.tf,/five.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf\n\n## Total global taxes paid in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf\n\n## Profit taxes\n\nThese include taxes on company profits that are borne (such as corporate income tax) and collected (such as withholding tax on payments to third parties).\n\n## People taxes\n\nTaxes on employment, both borne and collected (including income tax and social security tax payments).\n\n## Product taxes\n\nIndirect taxes on the production and consumption of goods and services, including net VAT and sales tax, custom duties, and insurance premium tax. Net VAT in countries in a net refund position is excluded in the total tax contribution, as it is considered a repayment of tax already paid within the year. Included are also planet taxes, which are insignificant for this summary.\n\n## Property taxes\n\nTaxes on the ownership, sale, transfer, or occupancy of property.",

This information can be compared with our total tax contribution. Our tax contributions reflect that some of our development and construction activities have been based in Denmark, and that our operations in the coming years are beginning to ramp up in markets that have been developed. Also, our presence and the corresponding tax position is affected by hedging, which is primarily handled centrally in Denmark.\n\nWithholding taxes are reported under the country where the payment is made.\n\n## Current tax explanation on country level\n\nThe table shows our profit (loss) before tax in tax jurisdictions and the journey to current tax. Current tax for Denmark is significantly impacted by hedge losses, resulting in an overall tax loss for the year, i.e. a deferred tax asset.

Part of the proceeds was used to repay a portion of the 6.25 % 3013 hybrid bond.\n\nFinally, we significantly increased our short-term credit facilities to ensure access to sufficient liquidity.

We have increased our committed credit facilities from DKK 28.3 billion end of 2021 to DKK 57.2 billion end of 2022.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nTo ensure the financial strength to operate in the international energy and capital markets and secure financing on attractive terms, we have defined a capital\n\n## Equity and interest-bearing net debt\n\nDKKbn\n\n- Interest-bearing asset\n- Interest-bearing debt\n- Hybrid capital\n\n/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf\n\n/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf\n\n/three.tf/six.tf./one.tf\n\n/three.tf./one.tf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/four.tf/seven.tf./one.tf\n\n/four.tf./zero.tf\n\nstructure and credit rating target of Baa1/BBB+ and a FFO/adjusted net debt credit metric of around 25 %.\n\n## Financing policy\n\nThe aim of our financing policy is to minimise liquidity and refinancing risks, while minimising financing costs and matching the currency composition of our debt with our revenue.\n\nThe financing markets are diversified among various funding sources and maturities and are primarily consolidated in the parent company where cash resources are made available to the Group companies via an internal bank.\n\n## Cash management and liquidity reserve\n\nA group-wide cash management set-up ensures optimal allocation of cash in relation to our day- to-day operations and investment programme. We target a liquidity reserve to ensure adequate coverage of budgeted liquidity uses on a rolling 12 month forward-looking basis to limit the company's sensitivity to unforeseen developments, including unrest in financial markets.\n\n/one.tf/two.tf/six.tf./one.tf bn\n\n- Equity attributable to shareholders in \u00d8rsted A/S\n- Non-controlling  interests\n\n/seven.tf/seven.tf./seven.tf\n\n/one.tf/nine.tf./eight.tf\n\n/seven.tf/one.tf./seven.tf\n\n/one.tf/zero.tf /nine.tf./four.tf bn\n\n/six.tf/zero.tf./four.tf\n\n/one.tf/eight.tf./zero.tf\n\n/six.tf/four.tf./zero.tf",

The increase in interest-bearing net debt consists of an increase in interestbearing debt of DKK 17,349 million and an increase in interest -bearing assets of DKK 11,058 million.\n\nIn January and March, we have entered into a USD 197 million (DKK 1,375 million) and USD 548 million (DKK 3,818 million) loan with Nordic Investment Bank and European Investment Bank, respectively.\n\nIn June, we issued two new green senior bonds in the amount of EUR 1,350 million (DKK 10,039 million):\n\n- -   EUR 750 million (DKK 5,577 million), 2.875 % interest, maturing in June 2033\n- -   EUR 600 million (DKK 4,462 million), 2.25 % interest, maturing in June 2028.\n\nIn September, we issued three new green bonds in the amount of EUR 900 million (DKK 6,693 million) and GBP 950 million (DKK 7,963 million):\n\n- -   EUR 900 million (DKK 6,693 million), 3.25 % interest, maturing in September 2031\n- -   GBP 575 million (DKK 4,819 million), 5.375 % interest, maturing in September 2042\n- -   GBP 375 million (DKK 3,143 million), 5.125 % interest, maturing in September 2034.\n\n## Rating\n\nWe have a corporate credit rating of BBB+/ Baa1/BBB+, stable outlook, from Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch, which is in line with our target. FFO/adjusted interestbearing net debt was 42.7 % in 2022, well above our target.\n\n## Loan arrangements and credit facilities\n\nAt 31 December 2022, we had bank loan obligations totalling DKK 5,880 million (2021: DKK 1,536 million) to European Investment Bank and Nordic Investment Bank. The loans offered by these multilateral financial institutions cofund specific energy projects with maturities exceeding those normally available in the commercial banking market.\n\nFurthermore, we had non-cancellable credit facilities and undrawn loan agreements of DKK 57,179 million at 31  December 2022 (2021: DKK 28,349 million) with a number of Scandinavian, international, and Taiwanese banks.\n\nIn connection with these loan arrangements and credit facilities, we may be met with demands for cancellation and repayment of any drawn amount in the event of shareholders other than a group consisting of the Danish state and Danish power  distribution companies  controlling more than 50 % of the share capital or voting rights in \u00d8rsted A/S. Our financing agreements are not subject to any other unusual terms or conditions.",

policies\n\nBond debt, bank debt, and other payables are recognised at inception at market value (typically proceeds received) net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the liabilities are measured at amortised cost, so that the difference between the cost (proceeds) and the nominal value is recognised in profit (loss) for the year as interest expenses over the term of the loan, using the effective interest rate method.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as current, unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability to at least one year after the balance sheet date.\n\nThe market value of issued bonds has been  determined as the market value at /three.tf/one.tf December (level /one.tf - quoted prices).\n\nThe market value of bank loans has been determined as the present value of expected future instalments and interest payments using the Group's current interest rate on loans as the discount rate (level /two.tf - observable inputs).",

The purpose of issuing hybrid capital is to strengthen our  capital base and fund our investments. We have issued EUR hybrid bonds with a total nominal value of EUR 2,194 million and GBP 425 million, equivalent to DKK 19,877 million (2021: EUR 1,950 million and GBP 425 million, equivalent to DKK 18,269 million).\n\nIn 2022, we have issued a new green hybrid bond with a nominal value of EUR 500 million (DKK 3,718 million). Part of the proceeds was used to repay the 3013 hybrid bond.\n\nFor all our hybrid bonds, we have the right to defer coupon payments and ultimately decide not to pay them at maturity. Deferred coupon payments become payable, however, if we decide to pay dividends to our shareholders or pay coupon payments on other hybrid bonds.\n\nAs a consequence of the special terms regarding the hybrid bonds, these are classified as equity, and therefore coupon payments are recognised in equity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nHybrid capital comprises issued bonds that qualify for treatment in accordance with the rules on compound financial instruments due to the special characteristics of the bonds. The notional amount, which constitutes a liability, is recognised at present value, and equity has been increased by the difference between the net proceeds received and the present value of the discounted liability. The carrying amount of the liability component amounted to nil on initial recognition as the only payment obligation is the repayment of the nominal value in /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf years.\n\nCoupon payments are accounted for as dividends, which are recognised directly in equity at the time\n\nthe payment obligation arises. This is because the coupon is discretionary, and therefore any deferred coupon lapses upon maturity of the hybrid capital. Coupon payments are recognised in the statement of cash flows within financing activities.\n\nOn redemption of hybrid capital, the payment will be distributed between liability and equity, applying the same ratio as when the hybrid capital was issued. This means that the  difference between the payment on redemption and the net proceeds received on issue is recognised directly in equity, as the liability portion of the existing hybrid issues will be nil during the first part of the life of the hybrid capital.",

The financial resources were in particular built up during the year to ensure sufficient liquidity to cope with collateral payments and continuing investments in the green transformation.\n\nThe change in liquidity reserve is due to an increase in cash, available securities, and undrawn credit facilities of DKK 7,554 million, DKK 18,217 million, and DKK 28,830 million, respectively.\n\n## Collateral and margin postings\n\nWhen we trade in derivatives to execute our hedging strategy, we have two alternatives:\n\n- -   Trading on exchanges where the market value is settled on an ongoing basis through receipt or placing of collateral.\n- -   Trading OTC where we accept the credit risk that will occur if we gain on the transaction.\n\nWe are trading under both type of agreements to increase the number of counterparties with whom we are engaging to achieve the most optimal price.\n\nTo mitigate and limit the potential negative impact on our cash position from\n\ntemporary fluctuations in market prices, we actively manage the volume of trades between trading with and without collateral arrangements.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, 31 % (2021: 51 %) of our power and gas trades and 86 % (2021: 82 %) of our currency, inflation, and interest rate hedges had daily margin settlements.\n\nTo limit cash impact, we also provide noncash collateral as parent company and bank guarantees, where possible. At the end of December 2022, we had covered EUR 1 billion in collateral for initial margins on energy hedges through a parent company guarantee.\n\nOur collateral and margin payments related to trading with derivatives and collateral related to insurance liabilities and escrow accounts have increased from DKK 12.3 billion at 31 December 2021 to DKK 17.3 billion at 31 December 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the large increase in power and gas prices. Collateral payments related to variation margins increased by DKK 10.3 billion and was partly offset by a decrease in initial margins of DKK 3.5 billion during the year and amounted to DKK 12.8 billion at 31 December 2022.\n\nInitial margin and variation margin relate to energy hedges, and the credit support\n\nannex (CSA) relates to currency, inflation, and interest rate hedges. Other collateral mainly relates to insurance liabilities and escrow accounts. Further securities can be placed as collateral in repo transactions as part of our cash management.\n\n## Liquidity reserve\n\nDKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Collateral and margin postings\n\nDKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->",

Most of the securities  qualify for repo transactions with the  Danish central bank, 'Danmarks Nationalbank'.\n\nSecurities not available for use comprise securities pledged as collateral for:\n\n- -   short-term repo loans: DKK 0 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: DKK 14,207 million)\n- -insurance- related  provisions: DKK 381 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: DKK 397 million)\n- -   trading in financial instruments: DKK 388 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: DKK 414 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nSecurities comprise bonds that are monitored, measured, and reported at market value on an on going basis in conformity with the Group's investment policy. Changes in market value are recognised in profit (loss) for the year as financial income and expenses. Purchase and sale of securities are recognised at the settlement date.\n\nFor listed securities, market value equals the market price, and for unlisted securities, market value is estimated based on generally accepted valuation methods and market data.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, we had received cash collateral in the amount of DKK 1,194 million (2021: DKK 1 million) concerning the positive market value of derivatives.\n\nCash not available for use comprises:\n\n- -   payables for the purchase of gas that has not yet been settled placed on a restricted acount: DKK 2,029 million (2021: DKK 0 million)\n- -   collateral for insurance-related provisions: DKK 38 million (2021: DKK 254 million)\n- -   collateral for power purchase agreements and trading with financial instruments: DKK 366 million (2021: DKK 825 million)\n- -   collateral for other transactions: DKK 38 million (2021: DKK 240 million).\n\nDivested securities where repurchase agreements (repo transactions) have been made at the time of sale are recognised in the balance sheet at the settlement date as if the securities were still held. The amount received is recognised as a liability, and the difference between the selling price and the purchase price is recognised in profit (loss) for the year over the term as interest. The return on the securities is recognised in profit (loss) for the year.",

Through our risk  management, we monitor these risks and reduce them to an  acceptable level.\n\nThe majority of our income from power generation for the next five years are based on fixed tariffs, guaranteed minimum prices, or long-term power purchase agreements. Only a small part of our total earnings are exposed to changes in energy prices. We describe the management of this residual risk in this chapter.\n\n## /three.tf/five.tf %\n\nOur net inflation risk for assets in operation, under construction, and awarded is /three.tf/five.tf % for the period /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/two.tf, i.e. if inflation increases by /one.tf./zero.tf percentage point, our long term earnings will increase by /zero.tf./six.tf/five.tf percentage point.\n\n## -/three.tf/three.tf./zero.tf bn\n\nThe value of hedging instruments (mainly power) that will impact EBITDA in the future amounts to a loss of DKK /three.tf/three.tf,/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf million at /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf (/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf: DKK /three.tf/one.tf,/eight.tf/zero.tf/four.tf million).\n\n## +/one.tf./five.tf bn\n\nThe initial fair value of corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs) amounts to DKK /one.tf,/four.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf million, which will be recognised as revenue over the remaining life of the CPPAs (/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf: DKK /eight.tf/three.tf/four.tf million).\n\n## Unusual year with high energy prices\n\nIt has been another extraordinary year for the energy markets. Gas prices have remained high during 2022 until at the very end of the year. The main reason for the high gas prices was the low supply of Russian gas as a consequence of the war in Ukraine. The high gas price has also driven the power prices to record-high levels.\n\nOur previous hedging policy implies that the majority of our expected energy price exposure in 2022 was hedged. This has caused a volume-related overhedging, among other things due to the delay of the commissioning of the Hornsea 2 Offshore Wind Farm. Overhedging and ineffective hedges net of our trading result was recognised in other operating expenses with a net loss of DKK 4.6 billion.\n\n## Trading portfolio\n\nWe have a limited trading portfolio with the main purpose of optimising the execution of hedging contracts and gains from short-term energy price fluctuations.

Going forward, we will apply a new approach better suited to the characteristics of our portfolio. The new framework provides a better balance between ensuring short-term financial stability and avoiding adverse impact from the hedges, such as the risk of being overhedged and large collateral postings due to negative market values. With the new approach, we have decided to reduce the hedge level and horizon for renewable\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWe apply hedge accounting to our energy, commodity, currency, interest, and inflation hedges. Where possible, we use hedging instruments which hedge the desired risk one-to-one. The GBP exposure, for example, is hedged using GBP forward exchange contracts, GBP swaps, or GBP loans. Thus, there are no significant sources of ineffectiveness. For currency swaps, the basis spread is accounted for according to the cost of the hedging model.\n\nTo the extent that a risk needs to be hedged, and if there is no fully effective instrument available in the market, analyses are performed of the expected effectiveness of the hedging instrument before the hedging transaction is concluded. In this case, the ratio between the hedged risk and the hedging instrument may deviate from the one-to-one principle and will be determined as the ratio which most effectively hedges the desired risk.\n\nWe recognise changes to the market value of hedging instruments that qualify for recognition as a hedge of future cash flows in other comprehensive income in the hedging reserve. The majority of our exposure is highly probable forecast transactions. On realisation of the hedged cash flow, the resulting gains or losses are transferred from equity and recognised in the same item as the hedged item. However, on hedging of proceeds from future loans, the resulting gain or loss is transferred from equity over the term of the loan.\n\nWhen we conclude a hedging transaction, and each time we present financial statements thereafter, we assess whether the hedged exposure and the hedging instrument are still financially correlated. If the hedged cash flows are no longer expected to be realised, the in full or partially accumulated value change is transferred to profit (loss) for the year. Ineffective hedges related to energy and commodity exposures are recognised in other operating expenses. Ineffectiveness related to other hedges are recognised in financial income or expenses.\n\nChanges in the market value of derivatives that are classified as hedges of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability are recognised in profit (loss) for the year together with changes\n\npower price exposures to a range of 0 % 70 % in the current year plus the next year. In addition, we will utilise opportunities beyond this period to maximixe value and support commercial initiatives.\n\nUnder our previous hedging framework, we hedged the next five years with a staircase model with minimum hedge levels of 90 % in the coming year, gradually being reduced each year. A transition period is required to go from the previous risk mandate set-up and into the new.\n\n## Managing long-term market risks\n\nBeyond the period where we actively hedge, our market risk picture is determined by our portfolio of assets and long-term contracts. We actively manage the long-term market risk through the investment decisions we take and contracts we enter into.\n\nOur power exposure is partly mitigated through long-term corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs), and we use debt to manage our long-term currency, interest rate, and inflation risks.\n\nin the value of the hedged asset or liability to the extent of the hedged risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Valuation of long-term power purchase agreements\n\nWhen we measure our power purchase agreements at fair value, we use estimates of non-observable prices such as:\n\n- -   production forecasts - intermittency (expected profiled production versus constant (flat) production)\n- -   forecasted long-term power prices and exchange rates\n- -   forecasted inflation expectations\n\nThe development in market values is monitored on a continuing basis and reported to the Group Executive Team.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nHedge effectiveness is measured using forecasted production as well as estimates regarding energy prices,intermittency, interest, currency and inflation. For periods where we are close to fully hedged, volume overhedging is possible if the forecasted production does not materialize which will lead to recognition of ineffectiveness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key accounting judgement\n\n## Valuation of long-term power purchase agreements\n\nWe measure our power purchase agreements at fair value, but they cannot always be measured on quoted prices in active markets due to the long duration of the contracts. We use elements of judgements determining models to measure the fair value and we aim to limit the use of subjective estimates and base the fair values on external information including external pricing and benchmark services.\n\n## Effectiveness of hedge relationship\n\nJudgements are used to consider whether forecasted transactions are highly probable exposures as hedged item in a hedge relationship, eg. expected production from wind farms, and judgment is applied in whether the hedge instruments applied in the hedge relationships identified are effective.",

Hence, the GBP exchange rate risk associated with power generation in the UK is hedged when the power price has been hedged.\n\nIn contrast, cash flows that relate to subsidised GBP income from offshore wind farms in the UK, less operating expenses, are hedged on a declining level of hedging over the fiveyear risk management horizon. The target is to hedge 100 % in year 1, declining by 20 percentage points each year to 20 % in year 5.\n\n## GBP exposure\n\nOur GBP exposure amounted to DKK 13.9 billion after hedging for the years 20232027. This unhedged GBP exposure stems primarily from subsidised GBP income less operational expenditures.\n\nThe GBP exchange rate for hedges impacting EBITDA in 2023 and 2024 is hedged at an average of GBP/DKK 8.4 and 8.3, respectively.\n\n## USD and NTD exposures\n\nFor our USD and NTD exposures from new markets, we have a limited existing portfolio against which we can net construction payments. Therefore, we seek to hedge the exchange rate risk in the near term by swapping out the exposure in time.\n\n## EUR exposure\n\nWe have a substantial exposure towards EUR, which we assess on a continuous basis. EUR is generally not hedged, as we believe that  Denmark will maintain its fixed exchange-rate policy.\n\n## GBP exposures\n\nDKKbn\n\n## Before hedging After hedging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph shows our GBP exposure before and after hedges from:\n\n- -   divestments and investments\n- -green  certificates\n- -hedged  energy.\n\n## Development in currency rates DKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph shows the historic development in spot currency rates for the past three years and the forward rates for /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf and /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/four.tf as of /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf.",

Gas and oil activities only have a risk after hedging of DKK 0.1 billion for the period 2023-2027.\n\n## Introduction to hedging of power\n\nWe use fixed-volume hedges (settled based on a fixed hourly volume throughout the hedged period) to hedge price risk associated with our power production. The fixedvolume hedges do not fully match the actual hourly production profile delivered by our wind farms. This is referred to as intermittency risk. See 'Intermittency risk' graph to the right.\n\n## Offshore power generation\n\nRevenue from power generation from offshore wind farms mainly comprise:\n\n- -   fixed tariffs in the UK (CfD wind farms), the US, and Taiwan\n- -   guaranteed minimum prices in Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands\n- -   sale of power production at market price from some wind farms in Denmark and the UK\n- -   guaranteed minimum prices for green certificates in the UK (ROC wind farms)\n- -   long-term power purchase agreements.\n\nAt the end of 2022, fixed tariffs and guaranteed minimum prices covered approx. 76 % (2021: 83 %) of the expected income from offshore wind farms for the period 2023-2027. The reduction is due to a large increase in forward power prices at the end of 2022 compared to 2021, which increased the expected revenue from production settled at market price. The remaining 24 % of expected income is exposed to energy price risks and concerns sales of power at market price in the UK, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.\n\n## Onshore power generation\n\nA large part of the earnings in Onshore comes from power generation in the US, which comprises tax incentives, such as PTCs or ITCs, and power. The tax incentives have a fixed value. However, there is a price risk associated with the power, which is\n\n## Intermittency risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe light blue area illu strates the intermittency risk where our actual production is either above or below the fixed volume in our hedges. When the additional value of the production (volume x market price) in area /one.tf does not match the missing value of the production in area /two.tf, our actual production will not fully match our fixed-volume hedges.\n\n## Development in power prices\n\nDKK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph shows the historic development in monthly average spot power prices for the past three years and the forward rates for /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf and /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/four.tf as of /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf.

The current CPPAs cover approx. 73 % of the  expected generation for the period 2023-2027 calculated from the time of commissioning of the individual wind farms, if that date is later than the end of 2022. The CPPAs are entered into with large corporates or financial institutions.\n\nFurthermore, additional earnings originate from power generation in Ireland, Germany, and France where the assets are either subject to a subsidy scheme, or we have PPAs in place for the majority of the production.\n\n## Power generation at our CHP plants\n\nOur combined heat and power (CHP) plants consist of biomass- and fossil-fuelled plants in Denmark. Heat generation does not give rise to price risks, as the associated costs are covered by the heat customers. However, heat generation entails a price risk for power to the extent to which we generate heat and power simultaneously. The profitability of power generation is determined by the difference between the selling price of power and the purchase price of fuel and, for other fuels than biomass, carbon emission allowances. If the spreads are attractive, we provide condensing power generation in addition to CHP generation. The total net risk associated with power from heat-bound CHP generation for the 2023-2027 period is DKK 5.9 billion after hedging.\n\n## Commodity risk for construction projects\n\nWhen building a wind farm, we are exposed to the price development in a number of commodities, most significantly steel. Steel element indices have enabled hedging of\n\nparts of this risk. We hedged a substantial amount of the steel for foundations that were delivered in 2022, and we will continue to hedge more throughout 2023 as future volumes are being committed.\n\n## Power sales\n\nThe price risk associated with power sales is given by the difference between the purchase and sales prices and is thus considered to be limited.\n\nFor our investor power purchase agreements, we retain part of the power price risk, and thus we are to some extent exposed to the same risks as for the production from our own share of the wind farms, including volume and intermittency risks.\n\n## Gas sales\n\nThe price risk associated with sale of gas stems from differences in the indexing of sales and purchase prices. Our largest gas purchase contracts are mainly indexed to pure gas prices and thus no longer constitute a significant risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principles for estimating exposures\n\nExposure is calculated as the expected production (or net purchase/sale) times the forward price for the respective years.\n\n\u00d8rsted's power price exposure before hedges for /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf split on markets DKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table shows our total exposure towards power prices before hedges for the period /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf.\n\n## Offshore's power price exposure DKKbn\n\n- Before hedging After hedging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table shows the exposure of Offshore's  generation of power before and after hedges.",

Earnings from fixed nominal assets provide cash flow stability and will benefit in periods characterised by deflation and expansionary monetary policy from central banks.\n\nA total of ~65 % of our revenue from Offshore and Onshore assets in operation, under construction, and awarded for the period 2023-2032 is expected to increase and decrease with inflation changes. Of this, ~50 % of our revenue is inflation-indexed, mainly from our UK and Polish offshore wind farms, while ~15 % of our revenue is driven by merchant power prices. The remaining ~35 % of revenue is fixed and is therefore subject to real value loss if inflation\n\n- increases.\n\n## This is the case for:\n\n- -   fixed nominal subsidies from offshore wind assets in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the US\n- -   fixed nominal power purchase agreements related to onshore wind assets in the US and offshore wind assets in Europe and Taiwan.\n\nWe have converted part of our UK inflationlinked revenue to fixed nominal revenue with derivatives to create a better match between our GBP revenue and debt at an average retail price index (RPI) rate of 3.6 % for the priod 2024-2037 and an average consumer price index (CPI) rate of 2.7 % for the period 2030-2033.\n\nOther EBITDA mainly includes OPEX, COGS, DEVEX, and other operating income from US tax credits and divestment gains. The majority of these items will increase with inflation and is netted with the inflationindexed revenue, leaving the EBITDA proportionally more exposed to fixed nominal cash flows compared to revenue.\n\nTo mitigate the inflation risk from our fixed nominal exposure, we issue fixed-rate debt and enter into hedges to fix future debt isuances. With active management, we have reduced the fixed nominal exposure to 35 % for EBITDA, net of debt and related hedges.\n\n## Inflation exposure from Offshore and Onshore assets\n\n- Fixed nominal\n- Inflation-indexed Merchant\n\n<!-- image -->",

A large part of our counterparty risks concerns major international energy companies and banks. Such trading is regulated under standard agreements, such as EFET and ISDA agreements, which feature, for instance, credit rating and netting provisions. Our credit exposure is mainly concentrated on counterparties in the EU, the UK,  Switzerland, and the US.\n\nWe limit our credit risks by:\n\n- -  rating significant counterparties\n- -   granting credit limits\n- -   demanding that collateral be furnished or credit security put in place for weak counterparties.\n\nThe counterparties and credit limits granted are monitored on an ongoing basis. The  monitoring is based on the framework established by our Board of Directors and the Group Executive Risk Committee.\n\n- /uni2196 The table shows our financial assets and liabilities where a share is offset and therefore presented net.  Offsetting is typically limited to specific products.\n- \u2190 The AAA/Aaa category covers our position in Danish AAA-rated government and mortgage bonds. The other category primarily consists of trade receivables from customers, such as end users.\n\nFor the most significant counterparties, an internal rating is assigned in connection with establishing credit limits. The rating is based on information from  external credit rating agencies, publicly  available information, and our own analyses.\n\nWe have not suffered losses from any single major counterparty in 2022 or 2021.\n\nThe credit risks from our financial assets prima rily concern derivatives, cash, securities, and receivables. The assessment is based on the individual counterparty's ratings with Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch. The  figures do not reflect our actual credit  exposure, as the positions are calculated  before offsetting our debt to such counterparties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWe only offset positive and negative values if we are entitled to and intend to settle several financial instruments net.",

A number of our derivatives, mainly power purchase agreements, are measured based on unobservable inputs due to the long duration of the contracts. The most significant non-observable inputs are the long-term US power prices (mainly ERCOT) and German power prices.\n\nValuation principles and key assumptions In order to minimise the use of subjective estimates or modifications of parameters and calculation models, it is our policy to determine fair values based on the external information that most accurately reflects the market values. We use pricing services and benchmark services to increase the data quality. Market values are determined by the Risk Management function, which reports to the CFO. The development in market values is monitored on a continuing basis and reported to the Group Executive  Team.\n\n## Initial fair value from power purchase agreements\n\nThe initiation fair value from CPPAs consist of the market value of CPPAs purchased as part of a business combination or asset acquisition. The CPPAs lock the  power price of the expected power generation over a period of 10-20 years. These contracts are accounted for at fair value. Due to the long duration of these CPPAs, power prices are not observable for a large part of the duration.\n\nThe initial negative fair value from CPPAs is recognised as revenue in profit or loss in the future period to which the market value relates. In 2022, we have recognised an income of DKK  228 million (2021: DKK 139 million) related to the initial fair value from CPPAs. The total amount of initial fair value as of 31  December 2022 amounts to a loss of DKK 1,497 million (2021: loss of DKK 834 million), which will be recognised as revenue in a future period.",

Since there are no active markets for the long-term prices of power and gas, the market values have been determined through an estimate of the future prices.\n\n## Estimating non-observable power prices\n\nSince our CPPAs are normally settled on the actual production, and the power prices available in the market are based on a constant production (flat profile), we take into account that our expected production is not constant, and thus our CPPAs will not be settled against a flat profile price (intermittency adjustment). For the majority of our markets, the flat profile power price can be observed for a maximum of four to six years in the market, after which an active market no longer exists.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nMarket values based on quoted prices comprise quoted securities and derivatives that are traded in active markets. The market value of derivatives traded in an active market is often settled on a daily basis, thereby minimising the market value presented on the balance sheet.\n\nMarket values based on observable inputs comprise derivatives where valuation models with observable inputs are used to measure fair value.\n\nAll assets and liabilities measured at market value are measured on a recurring basis.\n\nIn business combinations, gains (losses) at initial recognition of derivatives whose values are based on non-observable inputs are deferred and recognised in the period to which the value relates.",

The risks associated with our options are smaller than for our swaps. The market value mostly consists of received exposure from our assets with settlement at maturity, whereas part of the external trade is settled on a daily basis.\n- /two.tf Trading activities are carried out under mandates approved by the Board of Directors. The mandates comprise a value-at-risk (VaR) mandate and a stress mandate as well as a limit for the maximum positions measured in energy units per product (power, gas, etc.).\n- /three.tf The graph shows the daily VaR position for the period /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf. VaR reached DKK /two.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf million on /nine.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, causing a passive breach of the Board of Directors' mandate of DKK /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf million due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the large reduction in gas supplies to Europe, causing the European energy prices to spike. In /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, there were further passive breaches in August due to Russian gas supply cuts and in September-November due to a halt of gas through the Nord Stream /one.tf and /two.tf pipelines after the explosions in September.\n\n## Trading portfolio\n\nThe purpose of our trading portfolio is to: -   optimise hedging contracts\n\n- -    contribute to increased market insight\n- -   profit from short-term fluctuations in energy prices.\n\nThe energy trading portfolio receives the exposure from our assets and takes that exposure into the external market in the most efficient way possible, given the mandates shown to the left. The overview of the Group's energy trading portfolio to the left is the net of the internal exposures received from the assets and the external trades in line with internal risk management.\n\nThe trading portfolio primarily consists of positions in power and gas.\n\nThe trading portfolio constitutes a smaller part of our total portfolio of derivatives, and the associated risk is limited.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nMarket value adjustments of physical and financial contracts relating to energy that are entered into with the purpose of generating gains from  short-term price changes are recognised as revenue.\n\n## Daily position in the trading portfolio, market trading mandates /three.tf DKKm\n\n<!-- image -->",

The ESG performance report also includes additional information, such as selected ESG indicators by country and all ESG accounting policies, including a list of  references for conversion factors used in calculations.\n\n## Scope and consolidation\n\nUnless otherwise stated, ESG data is reported on the basis of the same principles as the financial statements. Thus, the  consolidated ESG statements include consolidated data from the parent company \u00d8rsted A/S and subsidiaries controlled by \u00d8rsted A/S. Joint operations are also included with \u00d8rsted's proportionate share. Data from associates and joint ventures is not included.\n\nThe consolidation of safety data deviates from the above-described principles. Safety data is collected using an operational scope. This means that irrespective of our ownership share, we include 100 % of injuries and hours worked, etc., arising from all operations where \u00d8rsted is responsible for safety,\n\nincluding safety related to external suppliers. Data from acquisitions and divestments is  included or excluded from the date of acquisition or divestment.\n\n## Danish Financial Statements Act, sections /nine.tf/nine.tf a, /nine.tf/nine.tf b, and /one.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf d\n\nPursuant to section 99 a of the Danish Financial Statements Act (\u00c5rsregnskabsloven), \u00d8rsted is under an obligation to account for the company's sustainability activities and report on business strategies and activities with regard to human rights, labour rights, anti-corruption, the environment, and the climate. By publishing our sustainability report (orsted.com/sustainability2022), \u00d8rsted complies with section 99 a of the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\n\u00d8rsted's work for increased gender diver sity at leadership level is reported in accordance with section 99 b of the Danish Financial Statements Act in our ESG performance  report 2022 (orsted.com/ESGperformance2022).\n\nReporting on diversity in accordance with section 107 d of the Danish Financial Statements Act can be seen in our sustainability report (orsted.com/sustainability2022).\n\n## Taxonomy Regulation (EU) /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf//eight.tf/five.tf/two.tf\n\nIn line with Regulation (EU) 2020/852, we disclose our taxonomy-aligned share of revenue (turnover), CAPEX, and OPEX for 2022.

The increase was mainly due to generation from Hornsea /two.tf commissioned in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf and higher wind speeds.\n\nOnshore power generation increased by /five.tf/seven.tf % to /one.tf/three.tf./one.tf TWh in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf. The increase was due to additional generation from our new onshore wind farms installed in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf and full-year effects from wind farms installed in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf. It was also due to the full-year effect from the two US solar farms commissioned in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf and a new solar farm coming online in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf.\n\nHeat and power generation in Bioenergy & Other decreased by /one.tf/six.tf % in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf. This was due to lower heat demand in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf as a result of warmer weather and a decrease in power generation from the CHP plants due to the lower heat demand, partly offset by increased condensing power generation due to higher power spot prices.\n\n- /one.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf numbers are taxonomy-eligible proportions.\n- /two.tf The /one.tf/seven.tf./five.tf GW (/two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/zero.tf) target is for onshore wind power, solar PV, and battery storage combined.",

/nine.tf/one.tf % in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf. This was primarily due to increased renewable generation from offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar PV, partly offset by reduced generation from sustainable biomass. Our target is /nine.tf/nine.tf % green energy generation by /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/five.tf.\n\nOffshore wind speeds were slightly higher in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, while availability continued to be at /nine.tf/four.tf %, resulting in the load factor increasing by /three.tf percentage points to /four.tf/two.tf % in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf. Onshore wind speeds were the same in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf as in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf. Availability and load factor decreased by /three.tf percentage points and /two.tf percentage points in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, respectively.\n\nGas sales decreased by /four.tf/eight.tf % to /three.tf/one.tf./six.tf TWh in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf. This was primarily due to lower UK sourcing volumes and lower offtake on our Gazprom Export supply contract.\n\nPower sales (Offshore) increased by /eight.tf./seven.tf TWh to /three.tf/three.tf./seven.tf TWh in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, primarily due to increased volumes sold from third-party wind farms where we are responsible for balancing and increased volumes sold on behalf of our partners. Power sales (Bioenergy & Other) decreased by /three.tf./four.tf TWh to /five.tf./four.tf TWh in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, primarily due to the phasing out of our UK B/two.tfB business.\n\n## Environment\n\nOur greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity (scope /one.tf and /two.tf) increased by /three.tf % to /six.tf/zero.tf g CO /two.tf e/kWh in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf due to increased GHG emissions from coal consumption, partly offset by increased energy generation. Coal consumption increased due to the energy crisis in Europe and a fire in a wood pellet silo at Studstrup Power Station. We are well on track to meeting our target of a GHG emission intensity of no more than /one.tf/zero.tf g CO /two.tf e/kWh in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/five.tf, assuming we are allowed by the Danish authorities to close down our coalbased generation in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/four.tf.\n\nOur scope /three.tf GHG emissions were reduced by /four.tf/zero.tf % from /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf to /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf. The main driver for this was the /four.tf/eight.tf % decrease in gas sales.\n\n- /one.tf For /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf, data is shown for US only.\n- /two.tf Offshore is responsible for \u00d8rsted's total power sales, including internal power sales to Bioenergy & Other, which are eliminated at Group level.\n- /three.tf A reduction from the adjusted base year /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/eight.tf.\n- /four.tf Primary source of emissions: upstream GHG emissions from new assets commissioned.\n- /five.tf Primary source of emissions: regular power sales.\n- /six.tf Primary source of emissions: natural gas sales.\n- /seven.tf Excludes scope /three.tf emissions from use of sold products (natural gas sales).",

With a satisfaction and motivation score of /seven.tf/six.tf in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, we were above our external survey provider's benchmark but below our target of being in the top /one.tf/zero.tf % compared to our benchmark peer group.\n\nOur total recordable injury rate (TRIR) increased from /three.tf./zero.tf in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf to /three.tf./one.tf in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf. The increase was driven by an increased amount of TRIs among contractor employees, partly offset by a reduction in TRIs from our own employees. Total hours worked was at the same level in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf as in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf. As part of our efforts to improve safety, dedicated TRIR reduction plans have been implemented in /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, including increased leadership involvement and leadership interventions, safety stand-downs, and targeted safety campaigns on specific issues.\n\n## Governance\n\nOur employees and other associates may report serious offences, such as cases of bribery, fraud, and other inappropriate or illegal conduct, to our whistle-blower scheme or through our management system.\n\nIn /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf, eight substantiated cases of inappropriate or unlawful behaviour were reported through our whistle-blower scheme. Six cases related to violations of our 'Good business conduct policy', while one case concerned IT security, and one case concerned workplace environment. None of the reported cases were critical to our business, nor caused adjustments to our financial results. One case required a police report.\n\n- /one.tf Our target is to have an employee satisfaction survey result in the top ten percentile compared to an external benchmark group.",

Goodwill has also been excluded.\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned OPEX\n\nThe share of our taxonomy-aligned OPEX is calculated as the OPEX related to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities as a proportion of our OPEX that is included in 'Other external expenses' (see p. /seven.tf/one.tf).\n\nWe have chosen to use 'Other external expenses' as this is currently the best-available OPEX number in our Group financial accounts that is related to the OPEX KPI definition in the regulation.\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned EBITDA (voluntary)\n\nThis is a voluntary disclosure. The share of our taxonomy -aligned EBITDA is calculated as the EBITDA derived from products or services associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities as a proportion of our total EBITDA (see p. /seven.tf/one.tf).\n\nWe have included taxonomy-aligned EBITDA as a voluntary disclosure as EBITDA better reflects our business than revenue. This is because we have an uneven margin on our revenue, where our gas business and sale of power to end customers have a large revenue but a small earnings margin, whilst other areas have a higher margin.\n\n## Business drivers\n\n## Installed renewable capacity\n\nThe installed renewable capacity is calculated as renewable gross capacity installed by \u00d8rsted accumulated over time. We include all capacities after commercial operation date (COD) has been reached, and where we had an ownership share and an EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) role in the project. Capacities from acquisitions are added to the installed capacity. For installed renewable thermal capacity, we use the heat capacity as heat is the primary outcome of thermal energy generation, and as bioconversions of the combined heat and power plants are driven by heat contracts.\n\n## Decided (FID'ed) renewable capacity\n\nDecided (FID'ed) capacity is renewable capacity where a final investment decision (FID) has been made.\n\n## Awarded and contracted renewable capacity\n\nThe awarded renewable capacity is based on the capacities which have been awarded to \u00d8rsted in auctions and tenders. The contracted capacity is the capacity for which \u00d8rsted has signed a contract or power purchase agreement (PPA) concerning a new renewable energy plant. We include the full capacity if more than /five.tf/zero.tf % of PPAs or offtake are secured. Acquired projects with pre-FID capacity are also included in the awarded and contracted renewable capacity.\n\n## Heat and power generation\n\nPower generation from wind and solar farms is determined as generation sold. The offshore wind farms Gunfleet Sands /one.tf & /two.tf and Walney /one.tf & /two.tf have been consolidated according to ownership interest. Other wind farms, solar farms, and CHP plants have been financially consolidated.\n\nThermal power generation is determined as net generation sold, based on settlements from the official Danish production database. Data for generation from foreign facilities is provided by the operators.\n\nHeat (including steam) generation is  measured as net output sold to heat customers.\n\n## Power generation capacity\n\nPower generation capacity for an offshore wind farm is calculated and included from the time when the individual wind turbine has passed a /two.tf/four.tf/zero.tf-hour test.\n\nThe offshore wind farms Gunfleet Sands /one.tf & /two.tf and Walney /one.tf & /two.tf have been consolidated according to ownership interest. Other wind farms have been financially consolidated.\n\n## Wind speeds\n\nWind speeds for the areas where \u00d8rsted's offshore and onshore wind farms are located are provided to \u00d8rsted by an external supplier. Wind speeds are weighted on the basis of the capacity of the individual wind farms and consolidated to an \u00d8rsted total for offshore and onshore, respectively. 'Normal wind speed' is a historical wind speed average (over a minimum /two.tf/zero.tf-year period).\n\n## Availability\n\nAvailability is calculated as the ratio of actual production to the possible production, which is the sum of lost production and actual production in a given period. The production-based availability (PBA) is impacted by grid and wind turbine outages, which are technical production losses. PBA is not impacted by marketrequested shutdowns and wind farm curtailments as these are due to external factors.\n\n## Load factor\n\nThe load factor is calculated as the ratio between actual generation over a period relative to potential generation, which is possible by continuously exploiting the maximum capacity over the same period. The load factor is commercially adjusted. This means that the offshore wind farm has been financially compensated by the transmission system operators when it is available for generation, but the output cannot be supplied to the grid due to maintenance or grid interruptions. New offshore wind turbines are included in the calculations of availability and load factor once they have passed a /two.tf/four.tf/zero.tf-hour test. Onshore wind turbines are included once they have passed commercial operation date (COD).\n\n## Degree days\n\nThe number of degree days expresses the difference between an average indoor temperature of /one.tf/seven.tf \u00b0C and the outside mean temperature for a given period. It helps compare the heat demand for a given year with a normal year.\n\n## Sales\n\nSales of gas and power are calculated as physical sales to retail customers, wholesale customers, and exchanges. Sales are based on readings from \u00d8rsted's trading systems. Internal sales to our CHP plants are not included in the statement.\n\n## Environment\n\n## Green share of energy generation\n\nThe green (renewable energy) share of our heat and power generation is calculated on the basis of the energy sources used and the energy generated at the different assets.\n\nFor combined heat and power (CHP) plants, the share of the specific fuel (e.g. sustainable biomass) is calculated relative to the total fuel consumption for a given plant or unit within a given time period. The specific fuel share is then multiplied by the total heat and power generation for the specific plant or unit in the specific period. The result is the fuel-based generation for the individual unit, for example the sustainable biomass-based generation of heat and power from the CHP plant unit within a given time period.\n\nThe percentage shares of the individual energy sources are calculated by dividing the generation from the individual energy source by the total generation.\n\nThe following energy sources and fuels are considered to be renewable energy: wind, solar PV, sustainable biomass, biogas, and power sourced with renewable energy certificates. The following energy sources are considered to be fossil energy sources: coal, natural gas, and oil.\n\n## Green share of energy generation, Bioenergy & Other\n\nThis is calculated as the green share of heat and power generation, but is only shown for the business unit Bioenergy & Other.",

        "page_content": "## Greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity\n\nGHG intensity (scope /one.tf and /two.tf) is calculated as total scope /one.tf and scope /two.tf (market-based) emissions divided by total heat and power generation, revenue, and EBITDA, respectively.\n\nGHG intensity (scope /one.tf, /two.tf, and /three.tf) is calculated as total scope /one.tf, scope /two.tf (market-based), and scope /three.tf (excluding natural gas sales) emissions divided by total heat and power generation.\n\n## Scope /one.tf and /two.tf greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n\nScope /one.tf and /two.tf GHG emissions are calculated based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\nScope /one.tf GHG emissions include all direct emissions of greenhouse gases from \u00d8rsted: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulphur hexafluoride. The direct carbon emissions from the combined heat and power plants are determined on the basis of the fuel quantities used in accordance with the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions outside the EU ETS scheme are, for the most part, calculated as energy consumption multiplied by emission factors.\n\nScope /two.tf GHG emissions include the indirect GHG emissions from the generation of power, heat, and steam purchased and consumed by \u00d8rsted. Scope /two.tf emissions are primarily calculated as the power volumes purchased multiplied by  country-specific emission factors. Location-based emissions are calculated based on average emission factors for each country, whereas market-based emissions take the renewable power purchased into account and assume that the regular power is delivered as residual power where the renewable part has been taken out.\n\n## Scope /three.tf greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n\nScope /three.tf GHG emissions are reported based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which divides the scope /three.tf inventory into /one.tf/five.tf sub-categories.\n\nGHG emissions from capital goods include  upstream GHG emissions from acquired and installed wind and solar farms in the month when the wind or solar farm has reached commercial operation date (COD). Carbon emissions are included from cradle to operations.\n\nGHG emissions from fuel- and energy-related activities are calculated based on actual fuel consumption and power sales, multiplied by relevant emission factors. We include all power sales to end  customers and use separate emission factors for green (with renewable certificates) and regular (without renewable certificates) power sales.\n\nGHG emissions from use of sold products are calculated based on actual sales of gas to both end users and wholesalers as reported in our ESG consolidation system. The total gas sale is divided into natural gas, LNG, and biogas, which have specific upstream and downstream emission factors.\n\n## 'Other' includes GHG emissions from:\n\n- -   category /one.tf:  Purchased goods and services\n- -  category /four.tf:   Upstream transportation and distribution\n- -   category /five.tf:   Waste generated in operations\n- - category  /six.tf: Business  travel\n- - category  /seven.tf: Employee  commuting - category  /nine.tf: Downstream  transportation\n\nand distribution.\n\n## Social\n\n## Employees\n\nEmployee data is recognised based on records from the Group's ordinary registration systems. The number of employees is determined as the number of employees at the end of each month converted to full-time equivalents (FTEs). Employees who have been made redundant are recognised until the expiry of their notice period, regardless of whether they have been released from all or some of their duties during their notice period.\n\n'Gender with the lowest representation (female)' represents the gender  distribution of our senior directors and above, our people leaders, and the total workforce in \u00d8rsted.\n\n## Employee satisfaction\n\n\u00d8rsted conducts a comprehensive employee satisfaction survey once a year. With a few exceptions, all \u00d8rsted employees are invited to participate in the survey. The following employees are omitted from the survey results: employees who joined the company shortly before the employee satisfaction survey, employees who resigned shortly after the employee satisfaction survey, interns, consultants, advisers, and external temporary workers who do not have an employment contract with \u00d8rsted.\n\n## Safety\n\nOccupational injuries are calculated according to operational scope. Data from companies wholly or partly owned by \u00d8rsted and where \u00d8rsted is responsible for safety is included. Occupational injuries and lost-time injuries are calculated for both our own employees and our contractors. Data from all \u00d8rsted locations are recognised.\n\nThe total recordable injury rate (TRIR) is calculated as the number of total recordable injuries per one million hours worked. The number of hours worked is based on /one.tf,/six.tf/six.tf/seven.tf working hours annually per full-time employee and monthly records of the number of employees converted into full-time employees. For suppliers, the actual number of hours worked is recognised on the basis of data provided by the suppliers, access control systems at locations, or estimates.\n\nFatalities are the number of employees who lost their lives as a result of a work-related incident.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Board of Directors of \u00d8rsted A/S\n\nThe employee representatives on the Board of Directors are not included in the data for the Board of Directors.\n\n## Group Executive Team\n\nThe Group Executive Team consists of the Executive Board (our CEO, CFO, and Chief HR Officer) and eight additional members, who undertake the day-to-day management of \u00d8rsted.\n\n## Substantiated whistle-blower cases\n\n\u00d8rsted's whistle-blower hotline is available for internal and external reporting of suspected cases of inappropriate or illegal behaviour. Whistle-blower cases are received and handled by the Internal Audit function, which also receives similar reports through the management system and from compliance officers. All reports are managed in accordance with the guidelines for the handling of whistle-blower reports approved by the Audit & Risk Committee, which is ultimately responsible for the whistle-blower scheme. Only cases which are closed during the financial year, and which have been reported to the Audit & Risk Committee as fully or partially substantiated, are reported.\n\n## Cases transferred to the police\n\nCases transferred to the police are defined as the number of substantiated whistle-blower cases which have been transferred to the police.",

Basis of reporting\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Danish Financial Statements Act ('\u00c5rsregnskabsloven') (reporting class D).\n\nThe Danish Financial Statements Act allows us to use certain IFRS standards to interpret the act. Therefore, we have previously implemented IFRS 15 'Revenue' and IFRS 16 ' Leases'.\n\nThe accounting policies remain unchanged from the previous year.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK) rounded to the nearest million.\n\nThe parent company accounting policies are consistent with the accounting policies described for the consolidated financial statements, with the following exceptions.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nWe recognise exchange rate adjustments of receivables from and payables to subsidiaries as financial income and expenses in the income statement when the balances are accounted for as part of the total net investment in foreign enterprises. Likewise, we recognise foreign exchange gains and losses on loans and derivatives in the income statement as financial income and expenses\n\nwhen they have been entered into to hedge the net investment in the foreign enterprises.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRental income comprises income from commercial leases and is recognised over the term of the lease. Income from services is recognised when delivery has taken place.\n\n## Dividends from investments\n\nDividends from subsidiaries and associates are recognised in the income statement for the financial year in which the dividends are approved at the annual general meeting. If the dividends exceed the total income after takeover, the dividends are recognised as a reduction of the cost of the investment under assets.\n\n## Investments\n\nWe measure our investments in  subsidiaries and associates at cost. If there is any indication that the value of a company is lower than our future earnings in the company, impairment testing of the company is carried out as described in the consolidated financial statements. The carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount whenever the carrying amount exceeds the future earnings in the company (recoverable amount).\n\nIf we have a legal or constructive obligation to cover a deficit in subsidiaries and associates, we recognise a provision for this.\n\n## Tax\n\n\u00d8rsted A/S is taxed jointly with its Danish subsidiaries. The jointly taxed companies are part of joint taxation with the parent company as the management company.\n\nSubsidiaries are included in the joint taxation from the date they are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date on which they are no longer consolidated.\n\nCurrent tax for 2022 is recognised by the individual, jointly taxed companies.\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nWe do not prepare a separate statement of cash flows for the parent company. Reference is made to the consolidated statement of cash flows on pages 75-76.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\nIn connection with the preparation of the financial statements, a number of accounting estimates have been made that affect the profit (loss) and balance sheet. Estimates are regularly reassessed by the leadership team on the basis of historical experience and other relevant factors.\n\n## Impairment test\n\nIf there is any indication that the carrying amount is lower than our future earnings in a company, we test for impairment as described in the consolidated financial statements. The future earnings of the company (recoverable amount) are calculated based on assumptions concerning significant estimates.",

Significant judgements and estimates are required in determining the income taxes and in the measurement of income tax assets and liabilities, including uncertain tax positions.\n\nWe focused on this area because Management makes significant judgments and estimates when calculating and assessing the income taxes due to the complex nature of the tax rules related to the business activities conducted in different tax jurisdictions. Furthermore, Management makes estimates when measuring the tax assets, including when and to which extent these can be utilised in the future, and when measuring tax liabilities, including assessing deferred taxes in tax equity partnerships.\n\nAdditionally, \u00d8rsted is a party in tax and transfer pricing disputes where Management assesses the possible outcomes and consequently recognises provisions to cover for these uncertain tax positions. In /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf and /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf, \u00d8rsted received administrative decisions from the Danish Tax Agency entailing additional tax payables and related interests, which Management disputes and has appealed to the relevant authorities.\n\nOn this basis, income taxes were a matter of most significance in our audit.\n\nRefer to notes /one.tf./two.tf, /four.tf,/two.tf, and /four.tf./three.tf in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor income taxes, income tax assets, and  liabilities, we evaluated the assumptions applied by Management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes, including those related to tax equity partnerships, while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and external advisors.\n\nWe assessed Management's judgements and estimates of tax balances and carrying amounts as well as the related applied tax rates when calculating these. We also assessed the reasonableness of the main data and assumptions used to calculate the taxable income forecasts underlying the recognition and recoverability of the deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards.\n\nWe evaluated and tested \u00d8rsted's processes for recording, assessing, and continually reassessing provisions for uncertain tax positions.\n\nIn our audit of uncertain tax positions, we obtained and reviewed the correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax disputes and the related provisions. We assessed the measurement of the provisions and challenged the assumptions used, including the possibility of obtaining corresponding tax adjustments, compensations from partners, and the likelihood of different outcomes. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the tax disputes, and we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our audit of income taxes, we involved our tax specialists.",

We did not identify any material misstatement in Management's Review.\n\n## Management's responsibilities for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and  further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act and for the preparation of parent\n\ncompany financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of  accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a  guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -   identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control\n- -   obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control\n- -   evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management\n- -   evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management\n- -   conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern\n\nbasis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern\n\n- -   evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view\n- -   obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any",

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n## Report on compliance with the ESEF Regulation\n\nAs part of our audit of the Financial Statements, we performed procedures to express an opinion on whether the annual report of \u00d8rsted A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2022 with the filename Orsted-2022-12-31-en.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF Regulation), which includes requirements  related to the preparation\n\nof the annual report in XHTML format and iXBRL tagging of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including notes.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing an annual report that complies with the ESEF Regulation.

The nature, timing, and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in\n\nthe ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\n- -   testing whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format\n- -   obtaining an understanding of the company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process\n- -   evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including notes\n- -   evaluating the appropriateness of the company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified\n- -   evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF   taxonomy\n- -   reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of \u00d8rsted A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2022 with the file name Orsted-2022-12-31-en.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nHellerup, 1 February 2023\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab CVR No 3377 1231\n\n## Rasmus Friis J\u00f8rgensen\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne28705\n\nAnders Stig Lauritsen State Authorised Public Accountant\n\nmne32800",

Regarding reporting on Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, we are assuring that data have been stated in accordance with the applied accounting policies, not compliance with the EU regulation, since\n\nreporting requirements are still open to interpretations.\n\nWe express limited assurance in our conclusion.\n\n## Professional standards applied and level of assurance\n\nWe performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) 'Assurance Engagements  other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information' and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions, in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 'Assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements'. The quantification of greenhouse gas emissions is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine the emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gasses.\n\nA limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to\n\nthe assessed risks; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\n## Our independence and quality control\n\nWe have complied with the independence requirements and other ethical requirements in the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior, and ethical requirements applicable in Denmark.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, ISQM 1, which requires the firm to design, implement, and operate a system of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an independent multidisciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance.\n\n## Understanding reporting and measurement methodologies\n\nThe consolidated ESG statements need to be read and understood together with the accounting policies. The accounting policies used for the preparation of the consolidated ESG statements are the applied accounting policies developed by \u00d8rsted A/S, which Management is solely responsible for selecting and applying.\n\nThe absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure ESG data allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\n## Work performed\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the consolidated ESG statements. In doing so and based on our professional judgement, we:\n\n- -   made inquiries and conducted interviews with Group functions to assess consolidation processes, use of company-wide systems, and controls performed at Group level",

        "page_content": "|\n\nGlossary Availability Availability is calculated as the ratio of actual production to the possible production, which is the sum of lost production and actual production in a given period. The production-based availability (PBA) is impacted by grid and wind turbine outages, which are technical production losses. PBA is not impacted by market requested shutdowns and wind farm curtailments, as this is deemed not to be reflective of site performance, but due to external factors.\n\n## Avoided emissions\n\nThe amount other sources of energy would have emitted if we had not generated energy from renewable sources.\n\n## Awarded capacity\n\nOffshore capacity that we have been awarded in auctions and tenders, but where we have yet to sign a PPA and take final investment decision.\n\n## Blockage effect\n\nThe blockage effect arises from the wind slowing down as it approaches the wind turbines.\n\n## BSUoS tariffs\n\nCosts related to the day-to-day operation of the transmission system imposed on generators and suppliers.\n\n## Carbon emission allowances\n\nCarbon emission allowances subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).\n\n## CfD\n\nA contract for difference is a subsidy that guarantees the difference between the market reference price and the exercise price won.\n\n## CHP\n\nA combined heat and power plant (CHP) generates both heat and power in the same process.\n\n## Commissioning/COD\n\nWhen our assets are in oper ation, and the legal liability has been transferred from the supplier to us.\n\n## Contracted capacity\n\nOnshore capacity where we have signed PPAs covering more than /five.tf/zero.tf % of the asset's capacity, but where we have not yet taken final investment decision.\n\n## Decided (FID) and installed capacity\n\nInstalled generation capacity plus capacity for assets where a final investment decision has been made.\n\n## Degree days\n\nNumber of degrees in absolute figures in difference between the average temperature and the official Danish indoor temperature of /one.tf/seven.tf \u00b0C.\n\n## EPC\n\nEngineering, procurement, and construction. The part of our business which handles the construction and installation of assets.\n\n## FID\n\nFinal investment decision. When the Board of Directors approves major investments for construction assets.\n\n## Generation capacity\n\n\u00d8rsted's ownership of the asset. Offshore wind turbines are included when each turbine has passed the /two.tf/four.tf/zero.tf-hour test. Onshore capacities are included after COD of the entire asset.\n\n## Green certificates\n\nCertificate awarded to producers of environment-friendly power as a supplement to the market price of power in the given price area.\n\n## Green dark spread (GDS)\n\nRepresents the contribution margin per MWh of power generated at a coal-fired CHP plant with a given efficiency. It is determined as the difference between the market price of power and the cost of the coal (including associated freight costs) and carbon emission allowances used to generate the power.\n\n## Ineffective hedges\n\nWhen we hedge our exposure with an instrument that is not /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf % correlated with the exposure, we may see ineffectiveness in our hedging (i.e. results from such hedges should be recognised in the P&L immediately).\n\n## Installed capacity\n\nInstalled capacity where the asset has been completed and has passed a final test.\n\n## Investment tax credits (ITCs)\n\nFederal tax credit based on qualifying renewable investment costs.\n\n## Load factor\n\nThe ratio between the actual power generation in a given period relative to the potential generation which is possible by continuously exploiting the maximum capacity over the same period.\n\n## Offshore transmission assets\n\nConnect offshore generation to the onshore grid and typically include the offshore power transmission infrastructure, an onshore substation, and the electrical equipment relating to the operation of the substation.\n\n## O&M\n\nOperations and maintenance. The part of our  business that operates and maintains our assets after installation.\n\n## Overhedging\n\nWhen our hedged volumes are higher than our actual generation, we are overhedged. This is normally caused by lower wind speeds and lead to financial losses if market prices are above our hedged prices.\n\n## P/two.tfX\n\nRenewable hydrogen and e-fuels, collectively referred to as Power-to-X (P/two.tfX).\n\n## Partnership income\n\nIncome originating from our partners' purchase of ownership interests in the offshore wind farms. Includes both the gain in connection with the farm-down and the subsequent construction of the wind farm.\n\n## Power purchase agreement (PPA)\n\nAn agreement between us and a buyer/seller to purchase/sell the power we generate, which includes all commercial terms (price, delivery, volumes, etc.).\n\n## Production tax credit (PTC)\n\nFederal tax credit based on eligible power generation in the US.\n\n## ROCs\n\nRenewable obligation certificates issued by Ofgem in the UK to operators of accredited generating stations for the eligible renewable energy they generate. Operators can trade ROCs with other parties.\n\n## Tax equity\n\nAn arrangement where an investor obtains rights to federal tax credits and other tax attributes in exchange for a cash contribution.\n\n## TEC\n\nTransmission entry capacity (TEC) defines a generator's maximum contractual level of transmission access in MW.\n\n## TNUoS tariffs\n\nCosts related to the use of the transmission networks in the UK based on TEC.\n\n## TRIR\n\nIn addition to lost-time injuries, the total recordable injury rate (TRIR) also includes injuries where the injured person is able to perform restricted work the day after the accident as well as accidents where the injured person has received medical treatment.\n\n## Wake effect\n\nWake within wind farms and between  neighbouring wind farms. There is a wake after each wind  turbine where the wind slows down. As the wind flow  continues, the wake spreads, and the wind speed recovers.\n\n## Wind speed\n\nShows the wind speed at \u00d8rsted's wind farms. The wind measurements are weighted on the basis of our generation capacity and can be compared to a normal wind period.",
