        "page_content": "## We develop solutions for a world that is more digital, more electric, and more sustainable.' '\n\nJean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and CEO\n\nIt goes without saying: 2022 was another hugely challenging year for the world. On top of the lingering effects of the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and electronic and resource shortages of the preceding years, 2022 brought war, sanctions, soaring interest rates, inflation, and an energy and cost-of-living crisis that caused hardship for millions of people and weighed on economies around the world. And not to forget some of the worst climate-related events on record.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we, at Schneider Electric, deployed our people and resources across our geographic footprint to make a meaningful impact - both supporting the communities impacted by the immediate crises, and helping all our stakeholders to improve their efficiency, reach for their sustainability goals, digitize to be fit for the future and bolster their long-term resilience against future economic and environmental shocks.\n\nIt was another year in which we were true to our purpose: to empower all to make the most of our energy and resources, bridging progress and sustainability for all.\n\n## The inflection point: the new energy future is about to materialize\n\nWhile there's a lot to reflect on, it's best to focus on what this means for the future.\n\nThe root cause of both the climate crisis and the energy crisis is the same: an unsustainable energy model that relies heavily on carbondense energy sources like gas, coal and oil. In 2022, we saw the consequences of having put insufficient investment towards remodeling our energy system. Energy prices, aggravated by the war in Ukraine, soared to a point that choked the economy.\n\nWhat all this means is that we're at an inflection point. The twin crises of climate and energy has created a potential turning point in the way we generate, manage, and consume energy.\n\nThe medium-term aspiration of reaching carbon neutrality to fight climate change now fully aligns with the short-term objective of ensuring energy security and shielding economies from the volatility and pressure of energy prices.\n\nAccelerating the energy transition has never made more sense.\n\n## A year that reinforced our focus on digitization, electrification, and sustainability\n\nThe best way to make the energy transition a reality is to decarbonize the demand side of the energy equation - how we use and consume energy. Think about it: Net-zero buildings, homes or cities, cars powered by electricity, ultra-efficient industries. All these are less severely impacted by rising energy costs and energy supply constraints. And they contribute less to climate change.\n\nToo often, the debate focuses purely on how to shift energy supply away from fossil fuels and towards renewables. This is forgetting the most important part: energy transitions happen when we transition the demand side. So we must transition demand for technologies that benefit users, and the supply will follow.\n\nWe have the opportunity, today, to create a more energy-efficient world by combining:\n\n- 1.  Digitization that can save energy in homes, commercial and other buildings, infrastructure, data centers, and industry.\n- 2.  Greater electrification , on both the production and the consumption side. Electricity is much more efficient than the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars and heat pumps are clear examples of this. We don't appreciate enough that 60% of fossil fuels today are wasted in the process of conversion.\n- 3.  Decentralization of some of our energy production, via microgrids using on-site renewables.\n- 4.  Flexibility of energy supply and demand, via smart grids that allow us to optimize how we use or store energy.\n\nAt Schneider Electric we've spent the last 20 years building our expertise and portfolio in exactly those areas. We develop solutions for a world that is more digital, more electric, and more sustainable, helping our customers at every stage of their journey towards greater efficiency and resilience, wherever they are.\n\nEcoStruxure , our full IoT, plug-and-play, open, interoperable architecture and platform, covers everything from Connected Products to Edge Control, and Apps, Analytics and Services to meet the needs of customers.\n\nOur agnostic software and data portfolio provides the toolbox for customers to digitize their enterprise. By bringing together all of their data into an industrial format, we can build a full digital twin of their operations. This enables them to immerse their people in a comprehensive metaverse of their enterprise, deliver greater efficiency and costs savings, and increase safety, resilience and circularity. The recent acquisition of AVEVA allows us to bring these possibilities to our customers faster.\n\nOur services offer supports our customers across the lifecycle of their assets, from initial consultation to end-of-life and circularity.\n\nOur sustainability business supports customers with a fullservice consultancy offering, from strategy right through to digitization and decarbonization. It starts with measuring their carbon and energy footprint, then helping to reduce this footprint and bolster their energy resilience, including through sourcing the cheapest and greenest energy for their use.\n\nWhile the majority of our activity is focused on the demand side, we also provide solutions to decarbonize and improve the safety of the fossil fuel industry. Realistically, fossil fuels will remain a significant part of the energy mix for many years. At Schneider Electric, we therefore assist this industry in their journey to minimizing their carbon and methane footprint, and the impact on environment and society.",

        "page_content": "## A year that reinforced our strategy of having ESG at the core of everything we do\n\nBusiness drivers and performance are one side of the story. The other is non-financial performance: we don't see positive environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance as something that comes at the price of business performance.\n\nSince the early 2000s, we've put ESG principles at the heart of everything we do. Back then, we set ourselves ambitious goals around decarbonization, diversity and inclusion, social responsibility, among others. Since then, we've consistently dialed up those goals and commitments. They've helped us to expand into promising new markets, to innovate, to reduce waste and costs, recycle and save resources, and to attract and retain talent.\n\nToday, we are an 'Impact Company', striving to make a long-term positive impact across multiple dimensions on the planet and societies around us. The logic is simple: if you want to do well as a company, you must also do good - and vice versa. And we must bring everyone along on this journey.\n\nOver the course of 2022, we delivered some great achievements and received numerous awards and recognitions that attest to our performance on these fronts.\n\nFor more detail on all this, please read the overview that Gwenaelle Avice-Huet, our Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer, provides later on in this report.\n\n## A year that underlined the value of our unique multi-hub model and culture\n\nThroughout the turmoil of the past few years - and in 2022 in particular - our multi-hub set-up has stood us in good stead. Having four regional hubs -- in North America, Europe, China and India - has provided us with greater resilience amid constant change.\n\nOur teams are empowered to make decisions in light of the local situation, adapting and responding quickly to market opportunities and local circumstances. They do this while staying close to our customers, business partners and other stakeholders, and locating our factories and warehouses close to the points of sale, thus limiting the carbon footprint of our supply chains.\n\n## A year that highlighted that Great People really make Schneider a Great Company\n\nCrises or not, our colleagues in more than 100 countries around the world work with purpose, passion and commitment to support our customers, our communities, our business, and each other.\n\nI'm proud to say that's long been the case, as the numerous awards and recognitions we receive every year confirm. But 2022 truly highlighted this dedication.\n\nOur supply chain, sales and customer service teams navigated difficulties and worked hard to try to find solutions to the resource and delivery challenges that still haunted the world for much of 2022. Our factory workers in some countries volunteered to spend weeks inside their sites to ensure that mission-critical operations continued throughout the local lockdowns. And together, our people and company raised over \u20ac2 million for the Tomorrow Rising Ukraine Fund, which we set up to support Ukrainians at this very difficult time, and donated a range of electrical equipment, to help restore energy in the country.\n\n## A year of challenges - and of opportunity\n\nYes, 2022 was another year full of challenges for economies, companies and households the world over. But those very challenges are now coalescing to accelerate the transition we so urgently need.\n\nWe have the opportunity to create a new energy landscape -- one that is connected, smart, efficient, clean, sustainable, and more resilient to external shocks. And one that makes access to safe and reliable energy a reality for everyone.\n\nSchneider Electric is positioned right at the heart of these changes: our products, systems, services and software; our portfolio, people, and multi-hub set-up; and our commitments to making a positive impact on the planet and society. All these combine to make us a trusted partner and advisor for our customers as they navigate this journey towards the new energy future.\n\nAt our 2022 Fiscal results, I made the announcement that as of May 4 2023, Peter Herweck will become Chief Executive Officer of Schneider Electric and I will continue on as Chairman of the Board. After thirty-six years at Schneider, of which twenty were spent as Chief Executive or Operating Officer, I leave the role of CEO just as passionate about the business, people and customers as when I first began my career at this company.\n\nUnder Peter's leadership, a new chapter of Schneider Electric begins, building on the solid foundation that many have contributed to and created together these past two decades.\n\nI look forward to continuing this journey with Schneider as Chairman.\n\nJean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

'\n\n## What were the highlights of Schneider Electric's 2022 financial performance?\n\nWe delivered a strong operational performance in 2022 with a focus on execution, enabling us to reach record levels of revenues, adjusted EBITA and net income. We made good progress on our strategic initiatives of more products, more software and services and more sustainability which contributed to us recording +12.2% organic growth and reaching an all-time high EUR 34.2 billion in revenue. We improved our adjusted EBITA margin by +40 bps organic, reaching 17.6%, another record and representing more than EUR 6 billion in value. Net Income of EUR 3.5 billion increased by +9% from 2021 and was also an all-time high, despite losses of ~300M associated with our exit from Russia.\n\nThe Group saw good volume expansion year-on-year, with price actions also contributing strongly to growth. Supply chain pressures were evident throughout the year, with progressive easing through the second half, though some tightness related to the supply of electronic components remains. We faced significant inflationary headwinds in the year, from raw materials, freight and electronics, and labor costs, which we were able to offset through strong pricing. We continued to deliver on our structural savings and cost efficiency plan with savings of \u20ac203 million in 2022, taking us to a cumulative EUR 1 billion over a three-year period. We also prepared for the future, with an additional \u20ac547 million invested on our strategic priorities in 2022.\n\nWe delivered Free Cash Flow of EUR 3.3 billion, reflecting record operational cash flow EUR 5.3 billion, but working capital requirements continued to impact the free cash flow for the year, despite strong recovery in the second half, as the Group prioritized securing supply and delivery to customers in an overall strong demand environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, we also made good progress on our digital journey, with our Digital Flywheel now representing 53% of Group revenue, showing good progress towards a target of around 60% by 2025. Software & Services represented 18% of Group revenues in 2022, impacted by our transition to subscription at AVEVA and supply constraints in Services, but with acceleration expected in the next years as we drive our transformation to a hybrid-digital company. Within Software & Services, around 36% of related revenues were classed as recurring, showing strong progress towards a target of around 45% by 2025.\n\n## 2022 was a year of portfolio change, tell us more about it?\n\nWe are happy to have completed the transaction to acquire the entire share capital of AVEVA this year, which will allow us to accelerate on our software strategy and towards our ambition of a consistent 'Company of 25' (1) . We also completed our portfolio optimization program, disposing \u20ac1.7 billion of revenues since the start of the program, in 2019. Over the past four years we've made good progress on our portfolio evolution and are well positioned for the future.\n\n## What is the outlook for Schneider Electric in 2023?\n\nOur priority for 2023 is to continue to deliver sustainable growth, targeting organic growth in our adjusted EBITA within the range of between +12% to +16%.\n\nTo deliver this strong performance, the Group will use two levers: firstly, organic topline growth where the Group targets between +9% and +11% and, secondly, organic adjusted EBITA margin expansion of +50bps to +80bps.\n\n## How do you intend to drive shareholder returns in the next years?\n\nThe themes set out in our 2021 CMD are today more relevant than ever, and we are well positioned to benefit in the coming years from long-term secular trends set to drive growth across the endmarkets we serve. Our objective is to continue to generate strong earnings growth through a combination of top line growth and margin expansion supported by these long-term secular trends and accelerated by our strategy of more products, more software and services and more sustainability.\n\nWe retain a strong focus on shareholder returns, and we continue our track-record of proposing a progressive dividend for a 13 th consecutive year, increasing our proposed dividend by +9% to EUR 3.15 per share.\n\nI am confident, as CFO, that we have the portfolio, the technologies and the great people required to enable sustainable growth for years to come, elements which combine to allow us to offer attractive returns to our shareholders.\n\n## Hilary Maxson,\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n- (1)  sum of organic revenue growth % and adj.

        "page_content": "## Financial Performance Highlights\n\n2022 was a year of strong performance against a complex economic and geopolitical backdrop. We navigated the challenges faced with agility, taking the next step on our sustainable growth journey. Strong and dynamic market demand across most end-markets and segments enabled the Group set new record highs in Revenues, Adjusted EBITA and Net Income, while there was a strong recovery on Free Cash Flow in the second half of the year, supported by progressive easing in global supply chains.\n\n## Revenue Performance\n\nConsolidated revenue totaled EUR 34,176 million for the period ended December 31, 2022, up +12.2% organic and up +18.2% on a reported basis. Organic growth was driven by a continuation of strong and dynamic market demand in the majority of end-markets and segments served by the Group, supported by accelerating energy transition trends and recovery in late-cycle segments. Consumer-linked segments saw softness in some geographies in the second half of the year. The Group saw good volume expansion year-on-year, with price actions also contributing strongly to growth. Supply chain pressures were evident throughout the year, with progressive easing through the second half, though some tightness related to the supply of electronic components remains. Growth was impacted by the Group's withdrawal from Russia and the effects of COVID-19 infections and related lockdowns in China. FX impact was +5.7% primarily due to the strengthening of the USD against the EUR, while there was a net negative impact of -0.2% from acquisitions and disposals.\n\nEnergy Management generated revenues of EUR 26,442 million, equivalent to 77% of the Group's revenues and was up +12.9% organically. North America grew +18% organic with strong demand across all end-markets, including residential buildings. Western Europe was up +13% organic with double-digit growth in each of the five main economies of the region with continued good traction in Data Center & non-residential Buildings, though residential markets were impacted by pressures on consumer-spending. Asia-Pacific grew +9% organic impacted by the resurgence of COVID-19 and softer residential markets in China, but with strong growth across the rest of the region, notably in India. Rest of the World was up +10% organic with strong project execution in resource driven economies and despite headwinds from Russia prior to the Group's exit.\n\nIndustrial Automation generated revenues of EUR 7,734 million, equivalent to 23% of the Group's revenues and was up +9.5% organically. Growth was led by Discrete automation markets while sales into Process & Hybrid markets grew strongly, benefiting from recovery in resource driven economies. North America grew +10% organic led by performance in Discrete automation markets, while strong growth in Process & Hybrid markets was supported by execution on a project in Mexico. Western Europe was up +14% organic, with strong growth in Discrete automation markets, particularly in Italy, Spain and France. Asia Pacific was up +7% organic, impacted by the resurgence of COVID-19 in China, but with strong growth across the rest of the region, including in India and Japan. Rest of the World was up +8% organic despite headwinds from Russia prior to the Group's exit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Industrial Automation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNorth America\n\n8,994 M\u20ac (+17.8% org.)\n\n- Western Europe 6,223 M\u20ac (+13.1% org.)\n- Asia Pacific 7,773 M\u20ac (+9.0% org.)\n- Rest of the World 3,452 M\u20ac (+10.0% org.)\n\nNorth America\n\n1,992 M\u20ac (+10.5% org.)\n\n- Western Europe 2,081 M\u20ac (+13.6% org.)\n- Asia Pacific 2,568 M\u20ac (+6.5% org.)\n- Rest of the World 1,093 M\u20ac (+7.7% org.)\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Gross pricing on products was positive at +\u20ac1,818 million due to pricing actions taken throughout the year. In total, RMI was a headwind at -\u20ac470 million. Net price after taking into account freight, electronic components and other inflationary items in the supply chain was +\u20ac743 million.\n- \u00b7 Cost of Goods Sold inflation was -\u20ac197 million in 2022, of which the production labor cost and other cost inflation was -\u20ac123 million, and an increase in R&D in Cost of Goods Sold was -\u20ac74 million. The overall investment in R&D, including in support function costs continued to increase as expected and represented ~5% of 2022 revenue.\n- \u00b7 Support function costs increased organically by -\u20ac581 million, or +8.2% organic in 2022 but the Group was able to reduce the overall SFC to Sales ratio from 23.7% to 23.0%, improving by 90bps organic.\n\nThe Group continued to deliver on its structural savings and cost efficiency plan with savings of \u20ac203 million in 2022. The Group invested an additional \u20ac547 million on its strategic priorities in 2022 including R&D, digital and commercial footprint to support future growth.

Executive compensation set by the Board of Directors is aligned with the Group's global strategy and is based on three pillars divided into seven principles:\n\n## Pay for Performance\n\n- 1.  Prevalence of variable components: circa 80% for CEO (at target).\n- 2.  Performance is evaluated via economic and measurable criteria.\n\nAlignment with shareholders' interest\n\n- 4.  Significant proportion of the total compensation delivered in shares.\n- 5.  Performance conditions support Schneider Electric's strategic priorities and are aligned with shareholders' expectations.\n- 3.  Financial and Sustainability objectives are fairly balanced and distributed between short-term (annual variable compensation) and medium-term (long-term incentive) components.\n\nAligned with those principles, the compensation of the Corporate Officer is made of the following components: for the variable component of the compensation, the Board upon recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, chooses the performance conditions directly linked to the Group's priorities. The Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) which includes a climate target (see section 2.1.2 of the Universal Registration Document) is used as a criterion in the annual variable compensation of the Corporate Officer and that of the 64,000 employees benefiting from such compensation. In the same way, the Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI) is used for the long-term incentive plan granted to 3,000+ employees including the Corporate Officer.\n\n- (1)  LTIP granted during 2023 fiscal year valued in accordance with IFRS standards.\n- (2)  Between 0% and 200%.\n\n## Group's strategic priorities\n\n## How the strategy links to the corporate officers' variable compensation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Annual incentive plan\n\nDelivering strong execution and creating value for customers and shareholders every year to contribute to Schneider Electric's long-term success\n\nGroup organic sales growth\n\nGroup Adjusted EBITA margin improvement\n\nGroup cash conversion rate\n\nNet Satisfaction score\n\nSchneider Sustainability Impact\n\n35% 25% 10% 10% 20%\n\n## Long-term incentive plan\n\nBuilding an integrated and leading company with strong sustainability focus and attractive returns to shareholders\n\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share\n\nRelative Total Shareholder Return\n\nSchneider Sustainability External & Relative Index\n\n40%\n\n35%\n\n25%\n\nCompetitiveness\n\n- 6.

Convinced that its responsibility extends beyond compliance with local and international regulations, the Group is committed to doing business ethically, sustainably, and responsibly. Schneider's business actions and decisions run on trust.\n\n## Trust Charter, Schneider Electric's Code of Conduct\n\nSchneider Electric Trust Charter acts as the Group's Code of Conduct and demonstrates its commitment to ethics, safety, sustainability, quality, and cybersecurity. Schneider Electric believes that trust is a foundational value. It is earned. It serves as a compass, showing the true north in an ever more complex world and Schneider Electric considers it to be core to its environment, sustainability, and governance commitments.\n\nTrust powers all Schneider Electric's interactions with stakeholders and all relationships with customers, shareholders, employees, and the communities they serve, in a meaningful, inclusive, and positive way. It is implemented via the Ethics & Compliance program with responsibilities at Board, executive, corporate, and operational levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our Trust Charter on se.com and on page 110 of this report.\n\nAccess our Trust Line on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 achievements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemployees participated in the first Trust Month event.\n\n## Our Speak Up Mindset\n\nSchneider Electric employees must feel free and psychologically safe to share their ideas, opinions, and concerns, without fear of retaliation, this is the base of our Speak Up mindset. All stakeholders may report concerns either by contacting an appropriate person internally or by using the Trust Line, our whistleblowing system, which is available online globally, at all times, and protects the anonymity of the whistleblower.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of that Speak Up mindset and related whistleblowing system, the Group created two specific committees: the Group Operational Compliance Committee (GOCC) which detects and manages cases of non-compliance and reviews monthly the effectiveness of the system, and the Group Disciplinary Committee which levies sanctions and remediation actions on serious non-compliance cases to guarantee a fair and transparent disciplinary policy.\n\nAll employees are invited to express whether they are comfortable to 'report an instance of unethical conduct without fear' each year. In 2022, 82% of employees surveyed answered 'yes', a 1 pt progress vs 2021, on track with the group's 2025 ambition to raise its employee's confidence by 10 points (SSI #7).\n\n## Training and empowering all employees\n\nEvery year, a global campaign of mandatory trainings is run for all employees, called Schneider Essentials, and is available in 18 languages. In 2022, Schneider Essentials trainings were: Trust at Schneider Electric, Cybersecurity, We All Have Mental Health and The Schneider Electric Story. Other trainings are provided to specific businesses or service teams according to their roles and positions, such as anti-corruption.\n\nIn June 2022, a Trust Month was launched to further raise awareness among employees. This internal communication campaign has been a great medium to draw together all the pillars of Trust into a single event, which consisted of 15 keynotes, 70 webinars and gathered more than 15,000 webinar attendees.\n\n2\n\nNew policies have been published: the Decent Work and Philanthropy policies.\n\nEthisphere Institute - One of the 2022 World's Most Ethical Companies for the 12 th year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 97.5%\n\nof all employees completed the Schneider Essentials trainings.",

Since then, this vigilance plan has been continuously reinforced, aiming to expand further towards communities.\n\n## An end-to-end, risk-based mitigation plan\n\nThe Group's vigilance plan complies with the provisions of the 2017 French law on corporate duty of vigilance and includes:\n\n- \u00b7 A risk analysis specific to risks that Schneider Electric poses or may pose on its ecosystem and environment;\n- \u00b7 A review of the key actions implemented to remediate or mitigate these risks;\n- \u00b7 An alert system (Trust Line);\n- \u00b7 Governance specific to vigilance.\n\nIn this Registration document, Schneider Electric presents the results of the risk assessment, and the subsequent mitigation actions. A synthesis of key risks and actions is presented below.\n\nThe plan is governed by the Duty of Vigilance Committee, set up in 2017.

They are inextricably linked and require joint efforts and solutions to tackle them. Schneider Electric's climate and resources strategies converge to minimize its environmental footprint and to maximize the environmental benefits its offers bring.\n\n## Climate & Resources strategy\n\nUrgent action and a system-wide transformation are needed to deliver the enormous emissions cuts necessary to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With its climate programs, the Group aims to limit its carbon emissions by implementing its own Energy Management and Industrial Automation solutions and develop offers that will help its customers do the same.\n\nSchneider Electric was one of the first companies to have its Net-Zero targets validated by the most recent SBTi 'Corporate Net-Zero Standard' in August 2022. The Group is committed to be 'Net-Zero Ready' in its operations and to reduce by 25% its scope 3 emissions by 2030, and to be Net-Zero across its full value chain by 2050. In addition, as an intermediary milestone, by 2040, the\n\nCarbon neutral in our operations\n\n2025\n\n2030\n\n2040\n\n2050\n\nGroup will be carbon neutral along its full value chain. With its resource programs, the Group aims to minimize the volume of resources it needs and optimize the use of these resources. The current linear systems and existing infrastructure are not adequate to maintain, collect, and redistribute materials effectively for a global circular economy. As a result, waste, including plastics and e-waste pollutes our land, and the world continues to deplete the limited natural resources. Schneider Electric embraces circular economy principles all along the lifecycle of products and offers.\n\nThe keystone of Schneider's circularity approach is EcoDesign Way \u2122 , a process that is applied to the development of all new products. EcoDesign Way \u2122 enables the right trade-offs between the environmental impact along the lifecycle of products, allowing to co-ordinate the efforts over the whole value chain.\n\nCarbon neutral across our entire value chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2021 - 2025 initiatives to act for climate & preserve resources\n\n## Suppliers\n\nReduce CO 2 from suppliers operations\n\nImprove CO 2 efficiency in transportation\n\n|         | Operations                               |\n|---------|------------------------------------------|\n| SSE #1  | Transition to Zero-CO 2  sites           |\n| SSE #3  | Source renewable electricity             |\n| SSE #5  | Improve energy efficiency                |\n| SSE #7  | Switch to electrical vehicles            |\n| SSE #8  | Deploy local biodiversity programs       |\n| SSE #9  | Make waste a resource                    |\n| SSE #11 | Deploy water conservation   action plans |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof our primary and secondary packaging is free from single-use plastic and use recycled cardboard (vs 21% in 2021).\n\nSSI #1\n\nGrow our impact revenues\n\nSSI #2\n\nSSE #2\n\nSSE #6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPart of CDP Climate A List for the 12th year in a row.\n\nSave and avoid CO 2 emissions for customers\n\nSubstitute products using SF 6\n\nProduct revenues covered by Green Premium \u2122 eco-label\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n77\n\nZero-CO 2 sites helping us decarbonize our operations.\n\n## Customers/Society\n\nNet-zero CO 2 emissions across our entire value chain\n\n25% absolute reduction across our entire value chain and 'Net-zero ready' in our operations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSI #3\n\nSSE #4\n\nSSI #4\n\nUse green materials in our product\n\nSSI #5\n\nSwitch to sustainable packaging\n\nSSE #10 Avoid primary resource use\n\n## 2022 achievements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof our revenues are impact revenues (vs 71% in 2021).",

This means thinking about the world of tomorrow by empowering everyone, regardless of origin, gender, or socio-economic level to build a fair future for individuals and families worldwide.\n\n## Bringing access to green electricity\n\nToday, more than two billion people have little or no access to electricity, representing one in four of the world's population. At Schneider Electric, we believe that access to energy is both a fundamental right and a means for social and economic development. Specifically, access to green electricity offers a chance to live a better life, because it can have a positive multiplier effect on all socio-economic dimensions of the individual or community: livelihood, health, education, security, and empowerment of women, while fighting against climate change by replacing fossil solutions.\n\nWe call this Electricity for Life and Electricity for Livelihood.\n\n'Electricity for Life' means delivering access to green electricity as a fundamental right, answering to essential needs (such as lighting, social connection, or education) for off-grid households, small businesses, and the humanitarian sector.\n\n'Electricity for Livelihood' means delivering access to green electricity as a driver of economic development and poverty reduction for households connected to an unreliable grid, and for productive businesses, In fact, farms, schools, or health centers in rural areas, depend on an intermittent grid and need quality energy with back-up solutions based on solar energy.\n\nSchneider's Access to Energy solutions already benefited close to 40 million people between 2009 and 2022. Our ambition is to support a cumulative total of 50 million people by 2025, and 100 million by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 achievements\n\n## 41,000+\n\nvolunteering days since 2017 (+13,112 vs 2021).\n\n## 397,000+\n\nyoung people trained in energy related professions since 2009 (+ 69,505 vs 2021).\n\n## Empowering youth by education and entrepreneurship\n\nFor more than 20 years, training and entrepreneurship have been the historical mission of the Schneider Electric Foundation, under the aegis of Fondation de France. The Group's ambition is to train one million people by 2025 for energy-related professions. The Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program aims to give all young people the means to build solutions for a better life, contribute to a fairer, low carbon society, and transform the world.\n\nBy providing funding, our expertise, volunteering our time and collaborating with our partners on the ground, we are empowering younger generations and the broader community to achieve a better future through sustainable development.\n\nOur work is divided into three main areas:\n\n- 1. Support access to qualitative jobs through vocational and entrepreneurship training in the energy field.\n- 2. Learn new skills for the future, technical and soft, giving younger generations the boost they need to succeed and build the world of tomorrow.\n- 3. Create the right ecosystem to spread entrepreneurial spirit and encourage innovation, enhancing younger generations to define their future and take part in social and environmental challenges.\n\nTo do this, the Schneider Electric Foundation draws on a network of around 85 delegates across 80 countries. Their role is to select local partners in vocational training and entrepreneurship in the energy sector and to raise sustainability awareness. The Foundation also leverages its VolunteerIn organization to empower employees to be local actors and ambassadors of the Group's societal commitments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our social impact on page 224.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 40M\n\npeople connected to green electricity since 2009 (+5.5M in 2022).\n\n## \u20ac1.9M\n\nraised for the Tomorrow Rising Fund to support employees and their families in Ukraine.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The qualification process focuses on people, social responsibility, and environmental management. Sustainability criteria account for a significant part of the evaluation.\n- \u00b7 Has begun in 2021 a new five-year engagement with ambitious targets for each of the thematic areas:\n- - Climate action, addressed by The Zero Carbon Project (SSI #3), aiming to reduce operational emissions from 1,000 suppliers.\n- - Enhance Circular Supply Chain by increasing the use of Green Materials (SSI #4) and Sustainable Packaging (SSI #5)\n- - Uphold social commitment related to Conflict Minerals and Extended Minerals (cobalt and mica)\n- - Uphold human rights and inclusive workplaces by implementing best-in-class practices through the Decent Work program (SSI #6).\n\n## Holistic monitoring approach\n\nTo complete the Group's commitment to environmental and social topics, it established a transversal governance mechanism to proactively screen, identify and mitigate sustainability risk from suppliers and embed preventive controls into the procurement processes and integrate in the day-to-day operations.\n\nOn the one hand, strategic suppliers are subject to the Group's ambition to promote continuous improvement based on the ISO 26000 standard evaluation.\n\nOn the other hand, our Vigilance program aims at auditing 4,000 suppliers by 2025, identified as high risk suppliers.\n\nSuppliers can also report any corporate misconducts through the Trust Line, which will be thoroughly and confidentially investigated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 500+\n\nstrategic suppliers commited to provide Decent Work to their employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBest value chain engagement award from Ecovadis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nincrease of suppliers' ISO 26000 score vs 2021 (+9.2 pts since 2017).",

To do so, the Group relies on the highest standards of product quality and safety, as well as digital trust and security.\n\n## Green Premium TM offers\n\nIn 2008, Schneider Electric developed Green Premium TM , its product sustainability program, to provide transparent information on hazardous substances, environmental impact, and end-of-life instructions.\n\nThe new Green Premium TM is an expression of our innate belief that ambitious environmental considerations must be embedded in all our value propositions. It is also what customers and business partners have been increasingly asking for, in multiple geographies, across multiple market segments.\n\nThe new label encompasses three pillars: Trust, Transparency, and Performance. Trust means Schneider continuing to be transparent with customers, and going beyond regulations by applying the same rules regardless of the geographies. Transparency is the warranty from Schneider to disclose in a digital way the environmental impacts of its products, their end-of-life treatment, as well as any meaningful environment-related attribute for customers. Finally, performance is Schneider's commitment to deliver products with reduced environmental impact.\n\nToday, more than 80% of Schneider's product sales originate from Green Premium TM offers.\n\n## Strive for Premium Quality\n\nSchneider Electric's priority is to delight customers with an outstanding end-to-end experience. It is our ambition to earn the reputation as the safest supplier in our industry. This vision is built on trust: we are committed to ensuring the safest experiences for our customers and we believe it is the personal responsibility of every employee at Schneider. Safety is at the heart of innovation at Schneider. At Schneider, industry standards are not the goal - they are the baseline. We innovate beyond standards and believe that technology helps people work safer. Safety demands active engagement of all, without exception. We rise to new challenges. Moreover, to better fulfill customers' needs and improve their satisfaction, Schneider Electric relies increasingly on data analytics, and digital interlocks to secure a zero defect mindset at the core of our processes from design, to execution and services. The Group's commitment to quality and customer satisfaction is illustrated in its ambition to have zero product recalled from customers, by 2025.\n\n## 2022 achievements\n\n## 440M\n\ntonnes of CO 2 saved and avoided for customers since 2018 (+93M vs 2021).\n\nFrom 2022 we have introduced a Customer First Performance Criteria in the incentive goals for Group executives, measured with our Net Customer Satisfaction through real-time digital customer surveys covering six critical touchpoints as part of our customer operational interactions. All the results are available in the Customer Feedback Management Platform where all the employees are engaged to act on the Customer Experience.\n\n## Strive for Resiliency\n\nResiliency is the capacity to quickly recover from difficulty. We use a risk centric framework to reduce our exposure to technological, environmental, process, geopolitical, and health risks that might disrupt our business. Schneider Electric has standardized issue-escalation processes in place, as well as risk assessment and business impact analysis, and is prepared to manage any crisis with disaster recovery and business continuity plans, if needed. The Group's local leaders are empowered to assess risks, increase their preparedness and handle all types of crises with a rapid and effective response, thanks to processes and tools in place to support them.\n\n## Strive for trust in Cybersecurity, Data Privacy and Protection\n\nSchneider Electric's cybersecurity strategy encompasses people, processes, and technology across the operational lifecycle. By following globally recognized standards and complying with certified 'secure by design' development processes, the Group safeguards digital ecosystem and delivers secure offers, systems, solutions and services. The right to privacy and protection of personal information is a fundamental human right. Schneider considers fairness, transparency, data integrity, quality, security, and trust as core principles of how the way it handles data and uses it in the products, systems and services they deliver. In 2022, the Group was awarded Gold Medal for its first participation to the CyberVadis' assessment, underlining its commitment for cybersecurity. By leveraging digital technologies based on human centered design with a 'do no harm' oversight, solutions benefit customers' sustainable future.\n\n## 80.2%\n\nof our product revenue covered by Green Premium TM .\n\n24\n\nrecalled products from our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGold medalist during the first participation to CyberVadis.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Critical decarbonization measures are required to stay within a global warming trajectory of 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nThe year 2022 will go down in the history books as one of the most turbulent in decades. Against the backdrop of some of the worst climate-related events on record - extreme heatwaves across Europe, a dried-up Yangtze River in China, catastrophic flooding in Pakistan - economies and societies around the world also faced painful geopolitical turmoil, and an energy crisis that caused prices to soar and exposed dependencies on supply.\n\nThese events brought untold pain for millions around the world. But they also generated an opportunity we cannot afford to miss: to tackle the energy and the climate crises, hand-in-hand.\n\nBecause the root cause of these multiple crises - notably climate and energy - is the same, the solution is also the same: diversifying and decarbonizing energy sources and empowering all of us to better produce and manage the energy we need. The mediumterm objective of reaching carbon neutrality to fight climate change fully aligns with the short-term objective of energy security.\n\nSchneider Electric advocates deploying proven digital technologies for energy efficiency, and an increased focus on electrification and sustainability to urgently decarbonize buildings, transport, and industry.\n\nWe are at an inflection point.\n\n## Being part of the solution Technologies already exist to make our companies energy resilient and net-zero.\n\n70%\n\nCO 2 emissions can be removed using existing technologies.\n\nAs part of its ambition to deliver a more sustainable future, Schneider Electric uses technologies to help customers in many sectors to build net-zero pathways. Our research shows that 70% of emission reduction is achievable with existing, proven, and competitive technologies.\n\nEfforts must be done on both the demand and the supply side. And we need a major acceleration on the demand side of the energy equation.\n\nImp act of key transformations on decarbonisation (in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Save\n\n- \u00b7 Digitization as disrupter\n- \u00b7 Energy Efficiency\n- \u00b7 Process Efficiency\n- \u00b7 Circularity\n- \u00b7 Digital Twin & Metaverse\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n30%\n\n## Electrify\n\n- \u00b7 IT\n- \u00b7 EVs\n- \u00b7 Heat Pumps\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Decarbonize supply\n\n- \u00b7 Smart Grid\n- \u00b7 Microgrid\n- \u00b7 Renewables\n- \u00b7 Storage\n- \u00b7 VPP, aggregation, contract & demand management",

It's what we call 'Electricity 4.0':\n\n- \u00b7 Digitization creates resilience and builds a smart future: Data analytics and insights enable more agile, efficient operations and continuity, making the invisible visible. Digital Intelligence makes massive amounts of invisible energy waste visible\n- \u00b7 Electricity makes greener energy possible: Green energy production offers the best path for decarbonization\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. All Digital\n\nDigital defines new levels of efficiency. Today's digital economy is driving disruption across every sector, defining new levels of efficiency. While life is returning to pre-pandemic levels in places, many newly formed behaviors will not change (remote work, remote operations).\n\n- \u00b7 Expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) in industrial processes, driving an abundance of data: By 2030, the number of IoT devices will be six times that of 2020 growing from eight billion to 50 billion, resulting in an eight times increase in compute workloads (1) .\n- \u00b7 Growing need to aggregate exponential amounts of data: 11 billion smart appliances in one billion homes are expected to participate in interconnected electricity systems by 2040 (2) .\n- \u00b7 New business models with artificial intelligence, algorithms, and platforms that turn vast amounts of data into insights and value. It is estimated that 70% of new value created in the economy over the next decade will be based on digitallyenabled platform business models (3) .\n\n## 2. All Electric\n\nOn the second part of the equation, we have electrification, a key factor in accelerating towards decarbonization.\n\n## \u00b7 Climate change is an energy challenge:\n\n- - >80% of the world's CO 2 emissions are linked to the production of energy.\n- - >80% of energy demand is still delivered by fossil fuels.\n- - Fossil fuels have high efficiency losses, with almost twothirds of primary energy being lost during use, while renewable energy sources have much lower losses, only around 5% in transmission and distribution.\n- \u00b7 Regardless of source - electrification is going to profoundly change energy on both sides (usage and supply):\n- - Electrification of usage: Energy batteries are expected to provide up to five times more energy density by 2030 (4) .\n- - Electrification of supply: More renewables, with a variable capacity mix anticipated to reach up to 50% by 2040 (5) .\n\n## In reality, the equation of the future needs to be an equation for today.\n\nThe journey to net-zero is also a journey to energy security. Priorities are:\n\n- \u00b7 Efficiency through digitalization.\n- \u00b7 Decarbonization of all sources, with electrification/green electrification at the core.\n- \u00b7 Flexibility through grid stability.\n\nWe are running out of time, but it is not too late - we need the demand side to take charge.\n\n## Why these trends matter for Schneider Electric?\n\nSustainability is not just a part of Schneider Electric's business; sustainability is the core of our strategy. We integrate sustainability everywhere, in our model and culture, to have a strong impact at both a global and local level.\n\nWe see many of our customers stepping up their efforts and investments in sustainability.

Today's market-leading approaches require adaptive, integrated sourcing to help organizations respond strategically to risk, build resilience, and decarbonize their assets/ portfolios.\n\nMarket disruption and volatility are material risks for most businesses. The current energy crisis in Europe is a clear case. Unprecedented short-supply conditions have caused energy prices to hit historic levels, jeopardizing not only business profitability, but business viability as operations, budgets, and ancillary priorities, such as decarbonization goals, suffer.\n\nIn a recent study conducted by Schneider Electric, only about 50% of the corporate respondents felt they were 'considerably' or 'extremely' effective in managing energy commodity risk due to volatility.\n\nThis is surprising as companies that do proactively manage volatility often realize measurable benefits across numerous departments within their organizations.\n\nRate your organization's ability to manage energy price and energy supply volatility:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Integrated energy commodity risk management and sourcing at Schneider\n\nSchneider Electric's Sustainability Business helps our customers to meet their risk and sourcing challenges through a holistic and strategic approach which:\n\n- \u00b7 Addresses the risks associated with energy complexity, including resilience and reliability, geopolitical uncertainties, geographic/market barriers, and resource or capital constraints.\n- \u00b7 Leverages artificial intelligence (AI) technology combined with our industry-leading market expertise to approach sourcing solutions using a mind+machine strategy.\n- \u00b7 Harnesses the strength of Schneider's global risk & analytics, commodity management, and renewables teams to develop and deliver risk profiling, cost analysis, and strategic procurement recommendations.\n- \u00b7 Maximizes energy flexibility in the form of connected, optimized distributed energy resources and other cleaner, greener technologies.\n- \u00b7 Advances budget management, cost forecasting, and risk preparedness through EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor, giving customers greater insight and access to strategic sourcing recommendations.\n\nRead more about how Schneider Electric is switching to 100% renewable energy on page 161.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## An Adaptive Sourcing strategy evolves with disruptors to minimize complexity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This urgency has been reflected in the growth of corporate climate action and a surge in new legislation to increase corporate disclosures on climate risk. The combination is leading to a rapid uptake of sustainability among corporations, with more than 4,000 companies globally committing to a science-based decarbonization target.\n\nTransitioning energy sources remains the fastest path towards decarbonization since energy drives approximately two-thirds of global emissions today. As the demand for cleaner energy sources and climate action strategies have grown, so has Schneider Electric's Sustainability Business, which now serves 40% of Fortune 500 companies through a unique combination of strategic consulting and implementation services, paired with best-in-class digital solutions.\n\nOur differentiated value proposition is to support our customers on climate, from strategy setting to execution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Collaborating for climate action\n\n## Scope 3 emissions\n\nCDP estimates that an average of 11.4 times as many emissions can be found in the value chain than in corporate operations. This extensive category, classified as Scope 3 emissions by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, is also the most difficult to decarbonize.\n\nRecently, the Sustainability Business has partnered with clients including Walmart, PepsiCo, a group of 15 pharmaceutical companies (known as the Energize program), and Schneider's own Zero Carbon Project to reduce Scope 3 emissions, specifically within the supply chain.\n\n## Walmart Gigaton PPA program\n\nIn 2022, the first cohort under the Walmart Gigaton PPA program was announced. Consisting of five Walmart suppliers working together to go to market as an aggregated buyer's consortium, the cohort worked with consultants from Schneider Electric to procure a 12-year wind Power Purchase Agreement from Orsted's Sunflower Wind Farm, expected to generate approximately 250,000 megawatt-hours annually of new renewable power. The aggregated consortium model allowed the cohort participants to gain market access they could not achieve alone.\n\nStrategize: Define climate strategy to meet client ambitions. Decarbonization starts by quantifying environmental baselines and definining organizational ambitions. Our consultants help companies measure their emissions, set decarbonization targets, create a roadmap for action, structure their program and governance, and communicate on commitments.\n\nDigitize: Create a single-source-of-truth for energy, emissions, and resource data management. AI-powered EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor and award-winning PPA marketplace solutions NEO Network \u2122 and Zeigo \u2122 provide clients with the data they need to identify savings opportunities, make strategic decisions and take action on decarbonization.\n\nDecarbonize: Execute decarbonization strategy using four key levers: electrification of operations, reduction of energy use, replacement of energy source, and engagement of the whole value chain. Ultimately, decarbonization requires action. Schneider Electric's robust portfolio of end-to-end net-zero solutions supports clients in their pursuit of their energy and emission ambitions. Our global team of experts help customers deploy solutions to systematically achieve their decarbonization aspirations.\n\n## Energize program\n\nAt COP27, Schneider Electric announced that the first European and U.S. cohorts under the Energize program have also been formed and will go to market together. The cohort consists of nine companies, representing a potential aggregate of two terawatt-hours of electricity demand.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "An introduction by Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, Gwenaelle Avice-Huet\n\n## 'Companies that want to do well must also do good - and vice versa.'\n\nI stepped into my new role as Schneider Electric's Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer in the midst of what was one of the most tumultuous years in recent history.\n\nOn the environmental front, we saw extreme heatwaves, devastating droughts and floods, and reports of record-breaking biodiversity loss. On the economic and political fronts, we saw war and intensifying geopolitical tensions, lingering supply chain issues, soaring inflation, rising interest rates, debt distress and widespread energy and food insecurity, plunging many countries around the world into recession.\n\nAs the latest United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals Report remarked, 'these cascading and interlinked crises are putting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in grave danger'.\n\nIn this context, combining corporate strategy, quality and sustainability into one joint role, as we have done at Schneider Electric, makes more sense than ever. My combined remit aims to ensure that sustainability drives all corporate decision-making and generates maximum impact for both the company and our stakeholders, starting with quality which is good for customers and also for the environment.\n\nSo, in 2022, despite rising costs and increased political and economic uncertainty, we remained focused on accelerating the transition to a cleaner and fairer world with our long-standing strategy of providing digitalization, electrification, efficiency and sustainability solutions that tackle today's energy, climate and cost of living crises hand-in-hand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engaging in the pursuit of long-term positive impact\n\nAddressing these global challenges requires commitment and determination. At Schneider, we firmly believe that companies that want to do well must also do good - and vice versa.\n\nOur success reflects the significant investments and efforts we've made into sustainability and innovation over the past years. These have helped prepare us for a new energy future while also reinforcing our resilience to upheaval and disruption. As an Impact Company, we are committed to bringing everyone along, employees, customers and suppliers, and working more closely than ever with policy makers and local communities to make a difference.\n\n## Sustainability achievements to be proud of\n\nIn terms of climate commitments, we raised the bar by validating our decarbonization roadmap according to new Corporate Net-Zero Standards from the Science Based Targets initiative. We were one of the world's first companies to do so.\n\nAnd prominent, independent ESG rating providers recognized our leadership, with best-in-sector rankings from S&P Global, CDP, Moody's ESG Solutions, and Corporate Knights' Global 100.\n\nWe also made good progress on the zero-carbon journey that we began with our top 1,000 suppliers in 2021. So far, we've helped them reduce their operational CO 2 emissions by close to 10% and we're ready to accelerate this momentum towards our 50% reduction target for 2025.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation also played a vital role in sustaining our commitments to communities in need and to leaving no one behind. When the war broke out in Ukraine, our employees from around the world raised funds to help local colleagues and their families, while our Foundation worked to support refugees displaced by the conflict.\n\nWe continue to address the complex, systemic inequalities associated with energy poverty. Our technologies improve the lives and livelihoods of communities with little or no access to energy and our training initiatives are creating the skilled workforce required to support the growing energy needs of developing countries and close the energy access gap by 2030.\n\nI'm proud of what we achieved in 2022, but since attending the COP27 summit, I realize that much more remains to be done. I look forward to advancing on this at speed and scale by working together, building on our achievements, and delivering lasting and positive impact for the future.\n\nGwenaelle Avice-Huet, Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer",

        "page_content": "## 2.1  Sustainability for all\n\n## 2.1.1  Our strategic vision towards long-term positive impacts\n\n## The world is changing\n\nThe world is facing multiple challenges that require a significant and rapid response from business. The climate crisis is causing flooding and droughts that have already resulted in billions of dollars in damage and mass population migrations. It is jeopardizing access to basic needs and services such as health, food, water and energy for billions of people - generating further social inequalities. The biodiversity crisis, driven by changes in the usage of land and sea, direct exploitation of natural resources, pollution, climate change and invasive species will further destabilize our economies as the ecological services nature provides to an ever-growing population are degraded. Meanwhile, the digital revolution is completely changing the way people interact with one another, how we interact with machines, and the way machines interact with each other.\n\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the geopolitical crisis in Ukraine have also set in motion a series of global events which have led to significant disruptions, many of which have impacts across the world. These include constrained labor availability, global shortages of raw materials and electronics, unreliable transportation, and reductions in energy availability. Supply chains across industries have been challenged by these outcomes.\n\nNew expectations and practices have emerged to help the world adapt to, or mitigate the impacts of this disruption:\n\n- \u00b7 Local dynamics in response to ecological and social considerations as well as supply chain disruptions\n- \u00b7 The mobilization of new generations, demanding a radical shift towards a more sustainable economy\n- \u00b7 The flourishing of new environmental, social and governance regulations for both financial and non-financial undertakings\n- \u00b7 New ways of working, which are more flexible and more digital\n- \u00b7 Circular business models to preserve the planet's resources\n\n## Articulating our strategy around an Impact Company model\n\nWhile everybody - governments, NGOs, investors, and individual citizens - has an important role, companies can be crucial players.\n\nThey can be both developers and users of new solutions. They have the resources, talent, technology, and geographic footprint to make real and fast change and use it to drive sustainable financial performance.\n\nThe foundation of Schneider's sustainability strategy and Impact Company model is the belief that investing in the transition to a more sustainable future - in energy sobriety, gender equity or low carbon solutions - is about future-proofing the company. It drives the company's competitiveness, innovation and resilience. It secures sustainable growth because any company's health is deeply interconnected with the health of the environmental and social systems it evolves in. It encompasses continuous improvement of environmental, social, and ethical dimensions across an organization's entire value chain and stakeholders. This holistic approach allows the Group to greatly mitigate risks and also brings tangible added value by being more attractive to stakeholders, while boosting innovation.\n\nThe transformation of Schneider Electric reflects this. The adoption of an Impact Company model has seen the company triple in size, growing from \u20ac9 billion in 2003 to \u20ac34 billion in revenues in 2022. Schneider Electric products, software solutions and services help households, companies, buildings, data centers, infrastructure projects and entire industries make the most of their energy and resources and bolster their energy resilience. With its solutions, the Group plays a major role in accelerating the energy transition and fighting the climate crisis, while making a long-term positive impact on the planet and society.\n\n## Our purpose is to empower all to make the most of our energy and resources, bridging progress and sustainability for all.\n\nThis positive contribution is measured as Impact revenues, which represent close to 72% of the Group's total revenues in 2022. In addition, in order to further contribute to a new electric and digital world, 100% of Schneider Electric's innovation projects are aligned with its purpose, more than 90% being either strictly green or neutral. On this journey for a better planet, the Group is convinced that no one should be left behind, and businesses should operate a just transition.\n\nClimate change, biodiversity loss and rising inequalities, are all issues that have long-term consequences and cannot be addressed with a short-term mindset alone: solving these issues requires a combination of a long-term vision and concrete short-term action presented below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nObjectives of the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI), and Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE)\n\nProvide access to energy to 100 million people",

By tracking its sustainability performance and publishing quarterly results, Schneider Electric upholds its commitments to the SDGs and industry leadership in corporate social responsibility.\n\n## Our tools to measure progress\n\nThe execution of the Group's 2021 - 2025 sustainability strategy is tracked through quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs), under two complementary tools: the SSI and the Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE). Collectively, the SSI 11 Global Impacts and its Local Impact, as well as the 25 SSE programs, are the Group's short-term sustainability roadmap and our contribution to the 17 United Nations SDGs.\n\nThe SSI is the translation of our six long-term commitments into a selection of 11 highly transformative and innovative programs. The programs are tracked and published quarterly, audited annually, and linked to short-term incentive plans for more than 64,000 employees.\n\n## Act for a climate-positive world\n\nby continuously investing in and developing innovative solutions that deliver immediate and lasting decarbonization in line with our carbon pledge.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Create equal opportunities\n\nby ensuring all employees are uniquely valued in an inclusive environment to develop and contribute their best.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Empower local communities\n\nby promoting local initiatives and enabling individuals and partners to make sustainability a reality for all.\n\nThe SSE reflects continuous improvement actions taken by the Group, complementing the SSI. This tool brings balance between the innovative transformation plans of the SSI and the need to keep making progress with other long-lasting programs.\n\nA notable addition to the 2021-2025 program is the local aspect, aiming to deploy local actions in the 100+ markets where the Group operates in order to better empower all leaders and collaborators to unlock meaningful local impacts.\n\n## Long-term commitments and tools\n\n| Tool         | Schneider  Sustainability   Impact (SSI)   | Schneider  Sustainability  Essentials (SSE)   | Local Sustainability  Impact programs   (SSI #+1)   |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| KPIs         | 11                                         | 25                                            | ~200                                                |\n| Scope        | Global                                     | Global                                        | Local                                               |\n| Reporting    | Quarterly                                  | Annual                                        | Annual                                              |\n| Assurance    | Yes                                        | Yes                                           | No                                                  |\n| Link to STIP | Yes                                        | No                                            | No                                                  |\n\nRead more on the SSI and SSE programs on the next page and throughout the report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on the local commitments on www.se.com\n\n## Be efficient with resources\n\n## Live up to our principles of trust\n\nby behaving responsibly and making the most of digital technology to preserve our planet.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Harness the power of all generations\n\nby fostering learning, upskilling, and development for each generation, paving the way for the next.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nby upholding ourselves and all around us to high social, governance, and ethical standards.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 2.1  Sustainability for all\n\n## 2.1.2.1  The Schneider Sustainability Impact: a unique transformation tool\n\nSince 2005, Schneider Electric has measured its sustainability performance each quarter in a dashboard known as 'Schneider Sustainability Impact' (or SSI). Schneider uses this tool to address its sustainability challenges and to improve each of the pillars of its strategy identified through its materiality matrix. Each SSI mobilizes the whole company around holistic sustainability goals impacting its ecosystem, shares the Group's improvement plans with stakeholders, and create system value.\n\n## A single ESG performance score\n\nThe SSI provides an overall measure of the Group's progress on its sustainability goals on a scoring scale of 10. This is achieved by converting each KPI's performance on a 10-point scale, considering that base year performance receives a 3/10 score and the 2025 target translates to a 10/10 score. For each KPI, the relevant score is obtained by linear interpolation and rounded down to the second decimal. The overall score of the tool is the average of each KPI's score with equal weight excluding the local commitment (SSI #+1). As an exception, in 2022, SSI #6 is excluded from the score calculation, as 2022 constitutes the first measurement and baseline of the program. In 2022, the SSI achieved a great score of 4.91/10 (vs 3.92/10 in 2021), exceeding its 4.70/10 target for the year, and is well on track to achieve its 2025 ambition. The 2023 objective is keep accelerating and reach 6.00/10.\n\n## Transparent quarterly progress disclosure\n\nThe results of the SSI are published every quarter together with financial results and made available to all stakeholders via the Group's website. On these occasions, results are collated and presented to the Function Committee, which makes decisions on any corrective actions that may be necessary to reach objectives. The Human Resources & CSR Committee within the Board of Directors conducts an annual review of the Group's Sustainability strategy, analyzing, in particular, the performance of the SSI. The results are also publicly presented to shareholders by Schneider Electric's Chairman & CEO or CFO, demonstrating the Group's commitment to making sustainability part of the Company's long-term strategy.\n\nIn addition, the results of the SSI are released in various external reports (such as the Universal Registration Document including the statutory auditors' report), and are shared during customers and investors events. Internally the results are published on the intranet, and in various communications to employees (including a quarterly internal video featuring the CEO and the CFO on the quarter's results).\n\nFind all quarterly releases on the Financial Result page on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Annual publication and external assurance\n\nThe annual publication of the SSI results follows thorough internal data controls performed by each relevant team and supervised by the Sustainability team, as well as a complete 'limited' external assurance from an independent third-party verifier for all of the SSI and SSE indicators (except SSI #+1 and SSE #12), in accordance with ISAE 3000 assurance standard. Progressively, Schneider Electric aims to obtain a reasonable assurance level on the SSI. In 2022, the SSI #8 obtained a reasonable assurance level, as well as other energy, CO 2 and safety KPIs.\n\nSee Independent verifier's report on page 270.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Rewarding employees for performance\n\nSince 2011, the SSI score is included in the variable compensation of global functions and Company leaders. In France, since 2012, the SSI has also been included in the profit-sharing incentive plan for the French entities, Schneider Electric Industries and Schneider Electric France. From 2019, the weight of the SSI criteria has increased from 6% to 20% in the collective part of the annual short-term incentive, further highlighting the importance of sustainability on Schneider Electric's business agenda. In 2022, the SSI performance impacted the short-term incentive plans for 64,000 employees (20% of collective share), including the Executive Committee members and the CEO.\n\nRead further details in the 2.5.4. 'Compensation and benefits' section on page 218.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SSI and Sustainable Finance\n\nIn November 2020, Schneider Electric announced its first sustainability linked convertible bond, due 2026, for a nominal amount of approximately \u20ac650 million. This bond issuance is linked with three programs of the SSI 2021-25 (SSI #2, SSI #8 and SSI #11) a .In 2022, Schneider Electric signed \u20ac2.7 billion Syndicated Sustainable-linked Revolving Credit Facilities with a margin indexed on the annual performance of the SSI.\n\nMore information about debt and bonds on the Debt page on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SSI creation process\n\nThe SSI is a cyclical process taking place every 3 to 5 years. In 2020, a specific SSI Steering Committee was created, comprising around 50 members representing each Executive Committee member, each geography, function and business unit. Three all-hands workshops took place, and the sustainability team organized individual follow up interviews with each member to define precise and measurable programs.\n\nThe breadth of stakeholders involved in the design of the SSI, and the variety of analyses leveraged, makes it a powerful tool to move the Group forward on its major challenges.",

        "page_content": "Three scenarios may emerge from one SSI to the next:\n\n- \u00b7 Programs are maintained and their targets are renewed or increased\n- \u00b7 New and more innovative or better-adapted indicators are implemented;\n- \u00b7 Programs are removed; if for instance they have reached a threshold. Any former program may continue to be monitored internally if relevant.\n\nThe Sustainability department presents a draft version of the new SSI to the Human Resources & CSR Committee, which reports on its work to the Board of Directors, and to the Group Sustainability Committee (now 'Function Committee') for validation. This latter Committee includes six members of the Executive Committee: the Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer; Chief Human Resources Officer; Chief Global Supply Chain Officer; Chief Marketing Officer; Chief Governance Officer & Secretary General; and Chief Financial Officer. The new SSI is then approved by the CEO.\n\nDuring the deployment of the SSI, annual reviews take place organized by the sustainability team together with internal experts and new or complementary programs may be launched or be evaluated in more depth.\n\n## Notable SSI achievements and challenges in 2022\n\nSSI #2 delivered +93MTCO 2 e saved and avoided for customers, a net improvement compared to 2021 (+84MTCO 2 e), driven by good progress in Power Purchase Agreements services and Variable Speed Drives sales.\n\nThe Zero Carbon Project (SSI #3) recorded a 10% progress (vs 1% in 2021) thanks to the CO 2 emissions efficiencies achieved by close to 1,000 onboarded suppliers.\n\n45% of the Group's primary and secondary packaging is now free from single-use plastic, and uses only recycled cardboard, compared to 21% in 2021. This rapid progress was possible thanks to the mobilisation of all teams worldwide, and particularly in Pacific, India, North America and Europe.\n\nClose to 28% of Group leaders are now women, a 4 points increase since 2020, but women hiring remains at 41% and will be a focus for 2023.\n\nLastly, SSI #9 delivered access to green electricity to 5.5 million people in 2022 alone, thanks notably to the solarization of Health Centers in Greater India and the delivery to Investment Funds. It is 30.7% more than in 2021 where 4.2 million people benefited from these offers.\n\nSSI #6 was launched for the first year, with 59% of suppliers committing to join the program and 1.5% already meeting the Decent Work expectations set by Schneider Electric. This KPI is excluded from the calculation in 2022 as this year constitutes the baseline for this program.\n\nOne of the most challenging 2025 objectives will be to train 1 million people in energy management (SSI #11). Excellent progress was delivered in 2022 with close to 70,000 new people trained (vs more than 46,000 in 2021) but due to the delay caused by the pandemic, an acceleration will be needed in the coming years to reach the target. To achieve it, the Group will open trainings to more OECD countries and support new types of programs for the youth.\n\n## 2.1.2.2  Schneider Sustainability Essentials\n\nThe SSE reflects continuous improvement actions taken by the Group, complementing the SSI. This new tool brings balance between the innovative transformation plans of the SSI and the need to keep making progress with other long-lasting programs. All SSE KPIs are externally assured each year like for the SSI.\n\n## Notable SSE achievements and challenges in 2022\n\nCorporate vehicule fleet transformation (SSI #7) accelerated by 14 points in 2022 thanks to a strong performance in Europe and growing market maturity.\n\nSchneider committed to having 100% of its sites adopt local biodiversity conservation and restoration programs, and 100% of its sites in water-stressed areas to deploy a water conservation strategy and related action plan by 2025. In 2022, SSE #8 made good progress with 17% of sites putting biodiversity programs in place, as well as SSE #11 as 48% of sites have adopted and implemented water conservation action plans.\n\nSchneider upgraded SSE #15 to reflect better its ambition to eliminate recalls through the adoption and rigorous execution of a quality system consisting of the highest available standards.\n\nIn 2022, 880 new suppliers have been assesed under Schneider's 'Vigilance Program' in 2022, notably thanks to the increase of remote Vigilance assessments (SSE #17).\n\nSSE #23 was deployed in 2022 and recorded 43% of employees who had access to meaningful career development programs during later stages of their career.\n\nImproving CO 2 efficiency in transportation (SSE #4) is a challenge as it is primarily driven by the mode mix of the Group's aggregate freight globally, to best serve its customers.\n\nDeploying a 'Social Excellence' program through multiple tiers of suppliers is one of Schneider's 2021-25 objectives (SSE #12). This program is stilll in development.\n\n## 2.1.2.3  Local Sustainability Commitments\n\nA notable addition to the 2021-2025 program is the local aspect, aiming to deploy local actions in the 100+ markets where the Group operates in order to better empower all leaders and collaborators to unlock meaningful local impacts. 100% of Schneider Electric's Country and Zone Presidents have defined three local commitments that impact their communities in line with our sustainability transformations. Close to 200 local programs have been deployed in 2021.\n\nDiscover Schneider's local sustainability commitments on the Empower local communities page on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

In addition, SSI #8 received a 'reasonable' assurance level in 2022. Please refer to page 242 for the methodological presentation of each indicator. The 2022 performance is also discussed in more details in each section of this report.\n- (3) Per Schneider Electric definition and methodology. Note that for the reporting requirements under the European Taxonomy Regulation, please refer to pages 253 to 263.\n- (4) Calculation methodology for SSI #8 has been expanded in Q2 2022 to include blue collar managers in the scope of front line managers. Due to this methodological change, the 2020 baseline for front line managers has been recalculated to 23% instead of 25%.\n\nRead more about the SSI indicators methodology\n\non the pages 243 to 247.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Schneider Sustainability Impact and Essentials programs contribute to those global goals, either directly or indirectly and for all stakeholders in the company's value chain. Schneider Electric is an active promoter of the SDGs and a member of the UN Global Compact, notably with its CEO being a member of the global Board. The Group discloses each year its Communication on Progress and was one of the 850 participants in the UNGC Early Adopters program in 2022. The mapping of Schneider's contribution by SDG and stakeholder presented hereafter has been realized internally by reviewing in detail all 169 targets and leveraging the SDG Compass tools.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider Electric operates with the conviction that human wellbeing comes first.

Food is a basic need and a necessity for livelihood. Underserved populations are at the margin of society, and the Group knows we all have a part to play to protect their livelihood.\n\nKey programs SSI #9\n\nSchneider's commitment to prioritizing people everywhere necessitates taking a holistic view of well-being - physical, mental, social, and emotional - and to govern and develop programs that empower and support all its stakeholders.\n\nKey programs SSI #6; SSE #12; SSE #14; SSE #17\n\nSustainability goals go beyond creating a greener world. Learning never stops, and Schneider actively promotes a learning and teaching culture by connecting tomorrow's energy leaders with the education, support, and opportunities they deserve.\n\nKey programs SSI #10; SSI #11; SSE #2\n\nConsult Schneider Electric's commitments to SDGs on the sustainability page on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider Electric believes in closing gaps between all populations.

Even though the Group does not consume a lot of water, it protects this scarce resource through its production and provide solutions to its customers.\n\nKey programs SSE #6; SSE #11\n\nSchneider provides solutions for clean, reliable, and efficient energy consumption to its customers, and is committed to help people in underserved areas gain access to green and reliable electricity.\n\nKey programs SSI #1; SSI #2; SSI #3 SSI #9; SSE #1 SSE #3; SSE #5; SSE #6, SSE #7",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.5  Analysis of material risks, opportunities and impacts\n\n## Assessment principles\n\nEach year, Schneider Electric performs risks, opportunities and impact assessments, considering issues that can have direct positive or negative financial impacts for the company in the short-term (3 - 5 years), medium-term (5 - 10 years) or long-term (10 - 30 years), as well as impacts the company may have on people or the planet, directly or indirectly in its value chain.\n\nThe assessments rely on a panel of both internal and external tools, take into account stakeholders' expectations and are coordinated by different teams. In particular, the Strategy and Sustainability team, the Group Risk Management function and the Duty of Vigilance Committee play a key role. Other topic-specific committees exist that oversee the Group's strategy on those issues, such as the Carbon Committee, Human Resources Committee, or the Ethics Committee.\n\nKey internal tools include:\n\n- \u00b7 An internal and external stakeholder consultation (materiality assessment), focused on analyzing key stakeholders expectations, is performed prior to each Schneider Sustainability Impact program launch every three to five years (last exercise done in 2020). This assessment is described in the next pages of this chapter;\n- \u00b7 The Group risk matrix, led by the Group Risk Management function is updated every year and focuses on identifying the risks considered by the Group as specific to its business and identified as having the potential to affect its activity, its image, its financial situation, its results, or the achievement of its objectives. For more details about the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) please consult chapter 3, pages 244 to 319;\n- \u00b7 The Vigilance risks matrix, which is presented and described in chapter 2.2.10 'Vigilance Plan' page 133, focuses on the potential adverse impacts the Group may have on people or the planet, directly or indirectly in its value chain through its business relationships. A dedicated Vigilance report is available online.\n- \u00b7 Other specific risk mappings, for instance dedicated to Ethics & Compliance risks (including Anti-Corruption and Conflicts of Interest risks), Climate, Water and Biodiversity risks, supplier risk, cybersecurity risk etc, are done regularly.\n\nInternal tools are complemented with outside-in inputs:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulatory frameworks: for instance, the key topics listed under Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (ExtraFinancial Performance Declaration), the EU taxonomy or upcoming European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS);\n- \u00b7 International institutions and Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) and peer working groups and initiatives;\n- \u00b7 Analysis of Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) rating agencies expectations;\n- \u00b7 Specific requests from investors and customers;\n- \u00b7 Recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and various other frameworks (SASB, GRI, etc.).\n\nThe analysis covers the entire value chain of the Group and its stakeholders: suppliers and subcontractors, transactions, customers, as well as Schneider Electric's scope - extending to the activities at its Foundation - on cross-functional, environmental, social, and societal topics, human rights, and anti-corruption, with a double materiality approach.\n\nThe main identified risks, opportunities and impacts are quantified on probability of occurrence and magnitude of impact by the relevant departments to determine gross risks, and an assessment of current mitigation measures informs on potential net impacts. In this sustainability chapter, we present and discuss gross risks, and detail the mitigation actions implemented. Net risks are presented in Chapter 3, page 304, in accordance with 'Prospectus 3' requirements.\n\nOn this basis, the list of extra-financial risks is reviewed and validated annually by relevant Senior Vice Presidents, the Board of Directors' secretariat, Internal Audit team, Group Risk Management function and presented to the Human Resources & CSR Committee and to the Group Sustainability Committee at least every 3 years, in coherence with the SSI calendar.\n\nSix main risk categories were identified in 2022 and are presented in detail in the following pages:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainable Supply Chain\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity and data privacy\n- \u00b7 Responsible and attractive workplace\n- \u00b7 Ethical business conduct\n- \u00b7 Product, projects, system quality and offer reliability\n- \u00b7 Corporate governance\n\n## Creation of the SSI programs and targets leveraging the analysis\n\nThe Group sustainability team collates the various inputs to identify the strategic issues that need to be addressed. Every 3 to 5 years, the analysis leads to the creation of new programs under Schneider Sustainability Impact.\n\nFor each target and indicator composing the SSI, the ambition is defined in consultation with the departments concerned, and leveraging the various risks, opportunities and materiality analyses as described above as well as best practice benchmarks.\n\n## Zoom on the latest materiality analysis\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric built its third materiality matrix by questioning external stakeholders (such as customers, suppliers, international organizations, trade associations, experts and shareholders) and top and senior managers within the Group, including the Executive Committee. Nearly 200 stakeholders were consulted in total. The details of the analysis can be found in the Group's Universal Registration Document 2021 pages 76-77.\n\nOverall, stakeholders pointed to growing instability - whether environmental, social, political, or economic. This creates uncertainties for businesses, which should work on building resilience:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate is the main trend identified externally and internally. It includes the trend for energy transition and electrification, on which external stakeholders expect Schneider Electric to take the lead.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and the need for a just transition covering the Company's extended responsibility to its ecosystem, in particular in the supply chain, to ensure the low-carbon transition benefits all equally. Stakeholders also mentioned the growing expectations in providing ethical and sustainable products.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

This covers topics such as the power of data and the ethical use it requires, the potential opportunities and dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as people's well-being, or job security in a transitioning world.\n- \u00b7 Resource scarcity and circular economy featured very highly in terms of internal expectations.\n\nDuring the discussions, a number of matters were frequently mentioned:\n\n- 1. The vision of the Group, endorsing the link between sustainability and digital, is complex and not always easy to understand for non-experts. Schneider Electric could be pedagogic in its advocacy.\n\n- 2. There are high expectations for Schneider to become a globally recognized leader for a decarbonized world, with its products and solutions, and in terms of thought leadership.\n- 3. All topics are deemed important, reinforcing our holistic vision of sustainability. Issues were prioritized based on three groups:\n- - License to operate - fundamental 'must have' topics such as product quality and safety, and cybersecurity.\n- - Standard issues - topics which are on track, and on which Schneider Electric must remain mobilized (e.g., health and security, environmental excellence, corruption).\n- - Key transformational topics - those which have the potential to transform markets and differentiate Schneider Electric from others (e.g., climate change engagement, circular economy, human engagement).\n- 4. The SSI is a renowned and transformative program which is a source of pride internally, and recognition externally, but which needs a new lease of life: simplified, with increased internal buy-in and awareness.\n\n## Schneider Electric 2020 Materiality matrix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Top four expectations\n\nThe materiality matrix above displays the results of the analysis, which can be summarized in four megatrends:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.\n\nLeading climate action in our ecosystem with our partners.\n\n4.\n\nLeverage digital in cybersecure solutions to boost positive impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.\n\nPioneering circular economy and being efficient with resources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3.\n\nEnsuring a fair transition and guaranteeing high ethical, social, and environmental standards along more local value chains.",

Since 2014, the Group has benefited from a specific Human Resources & CSR Committee. This Committee meets at the initiative of its Chairperson or at the request of the Chairman & CEO. The agenda is drawn up by the Chairperson. The Committee meets at least three times a year (6 meetings in 2022). The Committee may seek advice from any person it feels will help it with its work.\n\nMain responsibilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Employee shareholding schemes and share allocation plans;\n- \u00b7 Compensation of Group managers;\n- \u00b7 Succession plan for key Group Executives;\n- \u00b7 Human resources;\n- \u00b7 CSR policy and results.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore details about the composition and activities of the Human Resources & CSR Committee are provided in Chapter 4, page 359.\n\n## The Function Committee\n\nIn 2022, the Group Sustainability Committee (created in 2010) became the Function Committee. The committee is composed of the Executive Committee members in charge of key Functions: Governance, Global Marketing, Human Resources, Strategy & Sustainability, Finance and Digital. The committee meets quarterly. In 2022, this committee met 4 times. The Committee may seek advice from any person it feels will help it with its work.\n\nMain responsibilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Decides the sustainability agenda;\n- \u00b7 Sounding board for Functions;\n- \u00b7 Escalation body for highly transversal programs, such as the Schneider Sustainability Impact;\n- \u00b7 Informs the Board Human Resources & CSR Committee.\n\n## The Stakeholder Committee\n\nIn order to reinforce its sustainability governance further with solid external insights, Schneider Electric created a Stakeholder Committee in 2021. The Committee comprises eight external members who share the Group's passion for sustainability, and its mission is to oversee the delivery of short-and long-term commitments undertaken by Schneider Electric in accordance with its Purpose and Sustainability strategy. The company strives to ensure diversity of the Stakeholder Committee members, in terms of origin, gender and experience. The Stakeholder Committee meets three times a year and is chaired by Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman & CEO of Schneider Electric, while Gwenaelle AviceHuet, the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer of Schneider Electric, acts as its secretary.\n\nMore details about the Stakeholder Committee are provided on page 37.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Coordination and monitoring\n\n## The Group Sustainability department\n\nThe Sustainability department, created in 2002, is part of the Strategy and Sustainability department. It has the following responsibilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric's sustainability strategy and rollout of action plans at Group level with relevant entities;\n- \u00b7 Central point of contact for internal and external stakeholders regarding sustainability at Schneider Electric.\n\nIt is organized around four areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Access to energy, with responsibility for the Access to Energy program;\n- \u00b7 Environment, with responsibility for deploying Group climate and environmental policies, actions and strategies;\n- \u00b7 Group performance, in particular by steering the Schneider Sustainability Impact, and external ESG reporting;\n- \u00b7 Sustainability Transformation, in particular driving the ENGAGE program.\n\n## Territory Sustainability Leaders\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric's Country and Zone Presidents worldwide made 200 local commitments that impact their communities, in line with the Group's six long-term commitments. To manage these programs and to better answer the needs of Schneider's local stakeholders, a new model for sustainability governance in the company was created with a network of about 40 Territory Sustainability Leaders. This new network meet every two months and works to further instill a culture of sustainability at every level of the company, to empower every employee to act, and to innovate with disruptive sustainability actions.\n\n## Diffusion\n\n## SSI and SSE pilots and sponsors\n\nThe execution of all Schneider Sustainability Impact and Schneider Sustainability Essentials programs is ensured by operational managers or 'pilots', and sponsors at SVP-level as well as Executive Committee level to ensure proper oversight and efficient program implementation.\n\n## Other key organizations\n\nSeveral further Committees and organizations drive progress on all pillars of the sustainability strategy, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Global Supply Chain organization, with responsibilities including safety and the environment;\n- \u00b7 Human Resources organization;\n- \u00b7 The Ethics & Compliance organization;\n- \u00b7 The Corporate Citizenship department and the Schneider Electric Foundation.",

This program has the ambition to make every employee an advocate for sustainability, thereby accelerating the Group's transformation and contribution to the UN SDGs.\n\nThe Sustainability School was launched in 2022. Each employee can choose learning paths and find tips to know how to act both in a personal and professional way. The training modules cover a large range of topics from the understanding of environmental and social challenges of our decade, to the detailed explanation of Schneider's Sustainability Strategy.\n\nThe ENGAGE program builds on other initiatives already underway:\n\n- \u00b7 the Sustainability Essentials training deployed for all employees,\n- \u00b7 the 'Act For Green' initiative, which aims at supporting all employees to pursue local environmental actions,\n- \u00b7 the UN World Environment Day on June 5th has been celebrated on all sites since 2014.

        "page_content": "## 2.1  Sustainability for all\n\n## Internal governance model\n\nInternal policies are the backbone of an organization's compliance and security program. They ensure employees understand how to implement critical tasks and meet behavior expectations. Regulators have made clear the need for effective policy development and management programs.\n\nIt is no longer enough to merely document the existence of policies and procedures. Organizations must be able to demonstrate that employees know, understand and apply them. To that end, Schneider Electric has established a four tier form of documentation pyramid of norms, under the umbrella of its Code of Conduct called the Trust Charter, strengthened by policies, standards, procedures and guidelines.\n\nPolicies consist of formal statements produced and supported by the leadership team, that state where the organization stands on important issues. Schneider has around 85 global policies. The Schneider Electric Global Policy Management Policy provides the rules to be followed for global policies.\n\nStandards defined in these internal policies assign quantifiable measures and define acceptable levels of quality. Procedures establish the proper steps to take to operationalize a policy and/or standard. Finally, guidelines provide additional guidance with a set of recommendations to clarify expectations of a given procedure.\n\n## Trust Charter\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric evolved its Principles of Responsibility to the Trust Charter, acting as its Code of Conduct and demonstrating its commitment to ethics, safety, sustainability, quality, and cybersecurity. It is an executive summary of our policies and a guide on how we work. It is available publicly on our website in 30 languages. Further details are provided on page 110.\n\nDiscover Schneider's Trust Charter\n\non www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Human rights & corporate citizenship\n\nSchneider Electric wrote a specific Human Rights Policy as part of a broader program on duty of vigilance in its value chain and in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (see page 124). The policy was updated in 2022.\n\n## Human resources and safety\n\nThe Group's Human Resources policies cover the following topics: diversity, equity and inclusion, health & well-being, safety, security and travel, employee engagement, family leave, anti-harassment, recruiting, international mobility, training, human capital development, talent identification, total remuneration, social benefits, and COVID-19. These apply to the Group and are accompanied by global processes.\n\n## Ethical business conduct\n\nIn addition to the Trust Charter, the Business Agents Policy specifies the rules to be followed when an external stakeholder is solicited to secure a deal and integrates the approval process of business agents. The Internal Fraud Investigation directive indicates the commitment to whistleblower protection. The Gifts & Hospitality Policy was approved by the Group's CEO in December 2015 and updated in 2021 before local deployment. It is supplemented by an anti-corruption Code of Conduct detailing related processes. Other policies cover social media management, competition law, conflict of interest, export control, etc.\n\n## Cybersecurity, data privacy and protection\n\nSchneider Electric developed a number of policies to reinforce its cybersecurity and respect personal data and privacy, such as IT asset management and usage, acceptable use of assets, general information security, data classification, global data privacy, user access management policy, email security policy, and many others.\n\n## Climate and resources\n\nSchneider Electric's environmental policy aims to improve industrial processes, reinforce product EcoDesign and incorporate Group customers' concerns about environmental protection by providing them with product and service solutions. It is bolstered by the Energy and Environment policies. These policies apply to the Group and are accompanied by global action plans.\n\n## Responsible sourcing\n\nIn 2016, Schneider Electric renewed the charter for its suppliers, called the Supplier Guide Book. It sets the Group's sustainability expectations in five areas: environment, fair and ethical business practices, sustainable purchasing, working conditions, and human rights. These requirements are detailed in a dedicated document called the Supplier Code of Conduct. In 2018, the Group adopted the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct for suppliers. In 2021, Schneider renewed its Supplier Code of Conduct whereby it requires all its suppliers to review their own operations, set ambitious targets, and initiate bold actions in the areas mentioned in this Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\n## Strive for high quality\n\nSchneider's priority is to satisfy its customers with outstanding end-to-end experience. Quality is every customer's right and every employee's responsibility. Experience is the most important for customers, defining the business relationships they sustain with suppliers and partners. The Group's customers place trust in its resilient, highly-personalized, multi-channel experience, and the superior quality of its products. Hence, the company acts with agility, discipline, and good business sense throughout the offer life cycle; from creation to supply, manufacturing, delivery, when in operation and when being serviced. The Group has deployed a specific Quality Directive 'Managing Customer Safety Risks' and a Quality Procedure 'Offer Safety Review' to protect its customers. These are supported by the Quality Management System, which is improved continuously. It is in full alignment with the Trust Charter and the ISO 9001 standard.",

These standards address environmental impacts throughout life cycles to prepare for a better circular economy, support the new energy landscape with the goal of greener energy integration, ensure safer energy delivery and better integration of prosumers, support the digital transformation of the industry and any other customer values.\n\n## At National level\n\nOur experts are involved in National Committees in US, China, India and European countries. The French Electrotechnical Institute is a founding member of CENELEC - European standardization body and IEC - International standardization body.\n\nSchneider Electric chairs many French standardization committees hosted by AFNOR (French standards organization) and sits on other national committees, such as the chair of the French and Swedish Committees for environmental standardization. Schneider was a major contributor to smart manufacturing initiatives such as the AIF (Alliance Industrie du Futur) in France. Notably, it is a member of the Council Board and of the IEC Conformity Assessment Board.\n\n## At European level\n\nCENELEC (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization), CEN (European Standardization Committee), and ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) are the three official European standardization bodies. They have been officially recognized by the European Union and by the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) as being responsible for developing and defining voluntary standards.\n\n## CENELEC\n\nCENELEC is an association that brings together the National Electrotechnical Committees of 34 European countries. CENELEC prepares voluntary standards in the electrotechnical field, which help facilitate trade between countries, create new markets, cut compliance costs and support the development of a Single European Market. CENELEC supports standardization activities in relation to a wide range of fields and sectors including: electromagnetic compatibility, accumulators, primary cells and primary batteries, insulated wire and cable, electrical equipment and apparatus, electronic, electromechanical and electrotechnical supplies, electric motors and transformers, lighting equipment and electric lamps, low voltage electrical installations material, electric vehicles railways, smart grid, smart metering, solar (photovoltaic) electricity systems, etc.\n\nMost Schneider Electric activities and offers are covered by CENELEC, although CEN and ETSI also benefit. In addition, Schneider Electric experts are participating in the development of common works and standards in specific joint technical committees and joint working groups.\n\n## At international level\n\n## IEC - International Electrotechnical Commission\n\nThe IEC is a global, not-for-profit membership organization that brings together more than 170 countries and coordinates the work of 20,000 experts globally. The IEC publishes around 10,000 IEC International Standards which together with conformity assessments provide the technical framework that allows governments to build national quality infrastructure and companies of all sizes to buy and sell consistently safe and reliable products in most countries of the world. IEC International Standards serve as the basis for risk and quality management and are used in testing and certification to verify that manufacturer promises are kept.\n\nOur experts contribute through joint technical committees and joint working groups to ISO and ITU.\n\n## Smart grids and sustainable cities\n\nSchneider Electric participates actively in the standardization of smart grids, for which it leads the definition of standards and the standardization roadmap within the European smart grids coordination group, as well as the group in charge of standardizing the interfaces between smart buildings and smart grids.\n\n- \u00b7 Schneider co-chairs the Smart Energy Grid coordination group of the CEN-CENELEC-ETSI responsible for ensuring availability of an appropriate set of standards for the rollout of smart grids in Europe, as well as supporting the coming new legislative 'Clean Energy Package'.\n- \u00b7 It chairs the group at the IEC level in charge of defining the roadmap of international standards to support the rollout of the Smart Energy sector (smart grids, in addition to interfaces with other energies). This roadmap also includes cybersecurity and resilience, as well as the impact of the IoT.\n- \u00b7 It chairs and actively contributes to the definition of prosumer's electrical installations, installations integrating local production such as PV, wind and storage to ensure they are designed and erected with a high level of safety and efficiency.\n- \u00b7 It chairs the IEC's Advisory Committee for Energy Efficiency (ACEE) and chairs the Advisory Committee on Safety (ACOS).\n\n## Circular economy and product environmental performance\n\nTo support high standards of health and safety, Schneider experts continuously contribute to standards around materials and substances. They provide standards on methodology and test methods, raising the bar on safety and protection against toxicity.\n\nRegarding environmental footprint, our experts ensure fair comparison, relevance of assumptions, consistency of approach, interoperability and meaningful content for our customers.",

Schneider continues to contribute to the evolution of those standards and their extended scope and has appointed active experts in each of the existing and new working groups. For example, our experts are highly involved in the development of the future standard on circular design: material efficiency within environmentally conscious design.\n\nAs digitalization is a lever for circular economy and environmental performance, our experts are contributing to standards on terminology and digital formats.\n\n## Standardization to accelerate environmental transformation\n\nSince February 2007, Schneider has represented France on the IEC's Advisory Committee for Environmental Aspects (ACEA). ACEA works to advise and coordinate the IEC's efforts to tackle environmental issues.\n\n- \u00b7 It is particularly heavily involved in the working groups on sustainability (chairing environment and circular economy groups, participating in working groups in product technical committees dealing with environmental aspects (IEC TC121, IEC TC17, CLC TC22X) and in the work on the rational use of energy.\n- \u00b7 It chairs the IEC TC111 Committee on Environmental standardization of Electric and Electronic Equipment and IEC TC 23 Electrical Accessories (protection devices, wiring devices, home and building control systems).\n- \u00b7 It is the secretary of IEC SC23K on Energy Efficiency Products, Systems and Solutions.\n- \u00b7 In 2018, it led the UPS manufacturers' group in the EU Commission's Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) pilots for defining rules to assess the PEF of products put on the EU market, prior to its implementation of the European policy.\n- \u00b7 It chairs ISO/TC 184 (Automation systems and integration).\n\n## Digital transformation\n\nDigitization is the key driver for advanced manufacturing, optimizing production with more flexibility, more interoperability, more predictability, and continuity to provide a new level of system efficiency and sustainability.

        "page_content": "## 2.1 Sustainability for all\n\n## 2.1.9 Measuring our contribution to a more sustainable world\n\nSchneider Electric has been an early adopter of transparent disclosures on sustainable revenues, and created its own methodology of 'Impact revenues' (1) in 2019, consolidating revenues from offers that bring environmental efficiency to its customers, while not generating any significant harmful impact to the environment, and excluding revenues from carbon intensive segments. Recently, the European Union (EU) has shown international leadership by being the first to develop a Regulation and Taxonomy aiming at driving investments towards environmentally sustainable activities, which the Group applauds. Both methodologies are somewhat aligned but currently differ in the scope of activities included, and in end-segments exclusions.\n\n## A purpose-led, Impact Company\n\nSchneider Electric's purpose is to empower all to make the most of our energy and resources, bridging progress and sustainability for all. Schneider's aim is to be our customers' digital partner of choice to help them realise their sustainability and efficiency ambitions.\n\nThe Group proposes an integrated offering of technologies and market-leading solutions tailored to customer needs, promoting the transition towards more electric, digital, decarbonized, and decentralized energy. Those active energy efficiency solutions which consist of optimizing the entire energy cycle using energy control products, systems, services, and software - help mitigate, adapt, and improve humanity's resilience to climate change.\n\nSchneider Electric quantifies this climate impact as part of its Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) program and is committed to help its customers save and avoid 800 million tonnes of CO 2 by 2025 (cumulatively since 2018). As of end 2022, the Group delivered 440 million tonnes of CO 2 e of this commitment. The methodology and results of this indicator are audited every year as part of the extra-financial audit.\n\n## Early-adopter of transparent disclosures on sustainable revenues\n\nFor more than fifteen years, Schneider Electric has led by example and transparently presented its sustainability performance to its stakeholders, across all environmental, social and governance topics and tried to develop new market practices, such as its saved and avoided CO 2 methodology or biodiversity footprint assessment.\n\nIn 2019, the Group was one of the first companies to proactively disclose information on the share of its revenue coming from offers that bring energy, climate, or resource efficiency to its customers, while not generating any significant harmful impact to the environment. Originally called 'Green Revenues' to match market standards, such sales were renamed 'Schneider Impact revenues' (1) to avoid any confusion with the new European Taxonomy coming into force. In 2021, the Group took a step further by committing that Schneider Impact revenues reach 80% of Group sales by 2025 as part of its SSI. It is worth noting that each year the performance of the SSI impacts short-term incentive plans for 64,000 employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Grow our Schneider Impact revenues to 80%\n\nSchneider Electric supported Live Nation's Cardiff Arena in improving operational efficiency and the situation of unplanned outages with MasterPact MTZ \u2122 solution.\n\nMasterPact MTZ \u2122 is a circuit breaker that trips and cuts off electricity supply to protect electrical circuits if there are overloads due to electricity overconsumption, short-circuits due to faults in electrical outlets or earth leakage where electricity flows to earth via unintended paths. It also makes maintenance easier by sending alerts to a smartphone app, which diagnoses problems quickly and avoids downtime. In doing so, MasterPact MTZ \u2122 provides energy management to identify potential savings due to overloads, unbalanced loads, helping users reduce energy and maintenance costs.\n\nLive Nation is now able to monitor the health and consumption of electrical equipment, receive proactive maintenance recommendations so they can make better data-backed OpEx decisions in their business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider Impact revenues can be split into four categories:\n\n- 1. Energy efficiency architectures bringing energy and/or resource efficiency to customers.\n- 2. Grid reinforcement and smart grid architectures contributing to electrification and decarbonization.\n- 3. Products with differentiating green performance, flagged thanks to our Green Premium \u2122 program.\n- 4. Services that bring benefits for circularity (prolonged asset lifetime and uptime, optimized maintenance operations, repair, and refurbish) and energy efficiency (maintenance to ensure the operational performance of equipment and avoid a decrease of energy efficiency over time).",

        "page_content": "Additionally, revenues derived from activities with fossil sectors and others are systematically excluded, such as oil & gas, coal mining, and fossil-power generation, in line with prevailing corporate responsibility reporting and sustainable finance practices, even though Schneider Electric's technologies deliver resource and carbon efficiency in such sectors as well. In line with Schneider Electric's strategy to phase out SF 6 from offers by 2025, SF 6 -containing switchgear for medium voltage applications are also excluded. Neutral technologies such as signaling, racks and enclosures, access control, or emergency lighting are excluded.\n\nBased on internal assessment, which covers all revenues of Schneider as published in the financial statements, the total share of Schneider Impact revenues is 72% in 2022 versus 70% in 2019.\n\nIn addition, to further contribute to a new electric and digital world, 100% of Schneider Electric's innovation projects are aligned with its purpose, more than 90% qualifying as impact innovation under Schneider's definition, or neutral. This concerns every innovation contributing to a decarbonized world, for instance energy and process efficiency, resource optimization, SF 6 -free projects, or Green Premium \u2122 offers. The methodology to calculate this figure is similar to the Schneider Impact Revenue methodology and should not be confused with OpEx and CapEx eligible under the EU Taxonomy.\n\n## Schneider Electric's support to the EU Taxonomy\n\nSchneider Electric has experienced both the value and the challenges of conducting a mapping of green business activities early on. The Group therefore welcomes the European Commission's work to define a common classification system for sustainable economic activities and believes that the taxonomy can bring greater transparency and reporting alignment among non-financial undertakings.\n\nThe Group is willing to share its experience in the measurement of revenues contributed to a sustainable world and works collaboratively and constructively with relevant stakeholders to advance the transition to a sustainable and low-carbon economy. In particular, Group experts have contributed to the Platform on Sustainable Finance, an expert group assisting the EU Commission in developing technical criteria.\n\n## Reporting requirements under the European Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe adoption of the Taxonomy Regulation (2) in 2020 establishes a European Union-wide classification system to identify economic activities that are considered as environmentally sustainable as part of the European Union's long-term plan to connect finance with its sustainability goals. Dedicated Delegated Acts (DA) specify (or will specify), for six identified environmental objectives, which activities are included in the EU taxonomy (eligibility), and the screening criteria to determine if they are indeed making a substantial contribution to at least one of the environmental objectives, while also Doing No Significant Harm (DNSH) to the remaining objectives and meeting minimum standards on human rights and labor standards (alignment).\n\nPursuant to Article 8 of the regulation and the delegated regulation published on 6 July 2021, the proportion of turnover, Capital Expendiiture (CapEx) and Operating Expenditure (OpEx) resulting from products or services associated with economic activities considered sustainable is due to be reported progressively over the fiscal years (FY) 2021 to 2024. In FY 2022, large undertakings are required to disclose those three Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for activities eligible and aligned to climate objectives according to the EU Climate Delegated Acts already published. Full reporting on alignment for all six objectives is expected in 2025 (on FY 2024).\n\nImportantly, the phased application of reporting requirements, as well as the evolving nature of the regulatory framework means that the KPIs disclosed in this report may evolve as the regulation and its reporting requirements do. To date, Delegated Acts have been published for only two environmental objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation) out of six. In addition, more activities may be incorporated into the existing EU Climate Delegated Acts in 2023. This means that more Schneider activities could be included in the EU Taxonomy reference framework gradually. For instance, this may concern Schneider's offers related to grid reinforcement and smart grid architectures contributing to electrification and decarbonization, products with differentiating green performance (flagged thanks to our Green Premium \u2122 program) or services that bring benefits for circularity and energy efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on our EU Taxonomy assessment methodology and the full list of activities eligible under the current EU Taxonomy pages 253 to 263.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned turnover\n\nSchneider Electric identified several business activities that are eligible (i.e. listed) according to the current EU Climate DA. We provide the list of those activities in our methodological notes on pages 254 and 255.\n\nAlignment of each activity has then been assessed against Technical Screening Criteria (TSC), Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) and minimum safeguards criteria with the Group's experts and with the support of external consultants. As a result, Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned turnovers amount to 29% and 20% respectively, representing EUR 9,775 million and EUR 6,934 million respectively out of EUR 34,176 million.\n\nThe difference between eligibility and alignment is first related to the Technical Screening Criteria (TSC) for Activity 4.9 (Transmission and distribution of electricity). Alignment with this TSC is dependent on the carbon intensity of the electricity supply in the country of sale and the type of power generation source being connected to the grid. 4% of the taxonomy-eligible revenues from this activity is made in countries (such as the USA and China) where the carbon intensity is above the threshold stipulated in the TSC, or contributing to connect to the grid a power generation source with carbon intensity above the threshold stipulated in the TSC, hence considered as not aligned.\n\nThe second reason for the difference comes from the generic criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention and control regarding use and presence of chemicals.\n\nAbout 1% of Schneider eligible revenues do not comply with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive and are therefore not aligned. In addition, the Taxonomy regulation stipulates that products using substances identified in the candidate list for eventual inclusion in the list of substances subject to authorization, Annex XIV of Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 are not aligned, except if they are considered of essential use. However, the concept of essential use has not yet been defined by the European Commission. Therefore, Schneider has taken a conservative approach and declared as non-aligned all revenues coming from such products, amounting to 3% of eligible revenues.\n\nAll other eligible activities comply with Technical Screening Criteria, do not cause any significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives and respect the minimum safeguards as specified in Annex 1 of the EU Climate Delegated Act.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about calculation method of Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned turnover pages 253 to 254.\n\nRead more about the DNSH checks performed page 255.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned CapEx and OpEx\n\nIn 2022, Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned CapEx amount to 54% and 27% respectively, representing EUR 854 million and EUR 419 million respectively out of EUR 1,573 million.\n\nTo compute the Group's Taxonomy-eligible and aligned capital expenditure, CapEx related to assets, processes and business combinations associated with Taxonomy-eligible and aligned activities were calculated using allocation keys of eligible, and respectively aligned, turnover per business and operations, except for Research and Development (R&D) CapEx and IFRS 16 long term leasing of buildings CapEx, which have been qualified through the prism of CapEx for eligible and aligned individual measures. Indeed, as described more exhaustively in section 2.3.4 'Investing to achieve the Group's climate strategy and vision ' , page 158, each and every R&D project of the Group demonstrating a substantial carbon footprint saving, CapEx associated to R&D projects are both Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned under the European Taxonomy activity 3.6 (Manufacture of low carbon technologies).\n\nThe difference between eligibility and alignment in turnover, as explained in the previous section, also applies to capital expenditure. In addition, the fact that capital expenditure based on IFRS 16, related to long-term leasing of buildings, is fully eligible but not aligned increases the difference between the Group's Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned CapEx.\n\nIn 2022, Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned OpEx amount to 50%, representing EUR 856 million out of EUR 1,716 million.\n\nTo determine the Group's European Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned operating expenditure, only non-capitalized costs related to Research and Development (R&D) are analyzed for the establishment of the numerator of the OpEx KPIs. This includes non-capitalized costs relative to R&D projects but also, among others, costs incurred in relation with support and platforming, costs of IT global applications dedicated to R&D, costs relative to continuous engineering costs for quality, productivity and obsolescence. As mentioned for CapEx, each R&D project of the Group demonstrating a substantial carbon footprint saving, the numerators of the KPIs correspond to operating expenditure directly associated to Group's R&D projects: these OpEx are both Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned under the European Taxonomy activity 3.6.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about calculation method of Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned capital and operating expenditures pages 254 to 255.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Building owners and facility managers need to think smarter to manage their buildings' electricity loads to accommodate this increased consumption.\n\nEcoStruxure \u2122 for eMobility (with EcoStruxure \u2122 EV Charging Expert as the edge control) is the solution to that challenge, enabling end-to-end EV smart charging solutions for an efficient, resilient and sustainable future all-electric mobility at homes, buildings, and infrastructures. This activity is qualified as 'Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport' (6.15) in the EU Climate DA.\n\nPowered by Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure \u2122 EV Charging Expert, the intelligent EV charging infrastructure ensures an optimized use of energy where the charging infrastructure owners or operators can monitor, control and maximize the EV charging more efficiently based on real-time available power in the property. By leveraging the existing power infrastructure and EcoStruxure \u2122 EV Charging Expert, more EV chargers can be installed to respond to an increase in demand without the need to increase the existing power capacity. The system can adapt and limit the load dedicated to EV charging installations, define on-peak and off-peak time-of-use periods to optimize EV charging and avoid facility disruption and operating losses. Schneider's EV chargers are Green Premium TM certified and recognized with the efficient use of energy and natural resources, optimization of the total cost of ownership of customers' assets, regulatory compliance and strong value propositions through third-party labels and services.\n\nSchneider Electric is actively promoting the development of EVs with more than 150,000 EV chargers sold in 50 countries. For example, in Hong Kong, Schneider Electric recently leveraged its strategic partnership with Sino Group and expanded its network with another 420+ EV chargers - in addition to 1,700+ EV chargers already installed in 53 locations there - at Grand Central and the adjacent YM2, the new landmark in Kowloon East, making it the largest EV charging site at a composite / residential new development in Hong Kong.\n\nThrough close collaborations with all stakeholders, Schneider aims to further boost EV charging network by offering 15,000 EV chargers across the territory in 2025, with the hope of bringing more convenience to the EV community and making the city more sustainable.\n\n40%\n\nmore energy will be required.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEV chargers sold in 50 countries since 2018.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Therefore, after creating the Trust Charter in 2021, it was time for Schneider to deploy its new Code of Conduct.\n\nPresent in over 100 countries with diverse standards, values, and practices, Schneider Electric is committed to behaving responsibly in relation to all its stakeholders. Recognizing that its responsibility extends beyond compliance with local and international regulations, the Group is engaged to doing business ethically, sustainably, and responsibly. At Schneider Electric, we believe that trust is earned and starts with walking the talk, in relying on mechanisms and not only intentions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider lives up to the highest standards of corporate governance, through initiatives that monitor and educate teams on ethics, cybersecurity, safety, and quality. The Trust Charter is the evolution of the Group's Principles of Responsibility and sets out the expectations of how we work at Schneider, and it equips teams to confront any unethical behavior they might encounter.\n\nUnder our 2025 Sustainability Strategy, we commit to live up to our principles of trust by holding ourselves and all around us to high social, governance and ethical standards. In this report, we share our progress on the transformations achieved in 2022 under the Trust pillar of our Schneider Sustainability Impact and Schneider Sustainability Essentials programs.\n\n'As business risks become more interconnected and unpredictable, building resilience is top of mind: even with the best risk management systems in place, setbacks are bound to occur. Therefore, it is key for companies to rely on clear frameworks such as the Trust Charter - our Schneider Electric Code of Conduct - to earn and nurture trust with our stakeholders.'\n\nHerv\u00e9 Coureil, Chief Governance Officer and Secretary General",

Trust is evident in the following ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Trusted Teams that are built thanks to leaders setting the tone and exemplifying Schneider Electric's culture, as well as through creating for all our employees equal opportunities, harnessing the power of all generations, championing well-being and new ways of working, and being S.A.F.E. (Self, Activity, Facility, Environment) First;\n- \u00b7 Trust with Customers and Partners is earned by striving for high quality, resiliency, the highest standards for cybersecurity, data privacy and protection, as well as prohibiting any form of corruption, requiring third-party integrity, avoiding conflict of interest, upholding fair competition, abiding by export controls and sanctions, and selecting and managing suppliers responsibly;\n- \u00b7 Trust with Investors comes from preventing insider trading, delivering accurate financial statements, records, and tax information, delivering solutions in compliance with financial and risk management standards, and preserving information technology and related intellectual property assets as well as Schneider Electric's reputation;\n- \u00b7 Trust with Communities is possible by acting for a climate positive world, being efficient with resources, upholding responsible lobbying and political activity, empowering local communities, not using 'conflict minerals', and acting as good corporate citizens.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.1.2 Trust Charter\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric launched the Trust Charter, which acts as the Group's Code of Conduct and demonstrates its commitment to ethics , safety , sustainability , quality , and cybersecurity . Schneider Electric believes that trust is a foundational value. It is earned and serves as a compass, signaling true north in an ever more complex world, and Schneider Electric therefore considers trust to be core to its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments.\n\nLeadership at every level of the organization was involved in the design, creation, and deployment of the Trust Charter to ensure that everyone at Schneider Electric is aware of the importance of trust and understands how to get the most out of the Group's Code of Conduct.\n\nAs trust fuels empowerment, each section of the charter states clear Dos and Don'ts and provides clear references to relevant policies and procedures, which are adapted to meet local legal requirements when necessary. This Code of Conduct applies to everyone working at Schneider or any of Schneider's subsidiaries. It is both an individual and collective responsibility to comply and respect laws and regulations, to apply Schneider Electric policies, and to uphold strong ethical principles to earn trust at all times.\n\n## 2.2.1.3  Deployment of the Trust Charter\n\nIn addition to the Trust Charter being available in 30 languages on Schneider's website (se.com), a Trust Portal was made available to Schneider's employees to guide them towards related content such as policies, useful contacts, sites, guidelines, templates, and reports for each section of the Trust Charter. In 2022, the Group saw an increase of global policy views of +72% compared with 2021.\n\nFinally, the Trust portal is an Intranet portal that gives access to the right resources to all employees when they face situations in which they need support, and to help give them the confidence to alert any unethical behavior they witness or even remain informed of the news the Group provide on new Trust programs or policies they publish. As a testimony of the risen awareness and engagement to Trust, more than 17,000 unique views between February and November 2022 have been recorded on the Trust Portal.\n\nLeadership at every level of the organization was involved in the design, creation, and deployment of the Trust Charter to ensure that everyone at Schneider Electric is aware of the importance of trust and understands how to get the most out of its Code of Conduct.\n\n2022 was a strong deployment year for the Trust Charter. In fact, as a proof of this increasing involvement in Trust at all levels, almost 23,000 downloads of the Trust Charter on se.com have been recorded, which takes into account not only employees but all the Group's other stakeholders.\n\nThe mandatory Schneider Essentials trainings aim at ensuring that all employees are trained on the most important topics covered by the Trust Charter, notably: 'Trust at Schneider Electric', 'Cybersecurity for Schneider Electric 2022', 'We All Have Mental Health' and 'The Schneider Electric Story'. Thanks to the high level of engagement of all employees and the effort of sensibilization, the course dedicated to Trust was completed at 97.5% overall.",

        "page_content": "The Trust Month, the largest and longest-running global internal communication campaign, has been a great medium to draw together all the pillars of Trust into a single event. The campaign consisted of 15 keynotes, 70 webinars and more than 15,000 webinar attendees. By offering different activities and involving all employees in the events the group noticed a very high level of\n\nengagement and impact, with 88% of participants agreeing they learnt something that impacts their daily work life.\n\nDiscover the Trust Charter of Schneider Electric on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.2  Ethics & Compliance program\n\n## 2.2.2.1 Context\n\nOver the years, Schneider Electric has earned the trust of its customers, shareholders, employees, and communities through the quality of its products and its sustainability commitments. To fully serve these stakeholders, the Group's commitment to business integrity must be equally robust. This means acting at all times in accordance with the ethical principles it has set and in compliance with the laws and regulations in force in all the countries where it operates.\n\n## 2.2.2.2  Risk and opportunities\n\nUnethical practices or non-compliance of Schneider Electric, its employees or third parties acting in its name and/or on its behalf with applicable laws and regulations may expose Schneider Electric to criminal and civil proceedings, reputational damage, business interruption and damage to shareholder value. Due to broader externalities, the Group's exposure to those risks has been increasing for several years, through its geographic expansion, participation in complex projects, and a large range of acquisitions. Moreover, over the past years, there has been an increase in law enforcement by public authorities, new regulations, and higher reputational risk with media exposure.\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric carried out a specific risk mapping dedicated to 'Ethics and Compliance' regarding the following risks: Corruption, Conflict of Interest, Human Rights & Labor Laws, and Sanctions & Export Control. Its objective is to capture operational risk exposure at zone level, based on local interviews led by the Regional Compliance Officers and the Legal teams.\n\nThe process at regional level was as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Step 1 - each region defined its local risk universe taking into account local specific risks.\n- \u00b7 Step 2 - each region assessed its gross risks and effectiveness of its local mitigation measures, generating a mapping of regional net risks. In addition, a global risk mapping was consolidated at Group level.\n- \u00b7 Step 3 - each region defined action plans to reduce the risk exposure. In addition, a set of global action plans was established at Group level. All action plans were monitored during the course of 2022.\n\nBy contrast with those risks, there is competitive advantage in approaching this proactively. Companies can experience significant improvements when they hold themselves to high standards of integrity. The primary benefits range from increasing employee satisfaction, improving workplace culture, maintaining legal compliance and strengthen public reputation. It can also reinforce the engagement and loyalty of customers, partners, suppliers and local communities.\n\n## 2.2.2.3 Group policy\n\nThrough its Ethics & Compliance program, Schneider Electric aims to prevent, detect and mitigate integrity risks, including corruption, fraud, violation of human rights, health and safety, responsible workplace (including discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment), anti-competitive practices, sanctions and export\n\ncontrol. The program design and operation are influenced by the Group's risk profile, business model, organizational structure and culture.\n\nTo reflect this commitment to integrity and to enable employees to respect the Trust Charter, Schneider Electric deployed global and local policies: Anti-Corruption Policy (aligned with French Sapin II law requirements), Conflict of Interest Policy, Business Agents Policy, Anti-Harassment Policy, Export Control Policy, and Case Management & Investigation Policy.\n\nIn 2022, the Group also updated and deployed a set of new policies: Gifts & Hospitality Policy, Competition Law Policy, Human Rights Policy, Whistleblowing Policy, Philanthropy Policy, and Sponsorship Policy. Moreover, to ensure that the principles and rules of the Ethics & Compliance program apply throughout the Group and for new entities joining the Group, the Ethics & Compliance department worked on specific Trust Standards. This work is part of the Governance Models program (see page 114), applicable during the acquired company's integration.\n\nAll Schneider Electric employees are expected to comply with Schneider's Ethics & Compliance program. The Ethics & Compliance program is based on management commitment which makes its pillars effective and on risk assessment which assists decision making, determining the risks to be treated and the priority to implement the treatment.\n\nManagement commitment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Once a year, the Directors also review the Ethics & Compliance program's effectiveness and the allocation of resources to the program. In addition, the Directors agree on the audit plan which covers several audits related to the Ethics & Compliance program.\n- \u00b7 Executive level: Since April 2022, the Ethics & Compliance program is overseen by the Group Executive Committee, through the Group Function Committee. This Committee merged several existing committees, including the pre-existing Group Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n- \u00b7 Corporate level: Schneider Electric has created a standalone Ethics & Compliance department, chaired by a Chief Compliance Officer acting on behalf of the Group Ethics & Compliance Committee, and reporting to the Chief Governance Officer & Secretary General, to drive the strategy of the Ethics & Compliance program. The Ethics & Compliance department includes the following teams: Group Compliance, Group HR Compliance, Fraud Examination, Health & Safety, and IT Assets Governance. It works closely with the Legal, Human Resources, Finance, Digital and Strategy & Sustainability departments, as well as Internal Control and Audit; which are directly responsible for managing certain specific risks.\n\n## Speak-Up Supervision\n\nSchneider Electric employees must feel free and psychologically safe to share their ideas, opinions, and concerns, without fear of retaliation. To ensure the effectiveness of that Speak Up mindset and related whistleblowing system, the Group has created two specific committees:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group Operational Compliance Committee (GOCC) detects and manages cases of non-compliance with the Ethics & Compliance program in accordance with the Whistleblowing Policy and Case Management & Investigation Policy, and reviews monthly the effectiveness of the whistleblowing system. The GOCC is composed of the following members: Chief Compliance Officer (secretary of the Committee), Chief Legal Officer, Group Internal Audit & Control Officer, Group Compliance Director, Group HR Compliance Officer, and Head of Fraud Examination Team.\n- \u00b7 The Group Disciplinary Committee levies sanctions and remediation actions on serious non-compliance cases to guarantee a fair and transparent disciplinary policy upon request of the GOCC. The Group Disciplinary Committee is composed of the following members: Chief Governance Officer & Secretary General, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Compliance Officer (secretary of the Committee), Chief Legal Officer, and one rotating member.",

Operationally, they rely on Regional Compliance Officers who drive the implementation in the zone, with the support of Ethics Delegates and relevant subject matter experts at local levels.\n\n## Ethics Delegates, Schneider Electric's Integrity Ambassadors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEthics Delegates is an honors program designed to enable well-respected employees with high personal integrity to support the promotion of the Ethics & Compliance program, influence the behavior of the people and the culture of Schneider Electric, and help embed ethics and compliance in how people do their jobs within their business/location. In 2022, the community had 250 members.\n\nExperience feedback from Isabel Matos, Ethics Delegates in South America in 2022: 'I have been an Ethics Delegate for four years in South America. I am proud to be part of this community. We have the opportunity to guide people to be compliant with legal regulations and to make right decisions. As the company is totally committed with its Trust Charter, we have all support needed from stakeholders and employees to have a strong governance and risk management in place'.\n\n## 2.2.2.5  Actions and impacts\n\n## Management Commitment\n\nRules and policies alone do not suffice. Management sets the company standards and promotes a culture of integrity and a Speak Up mindset. Top management regularly expressed its commitment through statements and extensive communication (called 'tone from the top'), such as during the Trust Month organized in June 2022. This global event marked the deployment of the Trust Charter. Its launch was supported by the Chairman and CEO in a video in which he notably reminded colleagues of the importance of business running on trust and integrity. This integrity is also expressed by middle- and first-line management (called 'tone from the middle') by spreading the right message in their teams and supporting reporting of misconduct.\n\nManagement commitment is evidenced by the participation of Schneider's Chairman and CEO who sits on the global Board of the United Nations Global Compact. Schneider Electric also works with other companies and stakeholders to build integrity and common standards. The Group participates in the initiatives of many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and professional associations, such as Transparency International France, Le Cercle d'\u00c9thique des Affaires (The Ethical Business Circle), International Deontology & Compliance Committee of the Mouvement des Entreprises de France (Movement of the Enterprises of France) and Anti-Corruption Committee of Business at OECD (BIAC).\n\n## Training and awareness\n\nInternal communication provides employees with essential baseline information on Schneider Electric's integrity commitment while also raising awareness and understanding of the Ethics & Compliance program. To do this, the Group created a dedicated intranet page, a global internal social network group and a specific email address to answer questions. Schneider Electric also regularly distributes videos and other communication assets on integrity-related subjects to its employees. In addition, communication around the Ethics & Compliance program is rolled out locally by the Regional Compliance Officers and Local Internal Communication teams.\n\nEach year a global campaign of mandatory training is run for all employees, called Schneider Essentials , from March to the end of September. Training is available in 18 different languages in the organization's Learning Management System. In 2022, Schneider Essentials trainings were: Trust at Schneider Electric,\n\nCybersecurity, We All Have Mental Health and The Schneider Electric Story. For around 40,000 employees exposed to corruption risks, an additional anti-corruption training is required each year.\n\nA number of specific trainings are also delivered:\n\n- \u00b7 A dedicated module on Ethics & Compliance was prepared for Country Presidents. The module raises Country Presidents' awareness about their role and responsibility in supporting the Ethics & Compliance program.\n- \u00b7 The Ethics & Compliance program includes dedicated training for leaders of companies acquired as part of the integration process. The training entails a specific focus on what is expected from the leadership teams, including endorsing the program and actively following up employees' completion of mandatory trainings on Trust Charter and anti-corruption.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, ad hoc learnings were organized for all employees and managers as part of the Trust Month in June 2022 (e.g. Speak-Up) in sensitive geographic areas (e.g. Brazil, India) or in locations where a specific risk is higher (such as the export control risk).\n\nThe Group monitors and discloses its completion rate on trainings on ethics (Trust Charter and anti-corruption for eligible employees) and cybersecurity, aiming for 100% completion each year (SSE #13). The performance of this KPI received a 'limited' external assurance level each year as part of the Group's annual extra-financial audit. At the end of 2022, SSE #13 achieved a 95.5% completion rate.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The Group regularly responds to questionnaires and other additional requests to demonstrate its integrity to its customers.\n- \u00b7 Compliance screening: In 2022, 100% of direct customers were screened for both export control and sanctions as well as corruption risks. A pilot was also launched to provide automatic real-time screening of all direct customers. The Group is also working to screen its vendors and started an initial screening of its strategic direct vendors in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Business Agents: Schneider Electric has implemented a due diligence process for its intermediaries that it qualifies as 'Business Agents'. The Business Agent Policy sets out the rules under which Schneider Electric will determine whether there is a legitimate business purpose before engaging. The Ethics & Compliance department performs the due diligence and manages the approval process by analyzing risks of corruption, sanctions, and unethical practices.\n- \u00b7 Mergers and acquisitions: M&A operations represent specific risks regarding ethics and compliance. A specific process and guidelines were put in place in 2020 to ensure full compliance of M&A operations with anti-corruption and export control regulations: this process was developed by the Ethics & Compliance department, the Legal department and the M&A team, ensuring a methodology that fits with M&A processes and ways of working. In 2021, this process was extended to the management of Human Rights risk. In 2022, the integration of ESG assessments at each stage of the M&A process has been reinforced to further protect the Group and accelerate the integration of new entities to its Sustainability Strategy and reporting.",

In 2022, a revised cross-functional program involving mainly Accounting, Internal Control, Digital and Ethics & Compliance, as well as upstream functions such as Procurement, Sales, Marketing, was launched to further improve and digitalize the defined preventive and detection controls with the sponsorship of Executive Committee members. The program's priorities were defined based on the results of the 2021 Ethics & Compliance risk assessment, i.e. Gifts & Hospitality, Travel & Expenses, Sponsorship, Donations, Business Agents, Marketing Development Funds, Performance Bonuses.\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nAs part of the Speak Up mindset, and as developed in the Whistleblowing Policy, Schneider Electric employees have a responsibility to report potential unethical behaviors.\n\nhistleblowing corresponds to all methods of reporting available to employees, interns or contractors, and external stakeholders (suppliers, subcontractors, customers, business agents, etc.) to voluntarily report a potential violation of laws and regulations, and/ or of the Group's Trust Charter and Group policies.\n\nAt Schneider Electric, stakeholders, either internal or external, may report concerns either by contacting an appropriate person in the Group (manager, HR business partner, Legal Counsel, or Compliance Officer) and/or by using the Trust Line, Schneider Electric's whistleblowing system. The latter is available online globally, at all times, and protects the anonymity of the whistleblower (unless there is legislation to the contrary).

Since then, the Group is working to increase this measurement by 10 points by 2025 as part of Schneider Sustainability Impact. In 2022, 82% of employees surveyed answered 'yes' which constitutes an improvement of +1 point over a 12-month period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measure the level of confidence of our employees to report unethical conduct\n\nA speak-up mindset exists when employees and stakeholders feel safe to speak out about issues, concerns, and ideas in good faith, respectfully, and without fear of retaliation.

It also fosters a corporate culture of trust and responsiveness.\n\n## Experience feedback from an employee in France in 2022.\n\n'I didn't feel to do it as long as I was still reporting inside the team where I had the issue, so I declared the issue 2 months after, when I was in my new position.

Developed in 2021 and becoming effective in 2022 for the first time, this KIC framework has been significantly reshaped and enhanced by increasing the number of KICs for the Ethics & Compliance program aligned with new policies and processes. In addition, in 2022 Schneider Electric executed the central monitoring of key processes of the Ethics & Compliance program such as Business Agents, Conflict of Interest, Whistleblowing and Anti-corruption training results. The outcome of these controls is regularly shared with key stakeholders to ensure continuous process and design improvements.\n\nFurthermore, the Group's Internal Audit program includes specific tasks related to the Ethics & Compliance program, and to activities or subsidiaries for which an evaluation of the maturity and effectiveness of the program will be reviewed. Several internal audits were conducted in 2022 resulting in recommendations related to the improvement of the Ethics & Compliance program.\n\nFor more details on Key Internal Controls and the Group's Internal Audit.

        "page_content": "## 2.2.3  Zero-tolerance for corruption\n\n## 2.2.3.1 Context\n\nCorruption is illegal and refers to the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. It undermines the effectiveness of any given ecosystem by undermining the trust and confidence which are necessary for the maintenance and development of sustainable economic and social relations. Moreover, it threatens the rule of law, democracy and human rights, undermines good governance, fairness and social justice, distorts competition, hinders economic development and endangers the stability of democratic institutions and the moral foundations of society. Over the past years, anti-corruption regulations have been strengthened worldwide. Fighting corruption has become a legal obligation in several countries with more controls and sanctions in case of misconduct.\n\n## 2.2.3.2  Risks and opportunities\n\nEngaging in corruption exposes to legal proceedings, prosecutions and sanctions for companies and individuals. Companies accused or convicted of illicit behavior may then suffer a serious public relations backlash and expose themselves or individuals to being debarred from public tenders/ public funds. They may also be subverting local social interests and/or harming local competitors while the cost of funding corruption may be perceived by investors as a hidden 'tax' or illegal overhead charge, thereby increasing costs for companies, and further down the chain, their customers.\n\nMultiple studies indicate that companies that have anti-corruption measures significantly increase profits compared to companies that do not. Indeed, such an approach will attract customers, investors, employees and suppliers who are concerned about risks as well as those who value integrity. It is then translated directly into tangible benefits, including risk reduction, cost savings and sustainable growth.\n\nSchneider Electric's exposure to corruption risk materializes through various factors, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 Organic growth and mergers and acquisitions in countries with a high perceived level of corruption (especially in Asia and Africa);\n- \u00b7 Business model relying on a large ecosystem of partners, including accountability for activities performed on behalf of the Group;\n- \u00b7 Participation in complex projects in sector at risk, such as oil and gas, where the amounts invested may be very high and with end-users from the public sector subject to more restrictive anti-corruption regulations.\n\nTo meet the legal obligations specified by the December 9, 2016 French law known as the Sapin II law, the Company launched a risk mapping exercise focusing on corruption risks in 2018. In 2021, this risk assessment was updated as part of the new Ethics & Compliance risk mapping, which focuses in particular on Corruption and Conflicts of Interest. Please refer to section 2.2.2 'Ethics & Compliance program', page 111. In 2021, 8% of the confirmed valid alerts, reported through whistleblowing, concern a potential violation of the Anti-Corruption Policy. In 2022, this represented 13%.\n\n## 2.2.3.3  Group policy and governance\n\nAs stated in the Trust Charter and Anti-Corruption Policy, Schneider Electric has zero tolerance for corruption and is committed to comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws. This commitment is demonstrated by a strong and continuously developing AntiCorruption Compliance program, which is part of the Ethics & Compliance program and managed by the same Ethics & Compliance Governance (see page 112).\n\nSchneider Electric published and rolled out a revised AntiCorruption Policy in 2019, meeting the requirements of the French Sapin II law, to take into account results of the corruption risk mapping and to provide employees with examples illustrating situations they may face. This policy acts as a handbook to be consulted when in doubt about the appropriate behavior to adopt. It is not intended to address every issue one may encounter, but it provides appropriate examples of corruption risks and offers guidance to resolve many ethical dilemmas.\n\n## 2.2.3.4  Actions and impacts\n\nTo operationalize the behavior rules of the Anti-Corruption Policy, Schneider Electric has created a set of additional policies and procedures related to Conflict of Interest, Business Agents, Gifts & Hospitality, Philanthropy and Sponsorship and revised anticorruption accounting controls program. Moreover, the risks associated with onboarding new acquisition targets are numerous and consequently, Merger and Acquisition (M&A) guidelines have been published to identify, manage, and mitigate those risks at the earliest possible stage. These guidelines aim to cover the very first steps of identifying potential targets, what to look out for in data-rooms, and finally how the Group plans to integrate the acquired entity into its anti-corruption compliance framework through dedicated Trust Standards. These same rules also apply when Schneider Electric decides to make a divestiture with a step-by-step approach to managing the transition.\n\nSchneider Electric has also developed a suite of anti-corruption e-learnings, providing guidance on real life risk scenarios, designed to meet the trainees' needs and expectations. The training is mandatory for targeted employees exposed to corruption risks, as identified by the corruption risk mapping. A curriculum of modules of e-learnings was deployed in 2020: a general module on the 'zero tolerance' message against corruption and an explanation of the legal framework and risks, and two specific modules about third parties and gifts and hospitality. In 2021, four additional modules were created on facilitation payments, conflict of interest, the conditions that create a climate for wrongdoing and how to raise concerns. The modules were supported by videos from top leaders demonstrating the 'tone at the top' and are available in 14 languages. In 2022, those e-learnings were rolled out to more than 40,000 employees, with a completion rate of 97%.\n\nMoreover, the year saw ad hoc anti-corruption learnings delivered to all employees and managers as part of the Trust Month that took place in June 2022 (e.g. Conflict of Interest) and in functions deemed to be priorities (e.g. Services). Notably, Schneider Electric also organized specific communication campaigns dedicated to the new policies for Gifts & Hospitality, Philanthropy and Sponsorship.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 2.2  Driving responsible business with Trust\n\n## 2.2.3.5  Focus on responsible lobbying, political activity, and donations\n\nThrough its Trust Charter, Schneider Electric has taken a clear stance with regards to responsible lobbying, political activity, and donations. As a Company, Schneider has a role to play in the public debate addressing leading issues with the global community. It is necessary that the Group states its positions clearly, participates in technical discussions, and supports responsible public policy development. Donations and lobbying activities are risks specifically addressed in the Anti-Corruption Policy.\n\nSchneider believes that this representation of interests should be conducted in a transparent and fair manner, allowing third parties and stakeholders to understand its activities, positions, and statements. In particular, Schneider Electric does not engage in political activity or political representation and does not make any payment to political parties in relation to its public representation. In 2022, Schneider Electric was not involved in sponsoring local, regional, or national political campaigning.\n\nIn the US, political contributions can only be made by a corporation through a legally formed Political Action Committee (PAC) or Super Political Action Committee. Schneider Electric does not engage with Super PAC activity nor does it have a PAC in the US and therefore cannot make any political contributions in this country.\n\nSchneider Electric presents information about its lobbying activities in the French High Authority for Transparency in Public Life, in the EU transparency register, and in the US Lobbying Disclosure Act Registration.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2022, the Group discloses expenses in membership fees towards trade associations, business coalitions, and thinktanks, that are dedicated by the association to lobbying or representation. Generally, the budget allocated to lobbying in these organizations is small as these associations mostly organise business workshops, peer-learning groups, or work on standardization. Schneider Electric updated its reporting methodology compared to previous years and now discloses the budget allocated to lobbying or representation rather than total membership fees. The data collected covers the main Group geographies, in particular Europe including France, North America, China, India, Indonesia, the UK or Philippines.\n\nTotal contributions globally amounted to about \u20ac0.5 million in 2019, \u20ac0.6 in 2020, \u20ac1.2 million in 2021 and \u20ac1.1 million in 2022.\n\nThe largest contributions and expenditures concern two main engagement topics:\n\n- \u00b7 The first is 'Sustainable energy for all': Schneider Electric believes that energy management and energy efficiency are critical to move towards a new energy landscape and therefore supports a policy framework that unleashes the business and climate opportunities related to the new energy landscape. Contributions and expenditures on this topic amounted about \u20ac0.6 million in 2022 (\u20ac0.5 million in 2021) globally;\n- \u00b7 The second is 'Powering the digital economy': the Group supports the emergence of the digital economy to bring new opportunities for businesses and people and therefore supports a policy framework that facilitates the digital transformation globally. Contributions and expenditures on this topic amounted about \u20ac0.2 million in 2022 (\u20ac0.1 million in 2021) globally.\n\n## 2.2.4 Responsible Workplace\n\n## 2.2.4.1 Context\n\nA responsible workplace is an open and supportive place where all employees, no matter who they are, or where they live in the world, feel uniquely valued and safe to contribute their best. It is settled when everyone is treated fairly, when difference is acknowledged and valued, and everyone feels free from any type of harassment, victimization and discrimination.\n\n## 2.2.4.2 Risks and opportunities\n\nNot creating a responsible workplace may expose Schneider Electric to liability towards the person who has allegedly been harassed or discriminated, potential claims from the alleged perpetrator and future allegations to not prevent a potential culture of harassment and/ or discrimination to flourish or took insufficient steps to protect employees. Moreover, the Group could be exposed to reputational risk.\n\nTo assess risks relating to the workplace, Schneider Electric conducted a risk mapping exercise as part of the Ethics & Compliance risk mapping, under the Human Rights risk stream. In 2021, 30% of the confirmed valid alerts, reported through whistleblowing, concern Discrimination, Harassment or Unfair treatment. In 2022, this represented 44%.\n\nBuilding a responsible workplace establishes trust for employees. It also encourages talented candidates to join Schneider Electric's safe and comfortable work environment. Additionally, for the same reasons, it retains Talents by developing engagement and increasing employee morale. As Schneider's Employees are first in the line of defense, the Group has renewed and deployed its Core Values and Leadership Expectations. Each year, Employees are evaluated on their global performance, taken into consideration their alignment with the Group's values and corresponding demonstrated behaviors.\n\nSee more details in Chapter 2.5 page 196.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.4.3 Group policy and governance\n\nSchneider Electric has 'zero tolerance' for any kind of workplace misconduct. This commitment is evidenced by a specific HR Compliance program, which is part of the Ethics & Compliance program and manages by the same Ethics & Compliance Governance.\n\nSchneider Electric published and rolled out an Anti-Harassment Policy in 2018, serving as an employee manual to address and prevent misconduct that violates the dignity of employees. In 2022, the Group worked on a new version and extended the policy on discrimination. The new Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policy will be rolled out in 2023.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.4.4 Actions and impacts\n\nTo operationalize responsible workplace behavior principles, Schneider Electric has renewed the Global 'Flexibility at Work' Policy in 2020 and the Global Family Leave Policy in 2022, which both support greater inclusion and care to help its diverse workforce adapt to the 'next normal' workplace. Moreover, the HR Compliance program is applied across the Schneider Electric group through dedicated Trust Standards. These are deployed during the integration of new entities and the onboarding of new employees when they join the company.\n\nTo build a common understanding and alignment, Schneider Electric also created a mandatory training entitled 'Building a Culture of Respect' and assigned it to all employees as part of Schneider Essentials (mandatory for all) in 2021. 98% of employees completed the training. This training was available to all employees who wished to take it in 2022. In addition, some specific trainings were deployed in line with local initiatives to prevent harassment and discrimination in specific countries (e.g. U.S.).\n\nIn 2022, Schneider deployed a new e-learning called 'We All Have Mental Health' as a mandatory training for all, to raise awareness of the 'next normal' working conditions and the company's care of its employees. Due to the sensitivity of workplace-related alerts and the human factor involved, the Group has also created a specific e-learning for its network of internal investigators. This aims to ensure full impartiality and fair common practices everywhere. More than 240 HR investigators were trained. In addition, workshops have been conducted for internal investigators in many geographies.\n\nSchneider Electric also organized specific communication campaigns promoting a responsible workplace as part of the Trust Month that took place in June 2022. As part of this initiative, the company organized a dedicated awareness session on psychological safety. In addition, Schneider Electric encourages the Speak-Up mindset to allow employees and stakeholders to report any violations of the group's ethical standards or any workplace-related concerns.\n\n## 2.2.5  Compliance with tax regulations\n\nSchneider Electric Group applies a responsible fiscal approach supported by strong governance, as outlined in the tax policy of the Group which can be consulted on our website at se.com. Tax risk management is an integral part of the company's risk management process, and in this context, the Tax Director, under the authority of the CFO, is in charge of implementing the Group's tax policy and reports regularly to the Audit Committee. The Group engages to comply with the international and local tax regulations applicable in each of the countries in which it operates, and to build a lasting and transparent relationship of trust with the tax authorities. In this respect, the Group provides the tax authorities with all the information necessary to enable them to carry out their mission. As an example, the Group has entered into a tax partnership - a relationship of trust - in France, and works in consultation with the tax authorities. Similar steps are being taken in other countries.\n\n## 2.2.6  High standards for the quality and safety of our products\n\n## 2.2.6.1 Context\n\nSchneider Electric holds dear the trust customers and employees place in its products and services to protect themselves and their property. Continuous quality improvement is therefore central to the organization's strategy and foundational to achieve its overall business purpose and mission. Recognizing the opportunity that delivering superior quality would bring, the Group began a company-wide transformation of quality to accelerate its journey.\n\n## 2.2.6.2  Risks and opportunities\n\nSchneider Electric operates globally with a wide-ranging portfolio of customer solutions. The corresponding complexity of the product portfolio and supply chain brings with it risks and opportunities for quality. Many of the Group's solutions serve essential industries where product quality and safety are a critical topic. Product malfunctions or failures could result in Schneider incurring liabilities for tangible, intangible damages, or personal injuries. The failure of a product, system, or solution may involve costs related to the product recall, result in new development expenditure, and consume technical and economic resources.\n\nSchneider Electric's products are also subject to multiple quality and safety controls governed by national and supranational regulations and standards. Maintaining compliance to new or more stringent standards or regulations could result in capital investment.\n\nRisks identified by Schneider Electric in regard to product, project, system quality, and offer reliability can be:\n\n- \u00b7 Design quality concerns\n- \u00b7 Manufacturing and Logistic issues\n- \u00b7 Deficient product safety\n- \u00b7 Software quality\n- \u00b7 Brand labelling, Supplier & Supply mismanagement\n\nThe above-mentioned risks could have a significant impact on the financial performance of the Group. The business reputation of Schneider Electric could also be negatively impacted. Indeed, the Group has been impacted by several recalls. With the quality transformation, Schneider Electric has established the visionary goal to eliminate product recalls by 2025 (SSE #15).\n\n## 2.2.6.3  Group quality policy\n\nIn its Trust Charter, Schneider clearly outlines its commitments to strive for high quality.\n\nThe Quality Policy of the Group is guided by the following principles:\n\n- 1 Customer First: Quality is the safety of customers. Schneider Electric prioritizes their interests and anticipates customer needs through customer journeys and customer personas deployment everywhere in the Group.\n- 2 Offer Quality: Schneider Electric innovates with agility, discipline, and good business sense throughout the offer's lifecycle, from creation to supply, all the way through manufacturing, delivering, and operations and until services. Schneider Electric delivers safe, reliable, and cybersecure offers, for products, systems, and software, to secure customers' business continuity.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

These processes are to be used for all offers sold or manufactured by Schneider Electric.\n- \u00b7 Quality Procedure 'Offer Safety Review'. The overall objective of offer safety is to reduce the risk arising from the use of Schneider's products, solutions, or services throughout their life cycle. Offer safety reviews are conducted by Offer Safety Review Committees and are used to focus attention on safety and help ensure that offers are safe when properly installed (based on safety manual), maintained and used for their intended purpose and other reasonably foreseeable use or misuse.\n\n## 2.2.6.4 Governance\n\nThe Group policy is realized through a robust Quality Management System, which is improved continuously to fulfill expectations of all relevant parties. It is in full alignment with the Group's Trust Charter, Schneider Electric's Code of Conduct, as well as in compliance with and certification to ISO 9001 standard. 231 Schneider Electric manufacturing sites have achieved their ISO 9001 certification.\n\nAt Schneider Electric, the customer satisfaction and quality network covers all layers, functions, global supply chain, operations, and lines of businesses. Within presence of quality throughout the Group, Schneider seeks to create a culture of quality and spread the customer-first mindset everywhere.\n\nSchneider has strengthened the governance committee with a new accelerated operating rhythm wherein the new Head of Customer Satisfaction & Quality (CS&Q), together with the Executive Committee, reviews the status of quality across the company and guide the quality transformation journey.\n\nThe quality transformation is further informed with first-hand experience gained from over 50 quality-focused Gemba walks through Schneider operations worldwide. During the Gemba walks, the new Head of CS&Q personally compares the current standard to actual conditions and to industry best practice to identify necessary corrections and opportunities for improvement.\n\n## 2.2.6.5  Actions and impacts\n\nTo accelerate and focus the company-wide transformation of quality, the Group has invested in strengthening and reorganizing the quality function, beginning with a new Head of CS&Q bringing to the Group best practices that produce world-class quality in Automotive and Aerospace industries. The Group further enabled and accelerated the change through a revised organizational structure and investing in new capability.\n\n## Quality System\n\nBuilding on the foundation of the existing quality system, the Group has identified opportunities to simplify the existing processes and procedures, while adopting the highest applicable standards in every category. To ensure processes are completely implemented and procedures followed with discipline, the Group aims to greatly strengthen quality internal auditing program.\n\n## Quality Planning\n\nThe Group continues its ReeD program (Reliability End To End by Design), to secure fundamentals and ensure full integration of new customer expectations (from Quality to Reliability). Designed with R&D at its heart, with huge interactions with all functions and businesses of Schneider Electric:\n\n- \u00b7 By ensuring that new offer development is focused on customer promises.\n- \u00b7 By animating mitigation plan until deviation is fixed.\n- \u00b7 By ensuring Excellence in Offer Life Cycle changes.\n- \u00b7 By transitioning from product quality to systems reliability.\n- \u00b7 By combining people's competency with robust digital processes.\n- \u00b7 By leveraging more digital tools to detect issues early and reduce the number of bugs seen by customers.\n- \u00b7 Reinforce risk analysis to ensure proper usage of systems, software, and products to prevent associated issues and risks.\n\nIt is the obsession of the Group to ensure that 'Reliability' is a signature value of Schneider Electric branding. Accordingly, the program is being further strengthened with dedicated resources and the introduction of new processes and methods supporting increases in Reliability and Robustness. The new processes and methods are being animated though capability-building 'design fundamentals' training and practices.",

        "page_content": "## Quality Assurance\n\nSchneider strengthened its use of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis extending coverage, deepening the analysis, and creating a laser focus on severe failure modes, ensuring risk-mitigating controls are in place, and successfully reducing the risk on over 600 processes.\n\nThrough the process improvement efforts, the Group recognizes the opportunity to integrate and strengthen existing industrialization procedures with 'Advanced Product Quality Planning' (APQP) which seeks to introduce new products with outstanding quality. As APQP matures it would enable the Group to bring together the Design, Industrialization, Manufacturing, and Service teams to co-create solutions that are more reliable, robust, manufacturable and serviceable, contributing to the sustainability goals of the group.\n\n## Quality Control\n\nWithin operations, the Group pursues a twin strategy of 'back to basics' while it accelerates and leverages its digitization. The 'quality basics' were developed and are being deployed or strengthened across the group. To introduce the quality basics special radical change events (kaikaku) were held to immediately implement the basics. The radical change events serve to build quality capability in participants and organizations, further strengthening the Group quality culture.\n\nAccelerated implementation of digital solutions for real time process control and statistical process control, traceability, and other digital capabilities to over 300 manufacturing lines. Establishing the digital foundation encourages innovative thinking and ways the Group can unleash its digital potential. Globally the Group identified over 100 applications for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, successfully adding AI to manufacturing processes to improve first-time quality and successfully applying vision and machine learning to improve quality control.\n\n## Quality Improvement\n\nSchneider Electric's 'Issue to Prevention' process continues to deliver valuable insights to root causes of problems and their corresponding improvement opportunities. The process was further strengthened through the implementation and verification of corrective and preventive actions, and by creating a mechanism to share learning horizontally across the Group.\n\nSchneider has an Offer Safety Alert (OSA) process to alert the relevant Line of Business and other interested parties as soon as it is suspected that customers' health or property safety may be put at risk by Schneider products, solutions, or projects. The Offer Safety Alert Committee (OSAC) is a permanent corporate committee that oversees and regulates the management of OSA. Its mission is to ensure all OSA are managed with the due diligence and urgency to minimize safety risks to customers. Its independent, multi-discipline nature allows the OSAC to make decisions in the customers' best interest. As part of the Trust pillar of Schneider Sustainability Essentials 20212025, Schneider has set the visionary objective to eliminate recalls by 2025 (SSE #15), which is an enhancement of the previous program to 'reduce scrap from safety units recalled' originally set.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022 the Group recalled 24 products as approved by the Offer Safety Alert Committee, vs 14 in 2021. In addition to Safety, recalls have large environmental footprints consisting of re-production of the recalled units and multiplications of packaging and transportation.\n\nThe increase of Offer Safety Alerts in 2022 is consistent with the increase of detection policy close to defect 'Point of Creation', reducing the magnitude of impact for customers and for the environment.\n\nFor each alert, Schneider reaches out to customers impacted by the recall to arrange for product replacement. Investigation will be conducted on products returned to Schneider's premises to determine the final root cause of the safety issue. The returned product thereafter will be assessed on its reusability and parts which could not be reused will be scrapped according to the local environmental regulations.\n\nIt is the ambition of the Group to eliminate recalls though the adoption and rigorous execution of a quality system consisting of the highest available standards.\n\n2020 Baseline\n\n2025 target\n\n25\n\n2022 Progress\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

While hyperconnectivity and subsequent digital enablers provide transformative business and operational value, they also expand cybersecurity threats.\n\nOn top of that the Group operates in over 100 countries, sources goods and services from five continents and manages more than 50,000 unique suppliers. All of this increases the cyber complexity under which our companies operate and introduces sources of risks.\n\nCybersecurity is an essential business imperative for Schneider Electric. This means that the Group takes a risk-informed approach, managing cyber risks thoroughly to better protect its supply chain, working to shape a company-wide cybersecurity culture and finally partnering with experts to reach the highest cyber standards.\n\n## 2.2.7.2  Risks and opportunities\n\nSchneider Electric's strategy aims:\n\n- 1. to protect its customers assets and operations\n- 2. to mitigate the possibility of having its operational continuity disrupted by an attack by identifying and prioritizing high-value digital assets within the company's operations and enforcing a certification discipline across its major sites and assets\n- 3. to comply with global and local regulations where the company operates\n- 4. to prevent voluntary and involuntary loss or exposure of its intellectual property.\n\nIn this journey, Schneider Electric seeks to learn and mature its posture. Hence, cyber events are continuously monitored, detected, responded to, and learned from. The Group measures its improvement thanks to date-based reality checks, internal and external reviews, cyber crisis drills, and vulnerability assessments to its acquired companies and entities acquired which are under control form a business standpoint but whose IT management systems are out of our control.\n\nSchneider Electric believes that cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility, hence at Group level, clear expectations shape both individual and collective secure behaviors, not only to protect the Group but the society at large. Online training on cybersecurity is mandatory for all employees. This training helps employees to identify the cyber threats they may face and understand how to protect themselves. At the end of 2022, 99% of Schneider Electric employees had completed this training. Certain employee categories received mandatory training for risks linked to their activity. Hence there are trainings for:\n\n- \u00b7 HR teams as they are confronted daily to data\n- \u00b7 33,000 shopfloor employees are concerned, as well as the 84,000 white collars of the Group.\n- \u00b7 Employees that are directly facing customers, approximately 20,000 employees, need to validate a 'cyber badge' as they access customer sites\n- \u00b7 Teams in charge of R&D are bound to train as they deal with intellectual property on a daily basis.\n\nFinally, as cybersecurity is a collective play, Schneider Electric works collaboratively with the ecosystem sitting along its value chain (suppliers, authorities, customers, especially the ones in critical infrastructure etc.) to build trust, as it has an ambition to raise the defense level of the industry at large.\n\n## 2.2.7.3 Group Policy\n\nCybersecurity policies are foundational to the Group's security posture as they are compulsory for all stakeholders, they set management's tone and provide guidance towards secure behaviors (people), practices (processes) and environment (technology) throughout the company.\n\nThe company's overarching General Information Security Policy and all supporting security policies are in line with broadly recognized standards and regulations such as ISO27001, NIST, ISA/IEC62443, and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Schneider Electric's current policy framework governs and regulates security behaviors, and encompasses products, solutions, services, and sites. These guidelines apply to all employees and contractors, and relevant populations are regularly trained on them.\n\nOur public security-related policies can be found in the Cybersecurity and Data Protection page on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.7.4 Governance\n\nCybersecurity and data protection are integral to the Group's corporate business strategy and digital transformation journey, and at the core of the Trust Charter. In addition to corporate commitment, executives play a crucial role through the sponsorship of the Executive Committee and oversight from the Board of Directors.\n\nA central body governs the companywide cybersecurity portfolio, coordinating the execution of strategic and operational initiatives, and orchestrating a broader community of security practitioners distributed across businesses and territories. The community includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Digital and operational Security Leaders appointed to manage security risks within their domain (Sales, R&D, Supply Chain, Finance, HR, AI, Digital Offers\u2026). They prepare for and respond to an incident by coordinating the investigation, containment, and remediation.\n- \u00b7 Industrial and R&D Site Leaders nominated to act as cybersecurity experts in all industrial and R&D sites. They carry a strong knowledge of OT assets and technologies as well as their plant's network infrastructure.\n\nFor all security practices and initiatives, monthly updates on projects and report on metrics are orchestrated centrally to allow continuous improvement on all capabilities.\n\nThe company relies on an open and transparent culture where employees are encouraged to self-report any possible issue (intrusion, errors, vulnerabilities etc.). Schneider Electric has adopted a 'see something, say something' approach to encourage escalation to facilitate more rapid detection of exposure and breaches via 'people sensors'.",

New challenges are emerging, due to social, economic, and digital disruptions, such as forced labor, living wages, migrant workers or artificial intelligence.\n\nAs a global company operating in over 100 countries, Human Rights have been a main priority for a long time. Schneider Electric's ambition goes beyond compliance with existing regulations. Its ambition is to ensure that Human Rights are not infringed upon and to play an influential role with external stakeholders by promoting health and safety, diversity, inclusion, equity, and decent work for all.\n\n## 2.2.8.2  Risks and opportunities\n\nIn accordance with the 2017 French duty of vigilance law and its ambition to behave as an exemplary company, Schneider Electric implemented a specific vigilance plan. In 2022, Schneider reviewed and updated its 'duty of vigilance risk matrix' which highlights the risks the Group poses on its ecosystem including its sites, suppliers, contractors, and local communities (for more details please see page 133).\n\nThis review of risk covers fundamental Human Rights. This includes some rights that may be threatened as a result of the evolution of the geopolitical context: increased flow of migrant workers and threats of modern slavery (1) as a consequence of regional conflict and wars, pressure on working hours and individual income as a result of tension in the supply chain and accelerated inflation.\n\nIn front of these risks, the Group engaged into several programs that span across its supply chain and its workforce. A core commitment regarding Human Rights is the transformation program related to Decent Work launched in 2021. This program is based on 10 fundamental Human Rights pillars, with the aim of ensuring dignity for all and protecting workers' rights. The program benchmarks current standards around worker rights to ensure that fair policies and practices are followed. This was rolled out to all the Group's employees in 2022, and has started to be rolled out for the Group's strategic suppliers (see page 138).\n\nThe Group has also engaged into Duty of Vigilance program. As part of this program, Schneider Electric is performing audits of risky suppliers to identify potential gaps and suggests areas for improvement.\n\n## 2.2.8.3  Group Human Rights Policy\n\nSchneider Electric's human rights approach is articulated around three principles.\n\n- 1. Schneider is committed to fully respecting and applying laws and regulations in all countries where it operates.\n- 2. Schneider is committed to fostering and promoting human rights throughout all its operational sites and subsidiaries worldwide.\n- 3. Schneider wishes to support human rights beyond its borders, leveraging its large network of partners and stakeholders to promote the implementation of actions that will ensure the respect of people's rights.\n- (1) Report: Global Estimates of Modern Slavery: Forced Labour and Forced Marriage (ilo.org)\n\nSchneider Electric's Global Human Rights Policy (2) is applicable to all Schneider permanent or temporary employees working on Group premises. It also aims to inspire external stakeholders. For all human rights risks identified above, and based on the 'Protect, Respect, Remedy' principles, the policy provides a framework and gives guidance to employees and teams on how to behave in their daily operations or when facing a specific situation.\n\nAt the end of 2022, Schneider published the second version of its Global Human Rights Policy. The Company intends to increase its commitments by making clear its position on new challenges such as migrant workers and artificial intelligence. It confirms the Group's engagement to strive for the respect of all internationally recognized Human Rights and to ensure that Human Rights are respected for everyone, everywhere, at all times. The new policy includes eight new topics: respect and dignity, human rights in cyberspace, migrant workers, conflicts minerals, intergenerational solidarity, human rights activities within the Group's supply chain, civic space and human rights defenders, and access to a healthy environment. Full deployment including the creation of an e-learning is planned for 2023.\n\nFind Schneider's Global Human Rights Policy on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Alignment with international standards and frameworks\n\nSchneider Electric adheres to the following principles or guidelines:\n\n- \u00b7 The international human rights principles encompassed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (as part of the International Bill of Human Rights), which sets out a common standard for all types of organization.\n- \u00b7 The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, which formulate recommendations for companies, including for the respect of human rights.\n- \u00b7 The ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\n- \u00b7 The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) which precisely define the roles and responsibilities of States and businesses on these matters. Schneider Electric is committed to these Guiding Principles and to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nThe procedures implemented by Schneider Electric, notably its vigilance plan and Ethics and Compliance program, ensure that the Group adhere to the EU Taxonomy 'minimum safeguards' requirements referred to in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2  Driving responsible business with Trust\n\n## 2.2.8.4 Governance\n\nThe strategic part of the Human Rights policy as well as the measurement and its full deployment is led by the Corporate Citizenship Department, composed of Human Rights experts supported by Human Resources, Global Supply Chain Departments as well as the countries, the internal audit team and the compliance functions.\n\nThis policy is validated by the Chief Strategy and Sustainability officer, Chief Governance officer and Secretary General, the Chief Human Resources officer and the Executive Vice President Global Supply Chain.\n\nThe Group has joined Entreprises pour les droits de l'Homme (EDH - Businesses for Human Rights), a leading French association of businesses providing its members with tools and advice on implementing the UNGPs. In 2018, Schneider Electric also joined the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a non-profit coalition of more than 120 companies from the electronic, retail, automobile, and leisure industries, for compliance with human rights and sharing best practices with regards to on-site auditing and monitoring of suppliers' activity, including forced-labor issues.\n\nThe Group also took part in the Global Compact LEAD working group 'Decent Work in Global Supply Chain'. Lastly, Schneider Electric co-leads the G7 Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) coalition's 'Advancing human rights in direct operations and supply chains' and 'Building inclusive workplaces' working groups.\n\n## 2.2.8.5  Controls, actions and impacts\n\n## Internal\n\nSchneider Electric entities and subsidiaries are monitored through the implementation of Key Internal Controls. These controls are designed in co-ordination with the Internal Audit team and consist of an annual self-assessment covering different operational topics. Human rights and health and safety controls are included in this annual review. The results of these assessments allow Schneider Electric to benchmark the entities and to prioritize mitigation plans when necessary.\n\nInternal actions regarding respect and dignity, freedom of association, health and safety, working time and leave, wages and benefits, harassment, discrimination, diversity and inclusion, and development of competencies are described in section '2.5 Great People making Schneider Electric a great company', page 198.\n\nSchneider Electric is implementing training programs that are specific to the policies listed above, to raise the level of awareness of employees and give them advice on how to react or behave in specific situations. Some of these trainings are mandatory, others are part of recommended training paths. Such programs cover a very wide area of topics, from anti-harassment to well-being, how to overcome bias and how to develop an inclusive culture. For more details, see section 2.5.3 Talent attraction and development, page 211.\n\nSpecifically, for health and safety, the Group maintains a follow-up of safety metrics. Incidents are reviewed with management, corrective actions are implemented when necessary, and communications are sent to relevant teams throughout the Company. When needed, a global safety alert can be launched to alert all relevant employees. Schneider Electric organizes a yearly 'Global Health & Safety Day', to inform all employees and keep the level of awareness high on this key topic. For more details, see section 'Employee health and safety', page 127.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nHuman rights are included in the approach to select new suppliers. Schneider Electric uses a qualification process called Schneider Supplier Quality Management (SSQM) to select new suppliers. This is based on an evaluation questionnaire combined with on-site audits, which include human rights and health and safety assessments.\n\nSchneider Electric's Supplier Code of Conduct states the framework in which the Group wishes to operate with vendors. Schneider Electric expects suppliers to respect the fundamental principles on health, safety, people's protection, and development as defined in this document. Strategic suppliers are also assessed through EcoVadis, a third party that leverages ISO 26000 standard, and includes Labor and Human rights as one of the four pillars in its methodology. Other actions are implemented through the Group's vigilance plan.\n\nLastly, Schneider Electric launched in 2022 a Decent Work Program (SSI #6) for the Group's strategic suppliers (see more details page 142 to 143).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee more details about supplier programs in the Vigilance plan, and Sustainable relations with suppliers sections pages 130 to 144 .\n\nConsult and download Schneider Electric's Supplier Code of Conduct from the Suppliers page on www.se.com\n\n## Contractors\n\nSchneider Electric has developed specific actions to mitigate human rights risks related to project execution environment. These apply anywhere co-ordination with project contractors is necessary.\n\nThe Group is working to evolve the project decision-making process to incorporate a risk assessment covering ESG topics including human rights. The aim is to better calibrate the mitigation measures and anticipate their implementation earlier in the project process. Pilots have been launched in 2022.\n\nSchneider Electric is also conducting specific on-site audits for contractors included into the Vigilance Supplier Audit program. At the end of 2022, 17 subcontractors had been audited. For more details, see section '2.2.11 Relations with project execution contractors', page 135.\n\n## Communities\n\nThe risks for these locations were assessed for the first time in 2020 in the vigilance risk matrix. In 2021 Schneider Electric deepened the analysis with a specific segmentation to select potential risks that may have an impact on local communities. For more details, see section '2.2.13 Vigilance with local communities', page 146.",

Health and Safety is a value Schneider Electric will not compromise, which was demonstrated by Health and Safety being one of the five Schneider Electric Trust Charter pillars and by setting ambitious 2025 Health & Safety Targets.\n\nThe advances in digitization have made the world a smaller place, and it is now so much easier for H&S teams across the world to work together efficiently, to implement global solutions, including virtual audits, remote Factory Acceptance Testing, live performance dashboards and working from home.\n\nIn a fast-changing environment, where so many communication opportunities are available to everyone, Schneider Electric H&S team is making the most of all the new technologies and innovative ideas, to convey its messages to all employees.\n\nNew technology also exists to identify 'at risk situations', and to warn employees about risks so they can take action to mitigate them. Schneider Electric is constantly exploring how these technologies can make the work environment safer. Schneider Electric has embedded new digital technologies in many products so customers can benefit from improved safety while operating their electrical equipment.\n\n## 2.2.9.2  Risks and opportunities\n\nKey Health & Safety risks include human injury connected with a workplace accident, and non-compliance with regulations. These risks can potentially impact productivity, customer confidence, company image or financial penalties through legal proceedings. At the same time, the effort taken to manage risks can create new business opportunities through greater trust.\n\nStrategic action plans, based on previous incidents and results of risk analysis are performed each year. These plans include opportunities to reduce serious and fatal incidents, maintain legal compliance, provide safe working conditions, and encourage employee engagement in the safety processes. The plans are built on the previous Top 5 Hazards, which include driving, electrical, falls, powered industrial trucks (PIT), and fixed powered machines (FPM).\n\n## Injuries based on the Top 5 Hazards since 2018\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith regards to compliance, all Schneider Electric sites prepare a legal register, which identifies improvement opportunities and is audited as part of the ISO 45001, external certification.\n\n## 2.2.9.3 Group policy\n\nSafety is a key pillar of the latest Schneider Electric Trust Charter, is reviewed each year and is fully aligned with ISO 45001 and is available publicly.\n\nSchneider Electric is committed to invest in its people and its workplace as stated in its Group Safety and Occupational Health Policy.\n\nSchneider cares for all, including colleagues, customers, contractors, and partners, and wants everyone returning home safe & well every day.\n\nEach employee is responsible for safety and plays a key role in identifying and mitigating hazards. This practice applies at Schneider Electric sites, at customer sites and while driving or traveling.\n\nThe Group values engagement at all levels and:\n\n- \u00b7 Expects each Manager to role model Safety as defined in the Global Safety Strategy (see details below).\n- \u00b7 Empowers employees to Act Like Owners, by having an active role with their personal Health and Safety.\n- \u00b7 Seeks the views of all employees, their representatives and those working on the Group's behalf, through consultation, including their participation in reporting and resolving safety improvement opportunities.\n- \u00b7 Sustains relationships with Suppliers, Contractors and Customers under the condition that Safety commitments are agreed and met.\n\nThe Group provides a safe work environment for all and:\n\n- \u00b7 Invests in resources and training to support Schneider's Safety & Occupational Health vision and goals.\n- \u00b7 Complies to external legal requirements and internal directives.\n- \u00b7 Embeds safety into its business practices and is an integral part of all major decisions, from acquisition, product development, the launch of a business and change management.\n- \u00b7 Is determined to eliminate hazards and reduce risks.\n\nThe Group communicates in an open and transparent manner and:\n\n- \u00b7 Continually improves its Safety & Occupational Health Systems by benchmarking, adopting best available techniques and through continuous learning.\n- \u00b7 Captures, analyzes and communicates safety improvement opportunities, near-misses, and incidents in a systematic manner.\n- \u00b7 Creates global action plans and share with all potentially impacted employees to prevent (re)occurrence.\n- \u00b7 Sets Safety & Occupational Health goals and objectives, monitor performance, and reports progress internally and externally.\n\nConsult and download Schneider's Health & Safety Policy on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

First' at its core, developed as a personal reminder to pause and reflect on safety before beginning any task.\n- \u00b7 Top five hazards, which have been identified and controlled to prevent serious accidents.\n- \u00b7 Five guiding principles, which have been defined to set the expected H&S behaviors.\n- \u00b7 Four strategic priorities, which have been identified as strong levers to deliver the Schneider Electric Policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEach year a global action plan is generated by the H&S corporate team based on previous years' performance and 2025 vision. In 2023 the plan will cover the implementation of a new H&S software solution, a safe driving initiative, a program on high-risk activity and H&S training for front line managers.\n\nA local action plan, managed by each region, complements the global plan and includes the improvements identified by the Environment Health and Safety Assessment deployment, the IMS implementation and the Safety Culture assessment. In 2022 the Safety Culture assessment of Industrial and field service employees had a high engagement rate and employees responded positively to their sites Safety Culture. In 2023 the Safety Culture assessment will be extended to all Schneider Electric employees.\n\nCommunication is important to ensure that standards are known and implemented to provide a safe workplace for everyone and make safety performance visible, so that leaders can take action to continuously improve risk prevention. Each quarter, Schneider Electric focuses on key safety subjects (Quarterly H&S Spotlights) to raise awareness of both workplace and human factors. The campaign, promoting the importance of safety globally, is supported by training materials, posters, employee videos and a quarterly video message from Schneider Electric's top leaders.\n\nSchneider Electric engages employees by using the internal social media tool, Yammer, to post H&S updates, interact with the community and collect feedback from employees. Schneider also encourages employees to report safety opportunities, which are translated into risk reduction actions to engage employees in the H&S program. In 2023, following the good employee engagement (1.5 safety opportunities reported per employee), the focus is now on the completion of improvement actions connected with the safety opportunities.\n\n## 2.2.9.5 Governance\n\nSchneider Electric has a strong H&S governance in place with several instances of control to ensure the H&S strategy is fully deployed.\n\n## Steering Committees\n\n## Quarterly H&S Report to Executive level:\n\nA report is created each quarter by the Global H&S VP and presented to the Executive level. The report includes H&S performance versus targets and H&S program deployment update.\n\n## Monthly Global H&S Steering Committee\n\nEach month the Global H&S team share H&S performance versus targets and H&S program deployment, with the Regional and Organizational H&S VP's.\n\n## Audits & Engagement\n\nIntegrated Management System (IMS) - ISO 45001: The key elements of certification to ISO 45001 includes annual site management review and internal site audit program, and external audit program at site and corporate level. This certification is in place for 211 locations, including 176 manufacturing and logistics sites and the headquarter.\n\nAnnual Environmental Health and Safety Assessments (EHSA): To ensure successful implementation of the strategy, annual EHSA are performed in industrial and customer facing sites worldwide, by the site Safety team and validated by the regional H&S specialist. This assessment is a global process which measures compliance against H&S directives and identifies improvement opportunities and recognizes excellence. The EHSA digital Tool has been deployed in manufacturing and logistics locations in 2022. 96% of sites have carried out a self-assessment and for 84% of sites the assessment has been validated by regional H&S expert.",

The Medical Incident Rate (MIR) is the number of work-related medical incidents (including injuries and occupational illnesses) multiplied by one million hours (average hours of 500 employees working for one calendar year) divided by the total hours worked. Work related injuries and occupational illnesses requiring medical treatment are included. Medical Incidents, where the Injured Party requires hospital treatment for 24hrs, are classified as Serious.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee safety participation trend\n\n## MIR historical trend\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## LTIR historical trend\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe MIR performance has reduced to 0.58 in 2022, which represents a 51% progress of the 2021-2025 program. 2022 was the best performance ever showing a MIR reduction of 11% compared to 2021, this translates to 171 medical incidents, of which 9 were classified as serious without any fatal accidents.\n\nAs a result of all the H&S programs deployed over the last 8 years, Schneider Electric has been very successful in meeting goals for the reduction of workplace injuries and illnesses, including those injuries resulting in lost time days.

This includes 137 Occupational Excellence Achievement Awards from the National Safety Council (NSC) for safety performance that was 50% or better than their industry peer group.\n\nSchneider Electric's Safety VR Program was awarded the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce awards for Collaborative Innovation.\n\nSchneider Electric UK&I received three RoSPA Awards (The Royal Society H&S Performance Awards) during 2022: RoSPA Gold Medal (5 consecutive Golds) Award, RoSPA Fleet Safety Gold Medal (6 consecutive Golds) Award, and RoSPA Winner in the Fleet Safety Trophy.\n\nIn 2022, a Schneider Electric employee, from Australia, was awarded 2021 Safety Representative of the year.\n\n## 2.2.9.8  Future evolution of safety at Schneider Electric\n\nSafety is a never-ending journey towards excellence. Schneider Electric's vision is for all employees and contractors to work in a safe and healthy workplace, so they can perform to their full potential, positively impacting safety for its customers, and therefore always returning home safely to their family.\n\nThis translates into the following health and safety three-year improvement plan:\n\n- \u00b7 To strengthen H&S knowledge, skills, and abilities of all employees and contractors.\n- \u00b7 To equip all leaders to role model H&S at every opportunity and encourage employees to speak up and engage in safety program.\n- \u00b7 To accelerate transformation with digitization, data analytics and promote local innovation to accelerate H&S maturity.\n- \u00b7 To develop and implement effective controls for high-risk activities and to sustain a safe workplace for everyone.\n- \u00b7 To positively impact all stakeholders through effective communications.\n\n## 2.2.10 Vigilance plan\n\n## 2.2.10.1 Context\n\nSchneider Electric seeks to be a role model in its interactions with customers, partners, suppliers, and communities when it comes to ethics and the respect and promotion of human rights. The Group also strives to have a positive impact on the planet and the environment by contributing to finding solutions to limit climate change, and by trying to be more efficient with natural resources.\n\nThe Group's vigilance plan reflects this ambition. It also complies with the provisions of the 2017 French law on Corporate duty of vigilance. The plan includes:\n\n- \u00b7 A risk analysis specific to vigilance risks that Schneider Electric poses to the ecosystem and environment (ie externalities)\n- \u00b7 A review of the key actions implemented to remediate or mitigate these risks;\n- \u00b7 An alert system;\n- \u00b7 Governance specific to vigilance.\n\nIn this Registration document, Schneider Electric reviews the risk analysis and describes the actions that mitigate these risks. Readers are also directed to other sections of the report for relevant and detailed information. For more comprehensive and complete information, the full vigilance plan of the Group is available as a standalone document and can be downloaded from Schneider Electric's website at se.com.\n\nConsult and download Schneider Electric's Vigilance report on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.10.2 Group policy\n\nDuty of Vigilance is a notion that has been evolving significantly over the recent years. In 2017, a French law was introduced, that applies to large multinational companies. In 2023, a similar law will be implemented by Germany and Norway. In 2023 also, a draft for a European directive on vigilance will be presented to the European Parliament for a probable vote in the same year, and a transposition in local laws for each EU member state starting in 2024.\n\nThe objective of Schneider Electric is not only to respect these national laws but also to be at the forefront of the notion of vigilance, and to implement the actions that will contribute to significantly reduce the risk for its ecosystem, whether these actions are part of a law, or part of Schneider Electric's own ambition.\n\n## 2.2.10.3 Governance\n\nThe plan is governed by the Duty of Vigilance Committee, set up in 2017. The steering committee meets twice a year in normal circumstances. Overall, since its inception, 15 Committee meetings have been held (five in 2017, and two per year in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022). The Committee's objective is to provide a discussion on strategic orientation and prioritize initiatives and the resources allocated to their implementation. This Committee also reviews the actions in progress and their results and defines decisions on next steps for action.\n\n## Composition of the Duty of Vigilance Committee\n\n## Chairman:\n\nExecutive Vice-President, Global Supply Chain (Executive Committee member)",

The methodology is based on interviews with internal experts from areas such as Health & Safety, Social Relations, and Data Privacy. In 2021, Schneider expanded the scope of the risk mapping to local communities living close to Schneider locations and customer project sites. In 2022, Schneider initiated specific workshops that include members of the European Work Council. The conclusions of the workshops will be integrated into the 2023 risk evaluation. This process will gradually include other stakeholders, both internal and external.\n\nThe scope of work covers Schneider Electric and its subsidiaries, joint ventures, suppliers, and subcontractors. A review of the downstream supply chain is carried out for a sample of large customer projects.\n\n## Risk categories\n\nFour risk categories have been identified and for a more granular assessment of the risk level based on the nature of that risk and the magnitude of its impact on Schneider Electric's ecosystem, each category has been divided into specific risk areas.\n\nOverall, these risk areas cover more than 60 natures of risk and were selected from a saliency perspective. However, to simplify the reading, they have been grouped into the following sections that are synthesized as below.\n\n## Human rights:\n\n- \u00b7 Decent workplace\n- \u00b7 Health and safety\n\n## Environment :\n\n- \u00b7 Pollution and specific substances management\n- \u00b7 Waste and circularity\n- \u00b7 Energy, CO 2 , and GHG\n\n## Business conduct:\n\n- \u00b7 Ethical business conduct\n- \u00b7 Alert system, protection, and non-retaliation\n\n## Offer safety and cybersecurity:\n\n- \u00b7 Offer safety\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity and data privacy\n\n## Risk location\n\nThe Group has focused on four areas where risks may occur:\n\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric sites: these have been segmented based on categories that present a specific level of risk. For example, office buildings, R&D laboratories and production factories each carry a different level of risk.\n- \u00b7 Suppliers: the level of risk differs based on the type of process and technologies used, and the Group has therefore segmented the analysis by component category of purchase. The risk level is an average assessment. The geographical location is factored in when selecting suppliers for the audit plan;\n- \u00b7 Contractors: when implementing a customer project, such as building a large electrical system at a customer's site, Schneider Electric works with contractors, leveraging their expertise (civil work, electrical contracting, etc.). This 'off-site' project work bears specific risks for contractors. A separate 'off-site and projects execution' category for contractors has therefore been defined for the assessment.\n- \u00b7 Local Communities: Schneider Electric has identified two distinct segments: communities located around Schneider Electric sites and communities located around customer project sites. Communities have been assessed against three risk categories: human rights, environment, and business ethics.\n\n## Risk evaluation and scale\n\nThe evaluation combines the probability of occurrence of the risk, with the seriousness of potential impacts. The risk level displayed in the matrix is an evaluation before impact of mitigation actions ('gross risk'). After taking into consideration the impact of these mitigation actions, the level of risk may be significantly reduced. However, this 'net risk' is not reported in the matrix. Risks are assessed on the following scale:\n\n## 1 - Non-existent; 2 - Low; 3 - Medium; 4 - High; 5 - Very high.\n\nIn this 2022 risk assessment, no 'very high' risks were identified.\n\n## Key findings\n\nThe overall risk mapping exercise across Schneider's value chain is detailed in the matrix below, and can be summarized as follows:\n\n## Medium to high risk: Suppliers\n\nSchneider uses a large panel of suppliers across different geographies in the world: more than 53,000 in the first tier, and several million at the level of tier 2 and above.\n\n- -Human Rights have been identified as a key risk, especially in countries where labor laws and social protection are below average standards. The areas of concern are mostly around safety at work, decent workplace and labor standards. The most frequent issues detected by Schneider's audits are related to decent working hours, paid leave and proper resting time;\n- -CO 2 emissions coming from the transformation of raw materials into components, and then the transportation of these components, have been identified as an area of risk. This risk is quantified in the Scope 3 'upstream' analysis of the company's carbon footprint;\n- -A few very specific pollution risks are linked with some categories of purchases, due to the nature of substances used (solvents, Greenhouse gases, etc\u2026).\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 2.2  Driving responsible business with Trust\n\n## Medium to high risk: Contractors\n\nAmong Schneider's 53,000 tier 1 suppliers, 9,900 are off-site contractors (or otherwise called solutions suppliers), working on the construction sites for customer projects. Key risks identified are:\n\n- -Health and Safety has been identified as a high risk, mostly linked to the physical injuries that can happen during construction, or when doing services and maintenance operations. Some of the risks are specific to the presence of electrical equipment, and some other risks are more general to a construction site.\n- -Business Ethics is also identified as a risk due to the contractual nature of this activity. Specifically, corruption, conflict of interest and integrity are the most salient subjects.\n- -Human Rights is an area of concern, as these contractors often resort to temporary manpower, contracted for the duration of the construction at conditions that may not respect decent work standards. In several countries, this manpower is also coming from other countries of origin, therefore at risk of being forced labor or in the difficult condition of migrant workers.\n\n## Low to medium risk: Schneider entities and sites\n\nSchneider Electric is operating in 100+ countries, with 162 production factories, 84 distribution centers, and about 800 commercial offices and R&D laboratories. The risk evaluation for these locations has been assessed from low to medium, with the exception of cybersecurity, which is considered high (see below).\n\n- -Health and Safety risks mostly concern production sites, especially when the components or equipment manufactured are heavy (medium voltage activities) or when electrical tests are being performed (project execution centers). The risk is also concentrated on the service teams, as their activity is performed on customer sites, and in the frequent presence of powered electrical systems.\n- -Human rights concerns are linked to working hours and business pressure, these two subjects also being linked to social dialogue. Following the challenge of COVID-19, supply chain disruptions have left little room for teams to rest, therefore increasing the overall fatigue, and its consequences on mental health.\n\nSpecific situation of cybersecurity on Schneider Electric sites and systems: as Schneider is a supplier of connected components and software for complex, digital solutions, the company is a potential target for cyberattacks aimed at reaching its customer's systems. Therefore, Schneider considers this risk as high, and top of the agenda for its support to customers.\n\n## Low to medium risk: local communities\n\nThe ongoing risk evaluation for communities living around Schneider Electric sites (factories, offices) demonstrates that the level of risk is mostly low to medium, as Schneider Electric operations are usually located in large, well-structured urban areas. A very limited number of production sites may be an exception to this, and they are the subject of a specific review.\n\nAs regards customer projects, the review of a sample of large projects shows that in most instances, impacts on local communities are limited. However, in a few specific cases, interactions with communities are significant, and require greater attention. As these projects are usually very different from one another, a 'customized' approach is necessary, both for risk evaluation, and selection of mitigation actions.\n\n## Special mention of Carbon emissions for customers (scope 3)\n\nSince the beginning of the vigilance plan in 2017, the focus has been on Schneider operations, on the upstream supply chain and the transformation programs associated (supplier vigilance, contractors, The Zero Carbon Project, Decent Work, etc.). The downstream part of the supply chain has not yet been the subject of an evaluation from a Human Rights perspective. However it has been analyzed from the perspective of climate and CO 2 emissions. Scope 3 carbon emissions have been quantified, and several major action plans are deployed as part of Schneider's Net-Zero Commitment. Schneider considers that acting on carbon and climate are key responsibilities of the company. The Duty of Vigilance section does not provide details of these measures. For more information, please see the description of the program included in Chapter 2.3 'Leading on decarbonization', page 148.\n\n## Comparison of the 2022 analysis with 2021:\n\nThe following items have evolved:\n\n- - Psycho-social risks are increasing. Although this is difficult to quantify, the impact of a complex business environment and the pressure it entails is having consequences on employee well-being and mental health, This subject is carefully monitored at global and local level;\n- - Business Ethics is also at risk due to the highly competitive pressure commercial teams are facing;\n\nGiven the increasing complexity of regulatory environment, combined with the increased sophistication of the Group's software and systems, the subject of data privacy (employees and customers) is also the subject of specific attention;\n\nSchneider is using an independent database and risk assessment methodology for its suppliers from the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). In 2022, RBA reviewed some of the parameters used in its database. Some of the adjustments are merely 'technical', and some others reflect a slight degradation of risk parameters for specific categories of suppliers. The consequence for Schneider is that the number of 'risky suppliers' increased from 1,300 to 3,000. In response, Schneider's on-site supplier audit program remains focused on the top 1,300 risky suppliers. The 1,700 remaining suppliers are covered by the digital selfassessment tool; which allows to monitor suppliers that may become eligible for an on-site audit (see more details in the section 'Vigilance plan for suppliers' later in this report).\n\n2023 German Law on Supply Chain Due Diligence: Schneider Electric has significant operations in Germany and is subject to the new vigilance law that came into force in January 2023. The specific requirements of this law are being integrated into the global Vigilance Plan.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.11  Relationships with project execution contractors\n\n## 2.2.11.1 Context\n\nSchneider Electric's products and solutions are usually combined into larger systems such as electricity distribution and energy management in a building, or production process automation in a factory. The building of such systems can be complex and typically involves several different parties before they are commissioned by end customers.\n\nFor Schneider Electric, there are two options: to sell components through channel partners who take the responsibility to build and deliver the system; or to build and deliver the system directly for the end customer, as a project. This second option requires coordinating several project contractors (panel manufacturers, system integrators, building contractors, etc.), usually on the premises of the end customer. The common characteristics of these projects are that they happen primarily off-site (mostly on customer premises, existing or future), and they involve several different parties, global or local, bringing their added value. Each project is unique in its size, duration, and location.\n\nTherefore, relationships with contractors are specific to a contract, and not necessarily recurrent. In 2022, Schneider Electric worked with approximately 10,000 solution suppliers in the Group's portfolio (with a total spend of approximately \u20ac1 billion please note that not all of them may be simultaneously active during a year).\n\n## 2.2.11.2  Risks and opportunities\n\nHuman Rights: as project sites are located in countries where Schneider Electric may not be present, and involve independent subcontractors, there is a risk that the standard policies recommended by Schneider Electric in terms of health and safety, as well as decent workplace, may not be properly implemented. The main risks are physical accidents and injuries, or the improper treatment of employees (wages and salaries, resting time), especially temporary and/or foreign employees.\n\nBusiness Ethics: Projects that are conducted in countries where business ethics standards are insufficient may be subject to ethical risks such as corruption, bribery, or pressures of a similar nature.\n\nCybersecurity: Some subcontractors may have digital interactions with the end customer and Schneider Electric at the same time. Therefore, their level of cybersecurity and data protection may create some risks for the project and the final customer.\n\nA rigorous management of subcontractors supports a reduction in risks of incidents or accidents on site, and therefore protects workers, the communities living around the project site, and the final customer's employees and assets.\n\n## 2.2.11.3  Group policy and governance\n\nIn 2021, to further anticipate and reinforce its risk mitigation measures, the Group introduced an evolution of its project decision-making process. The aim is to include a risk assessment of human rights and environmental impacts at all key milestones of the process, and to select the mitigation measures that will enable Schneider Electric to reduce these risks. During the execution of the project, a regular review of the efficiency and effectiveness of these measures will be conducted. This process evolution has been implemented in pilot mode to project reviews in 2022, on a selection of projects based on their size. The process will be gradually enlarged based on the pilot's result.\n\nThe overall governance for this topic is under the responsibility of the Duty of Vigilance steering committee. The implementation of actions is a joint responsibility between procurement teams and global customer projects teams.\n\n## 2.2.11.4  Actions and impacts\n\nOut of the 10,000 solutions suppliers, Schneider Electric has identified about 130 solution suppliers categorized as 'high risk'. Since 2018, around 80 of those suppliers have been audited, with 17 audits performed in 2022 leading to Schneider raising 190 non-conformances. Out of these non-conformances, 7 were assessed as 'top priority' for two suppliers.\n\nThe most recurring non-conformances with high-risk solution contractors are related to labor, in particular terms of working contract which needs to be provided in writing and in workers' native language, and working hours which need to be better controlled not to exceeding standard.\n\nAs a consequence of 2022 audits, it has been decided to stop business with one solution supplier.\n\nIn addition to these non-conformances, specific risks related to local contract negotiation and relations with local authorities may occur.\n\nActions following non-conformances are the same as with other suppliers (re-audits, trainings, workshops). Specific measures are implemented for this project environment: Schneider Electric implements regular reviews of safety incidents on customers' sites, involving the Global Safety team and the Project Management leadership. The Group has also reinforced training on AntiCorruption and Business Agent policies for its employees involved in commercial negotiations. The project follow-up with contractors and the selection processes for contractors have been adapted to ensure vigilance topics are considered early in the project stage.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 2.2  Driving responsible business with Trust\n\n## 2.2.12  Sustainable relationships with suppliers\n\n## 2.2.12.1 Context\n\nSchneider Electric is the most local of global companies, with a presence in more than 100+ countries and a revenue and employee footprint almost evenly distributed across major geographies. While this provides a balanced market position, it also results in a supply base that is almost evenly distributed across the world. In 2022, Schneider Electric sourced goods and services from more than 53,000 suppliers, across more than 60 categories amounting to approximately \u20ac16 billion. This diverse supply base represents a unique combination of mature companies operating on a global scale, to small & medium scale enterprises serving local or niche markets and categories which require simple assembly to complex manufacturing activities. Deeply committed to advance all UN SDGs, and delivering solutions for sustainability and efficiency, Schneider Electric is in a unique position to influence and support its supply chain partners to progress and embrace more sustainable social and environmental practices.\n\n## 2.2.12.2  Risks and opportunities\n\nOwing to the location, size and nature of the Group's operations, its operating environment is directly impacted by climate change, resource scarcity and human rights issues across its global supply base. While the impact of Schneider's own operations is relatively limited, the footprint of its wider supply chain is more significant and affected by the evolving trends. As an example, GHG emissions from its upstream supply chain is estimated to be 25 times higher than its operations emissions.\n\nBy taking a combined approach to proactively managing upstream supplier risks through Schneider Electric's Vigilance plan, while also driving ambitious Sustainable Development programs and processes, Schneider Electric secures its business resilience and increases its attractivity to customers, investors or new talents.\n\nKey risks identified by the Vigilance risk assessment include human rights (in particular safety at work, decent workplace and labor standards), CO 2 emissions (especially coming from the transformation of raw materials into components and their transport), and pollution risks linked with some specific purchases categories.\n\n## 2.2.12.3  Group policy and governance\n\nOur global procurement mission aims to strongly align with our company strategy of delivering customer value through transformation of energy management. We will do this by contributing to top line and bottom line growth, while establishing a leadership position in sustainable sourcing. Our key priorities of Quality, Innovation, Cost, Cash and Sustainability are strongly supported by our people, our Tailored, Connected, Sustainable Supply Chain and Digitization. As a key part of our end-to-end supply chain, we count on our suppliers to be strong contributors across all aspects of performance.\n\nSchneider Electric embeds sustainability at every stage of supplier lifecycle. It starts with the mission of the global procurement organization, which embodies sustainability in its core. In addition to top line growth and bottom-line impact, sustainability in sourcing operations is one of the three key enablers for procurement function and firmly institutionalized.\n\nIn order to sensitize all current and potential suppliers about expectations and various stages of collaboration with Schneider Electric, a Guide Book is documented, initially launched in 2016 and updated regularly. The document articulates expectations for suppliers on sustainable development in the following five areas: environment, fair and ethical business practices, sustainable procurement, labor practices, and human rights and subsequently dwells on various stages for approval, qualification, and performance evaluation.\n\nConsult and download Schneider's Supplier Guidebook on the Suppliers page on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supplier collaboration steps\n\nSchneider Electric deploys a three-step process comprising of Supplier Approval Module (SAM), Supplier Qualification Module (SQM) and Supplier Performance Module (SPM), to qualify new and legacy suppliers for continued business association, where Sustainability performance is a key evaluation criteria.\n\n## Supplier Approval Module (SAM)\n\nThe journey of a new supplier starts with the SAM. This module has a dedicated evaluation on labor, ethics, environment, and occupational health & safety, in addition to other elements. It is a questionnaire-based evaluation combined with on-site audits by Schneider Electric auditors. For all new suppliers, it is mandatory to undergo this evaluation and only approved partners can proceed to next stage of functional and technical audits required for business qualification. Legacy suppliers are also required to periodically renew the approval module.\n\n## Supplier Risk Management (SRiM)\n\nThe SAM assessment results have an impact on the overall risk profile of the supplier managed by the SRiM process. Suppliers with low and medium risk are favored for business association, and those with high risk are requested to work on risk mitigation plan.\n\n## Supplier Qualification Module (SQM)\n\nPost the successful approval module the suppliers undergo SQM, which evaluates the technical feasibility with respect to the supplies, and after successful completion the supplier can begin the commercial association by supplying products to Schneider Electric.\n\n## Supplier Performance Module (SPM)\n\nDuring the commercial stage the performance of supplier is constantly evaluated by the SPM. Different functional teams evaluate different performance parameters, including sustainability as one of the pillars and the overall performance has an impact on the nature of business relationship (strategic or non-strategic).",

All business reviews with suppliers and internal functional business reviews with department Executives cover the sustainability performance as a key criteria of evaluation.\n\n## General Procurement Terms and Conditions\n\nAll Schneider Electric suppliers must abide by the General Procurement Terms and Conditions: each supplier undertakes to apply the principles and guidelines of the ISO 26000, the rules defined in the ISO 14001 standard.\n\nSuppliers also commit to respect all national legislation / regulations, REACH regulation, RoHS directives, and, more generally, the laws and regulations relating to the prohibition or restriction of use of certain products or substances. Lastly, suppliers are expected to report the presence and country of origin of any and all conflict minerals supplies in accordance with the requirements of the US Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 known as the 'Conflict Minerals' law. In this context, Schneider Electric has a 'conflict-free' objective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsult and download Schneider General Procurement Terms and Conditions from the Suppliers page on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBest in class level\n\nCurrent level\n\nDevelopment Area\n\nGaps in performance must be tackled by suppliers themselves or through development programs initiated by Schneider Electric (Quality, Logistics, Lean\u2026)\n\nFor Indirect Procurement; Quality, Delivery & Logistics are merged into 1 dimension: Service Level\n\n## Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nThe foundation of Schneider Electric's sustainability ambition is its own Supplier Code of Conduct. It is the mother document of all supplier relationships and lists out the basic expectations with its suppliers across, but not limited to, environment, human rights and decent work, fair business practices, sustainability procurements, occupation health and safety. The document also provides access to remedy by means of Trust Line, which is the ethics hotline of Schneider Electric. Any partner can access this help line to raise concern associated with ethical or sustainability standards with respect to business association.

This ensures sustainability is embedded in the routine operational activities of all procurement team working around the world.\n\nThe framework also identifies thematic areas across ESG spectrum, where Schneider Electric has material impact and can play an industry transforming role. Collaborating and engaging with supply partners to develop maturity on climate action, circularity, human rights and challenging status-quo allows to unlock newer areas of growth. The Group's ambitious sustainability roadmap leads its partners to define the next wave of evolution of industry, making them fore-runners who shape the future. This pursuit of sustainability helps identify new and several hidden avenues of efficiency, operational improvement and creating and capturing new markets, which provide competitive advantage and positively corelate with financial performance. All engagements within Schneider Electric and its supply base establish that sustainability is good for business and has to be looked at as an opportunity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

This evaluation covers sustainability risks and specific parameters such as the type of industrial process used by the suppliers, their technology, and the geographic location. This allows the Group to factor in risks that may arise from a country's specific situation (social, political, etc.). These parameters are compiled in a third-party independent database (Responsible Business Alliance methodology, RBA, ex-EICC, of which Schneider Electric has been a member since January 2018). Schneider Electric's entire network of about 53,000 tier 1 suppliers is processed through this methodology and is refreshed every year with the new supplier baseline in order to identify high risk suppliers.\n\n## Overall plan\n\nThe audit plan started in 2018. 2020 was the third year of implementation and Schneider Electric completed 3 years schedule with 374 audits.\n\nFrom 2021 to 2025, Schneider Electric has defined new objectives as part of its sustainability strategy: expanding from the previous plan, the Group set an objective to conduct 1,000 on-site audits of high-risk suppliers and deploy 3,000 self-assessment audits for other suppliers not in the high-risk category. This audit plan is integrated into the Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE #17) and progress is externally assured and published each year.\n\nFor the Group's 2022 plan, about 1,300 'high risk' suppliers have been identified; this number varies depending on the year.\n\n## ~53,000 suppliers\n\n## RBA Risk assessment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\nSSE #17 indicator: 4,000 suppliers assessed under Schneider Electric's 'Vigilance Program'",

        "page_content": "## On-site audits\n\nSchneider Electric's on-site audit questionnaire and audit methodology are fully aligned with the RBA framework. The RBA framework is linked to the Duty of Vigilance risk matrix categories as follow:\n\n- \u00b7 Human Rights and decent workplace: 36 questions\n- \u00b7 Health and safety: 40 questions\n- \u00b7 Environment: 21 questions\n- \u00b7 Offer Safety: non-applicable in RBA framework. More details about Schneider's quality strategy are provided in section '2.2.6 High standards for the quality and safety of our products' page 119.\n- \u00b7 Business Conduct: 11 questions\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity: non-applicable in RBA framework. More details about Schneider's end-to-end cybersecurity approach are provided in section '2.2.7 Digital trust and security' page 122.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, despite COVID-19 travel restrictions during the first part of the year, notably in Asia, the Group conducted 223 initial on-site audits with suppliers (audits conducted for the first time with a supplier). These audits allow Schneider Electric to identify non-conformances and request the supplier to implement corrective actions. Re-audits were then conducted to review the corrective actions implemented to remediate non-conformances identified during the initial audit and validate the closure.\n\nInformation and findings regarding on-site audits with new suppliers are described below.\n\nMost non-conformance in 2022 were related to health and safety, labor standards and management systems (32%, 27%, and 23% respectively). Graph 3 provides the breakdown of nonconformances by topic and graph 4 by geography.\n\nFor the most serious non-conformances, each case is escalated is to the Chief Procurement Officer level. An analysis of the 172 'top priorities' raised in 2022 shows the following issues are the most recurring:\n\n- \u00b7 Labor standards (47% of top priority non-conformance issues): lack of respect of working time and resting days (time measurement systems are often insufficient); poor overtime reporting and payment; lack of formalization of working contracts.\n- \u00b7 Health and safety (44% of top priority non-conformance issues): weak emergency procedures; insufficient emergency training issues and preparation drills; insufficient fire alarm and protection systems; lack of medical response equipment\n- \u00b7 Environment and management systems (9% of top priorities): lack of administrative compliance, management tools, and systems; and insufficient waste management and pollution prevention systems.\n\nAs of end of 2022, Schneider Electric has closed 90% of 2021 and 28% of 2022 non-conformances (all types). Schneider Electric's approach is to help suppliers remediate the issues by sharing good practices and providing them with guidance and training. When non-conformances are not remediated (mainly top priorities), escalation to the Chief Procurement Officer may lead to the end of the business relationship. In 2022, two relationships with suppliers were terminated, including a contractor for project execution.\n\nIn 2022, Schneider Electric implemented a program to review a selected number of audits that were carried out in previous years to review whether the non-conformances resolution measures were still in place and durable. So far, no major drift has been identified, confirming the efficiency of the program.\n\n## Self-assessments\n\nIn 2021, a specific self-assessment questionnaire was developed, building on the experiences of on-site audits performed during previous years. Among the questions asked, the core ones aim to check whether the suppliers are compliant on mandatory subjects of labor, human rights, environment, and health and safety. The two main goals of this assessment are to help the supplier to reflect on its compliance to vigilance standards, and for Schneider Electric to identify whether on-site audits may be necessary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4,000 suppliers assessed under our 'Vigilance Program'\n\nOverall, the resolution of non-conformances identified since the program's inception in 2017 has supported the improvement of the working conditions for 250,000 employees.\n\n- \u00b7  Decent Work: during an audit, Schneider Electric identified a medium size company active in plastic molding that did not correctly pay overtime to workers. The overtime was measured, but not paid in full as it should have been. The supplier acknowledged the situation and proceeded to recalculate the amounts due. Two months after the audit, the situation was corrected. After the re-audit, Schneider Electric validated the resolution, and the non-conformance was closed. The supplier now precisely tracks the working hours and makes payment of overtime at the legal rate.\n- \u00b7  Health & Safety: during an audit, Schneider Electric's auditor noticed that the fire alarm/fire detection system was not operative. An analysis of the root cause showed that the emergency activation point was blocked. The supplier worked with its safety contractor to analyze the root cause, and subsequently implement remediation actions. A comprehensive maintenance plan was implemented following this event. After two months, a reaudit was carried out to verify compliance and Schneider Electric decided to close the nonconformance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Procurement teams reviewed the answers and identified a few suppliers where on-site audits were conducted to ensure suppliers have implemented corrective actions.\n\nIn order to reinforce the co-ordination between Schneider Electric teams and suppliers on vigilance topics, a specific training program has been implemented. The primary target audience is the Schneider Electric Procurement team, and the training modules aim to increase their knowledge on the nature of risks, so they can integrate these topics early in the discussions with suppliers.

Most were related to health and safety and labor issues. Among the most serious ones are issues of fire safety, protection of workers from accidents and injuries, respect of a decent working time including proper resting periods and payment of overtime.\n\nSchneider Electric is well on track to reach the new target. The 223 on site audits performed in 2022 have allowed Schneider to raise 2,700+ non-conformances. Out of these non-conformances, 170+ are assessed as 'top priority' and are given very specific attention during the re-audits of the suppliers. Schneider Electric's objective is to close 100% of all types of non-conformances identified, whatever their priority level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nend of 2022, approximately 800 employees have taken this training. These trainings combine in-class experience with e-learning sessions.\n\nTo raise suppliers' awareness, improve their ability to identify risks earlier, and implement mitigation solutions, Schneider Electric organized face-to-face workshops dedicated to vigilance subjects. At the end of 2022, approximately 1,000 supplier team members had attended these events. These sessions include in-class face-to-face workshops and digital webinars.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.12.6  Promotion of a continuous improvement process based on the ISO 26000 standard for strategic suppliers\n\nSustainable development is one of the pillars to measure supplier performance, allowing the highest-performing suppliers to become and remain 'strategic' suppliers. Performance resulting from the EcoVadis / ISO26000 evaluation is a key element of the sustainable development strategy and SRiM process. The results of the assessment are an integral part of the business reviews scheduled between buyers and suppliers on a quarterly to yearly basis. The goal is to share with suppliers all improvement plans to put in place before next assessment, in order to improve all aspects of their sustainability posture, based on facts and clear recommendations.\n\nThe Group has set out to engage all its strategic suppliers in a process of continuous improvement in sustainability. At the end of 2022, strategic suppliers represented c. 55% of Schneider Electric's purchases volume. Strategic suppliers who have passed the third-party evaluation process cover 70%+ of total strategic purchasing volume.\n\nIn 2018, the Group took on the ambitious target of achieving +5 points out of 100 in the average ISO 26000 assessment score of its strategic suppliers between 2018 and 2020 as part of the SSI. In 2019, this target was raised to +5.5 points. At the end of 2020, +6.3 points were achieved, with an average of 57.4 points.\n\nThe new ambition for 2021 - 2025 is to raise the bar even higher to achieve an average of 65 points within 5 years.\n\n2021 end of year result was +1.3 points with an average of 58.7 points, and , the target set at +1.6 points was achieved, so to reach 60.3/100 average score. Overall, since end 2017 the average ISO26000 score of Schneider's strategic suppliers has increased by more than 9 points.\n\n## ISO 26000 Program Progress\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAverage EcoVadis score\n\nTarget\n\nNote that average score of companies assessed by EcoVadis more than 100,000 companies is approximately 45 points. It means Schneider' strategic suppliers sustainability position is much more mature than the global average.\n\n## 2.2.12.7  Conflict Minerals program\n\nIn August 2012, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted the Conflict Minerals rule as part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As defined by the legislation, 'conflict minerals' include the metals tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold, often called '3TG', which are the extracts of the minerals cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, and wolframite, respectively. The legislation focuses on the sourcing of these minerals to be 'DRC conflict free' meaning when these minerals were extracted, they did not directly or indirectly benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. This rule requires companies to conduct a 'reasonable country of minerals' origin inquiry' and due diligence to determine whether 'conflict minerals', as defined in the rule, are used in their supply chain.\n\nAlthough the US SEC Conflict Minerals rule does not apply directly to Schneider Electric - since it is not registered with the US SEC - it is deeply concerned about social and environmental conditions in some mines that could supply metals for its products. As part of the Group's sustainable business practices, it is committed to increasing its responsible metal sourcing efforts.\n\nIn working towards these commitments, Schneider Electric has taken numerous steps including:\n\n- \u00b7 Updating its Procurement Terms and Conditions to reflect its expectations of suppliers.\n- \u00b7 Establishing a 'Conflict Minerals Compliance program' supported and sponsored by its top leadership. This program was developed based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRA) and other appropriate international standards, which covers a wider scope of minerals and countries.\n- \u00b7 Identifying the use of conflict minerals in its products.\n- \u00b7 Engaging with its suppliers so that they respond in a timely manner to its requests for evidence of compliance.\n- \u00b7 Participating in smelter outreach program.\n\nSchneider Electric is working with an expert third party, collecting information from its suppliers to identify the source of the minerals in question and ensure they are recognized as 'conflict-free' within established international standards such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), and others. The Group is aware of the complexity of this task, and that it will take time to collect the required information, but it is committed to contributing to this responsible sourcing initiative as well as responding to its customers' potential concerns.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The reduction of 14% points is due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and the campaign is still ongoing, and the Group is still working on eliminating all unwanted smelters from its supply chain. At the time of the creation of this report the due diligence process is still ongoing and the campaign will close at the end of February 2023. Schneider Electric is actively working with its suppliers and closely monitors its supply chain to comply with the Conflict Minerals regulations and meet the Customers' expectations as much as possible. Based on current knowledge, the Group has no reason to believe that any conflict minerals the Group sourced, have directly or indirectly financed or benefitted armed conflict in the covered countries, nor supported illegally operating or sanctioned entities.\n\nConsult the page dedicated to Suppliers on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cobalt and Mica program\n\nMid-2020, Schneider Electric added cobalt to its Conflict Minerals Compliance program and added Mica in 2021, shifting to Extended Minerals Program. Cobalt and Mica sales have been identified as potentially funding or supporting inhumane treatment, including human trafficking, slavery, forced labor, child labor, torture, and war crimes in known CAHRA. These areas are identified by the presence of armed conflict, widespread violence, or other risks of harm to people, and are often characterized by widespread human rights abuses and violations of national or international law.\n\nThe program is focusing on the responsible sourcing of cobalt used as a key element for lithium-ion batteries in Schneider Electric's supply chain. With 64% data collected (that is relevant to 90% of the spend of selected suppliers), 100% of the smelters and refiners identified in the Group's supply chain were designated as compliant with a recognized third-party validation scheme or actively engaging in same approach. Therefore, the Group has no reason to believe that any Cobalt or Mica the Group sourced, have directly or indirectly financed or benefitted armed conflict in the covered countries, nor supported illegally operating or sanctioned entities.\n\n## 2.2.12.8 REACH and RoHS\n\nSchneider Electric is rolling out several eco-responsible initiatives with its suppliers.\n\nFor example, Schneider has chosen to go further than the European REACH and RoHS regulations. The approach is rolled out in the Group over the whole product portfolio and to all suppliers, regardless of their geographic origin. To support the REACH and RoHS projects, Schneider has implemented a data collection process supported by a dedicated team to gather the required information from its suppliers. This has allowed it to significantly reduce its response time to collect such information and therefore be quicker to respond to its customers' inquiries. In addition to data collection, the Group put in place a review process for this data to guarantee its quality. Through this process, the level of verification required for a given supplier can be adjusted in order to make the controls more stringent in cases where deviations have been detected.\n\nAnother example is Schneider's commitment to supporting the small and medium enterprises (SME) network. This support is enabled by working in an adapted manner with certain suppliers. In France, Schneider Electric is a major player in the International SME Pact.\n\nFinally, by the very nature of its activity, the Group continually encourages its ecosystem (including customers and suppliers) to implement energy efficient solutions.\n\n## 2.2.12.9  The Zero Carbon Project (SSI #3)\n\nIn 2022 Schneider Electric's new Net-Zero commitment was validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. The Group aims to reduce its scope 3 emissions by 25% by 2030 and by 90% by 2050 against a 2021 baseline. This means that all Schneider factories and transportation, and those of its suppliers in the entire upstream value chain need to transition towards operating without using any fossil fuel and run only on clean energy. To achieve this ambitious target, as a first step Schneider has launched The Zero Carbon Project, which aims to cut 50% of operational carbon emissions from its top 1,000 suppliers by 2025 (SSI #3). At the end of 2022 SSI #3 achieved a remarkable 10% performance and has laid the ground to accelerate decarbonization in the coming years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more details on The Zero Carbon Project in Chapter 2.3 'Leading on decarbonization' page 148 , and in chapter 2.7 'Methodology and audit of indicators' page 242 .\n\nConsult our webpage dedicated to The Zero Carbon Project from the Sustainability section on www.se.com\n\n## 2.2.12.10  Green materials (SSI #4) and sustainable packaging (SSI #5)\n\n## Green Materials (SSI #4)\n\nSimilarly, an initiative has been launched to increase the proportion of green material in Schneider products to 50% by 2025 (SSI #4).\n\nThe scope of this initiative currently includes about 30% of Schneider's procurement volume:\n\n- \u00b7 thermoplastics (direct and indirect purchase);\n- \u00b7 steel (direct purchase); and\n- \u00b7 aluminum (direct purchase).\n\nOther kinds of materials such as steel purchased as fabricated components, other non-ferrous metals (such as copper, silver or brass), and thermoset, both direct and indirect procurement, will be considered for the next phases. At the end of 2022, 18% of materials in scope were qualified as 'Green', following specific criteria.\n\nFor thermoplastics, the 2022 performance was achieved mainly by embedding recycled plastics in products and by obtaining supplier proof for both recycled and green flame retardant.",

During the period of 2018 2020 the Company implemented an initiative to successfully move to 99% of cardboard and pallets used in the transport of goods to be sourced from recycled or certified sources.\n\nIn 2021, this ambition was extended to use recycled cardboard in all primary and secondary packaging and remove all single use plastic from Schneider packaging by 2025 (SSI #5). To achieve this transformation, a two-pronged approach is deployed. On the one hand, a cross functional team is deployed to review the packaging design and explore and authorize the use of alternate materials for packaging; on the other hand, various procurement teams engage with suppliers across regions to ensure the deployment of the roadmap by the suppliers to meet the prescribed requirements.\n\nTo ensure streamlined actions, dedicated categories of packaging material were identified to be included in the transformation. As a result of concerted efforts by various teams, over 45% of the packaging spend in scope was attributed to sustainable packaging and the end of 2022, vs 21% end 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more details on the sustainable packaging program in chapter 2.4 'Be efficient with resources', page 174 , and in chapter 2.7 'Methodology and audit of indicators' page 242 .\n\n## 2.2.12.11 Decent work\n\n## Context\n\nSupply chains power the economic engine of the world. On the one hand they help companies leverage the global capabilities and benefit from collective genius; on the other hand, they help economies progress and engage in global commerce. However, the benefits of this global integration are often unequally distributed. One of the areas where this is prominent is working conditions and rights available to the workers in their workplace.\n\n## Working condition crisis\n\nStudies and research across the world have shown that mere involvement in global commerce is not sufficient to uplift underprivileged populations. According to the United Nations, over 700 million workers lived in extreme or moderate poverty in 2018 and as per estimates by civil society organizations, more than 50 million people are trapped in modern day slavery worldwide, with more than 70% being women and children. The COVID-19 onslaught had a catastrophic impact on employment conditions. A survey by the United Nations Global Compact revealed that global labor income declined by an average of 10% in the first three quarters of 2020 compared with 2019. Widespread job losses and loss of earning members increase insecurity, making workers vulnerable to poor and exploitative working conditions. The scale of this challenge is too great to be handled by governments alone. Corporations need to take responsibility and do their part in ensuring that worker rights are respected universally.\n\n## Decent Work Program\n\nThe extent and severity of the crisis requires a systematic, broad based, ecosystem approach and not simple rectification of observed malpractices. The focus needs to be opening dialogue and normalizing universal worker rights irrespective of the geography or the context of employment.\n\nThe Decent Work Program focuses on engaging suppliers to protect worker rights, going beyond the regulatory requirements and prevailing normative practices. The initiative is aimed at implementing preventive controls that act as an additional buffer against any potential violations and reduce the likelihood of any malpractices. Gradually, such actions need to become the new norm for evaluating performance of the supply chain.\n\nThe key requirements of the initiative are based on the principles of decent work, promulgated by the International Labour Organization (ILO), and also leverage concurrent issues, to make it comprehensive. The details of the 10 pillars forming the foundation of the program are outlined on the next page.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe scope of the program includes strategic suppliers across direct (also known as production) and indirect (known as nonproduction) procurement.\n\nThe initiative adopts the approach of a development program, acknowledging that the program criteria may be new for many suppliers and Schneider Electric will need to support them by handholding, capacity building, and constant engagement for implementation. To facilitate the execution by suppliers in a gradual way, the program is split in two stages.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

A specifically trained team of associates from the Global Procurement Services (GPS) lead the launch of the initiative. The suppliers are required to respond to the questions and upload evidence to support the responses. All responses and accompanying evidence are evaluated to meet the minimum criteria of decent work. In cases where the supplier actions do not meet the minimum requirements, feedback is given, and corrective actions need to be implemented by the suppliers in a timely manner. Upon rectification, the information needs to be resubmitted along with the evidence for the re-evaluation.\n\nTo formally record suppliers' commitment to the Decent Work Program, a participation confirmation survey is sent to the suppliers. Once the supplier responds in the affirmative, the decent work program stage 1 survey is sent to them for participation.\n\nDuring the year, 765 suppliers were invited to participate in the Decent Work Program and by the end of 2022, more than 525 suppliers agreed to join the program, and engagements are underway to onboard other eligible suppliers. Owing to the dynamic nature of the supplier categorization, Schneider Electric will review the list of eligible suppliers on an annual basis and ensure inclusion of relevant suppliers in the program. In addition to English, the program requirements were also translated into Mandarin, including trainings to ensure adequate coverage for suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 100% of our strategic suppliers\n\n## provide decent work to their employees\n\nDuring the year Schneider Electric conducted four dedicated sessions for procurement teams worldwide, to introduce the program, its objective and requirements of implementation. These sessions were attended by more than 225 procurement staff. 23 sessions were organized during the year to sensitize and equip the suppliers about the rationale, structure and implementation requirements of the program. These sessions included focused group trainings as well as one to one dedicated trainings for the suppliers and were attended by more than 350 supplier participants. As of end of 2022, 473 suppliers have been invited to respond to the decent work program stage 1 questionnaire, 104 suppliers have responded to the survey and 13 suppliers were assessed as compliant post the evaluation of their responses and validation of required documentation.\n\n2022 Baseline\n\n2025 target\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\n100%\n\n2022 Progress\n\n## 2.2.12.12 Supplier diversity program in the United States\n\nSchneider Electric's US supplier diversity program strives to identify, include, and engage qualified diverse suppliers to support the company's goals and foster equal opportunities.\n\nSchneider Electric US is in constant pursuit of qualified businesses that are certified as one, or more, of the following business classifications and provide quality products and services at competitive prices:\n\n- \u00b7 Small Business Enterprise (SBE);\n- \u00b7 Veteran (VET);\n- \u00b7 Minority-Owned Enterprise (MBE);\n- \u00b7 Women-Owned Enterprise (WBE);\n- \u00b7 Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone).\n- \u00b7 LGBTQ+-Owned Enterprises (LGBTBE)\n\nAs of end of December 2022, the Group is on target to spend more than 4% of its total US Procurement spend with uniquely diverse businesses. This represents an increase of nearly 0.5% vs. 2021. Schneider Electric is aware of the work it has to do in this area and is committed to growing its program within, and outside, the US to bring more opportunities to the diverse business community.\n\nIn 2022, Schneider Electric enhanced its Supplier Diversity program in the following directions:\n\n- \u00b7 Expanded relationships with supplier diversity partner organizations\n- \u00b7 Performed data cleansing exercises quarterly to reflect the diversity more accurately in its supply chain\n- \u00b7 Updated policies, procedures and web site content to more fully articulate its efforts in supplier diversity\n- \u00b7 Conducted robust training across the North America organization for both procurement and other employees who have authority to purchase good/services on behalf of the company",

The gradual decline of  industrial wages and the COVID-19 crisis have severely impacted the economic outlook of the workforce,  globally. Companies should review wage policies to ensure the affordability of a dignified living by the  workers. Additionally, employment should equip the workforce to improve current skill sets and knowledge  for future employability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| 3.  Decent working  hours                                     | Excessive working hours is a legal violation, often accepted as 'necessary'. It is generally connected with  low industrial wages and used as an excuse to not provide appropriate wages. Companies should review  and remediate excessive hours and should align with the legal and/or international requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| 4.  Stability and  security of work                           | Employment should be a source of economic stability and peace of mind. Uncertainty of job security  increases stress and makes the workforce vulnerable to abuse and hazardous working conditions.   The problem has been exacerbated due to COVID-19-related job losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| 5.  Social dialogue  and workplace  relations                 | Employees should have the right to engage with management and collectively put across their concerns  and demands.

Fair treatment in  employment                             | Employment should be based on merit and the ability to do the job, and fair treatment should be extended  to all employees. Differences in lifestyle, choices, etc., often become a source of discrimination,  victimization, and harassment. This curbs freedom of expression, hiding preferences, and creates mental  health challenges. Companies should ensure a workplace that accepts diversity and provides an inclusive  work environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 7.  Safe work                                                 | Employment should result in economic independence and augment the ability to exercise a healthy and  prosperous life. It should not result in ill-health, risk to well-being, or be a source of injury/misery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| 8.  Social protection                                         | Industrial wages are often not sufficient to provide adequate living standards. The problem is exacerbated  in cases of health emergencies. Social protection, provided by employers/governments, provide a much- needed safety net from economic shock, descent into poverty, and vulnerability. Companies should ensure  that all employees have access to the social security safety net.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| 9.  Purchasing  practices 10. Balancing work  and family life | Purchasing practices and requirements significantly impact working conditions. They influence the working  culture of the supplier organization to meet customer requirements. The power of procurement can be a  strong driver for positive change to include decent work conditions as a pre-requisite among the supply  chain partners, when balanced with other commercial criteria.

As a result of this proximity, people's conditions of living could be affected by the Group's activity. Schneider's local operations are of two types:\n\n- \u00b7 Local facilities, such as a factory or an office building.\n- \u00b7 Local project sites where Schneider is operating as a contractor or subcontractor for a customer.\n\n## 2.2.13.2  Risks and opportunities\n\nThe risk overview exercise has been carried out for the top 30 Schneider Electric sites throughout the world and a selection of 40 customer projects and is still in pilot mode. The main risks that have been explored were related to the impact of Schneider Electric's activities on the local infrastructures such as transportation and mobility, access to energy or water, access to staple-good and utilities, safety, and protection against ethical breaches.\n\nOpportunities have also been identified in the form of improvement of infrastructures, better access to education, support to sociocultural local projects, and improvement of local employment.\n\n## 2.2.13.3 Governance\n\nThe overall governance is under the responsibility of the Duty of Vigilance steering committee, throughout the pilot phase. In the next phase, the steering committee will bring in additional stakeholders to implement the actions that will be decided.\n\nThis subject is governed by Schneider Electric's Human Rights policy as well as the ambition set forth in the Group's vigilance plan. At a later stage, some specific policy may be drafted to further structure the framework.\n\n## 2.2.13.4  Communities living around Schneider's sites\n\n## Vigilance risk assessment for Schneider Electric's 30 largest sites\n\nThe overall result shows that the level of risk to local communities living around Schneider Electric sites is 'low' in most cases. This is mainly due to the fact that the Company is usually located in large, urban, or peri-urban areas, crowded with many similar or larger companies. In the case of factories, they are mostly located in already existing dedicated industrial areas, with stable infrastructures and transportation networks, and Schneider Electric's presence does not have an impact on these areas.\n\nAmong the top 30 sites, the Group only identified a very limited number that may have a 'moderate' impact on local communities and found no site where Schneider Electric could have a 'high' or 'very high' impact.\n\nIt is to be noted that although Schneider Electric speaks about risks, the notion of impact can also be positive, as it is part of Schneider Electric's policy to include local parameters in its sourcing policy: providing employment; including a percentage of local companies and contractors for services (catering, maintenance, etc.).\n\n## 2.2.13.5  Communities living around customers' project sites\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric extended its risks assessment to cover local communities residing close to the sites where the Group is implementing projects for customers. These projects can be, for example, the building of an electrical switchgear station to distribute electricity, either to the grid or to private large users (factories, professional buildings, etc.). Depending on the profile of the end-customer, these projects necessitate the on-site coordination of several types of contractors: civil engineering, industrial process experts, electricity specialists, communication infrastructure experts. Relations with local communities, when relevant, are usually handled by the main contractor, or by the end-customer.\n\nTo identify the main sites presenting potential risks, Schneider Electric has pre-selected customer projects based on the combination of two criteria: country risk and customer activity. Country risk is a compound of several external publicly available indicators (transparency, human rights, etc.). Customer activity is based on the industrial process specific to the end-customer. For illustration, the top five risks are ranked as follows:\n\n| Top country risk   | Top customer activity risk   |\n|--------------------|------------------------------|\n| Chad               | Mining, minerals and metals  |\n| Mauritania         | Oil, gas and petrochemicals  |\n| Angola             | Power and grid               |\n| Nigeria            | Life sciences                |\n| Tanzania           | Water                        |\n\nBased on the combination of these criteria, a sample of 40 projects have been selected for review.",

Mitigation actions can be decided and implemented by Schneider.\n- \u00b7 Type 2: Schneider Electric provides switchgear and/or industrial equipment, but it is not the main contractor. Mitigation capabilities are limited.\n- \u00b7 Type 3: Schneider Electric provides software and control, and is mostly working remotely, being present on site only for final testing and commissioning. Mitigation capabilities are very low.\n\nAmong the projects reviewed, two were of type 1, six of type 2, and six of type 3.\n\n- \u00b7 A study of the two projects of type1 shows the following risks and benefits to local populations:\n- - Temporary/brief disturbance in transportation and mobility due to large materials and equipment delivery.\n- - Temporary and planned power outages.\n- - No environmental or pollution risk.\n- - Local security implemented by final customer, with no or little impact on the neighboring communities.\n- - The project is a source of employment for local companies.\n\nFor type 1 projects that have been reviewed, Schneider Electric and the contractors under its responsibility were not found to create major or significant risks for communities. Some points of improvements that would contribute positively to the communities were identified, such as for example: additional focus on local education and technical training, awareness of energy-related subjects, or more emphasis on local hiring. Globally, a more structured communication and pattern of interaction with communities or their representatives would bring value.\n\n- \u00b7 Among the 12 projects of type 2 and 3, six are projects with significant impact on the local communities (petrochem, etc.) and six have limited impact (desert or remote location). For the projects with significant impact, relations with local communities are handled by the end-user or the main contractor. Given the small size of Schneider Electric's contribution to the overall project investment, the capacity of Schneider to be a significant contributor to the mitigation measures is very limited. Specific policies, adapted to these project profiles, are currently under review.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The world is not on track to reach the Paris Agreement goals, and global temperatures could reach a 2.8\u00b0C average increase by the end of the century. Urgent action and a system-wide transformation are needed to deliver the enormous cuts in emissions necessary to limit GHG emissions by 2030.\n\nThe number of companies pledging to align their business strategies to a 1.5\u00b0C (or well below 2\u00b0C) trajectory has increased. Since 2018, more than 2,000 companies have set science-based reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). To determine science-based targets and align with Net-Zero ambitions, the SBTi released the SBTi 'Corporate Net-Zero Standard' at the end of 2021. Schneider Electric was one of the first companies to have its Net-Zero targets validated by the SBTi with this new standard in August 2022. But pledges are not enough and Schneider Electric is committed to action, acknowledging that the world needs to move from pledges to progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs an Impact Company, the Group's climate strategy addresses all its stakeholders, from employees to supply chain partners, customers, as well as local communities and institutions, and shows that there are ways for companies to 'do good while doing well and vice-versa'. First, the Group takes responsibility for its carbon footprint, across its operations and full value-chain. Second, it adapts and improves the solutions and products it offers to its customers to help them in their decarbonization journey.\n\nConcrete actions for the 2021-2025 period are monitored and shared transparently in Schneider Sustainability Impact, and Essentials. They are overseen by various dedicated Committees up to the Board of Directors. In the longer term, the Group is committed to be Net-Zero in its operations by 2030, and across its entire value chain by 2050. It has made specific commitments for energy efficiency, electrification, and renewable electricity under the EP100, EV100, and RE100 initiatives of the Climate Group. Schneider Electric also aims to deliver to its customers 800 million tonnes of saved and avoided CO 2 emissions between 2018 and 2025 thanks to EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions.\n\n'The fight against climate change is driving a profound transformation of our economic and energy systems. Schneider Electric is one of the world's first companies to validate science-based Net-Zero targets and so far, we've made good progress in meeting them. Yet this requires faster and more concerted action, and we're ready to engage with all our stakeholders and lead the way.'\n\nXavier Denoly, SVP Sustainable Development",

The Group is assessing its risks and opportunities following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2022, it conducted a forward-looking climate scenario analysis, expanded its climate-related risk governance and defined its strategy to address climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nRisks are identified and assessed with specific internal and external metrics, but also with interviews with experts and leaders, run by the Internal Audit Department and the Group Risk Management Department, to update the list of general risks at Group level each year. The risk assessments cover market risks, acute physical risks, chronic physical risks, legal risks, current and emerging regulations as well as reputational risks. In 2022, around 40 of the Group's top managers were interviewed in addition to Board members.\n\nClimate-related risks are included in Schneider Electric's Enterprise Risk Management framework built around 3 lines of defense and an independent control:\n\n- \u00b7 businesses and operations manage risks while achieving organizational objectives;\n- \u00b7 risk domain leaders act as risk overseers, set guardrails and review the risk management systems;\n- \u00b7 the Group risk management is accountable for the overall risk governance with oversight by the Board of Directors.\n\nInternal Audit acts as an independent assurance to advise on the adequacy and effectiveness of governance and risk management.\n\nMore details in chapter 3 page 292 'How we manage risks at Schneider Electric'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider places dependency analysis at the heart of its risk management and performs a forward-looking climate risk and vulnerability assessment to identify and price the materiality of physical and transition climate risks that may affect its own operations and sites, its extended value chain (upstream and downstream), and overall economic activities in the short-term, medium-term and long-term, using scenario analysis.\n\nThe Group has developed a scenario-based analysis of climate physical and transition risks, applying climate-related risk scenarios entailing different emission pathways between 1.5\u00b0C and >4\u00b0C temperature rise by 2100, with a digital-twin of the company including financial projection, market breakdown, supply chain, and carbon footprint to quantify financially the physical and transition risks for the Group. Five emissions pathways have been considered: SSP5-8.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP2-4.5, SSP1-2.6 and SSP1-1.9 by 2050, 2070 and 2100.\n\n## 2.3.1.1 Climate-driven opportunities\n\nThe climate crisis calls for significant action and innovation across businesses, industries, and governments. Increasing awareness of the risks posed by climate change has led thousands of businesses to make commitments to act on decarbonization, energy efficiency, electrification, renewable energy procurement, and more. More than 4,000 companies have either set or made a commitment to set targets in line with the Science-Based Targets initiative. However, only a fraction manage to reduce their carbon footprint in line with 1.5\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C scenarios.\n\n2022 saw an unprecedented number of changes in climate or Corporate Sustainability Reporting (CSR) regulations - from the CSR Directive (CSRD) in Europe and the implementation of the climate objectives of the European Taxonomy Regulation, to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) Climate Disclosures consultation in the US and the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) in India.\n\nSchneider Electric is uniquely positioned to seize opportunities from the growing demand for greener, low-carbon products and services, and to help its suppliers and customers in their decarbonization journey. The Group promotes a three-step approach with its ecosystem: strategize, electrify, and decarbonize.\n\nThe Group sees the energy and climate transition as an opportunity for companies that are 'part of the solution' to grow their revenues. Schneider's Energy Management and Industrial Automation solutions help customers use their energy and resources more efficiently, and reduce their CO 2 emissions. Furthermore, smart grid technologies unlock the potential to electrify and, optimize energy usage, powered by renewable electricity.\n\nFollowing internal research, the Group sees an acceleration in the dominant roles of:\n\n- \u00b7 electrification: the world is becoming more electric, with demand growing potentially up to 3x by 2050;\n- \u00b7 digitization: with the increase in connectivity, complemented by real-time information and competitive computing capabilities, digital technologies play a major role in reaching decarbonization targets while augmenting economic productivity, notably around efficiency in energy, resource use, and circularity, as well as increased resiliency and security.",

        "page_content": "All these findings, and their potential financial impact on Schneider business has helped the Group fine-tune key development areas that will allow it to actively contribute to the low-carbon transition, enabling it to develop its portfolio of sustainability-related products and solutions.\n\nIn 2022, 72% of the Group's revenues qualified as 'Impact', meaning revenues from products and solutions that generate energy or resource efficiency to customers. The Group aims to grow its Impact revenues to 80% by 2025 (SSI #1). Additionally, more than 90% of Schneider's innovation projects contribute to solutions relating to climate change mitigation and environment protection.\n\nSee more details about Schneider Impact revenues and EU taxonomy in chapter 2.1.9 page 100 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.3.1.2 Climate-related risks\n\n## Reputation risk\n\nAs Schneider Electric has been working to reduce its own GHG emissions for over 15 years and has a proven track record of success with its past commitments related to reducing its own emissions, the Group does not anticipate significant reputational risk. Yet, the risk from the Group's actual or perceived failure to achieve its environmental targets, or commitments could negatively impact its reputation or otherwise materially harm its business. This risk is also tied to growing and moving environmental regulations.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Group monitors and manages its reputation risk by:\n\n- \u00b7 continuously monitoring its sustainability performance and revising its strategy to adapt to regulations, and customer demand;\n- \u00b7 consistently and transparently presenting its sustainability performance to its stakeholders, across all environmental, social, and governance topics;\n- \u00b7 considering the possible financial impacts of future CO 2 costs on its activities, by taking into consideration both operational and supply chain footprints. Given the relatively low level of the Group's Scopes 1 & 2 carbon emissions, carbon pricing has indirect rather than direct impacts, resulting in increased supply chain costs or product costs;\n- \u00b7 working collaboratively with relevant stakeholders to develop and strengthen regulatory frameworks, advance standards to create common methodologies to measure the environmental footprint of products, and to improve corporate carbon accounting.\n\n## Supply chain disruption\n\nSchneider Electric has over 200 industrial and logistics sites globally and is exposed to the physical effects of climate change in the form of more frequent and severe acute weather events. This could result in damage to assets, disruption to business operations, and human consequences. Extreme weather events do not only threaten Schneider's assets and properties but also the overall supply chain. Shortages or logistic bottlenecks in the upstream and downstream supply chain can translate directly into revenue losses, higher costs, and increased working capital requirements. Delays in production and delivery can impact customer experience.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nTo understand the risk exposure of Schneider's sites and extended supply chain and identify mitigation and adaptation actions, the Group performed a physical climate risks and vulnerability assessment. In this assessment, the Group developed a digitaltwin of the company including geographic location and dependency of key facilities, and quantified for each site the exposure of both assets and business operations to acute and chronic climate-related perils, calculating the exposure of the Group's economic activities in the short, medium (2030) and long term (2050) under different scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), from 1.5\u00b0C to >4\u00b0C temperature rise by 2100.\n\nThe Group monitors events across 10,000 nodes (such as ports and critical supplier locations) to shorten reaction time should events occur, and thereby minimize business impact. In addition, an analysis of criticality of industrial sites is performed by independent experts, covering areas including interdependency analyses, alternative supply, and time to recover in case of damage. At present, the impact of natural hazards is not material to the Group's financial statements. Indeed, the magnitude of impact, whether on physical or supply chain risks, is considered 'medium to low', and likelihood 'as likely as not', however the Group is proactively monitoring this risk. The Group's Supply Chain uses a resiliency index that includes natural and climate-related hazards to assess and mitigate business interruption risks.\n\nTo mitigate and adapt to these risks, the Group launched the 'Power of Two in Manufacturing', a project to bolster greater supply chain resiliency. The project aims at ensuring that no product is manufactured in a single location, or with only one supplier for any critical parts or components. More information on Schneider's measures to adapt to climate change are provided in the next section.\n\nFinally, the Group's Property Damage and Business Interruption program, aligned with ISO 22301 standard, maps substantive risks on the business and ensures crisis management, from the initial phase following an incident all the way to the recovery of critical activities.\n\n## Adaptation measures\n\nSchneider Electric's approach to climate change adaptation consists of several resilience initiatives. Weather risks are part of the Group's Business Continuity & Risk Management program, leading to preventive investment to secure assets and mitigate material climate risks.\n\nFirstly, Schneider's management method consists of risks quotations. Climate-related physical risks including floods are part of the risk assessments and standard practice reviews made by independent global risk experts (GRC), thereby defining potential financial impacts as well as the cost of response.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Risk profiles of each site are regularly updated, and recommendations are made to mitigate and adapt to identified risks.\n\nThe Group deploys protection measures to mitigate or avoid the risks. Action plans are being developed for its sites potentially exposed to floods. Plans may include installing flood gates or moving equipment to a higher level, production increase or reduction, delivery increase, checking external areas for possible objects that could float, and so on. As of 2022, eight Schneider sites are protected by levees.\n\nThe cost of management can be approximated by that of insurance plans. The cost (including tax) of the Group's main global insurance programs, excluding premiums paid to captives, totaled around \u20ac28 million in 2022.\n\nIn addition, the supply chain strategy called STRIVE, launched in 2021, includes an increased focus on resilience to ensure supply chain flexibility is continually improved. More than 80% of selected CapEx is engaged in the 'Power of Two in Manufacturing' project, whereby the Group is proactively working to qualify alternate factories for same products and suppliers for all critical parts and components to improve continuity of supply. By doing so, the Group can dual-source critical components from partners in different geographies to help ensure availability regardless of business disruptions that may occur, such as natural disasters. As a result of the STRIVE strategy, 84% of top manufacturing risks are secured with strategic stocks, and 51% of top supply risks are secured under a specific multi-sourcing project.\n\nFor example, in the Philippines, the Group identified products at risk based on revenues, and then conducted a study to assess whether it should implement its Power of Two resilience strategy. The industrial planning team investigated associated existing technological challenges and budgeting. The site then worked with partners in the region (for example, in Vietnam) and invested in tools and equipment to mitigate potential business interruptions and secure the cost of goods sold (and therefore revenues), with the objective of securing around 35% of its sales through a business continuity plan by 2024.\n\n## 2.3.1.3 Governance\n\nOverall, the different governance bodies involved in the definition and monitoring of the sustainability commitments and programs are responsible for defining strategic mitigation programs in response to the risks and opportunities identified. Strategic programs defined at Group level are then cascaded into business divisions, down to the sites for implementation, and are monitored through the digital platform, EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor. Each program of the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) has a dedicated pilot in charge of driving the transformation and is sponsored at the Senior Vice-President and Executive levels to ensure management control and oversight.\n\nThe sustainability strategy, including climate, is overseen by the Board of Directors with the assistance of the Human Resources and Corporate Social Responsibility (HR & CSR) Committee. Schneider was one of the first companies to address this topic at the Board level with the creation of the HR & CSR Committee in 2014. The Group further addressed the topic by deciding that the annual variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and of the more than 64,000 employees (who benefit from a variable compensation), includes ESG criteria, part of which relates to climate. The long-term incentive plan is also correlated with ESG criteria (for more details on compensation, please refer to section 2.5.4, page 218).\n\nSeveral other governance bodies are involved in this matter: the Executive Committee and its Function Committee, the Stakeholder Committee and the Sustainability department. At Group level, the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, who is part of the Executive Committee, helps determine and enforce the Group's environmental goals and underlying transformations. Three Committees involving Group Executive Vice-Presidents and Senior Vice-Presidents are dedicated to oversee the implementation of the Group's decarbonization roadmap, respectively focusing on the supply chain, low-carbon product design, and the decarbonization of Schneider's operational emissions.\n\nSchneider Electric's Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer is the head of the Global Environment team, leading the overall environmental vision, strategy, and program execution, including climate. The Global Environment team participates in the Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, which identifies, assesses, and prioritizes risks and, through regular reporting and discussion, assists senior management and the Board with governance of risk. The team gathers input from climate experts across the company to support this reporting.\n\nIn addition, environmental transformations are driven by a network of leading experts in various environmental fields (eco-design, energy efficiency, circular economy, CO 2 , etc.). On an annual basis, a process identifies and recognizes those individuals who own a specific expertise that the company is keen to maintain and grow. Various governance bodies enable these communities of experts and leaders within the environmental function to meet every month or every quarter, depending on the topics and entities, to ensure consistent adoption of environment policies and standards throughout the Group. To implement these policies, Environment leaders coordinate a network of more than 600 managers responsible for the environmental management of sites, countries, product design, and marketing.",

This team is in charge of climate and environment scenario analysis, and reports to the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer.\n\nSeveral scenarios to 2050 were developed in 2019. Those included critical reviews of the geopolitical landscape, commodity and resource availability, economic and financial evolutions, climate sensitivity and evolving policies, energy transition pathways, and technology developments, among others, with quantified consequences, taking into consideration ten regions and a number of sectors individually, framing the business landscape in which Schneider operates.\n\nIn 2020, those scenarios were further updated. Beyond long-term impact analysis, the COVID-19 short-term impact assessment has also been reviewed in detail, including the importance and feasibility of climate-compatible recovery plans.\n\nFinally, in 2021, Schneider published a set of scenarios exploring the feasibility of a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory. The scenarios developed by Schneider demonstrate that a net-zero carbon future, aligned with IPCC's 1.5\u00b0C scenarios, is still possible.\n\nKey findings are regularly cross-checked with new publications, particularly the ones from the International Energy Agency, BNEF, and the IRENA, among others. Both short- and long-term analysis are shared internally and used to inform strategic priorities across businesses and operations.\n\nMore about Schneider Electric's climate scenarios can be found on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Scope 3 emissions represent more than 99% of the Group's carbon footprint, of which:\n\n- \u00b7 77% are due to the use phase of products: these emissions correspond to the electricity consumption of Schneider's products throughout their lifecycle, through heat dissipation (Joule effect). This value is based on a lifecycle approach, leveraging the Product Environmental Profiles (PEP) of products. This number is calculated following the GHG Protocol Scope 3 guidelines for category 11, use of sold products. It is not the volume of CO 2 emitted in the reporting year from the use of products sold and in use by customers. It is a forward-looking view and an estimate of emissions resulting from the use of products sold in the reporting year, during their full useful life. It is worth noting that the Group's products have long lifetime, which can be up to 30 years in calculations.\n- \u00b7 12% result from the purchase of goods and services: the calculations are based on the purchasing database combining spending and volumes (e.g., tonnes). The methodology considers the wide heterogeneity of the Group's procurement portfolio: raw materials, electronic and electrical products, printed circuit board assembly, fabricated components, along with purchases that are not directly related to production (e.g., services such as insurance and banking services). As per the principles of carbon accounting, calculations are based on physical quantities as much as possible, using the tonnes of metals and plastics purchased for instance.\n- \u00b7 8% are from the products' end-of-life, and more specifically end-of-life treatment of SF 6 : the calculation is based on the SF 6 gas used by Schneider in products sold in 2022, and that may be released at the end of product life. An assumption is made on the release in the atmosphere of SF 6 at product decommissioning, based on Schneider's research, considering that some SF 6 in equipment is being recycled, while the majority is not recycled.\n\nThe charts below represents Schneider's 2022 carbon footprint for Scopes 1, 2, and 3, including all GHG emissions, from the upstream activity of all its suppliers to the use and end-of-life of its products sold to customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCoverage of reported emissions is 99% for energy, fugitive SF 6 emissions, waste, purchases, capital goods, commuting, travel, and freight (coverage is estimated using a relevant activity indicator for each source of emissions, such as spend on purchases and business travel, surface for energy and capital goods, headcount for commuting and waste). Schneider Electric reports no GHG emissions on franchises, investments, or downstream-leased assets, because these emission categories are not considered relevant for its activities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2022 CO 2 footprint reduction performance\n\nOver the last five years, since 2017, emissions from Schneider Electric's operations (Scopes 1 & 2) have decreased by 67% absolute, while the emissions from the value chain, both upstream and downstream, have been more challenging to control.\n\nOn operations, direct emissions from Scope 1 have decreased by 36% since 2017, thanks to efforts focused on energy efficiency and electrification of the Group's onsite processes and company cars. In addition, targeted efforts to reduce SF 6 have yielded great results. On Scope 2, emissions have decreased by 79% between 2017 and 2022. On Scopes 1 & 2 combined, the emission reduction has historically been driven by energy efficiency, leveraging the Group's portfolio of EcoStruxure solutions.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022, the emission reduction (-22%) had three main drivers:\n\n- \u00b7 consumption behavior changes linked to the energy crisis (with electricity consumption at sites decreasing by 5% and gas consumption by 20% as compared to 2021);\n- \u00b7 energy efficiency (SSE #5): 6.6% in 2021, 7.8% in 2022. An additional modeled savings of 10GWh compared to 2021;\n- \u00b7 the switch to more renewable electricity consumed by the Group's facilities, whether directly, via onsite renewable energy or green tariffs from the utilities serving Schneider's operations, or indirectly, via unbundled and bundled market mechanisms.\n\nOn Scope 3, emissions have decreased by 12% between 2021 and 2022. This is the result of two opposite evolutions in upstream and downstream emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 the emissions from the supply chain upstream emissions, have increased by 5%. This increase is mainly due to the increased volume of purchased goods and services driven by the growth of the Group's activity, despite the efforts to support suppliers' decarbonization with the Zero Carbon Project, and to source green materials. Indeed, the outcome of these programs are not yet reflected into the Group's corporate carbon accounting due to necessary methodology and emission factors updates that are not yet implemented. The Group is working on the reconciliation of the data in 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's downstream emissions, mostly emissions from the use of sold products, have decreased by 14% between 2021 and 2022. This is mainly due to external factors and the decarbonization of the grids that the Group's consumers rely on. The emissions under the 'use of sold products' category correspond to the lifetime emissions from the use of products sold by Schneider during the year of reporting. These emissions are attributable to electricity consumption of products, either due to internal consumption or due to heat dissipation (Joule effect). When calculating these emissions, the Group has to factor the useful life of the products and the projected carbon intensity of the grids where its consumers are located over that lifetime. The Group has historically based the emission factor of the grids where its customers are located on a scenario from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that models the future decarbonization of the grids. Previously, the emission factors of the grids were based on the Reference Technology Scenario of the 'Energy Technology Perspectives 2017' (IEA, 2017).\n\nFor the 2022 carbon footprint, the GHG emissions from electricity have been updated with the most recent scenario, to better reflect the current stated policies of countries (Stated Policies Scenario from the 'World Energy Outlook 2022' (IEA, 2022), which is based on current policies, as well as policies announced by governments at the time of publication). This update of the emission factors of the electricity grids, where customers are located, is the major driver for the significant reduction in the emissions from category 11 between 2021 and 2022: -15% as compared to the reported emissions in 2021 for this category. To better illustrate the evolution of the emissions from this category under the evolution of Schneider Electric's activities, the 2021 emissions from category 11 have been re-calculated using the same scenario for the evolution of the carbon intensity of the grids. With this recalculation, the difference between 2021 and 2022 is a 3% emissions reduction.\n\n- \u00b7 The rate at which Schneider can implement emission reductions is dependent on many factors that can fluctuate over time, ranging from the Group's business growth and its geographic distribution, its supplier mix and their own decarbonization journey, to the rate of decarbonization of the grids that power the products the Group sells.\n- \u00b7 The Group will work to develop increasingly robust and precise activity data and use more granular or higher quality emission factor datasets. The quality and granularity of the emission factor datasets are critical to support greater accuracy and reliability of GHG measurement and reporting. For example, on supply chain emissions, the Group is engaged with the Pathfinder Framework, a guidance for the calculation and exchange of product-level carbon emissions data across value chains.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

As part of its Net-Zero Commitment, the Group has defined mid- and long-term targets. Ultimately, the Group is committed to be Net-Zero across its entire value chain by 2050, which means that the Group aims to reduce its 2021 footprint by an absolute 90% by 2050 and neutralize residual emissions with high quality and durability carbon removal credits.\n\nThe four milestones towards Schneider's Net-Zero Commitment are presented below together with the key decarbonization levers, and are detailed in the subsequent sections of this chapter. Please note that this graph is intended to provide a simple visualization of the Group's roadmap, so the proportions between Scopes 1, 2, and 3 have been adjusted to facilitate readability. lt is not representative of year over year targets. Yet, what is important to note is that between 2040 and 2050, the above and below the line are symmetrical, meaning the emissions that are not reduced need to be compensated, and by 2050 at the latest removed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Decarbonizing our downstream value chain by:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Scopes 1 & 2 emissions\n- Scope 3 emissions\n- Carbon offsets\n- \u00b7 Influencing for global decarbonization\n- \u00b7 Innovating with more efficient products and SF 6 - free medium voltage equipment",

This encompasses all Scope 3 emissions, in particular upstream emissions from purchased goods and services, as well as downstream emissions from the use of electricity by its sold products.\n\nSchneider is already carrying out concrete actions to engage its value chain in decarbonization under its Climate and Resources commitments:\n\n- \u00b7 engage 1,000 top suppliers to reduce their operational CO 2 emissions by 50% with The Zero Carbon Project (SSI #3);\n- \u00b7 increase green material content in products to 50% (steel, aluminum, and plastics) by 2025, favoring bio-sourced, recycled, and sustainable options (SSI #4), and improve the end-to-end lifecycle environmental footprint of its offers with EcoDesign Way \u2122 ;\n- \u00b7 have 100% of primary and secondary packaging free from single-use plastic and made from recycled cardboard (SSI #5);\n- \u00b7 propose SF 6 -free alternatives for all medium voltage technologies by 2025 (SSE #2);\n- \u00b7 increase CO 2 efficiency in transportation of goods by 15% by 2025 (SSE #4), and replace at least 5% of conventional jet fuel use with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030 (WEF First Movers Coalition);\n- \u00b7 reduce CO 2 emissions from waste management, and reach 200 'Waste-to-Resource' sites (SSE #9).\n\nHaving 'Net-Zero ready' operations means the Group plans to reduce absolute emissions from Scopes 1 & 2 by 76% from a 2021 base year (equivalent to a 90% reduction compared to 2017) and neutralize residual emissions from its operations with carbon removal credits of growing quality and durability (see details thereafter).\n\nTo deliver on this operational target, the Group has launched several transformations:\n\n- \u00b7 reach 150 Zero-CO 2 sites by 2025 (SSE #1);\n- \u00b7 source 90% of electricity from renewables by 2025 (SSE #3), and 100% by 2030 (RE100);\n- \u00b7 increase energy efficiency in its sites by 15% by 2025 (SSE #5), and double energy productivity by 2030 compared to 2005 (EP100);\n- \u00b7 shift one-third of corporate vehicle fleet to electric vehicles by 2025 (SSE #7), and 100% by 2030 (EV100).\n\n## By 2050, reach Net-Zero CO 2 emissions across the entire value chain\n\nTo reach its Net-Zero Commitment, the Group will reduce its absolute Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by at least 90% from a 2021 base year, and compensate residual emissions with carbon offsets, in line with the SBTi 'Corporate Net-Zero Standard'.\n\nSchneider Electric has already implemented a solid foundation of initiatives, which will be reinforced and completed by additional actions. Considering the company profile in terms of GHG emissions, meeting the targets will require to engage even more with customers and suppliers on decarbonization, leveraging the Group's portfolio of solutions to grow the energy efficiency of the global economy, the electrification of the energy mix, and the sourcing of renewable electricity.\n\nIn addition to that, the growing share of circularity services in the revenue of the company, along with the greater environmental value added by the Group's Green Premium TM offers, are enablers to lead to the decoupling of company activity from absolute emissions.\n\n## Reach carbon-neutral operations and a carbon-neutral value chain in 2025 and 2040 respectively\n\nTo achieve carbon neutral operations by 2025, Schneider Electric will compensate residual Scopes 1 & 2 GHG emissions with quality carbon offsets. Similarly, by 2040, the Group aims to compensate its end-to-end carbon footprint.\n\nSince 2011, Schneider has invested in the Livelihood Carbon Fund (LCF) and renewed its engagement with the LCF2 and LCF3 funds. These funds invest into three kinds of projects combining climate change resilience with strong social and economic impact:\n\n- 1. agroforestry and regenerative agriculture (which combines productivity and biodiversity restoration);\n- 2. reforestation and restoration of key natural ecosystems, including mangrove restoration (mangroves are powerful carbon sequestration agents and natural barriers to coastal areas);\n- 3. rural energy (the fuel-efficient cookstoves distributed by Livelihoods decreases wood consumption by half, preserves forests, and mitigates climate change).\n\nThe return of the fund is measured in carbon credits from the highest available standards (VERRA and Gold Standard). To date, those credits have not been used to compensate the Group's GHG emissions, but some have been used to compensate emissions from the Schneider Electric Paris Marathon.\n\nRead more about Livelihoods in chapter 2.6 pages 224 to 241 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo fulfill Schneider's Net-Zero targets, solely carbon removal will be used to 'net' the company's emissions. At this stage, the current market maturity, lack of standard definition regarding quality and durability of carbon removals make it challenging to define the nature and composition of the company's carbon removal portfolio.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 2.3  Leading on decarbonization\n\n## 2.3.4 Investing to achieve the Group's climate strategy and vision\n\nSchneider Electric has defined short and medium-term financial investments priorities in order to set the course towards its SBTi validated Net-Zero Commitment, and more broadly to meet its long-term commitments for climate, and to preserve natural resources.\n\nThese investments mainly relate to the following areas:\n\n- 1. The evolution of the Group's portfolio towards a greater proportion of Digital and Services, expanding the Group's portfolio of connected solutions for efficiency and sustainability. Those investments typically vary year on year.\n- 2. Research and Development (R&D) to design products that use fewer virgin resources, bring additional CO 2 or resource efficiency for customers, have longer lifespans and lower end-of-life impacts, such as SF 6 -free products. 5.4% of turnover (about \u20ac1.8 billion) was invested in 2022, and the Group expects a step-up in strategic R&D investments over the coming years.\n- 3. The decarbonization of the Group's own operations, by investing progressively in energy efficiency, site electrification, renewable energies, and electric vehicles. In 2022, the Group has estimated the remaining cumulative investments needed until 2030 at about \u20ac200 million.\n- 4. The decarbonization of the Group's upstream supply chain and decoupling business growth from virgin resource consumption, by improving traceability, and controlling that Schneider Electric's ESG expectations, including for climate (SSI #3) or resources (SSI #4 and #5), are met by its suppliers, while securing business resilience. Long-term investments required are under assessment.\n\n## Mergers and acquisitions\n\nIn 2022, Schneider Electric acquired the remaining minority shares of AVEVA, which will allow the Group to accelerate its software strategy, building a single data-hub to bring together the digital industry twin and the energy twin of its customer's enterprise, for holistic efficiency across domains, and across the lifecycle of assets and installations. The Group also performed early-stage acquisitions with EnergySage, Autogrid, EV Connect, and QMerit, and all of them are part of the new energy landscape, maximizing digitization and energy efficiency. Such investments can typically greatly vary year on year.\n\n## Redesigned investment tools and processes to embed low-carbon and resource criteria\n\nIn order to track and steer its low-carbon investments, the Group's investment monitoring and approval tool was redesigned in 2022 in order to:\n\n- \u00b7 prioritize low-carbon investments, with a dedicated validation workflow;\n- \u00b7 monitor investments to decarbonize its own operations, notably for Zero-CO 2 sites (SSE #1).\n\nThis process will improve both qualitative and quantitative information on individual low-carbon investments, thereby facilitating decision-making.\n\n## Investments in R&D\n\nAbout 99% of the Group's carbon footprint are either related to upstream emissions from the transportation and transformation of raw materials by its suppliers, or to downstream emissions from product use or end-of-life that all depend on product design and R&D investments.\n\nSchneider has been embedding environmental considerations into product design for more than 15 years, since the creation of its internal Green Premium TM label. In 2022, the Group revamped its EcoDesignWay TM process to better manage the environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of products, and to coordinate efforts across the value chain. In addition to that, Schneider is reinforcing its process at an early stage of product development, so that all future generations of products achieve substantial carbon footprint savings, meaning that any new product developed by the Group will result less greenhouse gases than the previous generation.\n\nSchneider has been stepping up its investment in R&D, both in value and as a percentage of Group revenues, investing about 4.8% of its turnover in R&D between 2012 and 2016, 5.1% between 2017 and 2021, 5.4% in 2022 and, as outlined during its 2021 Capital Markets Day, expects a step-up in strategic R&D investments over the coming years with a strong focus on ensuring return on investment. In 2022, this represented an investment in R&D of approximately \u20ac1.8 billion. The Group estimates that about 90% of its innovation is either strictly green or neutral according to its Impact revenues methodology. More details on Schneider's Impact revenues and EU Taxonomy indicators is provided in Chapter 2.1.9 page 100.\n\nAn example of investment priority is on SF 6 -free products, in line with Schneider Electric's target to substitute 100% of relevant offers with SF 6 -free medium voltage technologies by 2025 (SSE #2). For SF 6 -free products, more than \u20ac100M have already been invested in both R&D and CapEx in factories, and a total future spend (2023-2027) close to \u20ac100M more is already planned.\n\n## Decarbonizing operations\n\nFor the past years, the Group has invested between \u20ac5 million and \u20ac15 million each year in energy efficiency, deploying its own solutions in its sites, which enabled equivalent savings on energy costs, and a reduction of 67% of Scopes 1 & 2 CO 2 emissions compared to 2017. The last miles in Schneider's journey to be 'Net-Zero ready' in 2030, achieving 90% CO 2 reductions vs. 2017 will be the hardest.\n\nTo support this objective, an estimated \u20ac200 million will be invested by 2030, in technologies such as heat pumps to substitute comfort gas or to install electric vehicle chargers. Such investments are usually not linear year on year as large projects may take a few years to design and implement, and opportunities at a given time depend on the local economic and regulatory context.",

Direct Scope 1 emissions result mostly from the natural gas consumption of sites that are not yet electrified, from the fuel used by company cars as well as a small amount from SF 6 leakages in a limited number of manufacturing plants. Indirect Scope 2 emissions result primarily from the electricity consumption of sites (manufacturing and offices).\n\nTo deliver its 'Net-Zero ready' target on these emissions by 2030, the Group leverages its Power and Building EcoStruxure \u2122 IoT architectures, to monitor and optimize energy consumption, manage assets and grid infrastructure, manage distributed renewable energy resources and electricity load, and power electric vehicles.\n\nSchneider set best-in-class operational ambitions engaging with the Climate Group on their EP100, EV100 and RE100 programs. The Group's approach has three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 save: foster energy conservation and avoid SF 6 leakages;\n- \u00b7 electrify: switch from gas or car fuel to electricity;\n- \u00b7 decarbonize electricity: use renewable energy, either from onsite generation, or through external procurement of renewable power.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Schneider's Operations\n\nScopes 1 & 2 annual GHG emissions (MTCO 2 e)\n\nInduced: 0.2 MtCO 2 e in 2022 0.4%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n## -22%\n\nGHG emissions reduction in Scopes 1 & 2 vs. 2021.\n\nThis strategy has delivered an absolute reduction of 469,731 tonnes of CO 2 e emissions on Scopes 1 & 2 (compared to 2017), which is a 67% decrease, as presented in the chart below, and a 64,703 tCO 2 reduction versus 2021.\n\n## 2.3.5.1 Group energy policy and management system\n\n## Group Energy Policy\n\nThe Group's Energy Policy requires sites to implement the following actions:\n\n- \u00b7 improve energy efficiency, sustainably decoupling energy consumption from activity growth;\n- \u00b7 decarbonize energy consumption;\n- \u00b7 adopt Schneider's own Energy Management and Automation EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions, wherever feasible, to showcase the Group's solutions for customers and business partners, and help them embark on an energy excellence journey.\n\nProgress against these goals is tracked in the Group's Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) and Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) programs. Relevant SSI and SSE targets are SSE #1, SSE #3, SSE #4, SSE #5, and SSE #7.\n\n## ISO 50001 Energy Management System\n\nThe Group certifies all sites consuming over 5GWh with ISO 50001. As of end 2022, 132 Schneider Electric sites are ISO 50001 certified as part of the Group's Integrated Management System to drive energy excellence, focusing on the highest energyconsuming sites. ISO 50001 certification is complementary to ISO 14001 certification and enables the company to define and sustain robust energy governance. With the support of this certification, sites are able to understand and reduce their energy footprint.\n\n## Resource Advisor data management system\n\nGlobal, regional, and site energy reporting is delivered with the EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor software suite. EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor provides a data visualization and analysis application that aggregates volumes of raw energy data into actionable information.

Two such ways are energy productivity and energy efficiency. On the one hand, energy productivity is the amount of output the Group produces vs. the amount of energy consumed (turnover/MWh), and the goal is to increase this value by both increasing the Group's business performance while simultaneously reducing the energy consumed in its operations. Energy efficiency, on the other hand, uses linear regression models to predict how much energy the Group would consume based on various inputs (production, weather, worked hours, etc.) vs. the actual energy consumed. The goal here is to reduce energy consumption compared to predicted value by driving energy efficiency in its operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider Electric has been a member of Energy Productivity 100 (EP100), a Climate Group initiative, since 2017. Schneider's target is to double energy productivity by 2030 against the 2005 baseline, which means doubling the economic output from every unit of energy consumed within 25 years. In 2022, the Group achieved 129% energy productivity (against a 2030 target of 100%) compared to 2005. This huge jump compared to 2021 performance (76%) is a result of strong business performance and intensified energy savings efforts. Achieving its commitment 8 years early, Schneider demonstrates the feasibility of decoupling business growth from energy consumption. Simultaneously it tangibly illustrates Schneider products, solutions, and services are a core foundation to energy saving opportunities. The Group will reevaluate its energy productivity program in 2023 to identify its next ambition.\n\n## Annual energy productivity progress (in %) against 2030 EP100 target (vs 2005)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 15% energy efficiency in our sites\n\nA good example to illustrate the SSE #5 program is the Wuxi plant in China.

        "page_content": "Despite being low consumers of energy compared with other industries, due to its discrete and assembly-based industrial processes, Schneider has had a clear obsession with efficiency since long before its EP100 commitment. The Schneider Energy Action program uses site energy experts along with Schneider's Sustainability Business consulting team to report and analyze energy consumption, identify energy saving opportunities, and deploy actions. Since 2005, the Group has fixed annual objectives for energy efficiency each year. Schneider met or exceeded its energy efficiency goals during the previous four Company programs (2009-2011, 2012-2014, 2015-2017, and 2018-2020), by achieving 10%, 13%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. In 2021, the Group renewed its commitment to improve energy efficiency by another 15% between 2019 and 2025, tracked under SSE #5. 7.8% were achieved in 2022, totaling over 50% reductions between 2009 and 2022.\n\nThe Group measures energy efficiency in its 200+ largest energy-consuming sites, which account for 85% of the total energy consumption of the Group. At the end of 2022, this program enabled the following achievements:\n\n- \u00b7 around \u20ac6 million and 75.7 million kWh were saved in 2022 compared to the 2019 baseline;\n- \u00b7 around \u20ac5.8 million were invested, of which \u20ac5.5 million were capital expenses and \u20ac0.3 million were operating expenses.\n\nSchneider Electric leverages the power of its EcoStruxure \u2122 architecture to deliver energy savings, and uses its own sites as showcases for customers and business partners. In its smart factories and distribution centers, the Group implements the three-layer EcoStruxure \u2122 architecture, with connected meters and sensors to monitor energy consumption and quality, Edge Control Power Monitoring software to optimize daily operations, and analytics and services to benchmark performance and optimize energy and maintenance. Asset Performance Management also enables the Group to optimize operations and maintenance, for maximum uptime and longevity.\n\nFive of Schneider's Smart Factories have been designated as 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) Advanced Lighthouses by the World Economic Forum (WEF), with the newest 2022 member Hyderabad in India joining four others in China, France, the US, and Indonesia. In 2022, the Le Vaudreuil plant in France joined the Lexington facility in the US as a Sustainability Lighthouse designated by the WEF. At the time, these two factories were among only six worldwide facilities receiving this new recognition by the WEF. With its Smart Factory and Distribution Center (DC) programs, the Group has deployed advanced manufacturing technologies in over 120 smart factories and DCs in the past 6 years.\n\nIn offices, Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions Building and Workplace Advisor enable analytics of Building Management System data alongside space, utilization, and comfort metrics. These smart solutions enable the Group and site leaders to actively benchmark, and develop occupancy and facility management strategies to ensure continuous right sizing of its footprint and site occupation to keep energy consumption and resultant emissions to a minimum, while reducing costs and improving employee experience and comfort.\n\n## 2.3.5.3  RE100: switch to 100% renewable electricity by 2030\n\nIn 2022, electricity consumption in Schneider Electric's sites generated 98,312 tonnes of CO 2 e emissions, i.e. 59% of emissions from energy consumption at sites. In 2017, Schneider joined Renewable Energy 100 (RE100) and committed to sourcing 100% of its electricity from renewables by 2030, with an intermediary target of 90% by 2025 (SSE #3).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SSE #3: annual share of global renewable electricity 1 (in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\nrenewable energy credit\n\n- 1 Data represents renewable electricity consumption for ISO 14001 sites, in alignment with the scope of SSE #3.\n- 2 Specific targets are not defined for the split between onsite renewable, bundled renewable, and unbundled renewable for 2025 or 2030. However, the Group is committed to reducing the amount of unbundled certificates and increasing the amount of onsite renewables and bundled certificates as it moves towards 2030.\n- 3 Contracted unbundled renewable energy credits include options such as Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) and unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). Contracted bundled renewable energy credits include options such as 'green tariffs', power purchase agreements (PPAs), virtual PPAs (VPPAs), bundled RECs, etc.\n\nSince 2017, Schneider Electric has accelerated renewable electricity sourcing and the installation of on-site solar panels, coupled with EcoStruxure \u2122 metering and power architectures. As its program has progressed, the Group has progressively increased the share of renewable electricity coming from onsite renewable generation and bundled renewable electricity sourcing.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

It will progressively reduce the reliance on unbundled certificates as it moves towards its 2030 goal of 100% renewable electricity. Critical to the success of this program is leveraging Schneider Electric's Sustainability Business (SB), an expert in sourcing renewable electricity with additionality benefits. SB helps Schneider and many customers source renewable electricity. Their expertise on renewable electricity markets around the world is key to finding solutions in less mature renewable markets as well as monitoring the evolution of marketing offerings, funding mechanisms, and sourcing requirements (e.g., RE100 2022 revised technical criteria).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.3.5.4 EV100: shift 100% of company fleet to electric vehicles\n\nCompany cars generated 56,856 tonnes of CO 2 e emissions in 2022, 25% of Schneider Electric's Scopes 1 & 2 emissions.\n\nTo reduce these emissions, Schneider looks at opportunities to reduce the use of cars for travel by improving the accessibility of sites, with commuting shuttles, secure bicycle storage, personal lockers and changing areas, as well as pedestrian-friendly access paths connecting to local routes. The Group also promotes flexible working arrangements to avoid unnecessary or avoidable trips thereby reducing travel-induced emissions by enabling employees to connect remotely, to work from home, and at customer sites.\n\nAdditionally, Schneider began its journey towards 100% electric cars by 2030 in 2019, with an intermediary target of one-third by 2025 (SSE #7). The Group demonstrates this commitment by being a member of Electric Vehicles 100 (EV100), a Climate Group initiative bringing together forward-looking companies committed to accelerating the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and making electric transport the new normal by 2030.

The path towards 'Net-Zero ready' operations by 2030 will require more than just powering sites with renewable electricity. While many applications can be electrified, some applications from industrial sites are more challenging to electrify with current technologies. As such, Schneider Electric has begun identifying applications at sites that currently have electrification alternatives as well as those which will require the use of fossil-free fuel solutions under the current circumstances.\n\nAs a general rule, a Zero-CO 2 site emits no greenhouse gases related to energy and monitors energy digitally, meaning:\n\n- \u00b7 no fossil fuels from energy consumption (exceptionally up to 3% of a site's total energy can be exempted from the fossil-free requirement, on a case-by-case basis, if the application does not have a feasible fossil-free alternative on the market. In 2022, 15 out of 77 Schneider's Zero-CO 2 sites benefitted from this exception);\n- \u00b7 digital energy monitoring;\n- \u00b7 no SF 6 leaks;\n- \u00b7 no CO 2 offsets.\n\nBeyond using renewable electricity and fuels, it remains critical to continuously improve energy efficiency. That is why the program also requires digital energy monitoring. For large sites, this means installing meters to monitor the site's significant energy uses and connecting them to systems like EcoStruxure \u2122 Power Monitoring Expert, EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor, or EcoStruxure \u2122 Building Operation to ensure real-time monitoring of energy consumption, which allows for active energy management and efficiency improvement.\n\nIn 2022, thanks to the Zero-CO 2 sites, Schneider reduced 54,000 tonnes of CO 2 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAHM is a site located in Hungary, established in 1964. The site is part of Schneider Electric's Global ETO Power System and manufactures medium voltage switchgears (PIX, MCSet). In 2022, as part of the company's Zero-CO 2 sites commitment, the site worked to electrify and decarbonize a paint line, and oven renewal process for its equipment, which had been built over forty years earlier.\n\nWith the help of governmental subsidies and the Hungarian Investment Promotion Agency (HIPA), the site achieved three major successes:\n\n- \u00b7 surface pre-treatment modernization which resulted in less usage of chemicals and decreased water consumption;\n- \u00b7 automatized powder recovery unit which reduced painting powder consumption by 70%;\n- \u00b7 100% renewable electricity powered drying oven, which reduced the natural gas consumption of the entire paintline by 33%.\n\nIn 2023, the site will implement actions to fully power the paintline with 100% renewable electricity, reducing CO 2 by nearly 140 tonnes annually. This transformation to electrify its operations, combined with Schneider Electric Building and Power Management technologies, highlights one of the many actions the Group is taking in its commitment to decarbonize its operations. For the benefit of customers and the industrial community, that illustrates the importance of electrification and renewable sourcing, and demonstrates the real and tangible opportunities and solutions that exist today.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Yet, SF 6 is a harmful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 25,200 times higher than CO 2 over 100 years. While Schneider Electric's product portfolio is progressively moving away from SF 6 (see additional information in section 2.3.7.1, page 170), SF 6 is used in 13 of the Group's manufacturing sites. Handling this greenhouse gas can inevitably result in leakages despite having good practices in place. Converted into CO 2 -equivalent, these leakages represented 4,777 tonnes of CO 2 e in 2022, which is 2% of emissions from Scopes 1 & 2. The GHG emissions at end-of-life is 4,477,721 tonnes of CO 2 e, which is 7.3% of total GHG emissions of 2022.\n\nAll the Group's manufacturing sites handling SF 6 gas in their processes are working hard to actively reduce SF 6 leaks and emissions during the different phases of their activities. A worldwide community of SF 6 experts shares best practices for processes, including procedures, equipment, and training.\n\nIn 2022, an advanced and digital system of emission monitoring has been designed, to be deployed at the Group's biggest manufacturing sites in 2023. This technology allows for continuous measurement of SF 6 concentration in enclosures around devices and piping networks. In the event of any deviations, an alarm notification is automatically sent to maintenance teams. Additionally, the seal testing processes of the products are mainly carried out with helium instead of SF 6 . This method ensures that no emissions come from non-compliant enclosures during production.\n\nThanks to this global activity and to the commissioning of efficient equipment, the Group achieved 0.08% leakage rate globally in 2022, exceeding the 0.11% target set for 2022 and systematically decreasing from 0.26% since 2018. This SF 6 leakage reduction enabled the avoidance of 900 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent in 2022 versus 2021.\n\n## 2.3.5.7  Energy sufficiency plan in Europe\n\nIn 2022, Europe faced an unprecedented energy crisis: risks on energy supply (mainly electricity and gas), along with escalating prices placed pressure on businesses and households. On companies especially, this had an impact on costs, profits, and - in some cases - business continuity.\n\nTackling Europe's energy security problem and the climate crisis are two sides of the same coin. Reducing both our use and dependence on fossil fuels, increasing electrification and the transition to renewable energy are now essential to tackling both the current energy crisis and reducing Europe's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn this context, Schneider Electric implemented an energy sufficiency plan to adapt quickly to the fast-changing energy situation. Criticality assessments were conducted at Schneider's sites across Europe, assessing the potential likelihood that electricity or gas supplies may be cut. Business continuity plans were proactively put in place to ensure the Group is able to continue to serve customers through this time of uncertainty. Schneider adopted European Commission recommendations on energy consumption reduction as targets for sites in Europe: gas consumption by 15%, and electricity consumption by 10%.\n\nFrom August to December 2022, Schneider Electric succeeded in reducing gas consumption by more than 32% and electricity consumption by more than 10% for its operations across Europe, as compared to the same period in 2021 and with no disruption to operations or service to customers.\n\nMore about Schneider Electric's management of the energy crisis can be found on Schneider's blog.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Spotlight: sufficiency actions at 'The Hive', Schneider Electric's Paris headquarters\n\nSchneider Electric is responding to the energy crisis with a plan that supports France's EcoWatt charter and aims to reduce energy consumption by 10% and shed or shift loads to avoid demand peaks when required.\n\nEnabled by integrated EcoStruxure solutions, the indoor temperature at this Schneider building has been reduced a few degrees, with ventilation and heating start times adjusted. In addition, hot water to washroom taps has been cut all year long. The kitchen lighting and ventilation schedule is optimized. Corridor lighting is reduced from 100% to between 40 and 70%, and car park lighting hours are reduced. All employees have been encouraged to take additional steps.\n\nIn total, electricity consumption has been reduced by almost 300 MWh per year. The facility can also automate responses to EcoWatt peak period alerts, reducing demand by more than 500 kW by controlling heating and ventilation, limiting or shifting EV charging, and more.\n\n'The Hive', Schneider Electric's Paris headquarters\n\n<!-- image -->",

Purchases are the predominant source if emissions, and transportation of goods make a significant contribution as well.\n\nDecarbonizing the world at scale requires immediate collective action. Schneider Electric is already taking concrete actions to meet its absolute 25% reduction across its value chain by 2030 and to be on track for its net-zero emissions by 2050. This includes:\n\n- \u00b7 the Zero Carbon Project (SSI #3), which aims at halving emissions from operations of the top 1,000 suppliers;\n- \u00b7 sourcing more and more green materials, including materials such as steel and plastics with lower carbon footprints (SSI #4);\n- \u00b7 increasing the CO 2 efficiency of transportation of goods (SSE #4).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Suppliers\n\nScope 3\n\nupstream\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## +4.6%\n\nCO 2 e emissions in Scope 3 upstream vs. 2021. Note that total Scope 3 GHG emissions decreased by 11.5% in 2022 vs. 2021.\n\n## 2.3.6.1  The Zero Carbon Project\n\nCarbon emissions from Schneider Electric's procurement of goods and services (emissions from its suppliers up to the last tier) represented 7.6 million tonnes of CO 2 e in 2022, which is 12% of its cradle-to-grave carbon footprint, and 88% of its cradle-to-gate industrial footprint. This is the largest contributor to the Group's Scope 3 upstream emissions. The Zero Carbon Project (TZCP), launched in April 2021, is the first step of a journey to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Schneider Electric's suppliers.\n\nThe ambition of TZCP is to collaborate with 1,000 suppliers and reduce their operational (Scopes 1 & 2) GHG emissions by 50% by 2025 (SSI #3).\n\nParticipating suppliers are required to make public commitments for their reduction targets and share the emission reduction progress with Schneider. The participating companies in the program are based in more than 50 countries, represent 60 procurement categories and vary in terms of carbon maturity and size. To adapt to this diversity, the participating suppliers are allowed flexibility to customize their reduction plans by defining their own base year and baseline and adopting relevant reduction targets and time frames.\n\nThe fundamental actions that need to be implemented by suppliers, as part of this program include:\n\n- \u00b7 quantifying their GHG emissions (Scopes 1 & 2 are mandatory and Scope 3 is optional for now);\n- \u00b7 establishing an ambitious emission reduction target;\n- \u00b7 implementing an action plan to achieve the target.\n\nAs of 2022, more than 1,000 suppliers have committed to participate in the program, achieving an overall operational emission (Scopes 1 & 2) reduction of 10%.\n\nThe GHG emission reduction reported in Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) #3, is measured as the average supplier carbon intensity reduction for the proportion of the reporting suppliers out of 1,000 suppliers. This normalization helps achieve a more reliable picture of the overall progress of all participating suppliers.\n\nThe extensive capacity building efforts towards the quantification of carbon footprint and decarbonization actions have resulted in:\n\n- \u00b7 increased participation and quality of carbon accounting response from suppliers. As of December 2022, 946 suppliers out of 1,013 participating suppliers have calculated their CO 2 e emissions. This is 6 times higher than at the end of 2021, when 126 suppliers reported their CO 2 e calculations.\n- \u00b7 strong supplier actions, resulting in ~10% GHG reduction for 1,000 suppliers vs. 1% reduction at the end of 2021. Schneider Electric remains committed to working together with its partners to strengthen their efforts for stronger decarbonization. The Group will continue to record its suppliers' GHG declarations on an annual basis to ensure the most accurate and updated information is available for reporting performance.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

This is especially important as over 70% of participating suppliers had no previous experience of GHG emission quantification. Schneider Electric deployed an extensive supplier support framework. This framework focuses on three focal areas:\n\n- 1. Capacity building\n- 2. Digital support\n- 3. Expert consultation\n\n## Key figures In 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 946 suppliers computed their CO 2 footprint\n- \u00b7 Accelerated decarbonization led by continuous deployment of:\n- - Supplier Support Framework\n- - iAccelerate Zero Carbon Day workshops\n- - Dedicated 1:1 support led by Schneider's procurement team\n- - More than 130 live trainings\n- \u00b7 Supply Chain Renewable trainings\n- \u00b7 'S3' digital tool (for SME) to be launched in 2023\n\n2020 Baseline\n\n2025 target\n\n0%\n\n50%\n\n2022 Progress\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Capacity building\n\nOne of the first barriers for suppliers to embark on their sustainability journey is measuring their carbon footprint and understanding what they can do to reduce their carbon footprint. Extending Schneider's spirit and effort of collaboration from the quantification of the GHG emissions to the implementation of decarbonization actions, an acceleration plan was developed and deployed with the suppliers. This acceleration plan identified various levers of emission reduction that can be implemented by the suppliers. Each lever was analyzed in detail and compared with the characteristics of the participating supply base to determine the reduction potential per lever. To increase the practicality of implementation, individual actions were identified for each lever.\n\nMore than 130 live, training, mentoring and experience sharing sessions were conducted for suppliers in a variety of settings (group; focused; 1-1). Building on the foundation of the end-to-end decarbonization training delivered in 2021, a common feedback received from suppliers was the need for guidance and implementation support for the first steps towards decarbonization. Schneider Electric defined a simple step-by-step roadmap of decarbonization, and explained each step in detail.\n\n## iAccelerate\n\nTo drive and scale up the adoption of emission reduction levers by suppliers, Schneider Electric adopted an innovative approach and curated a dedicated workshop under the aegis of 'iAccelerate Zero Carbon Day'. The India Middle East Africa (IMEA) and East Asia Japan (EAJ) regions of Schneider Electric, led by the local Procurement leadership teams successfully piloted its execution in Singapore and this is now being rolled out to other regions.\n\nThe fundamental idea behind iAccelerate workshop is that suppliers lack the practical knowledge to decarbonize, and if this information gap were filled, they would readily adopt emission reduction practices. To ensure this gap was bridged, a suitability analysis was conducted to identify the appropriate decarbonization levers and the specific actions that are feasible and applicable across various geographies. Specific diagnostic tools were then developed and shared with suppliers to analyze their own operations and identify their most relevant actions. These diagnostic tools included:\n\n- 1. Low-hanging energy efficiency checklist\n- 2. Solar energy suitability calculator\n- 3. Digital emission calculator\n\nIn addition to the diagnostic, which was self-administered by the suppliers, subject matter experts were identified within the Schneider Electric ecosystem. The main task of these experts was to demystify and explain to the suppliers in very practical terms, for each action, what needs to be done, how it impacts their in-house processes and what are the overall benefits to the organization. In addition, service/solution providers were identified who can support suppliers in the execution of these actions. The Schneider Electric procurement team executed an expression of interest to identify the right companies and held screening discussion to ensure they were aligned with the idea and objective. This created a pool of service providers, in case they were needed.\n\nFollowing this background preparation, the suppliers were engaged in an intensive five-week pre-workshop process to review the GHG emission data, results of diagnostics and commitment of the leadership to overall decarbonization. During the iAccelerate Zero Carbon Day, the supplier teams were able to listen to and understand subject matter experts who explained how individual actions can help their companies, and subsequently were able to visit the roadshow organized by the service/solution providers and engage on implementation modalities.\n\nThe purpose of the iAccelerate workshop is to provide an overview of actions and approaches to decarbonize and no commercial interests are associated. The suppliers are free to learn and discuss with the stakeholders, to treat it as a educational experience and then to explore the market to find the most suitable partner to engage for implementing decarbonization measures.\n\nThe power of peer-to-peer experience sharing was also harnessed. Separate sessions were organized with participating companies who are leading the decarbonization journey, to share their experiences and lessons learnt with other suppliers. We are thankful to Henkel AG and ArcelorMittal teams, who shared the actions and processes implemented in their companies and provided practical suggestions for enhancing decarbonization efforts.",

As a result of the exercise, the emission reduction forecast for the two regions increased.\n\n## Digital support\n\nTo ensure that participating suppliers have access to all the latest knowledge, research, trainings, and tools for decarbonization, the Group developed a dedicated web portal on decarbonization, which is exclusively available to TZCP member companies. The portal hosts all the key trainings conducted so far. To automate the supplier emission calculation, a digital tool was developed and made available to suppliers. This tool removes the need to identify appropriate emission factors and manual calculations. The suppliers can simply collect and enter the usage data of various energy sources and the tool refers to the appropriate emission sources and gives the emission sources, standardizing and improving the quality of the data reported by suppliers.\n\n## Supply Chain Renewable Initiative\n\nA dedicated program called 'Supply Chain Renewable Initiative' (SCRI) is under implementation to help suppliers with low electricity demand to access renewable electricity.\n\n## Expert consultation\n\nIn addition, Schneider leveraged its partnership with organizations delivering best-in-class trainings. The Group invited 500 suppliers who are CDP members to respond to the survey and use their resources. In Singapore, Schneider launched a SME kickstarter decarbonization program, leveraging incentives offered by the Government to SME to decarbonize.\n\nLearn more about the Zero Carbon Project from the Sustainability section on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.3.6.2 Buying more Green Materials\n\nSchneider Electric has committed to increasing the volume of green materials in products to 50% by 2025, for about 30% of its procurement volume, and is tracking quarterly progress as part of the Schneider Sustainability Impact program (SSI #4).\n\nWhile this program does not focus solely on CO 2 , but also mitigates other environmental impacts such as resources, biodiversity or toxicity, it will contribute to reducing the Group's Scope 3 upstream emissions, in line with its Net-Zero Commitment.

The related CO 2 emissions are part of the Scope 3 upstream emissions of the Group's carbon footprint, as this activity is performed by external transport suppliers.\n\nIn 2022, emissions from the transportation of goods represented 1.1 million tonnes of CO 2 , which is 2% of the Scope 3 upstream emissions company-wide. The transportation that is directly paid by the Group (about 60% of the freight CO 2 emissions) is closely monitored, with primary data coming from detailed shipment information from the top 70% of transport suppliers. The CO 2 emissions are then calculated including the emissions from the full lifecycle of fuels, which means upstream emissions in the energy sector and the direct emissions at point of use.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, CO 2 emissions intensity from transportation was reduced by 10%, and an additional decrease of 8.4% was achieved between 2018 and 2020. With its Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) 2021-2025, the Group aims to further reduce CO 2 intensity in transportation by 15% compared to 2020 (SSE #4).\n\nFor 2022, continued shortages and supply chain challenges early in the year led to the use of more expedited modes of transport. Additionally, internal focus on building resilience within operations through increased regionalization of manufacturing resulted in an increased use of regional road freight and a decrease in international sea freight. Together, these factors shifted the transportation mode mix, resulting in a 7.7% increase in transport CO 2 emissions intensity compared to 2020. Looking forward, as operations normalize, there will be a continued focus internally to optimize the transportation mode mix towards lower CO 2 options.\n\n2022 freight CO 2 e emissions by mode (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 15% CO 2 efficiency in transportation\n\nAs part of its efforts to reduce the CO 2 intensity of transportation, Schneider Electric is focusing on both the optimization of its transport networks, modes, and utilization, and on piloting low-carbon transportation technologies such as electric vehicles.\n\nFor example, for one of the Group's critical transport lanes, from Singapore to France, a multi-model solution was implemented to replace airfreight with a hybrid sea freight-airfreight solution. This achieved an estimated 47% annual reduction in CO 2 emissions for this flow. Additional multimodal opportunities have been deployed globally and new ones are being identified as the Group seeks to reduce the overall impact of airfreight emissions.\n\nIn Europe, an annual road freight optimization contest is held internally within plant and distribution center operations to reduce the total number of outbound road freight trips. This has led to a reduction in the number of trucks used by 419 and resulted in saving 347 tonnes of CO 2 across 14 sites in the past two years, with plans to expand this best practice globally to scale the CO 2 savings opportunity.\n\n2020 Baseline\n\n2025 target\n\n0%\n\n-7.7%\n\n15%\n\n2022 Progress",

To jump-start the market, the coalition's members commit in advance to purchasing a proportion of the industrial materials and long-distance transportation they need from suppliers using near-zero or zero-carbon solutions, despite the premium cost.\n\nMore about the First Movers Coalition of the World Economic Forum can be found on the organization's page\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider made an initial commitment to the aviation working group to replace at least 5% of conventional jet fuel use with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030. This commitment to the use of SAF, in conjunction with a focus on reducing company use of air freight, will have a significant impact on Schneider's carbon footprint from the hard-to-abate aviation sector. Additionally, the Group further enhanced CO 2 reporting capabilities to not only report on freight CO 2 footprint, but to provide analytics to facilitate engagement internally, and with transport suppliers, on decarbonization initiatives.\n\nCollaborative engagement with the Group's transportation suppliers will continue, focusing on the pillars of optimizing existing transport footprint, as well as supporting and piloting advanced low carbon transportation technologies across all transport modes air, sea, and overland freight.\n\nEvidence of Schneider's initiatives to mitigate the impact of transport-related CO 2 emissions include:\n\n- \u00b7 ongoing reviews globally of lead-time requirements, allowing a shift to lower CO 2 emissions transport modes and introduction of multimodal solutions;\n- \u00b7 network design optimization to move towards more direct flows or opportunities to source products closer to the customer;\n- \u00b7 in all regions, pilot implementations of electric vehicles for final mile customer deliveries;\n- \u00b7 in Asia, implementation of a rail solution from China to Singapore to replace existing air, sea, and road freight solutions;\n- \u00b7 with the Group's key transport providers, identifying opportunities to use sustainable fuel options where zeroemission options are not available.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 2.3  Leading on decarbonization\n\n## 2.3.7  Decarbonizing the Group's downstream emissions\n\nDownstream emissions are by far the largest category of emissions. They represent 86% of Schneider Electric's footprint, and largely come from the electricity consumption by the Group's customers during the use phase of the products.\n\nSchneider's strategy to decarbonize its downstream emissions is articulated around 4 main pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 innovating and eco-designing in product development: eco-design principles aim at reducing the environmental impact of products, including the product carbon footprint, for instance by increasing the energy efficiency of products in use phase;\n- \u00b7 substituting all relevant offers with SF 6 -free medium voltage technologies by 2025: since end-of-life emissions from sold products are predominantly due to their SF 6 content, this substitution will result in a significant drop in the downstream carbon footprint;\n- \u00b7 using the Group's voice for influencing the transition towards a more electric, digital, and decarbonized world;\n- \u00b7 supporting customers in their own decarbonization journey by providing products and services that drive significant decarbonization of their operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEcodesign is developed in chapter 2.4 'Being efficient with resources', page 180 , and the decarbonization of customers with Schneider Electric's products in section 2.3.8, page 172 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\nScope 3 downstream\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-13.7%\n\nCO 2 e emissions reduction in Scope 3 downstream vs. 2021, mostly driven by an update of electricity emission factors projections.\n\n## 2.3.7.1 Developing SF 6 -free offers and SF 6 recovery services\n\nThe SF 6 gas has excellent insulating properties and has therefore been widely used for building switchgear - especially medium voltage gear - for the past 30 years, as it allows a reduction in the size of the electrical equipment. The electric power industry uses roughly 80% of all SF 6 produced worldwide, and the global installed base is still expected to grow by 75% by 2030.\n\n## SF 6 -free AirSeT, a suite of award-winning medium voltage innovations\n\nWhile helping ensure the safety and quality of certain medium voltage equipment, SF 6 gas has a Global Warming Potential (GWP) 25,200 times higher than CO 2 , making it one of the highest greenhouse gases. Schneider is therefore innovating its offers to move away from SF 6 gas, as part of the SSE #2: 100% substitution with SF 6 -free medium voltage technologies by 2025. In 2021, Schneider's promises to deliver new SF 6 -free medium voltage switchgear became a reality with the installation of innovative products at several customer sites. 2021 was the year of the industrialization of several new product lines, free of SF 6 , to prepare for the full commercial launch of this new generation of products. In 2022, Schneider unveiled the latest equipment in the SF 6 -free medium voltage solutions contributing to the global fight against climate change, with GM AirSeT, a breakthrough primary gasinsulated technology for electrical networks and demanding applications in industrial buildings and critical infrastructure.\n\nSchneider's technology has been piloted at numerous electric utilities, infrastructure and buildings, by customers such as GreenAlp in France, EEC Engie in New Caledonia, Renault Group in France, and Azienda Trasporti Milanesi in Italy. AirSeT has also received multiple recognitions, most recently at the Greek Energy Mastering Awards 2022 and by the International Carbon Handprint Award at Climate Week NYC.\n\nThe average RM AirSeT switchgear installation removes the need for up to 3 kg of SF 6 gas, the equivalent of over 75 tonnes of CO 2 .\n\n## SF 6 recovery services\n\nIn 2013, Schneider Electric started offering its customers a seamless service for the removal and/or recycling of obsolete equipment called 'SF 6 recovery services'. Today, recovery services are available in France and 10 other countries, and customer support is being developed to expand a model adaptable to different markets in different countries all over the world. The ambition is to offer recovery services to any SF 6 Schneider legacy by 2025.\n\nThe recovery service allows the Group's customers to dispose correctly of their machinery, against a green disposal certificate, thus granting them peace of mind. The service consists in collecting the equipment and, together with our partners, dismantling and reusing, recycling or disposing of all the components (such as metals or thermoplastics) appropriately. Specifically, SF 6 is extracted from machines and sent to a specialist company for regeneration and destruction.",

Policies underpin the pace and the progress that the world will be able to make towards decarbonization. The Group will use its voice to speak out on public policy issues that Schneider Electric thinks can advance the world's carbon efforts:\n\n- \u00b7 public policy initiatives that accelerate the electrification, digitization, and decarbonization of the economy;\n- \u00b7 the removal of regulatory barriers to help catalyze markets to enable carbon-reduction technologies to scale more quickly;\n- \u00b7 the use of market and pricing mechanisms so people and businesses can make more informed carbon decisions;\n- \u00b7 the empowerment of consumers through transparency based on universal standards to inform purchasers about the carbon content of goods and services.\n\nIn 2022, Schneider Electric signed Corporate Knights' Action Declaration on Climate Policy Engagement together with more than 50 other companies to support climate action aligned with the Paris Agreement when engaging with policymakers, work with trade associations to advance alignment with the Paris Agreement and monitor and disclose climate policy alignment.\n\nSchneider is engaged in sectoral and multi-stakeholder organizations that drive ecosystem change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more details on Schneider Electric global and local external commitments to move forward collectively in chapter 2.1.8 page 95 , and on Schneider Electric lobbying activities in chapter 2.2.3.5 page 118.\n\n## Electrification policies\n\nSchneider advocates for strong climate and clean energy policies in many jurisdictions where it operates. The Group supports innovative technologies and projects that reduce carbon dioxide, modernize and digitize the grid, accelerate clean energy, and strengthen resilience to the impacts of a changing climate. In the USA, Schneider submitted comments to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's proposal for The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors.\n\nIn Europe, Schneider engages actively with the European institutions advocating for rapid electrification and decarbonization of the grid. For example, in May 2022, it submitted its views about the REPowerEU plan of the European Commission, a strategy plan that aimed to fast forward the green transition. Schneider's own position paper highlighted ten ideas to move forward Europe policy framework into that direction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiscover the white paper 'REPowerEU: Empowering energy consumers for a more sustainable and resilient Europe' on www.se.com\n\nThe Group engages with local governments on the electrification, digitization and decarbonization of the economies.\n\n## Carbon policies\n\nSchneider Electric calls for policymakers to define robust and predictable carbon pricing for companies, enabling companies to integrate collaterals on climate into their strategy. A high and stable price for carbon will strengthen incentives to invest in sustainable technologies and to change behaviors.\n\nSchneider supports the implementation of carbon pricing. Internally, the Group is incorporating an internal or shadow price for carbon to test its portfolio's resilience to climate scenarios. The Group internal shadow price is meant to uncover inefficiencies, incentivize low carbon innovation, and understand the potential impact of external carbon pricing on the profitability of a project, a new business model, or an investment. Schneider uses different carbon price scenarios, varying from EUR 50-130/ton (depending on time horizons) to inform the Group's climate strategy.\n\nThe internal carbon price is used to assess the performance and resiliency of operations. The cost of carbon is evaluated for industrial activities, taking into account CO 2 emissions from energy consumption and SF 6 leaks at industrial sites. CO 2 cost is also taken into consideration in industrial network modelling to account for future CO 2 prices in industrial decisions. This enables the measurement of the potential impact of CO 2 pricing on the Group's supply chain.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 energy Efficiency : the Group helps companies become more efficient and reduce their CO 2 emissions, for instance with variable speed drives or energy performance contracting;\n- \u00b7 renewable power generation : Power Purchase Agreements or microgrids lead to the consumption of less carbon-intensive electricity;\n- \u00b7 reduced GHG leakage : SF 6 -free equipment or SF 6 recovery services lead to reduced emissions;\n- \u00b7 materials efficiency : circularity business models (e.g., refurbish) or lead battery recycling lead to reduced emissions for manufacturing virgin materials.\n\nTo demonstrate this positive impact, a new indicator was launched in 2018 which tracks how Schneider's offers enable its customers to save and avoid emissions. The Group has committed to reaching a cumulated 800 million tonnes of CO 2 of saved and avoided emissions by its customers between 2018 and 2025 (SSI #2). This commitment is one of the three performance indicators of the first ever convertible Sustainability-Linked Bond launched by the Group at the end of 2020. Overall, from 2018 to 2022, Schneider Electric helped customers save and avoid 440 million tonnes of CO 2 e.\n\n## Cumulative saved & avoided CO 2 e emissions since 2018 (MtCO 2 e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## +93M tonnes\n\nCO 2 e emissions saved and avoided for our customers in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Deliver 800 million tonnes of saved and avoided CO 2 emissions to our customers (cumulated between 2018 and 2025)\n\nAltivar variable speed drives were awarded as 'Most Climate-Positive Carbon Handprint Product Award' at Climate Week 2022. By allowing motors to operate at the ideal speed for every load condition, Altivar variable speed drives can generate up to a 30% reduction in energy consumption in industrial processes.\n\nConsequently, it's estimated that over 180 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions could be saved or avoided during the service life of the drives sold by Schneider Electric during the 2018-2022 period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo transparently measure these saved and avoided emissions, the Group developed a methodology that is publicly available on the Group's website. It was developed with Carbone 4, an expert CO 2 accounting consulting company. The methodology is designed to become a shared industry standard. Its principles are applicable across the capital goods and consumer durables sectors.\n\nAttention was given to defining rigorous calculations, with conservative assumptions. The methodology was first published in July 2019 and was independently reviewed by the audit company EY with regards to its consistency, accuracy, understandability, neutrality, completeness, and relevance. The methodology has been assessed in view of the requirements of ISO 14067 and ISO 14021.",

The threat to our natural ecosystems is now greater than ever.\n\nThe world is facing a twin crisis of climate change and nature loss, which are inextricably linked and require a unified effort to be addressed. On the one hand, climate change is the third driver of biodiversity loss (IPBES 2019), and is projected to become the first in the years to come, unless we achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. On the other hand, nature has historically provided carbon sinks to help balance the growing carbon emissions created by human activity. These sinks are now disappearing rapidly, due to deforestation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider Electric's long-term commitment is to be efficient with resources, by behaving responsibly and making the most of technology, including digital technology to preserve our planet. Concretely, its strategy is to minimize the lifecycle environmental footprint of its products and solutions, while maximizing the environmental benefits they can bring. This strategy has three pillars: first, to be efficient with resources and responsibly source materials, second to protect, and restore biodiversity and third to innovate with circularity as the end game.\n\nWith Schneider Sustainability Impact and its concrete programs, the Group is constantly innovating, so its offers contribute to a more circular economy, in industrial processes, product design, and business model. In 2022, the proportion of sustainable packaging doubled, from 21% to 45%, and the Group joined The Copper Mark and Responsible Steel to accelerate responsible material sourcing for metals.\n\n'2022 was a challenging year for supply chains with continuous disruptions. We have taken further actions to strengthen resilience for the short, medium, and long term - making significant capacity investments, accelerating regionalization, and simplifying flows. With our strategic supply chain partners, we are building additional resilience, improving energy efficiency, reducing carbon emissions, advancing circularity, and preserving local biodiversity.'\n\nMourad Tamoud, Chief Supply Chain Officer",

        "page_content": "## 2.4 Being efficient with resources\n\n## 2.4.1 Minimize the Group's impacts and dependencies on nature\n\n## 2.4.1.1 Context\n\nA sustainable future for people and economies will only be possible if nature, climate, and people are addressed in an integrated way. Climate change is among the main drivers of biodiversity loss, while nature is part of the climate solutions. If the limit of warming of 1.5\u00b0C becomes impossible to reach, climate change will likely become the dominant cause of biodiversity loss in the coming decades. WWF 'Living Report 2022' points out that rising temperatures are already driving mass mortality events, as well as the first extinctions of entire species. Every degree of warming is expected to increase these losses and the impact they have on people.\n\nAn analysis of 163 industry sectors and their supply chains found that over half of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - US$44 trillion of economic value generation - is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services. Pollination, water quality and disease control are three examples of the services an ecosystem can provide. As nature loses its capacity to provide such services, the economy could be significantly disrupted. This report found that many industries have significant 'hidden dependencies' on nature in their supply chain and may be more at risk of disruption than expected.\n\n## 2.4.1.2 Risks and opportunities\n\nWhen considering this 'climate-nature nexus', Schneider Electric recognizes the inability to mitigate - or adapt to - the impacts of climate change without protecting, restoring, and enhancing our global stocks of nature. The Group used the Taskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework to conduct a double materiality assessment: impacts and dependencies; risks and opportunities related to nature. The double materiality approach looks at the two-way interaction with nature: how nature impacts a company and its operations, but also how the operations of a company impact nature.\n\nSchneider assessed impacts and dependencies on the four realms of nature defined by TNFD (land, ocean, freshwater, and atmosphere), and five main drivers of nature change: climate change, resource exploitation, land and sea use change, pollution and invasive alien species.\n\n## Risks\n\nAs a discrete manufacturing industry, Schneider Electric's physical footprint from its operations and value chain may impact nature's capital, local and global ecosystems.\n\nTo measure its impact on nature, Schneider Electric has conducted an end-to-end biodiversity footprint assessment, quantifying biodiversity-related risks and identifying opportunities for reducing these risks across its value chain, with a global and scientific approach. The Group's biodiversity footprint shows that most of its impacts are indirectly caused by its carbon emissions, and that dependencies come mainly from the use of resources in manufacturing, and logistics.\n\n## Opportunities\n\nSchneider Electric is convinced that the circular economy can help create a win-win-win-win ecosystem:\n\n- \u00b7 good for the planet, because it reduces the use of virgin resources;\n- \u00b7 good for customers, because it enables lower total cost of ownership, or increased lifespan of assets;\n- \u00b7 good for business resilience because it improves customer intimacy and stickiness as well as overall stakeholder attractivity;\n- \u00b7 good for collaborators because it provides a meaningful purpose.\n\nSchneider Electric has a fantastic opportunity to enable more repair, retrofit, and recycling services, provided the product categories concerned are adequately maintained, and serviced by qualified and certified experts.\n\nThe regionalization of environmental regulations is creating complexity for companies across the value chain and requires enhanced product traceability. Schneider's worldwide approach of environmental product stewardship directives fed by a local network of experts enables the group to adjust promptly to future requirements, providing Schneider with the opportunity to strengthen its relationships with its suppliers, and to provide its customers with the robust product life cycle information they demand.\n\n## 2.4.1.3 The Group's commitment\n\nSchneider Electric reduces its GHG emisions by engaging and transforming its value chain to be efficient with resources, increasing recycling and responsible behaviors towards raw materials, plastics and wood used. Finally, Schneider acts locally, engaging employees and partners to implement local biodiversity conservation and restoration programs. Site managers and biodiversity leaders define their site's biodiversity program. Guidelines define the rules applicable for the Schneider Sustainabiity Essentials target and share best practices across sites for continuous improvement.\n\n## Schneider Electric's commitment to act4nature international\n\n- 1. Quantify and regularly publish the assessment of the Group's impacts on biodiversity;\n- 2. Commit to reduce Schneider's impacts and align biodiversity objectives with science;\n- 3. Develop solutions and technologies that contribute to the preservation of biodiversity;\n- 4. Engage and transform the value chain;\n- 5. Act locally, engaging employees and partners.\n\nConsult Schneider's commitments to Act4Nature international on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.4.1.4  Biodiversity footprint measurement\n\nThe quantification of the Group's impacts on biodiversity is an essential firs step to understand its impacts and dependencies on nature and take appropriate action. In 2020, Schneider Electric became the first company to publish the end-to-end Biodiversity Footprint Assessment (BFA) of its activities, using the Global Biodiversity Score (GBS) tool developed by Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations (CDC) Biodiversit\u00e9. By sharing its experience with other companies and publishing the results transparently, the Group aims to demonstrate that measuring biodiversity footprints is a key first step in helping companies define relevant and impactful biodiversity strategies, across their entire value chain.\n\nThe GBS gives detailed and modular results which can be split by input line (for example, by raw materials such as metal, plastic, or timber); by pressures on biodiversity (such as land use, climate change, fragmentation, or encroachment); or it can be presented by scopes in Mean Species Abundance per square kilometer (MSA.km\u00b2). Synthetic, easy to understand and widely available, this metric has the potential to become the international standard. et c ast epote ta tobeco et e te ato a sta dad\n\nThe results of Schneider's BFA are presented hereafter illustrating the Group's dynamic terrestrial impact, with details by pressure. The pie chart highlights the weight of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which represent almost 70% of Schneider Electric's pressure on biodiversity. Land use accounts for almost 30% of 'cradle-to-gate' impacts. The results of Schneider's BFA are presented hereafter illustrating The results of Schneider s BFA are presented hereafter illustrating the Group's dynamic terrestrial impact, with details by pressure. The pie chart highlights the weight of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which represent almost 70% of Schneider Electric's pressure on biodiversity. Land use accounts for almost 30% of 'cradle-to-gate' impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about Schneider Electric's commitment to biodiversity on www.se.com\n\nThe BFA allowed Schneider Electric to identify the main levers of action to reduce its biodiversity footprint across its value chain:\n\n- \u00b7 Reduce GHG emissions in the Group's own operations and in the supply chain. Climate change is one of the major pressures on biodiversity globally and is the Group's main impact on biodiversity (close to 70%). Therefore, Schneider's Net-Zero Commitment will have a significant impact on reducing the Group's pressure on biodiversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore details on Schneider's climate programs and achievements are presented in chapter 2.3 pages 148 to 173 .\n\n- \u00b7 Reduce the 'land use' due to the extraction of raw materials. The main driver of land use is the extraction of wood and metals. Wood is mainly used for packaging purposes (cardboard, pallets, boxes); metals are the core of the Group's products (silver, copper, steel, aluminum...). Greater transparency and access to data on end-to-end supply chain is key to understand how to minimize the Group's impacts and dependencies on nature. Nevertheless, whether on climate or nature, data quality should not get in the way of necessary immediate action. Schneider made several commitments :\n- - Source 100% deforestation-free wood by 2030;\n- - Source 50% 'green materials' in its products by 2025 (SSI #4);\n- - Use 100% of sustainable primary and secondary packaging by 2025 (SSI #5).\n\n## Schneider Electric's biodiversity industrial footprint by scope (in MSA.km2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cradle-to-gate terrestrial dynamic pressures on biodiversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 2.4  Being efficient with resources\n\n## 2.4.1.5   Actions to minimize the Group's impact on biodiversity\n\n## Deforestation-free wood by 2030\n\nIn June 2022, Schneider Electric made the commitment to be deforestation-free by 2030. Deforestation is currently running at a rate of 10 football fields a minute in the areas most critical for carbon storage and biodiversity. Last year, primary tropical forests the size of the Netherlands were destroyed. There is no path to net-zero that does not address deforestation and supports nature-based solutions.\n\nTo date, the deforestation-free wood program runs largely through the SSI #5 (100% of our primary and secondary packaging is free from single-use plastic and uses recycled cardboard), which addresses the large majority of wood consumption by Schneider Electric. In parallel, streams of work are being created to address the complementary topics, such as technical wood or marketing materials.\n\n## Use the Group's voice for mandatory disclosure on nature\n\nIn October 2022, Business for Nature launched the United Nations Biodiversity Conference of Parties (COP15) advocacy campaign (#MakeItMandatory) to call on governments to mandate assessment and disclosure on impacts and dependencies on biodiversity for businesses and financial institutions above a certain size across the 196 member states of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Schneider signed the campaign, joining more than 330 companies calling on Heads of State and Governments to include in COP15 agreement Target 15, mandatory requirements for all large and transnational businesses and financial institutions to assess and disclose their impacts and dependencies on biodiversity, by 2030. During the COP15 Biodiversity, Schneider supported an ambitious Target 15, shared its actions to date and ambitions relating to nature, and learned from others public and private sector actors. Leading businesses already recognize the multifaceted benefits and opportunities that come with investing in nature, and the risks that come from inaction, and are working towards assessing and disclosing their impacts. COP15 also showed how Schneider and others are already accelerating efforts to restore ecosystems, including anticipating and avoiding asset stranding, circumventing value chain disruptions and protecting vital habitats through responsible sourcing.\n\n## 2.4.1.6 Governance\n\nBecause Schneider Electric builds products that can help people and businesses decarbonize and digitize, environmental sustainability is core to every step of the cradle-to-cradle product lifecycle. The Group works hard to minimize the environmental impact of how it designs, manufactures, delivers, and maintains its products. The Group engages with partners and suppliers on the materials it uses, and integrates strict social and environmental accountability standards that address considerations around business ethics, human rights, and environmental impact.\n\nThe Group's environmental performance is delivered with the involvement of its strategy, R&D, manufacturing, procurement, finance, human resources, transportation, sales, marketing and services teams. This environmental performance is core to the customer value proposition, and is reported and discussed during leadership meetings of concerned entities, including the Global Supply Chain, the Decarbonization Committee, the Low-carbon product design Committee, the Board Audit & Risks Committee, the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee, Human Resources & the CSR Committee, and with the ExCom Function Committee.\n\nThe environmental transformations are driven by a global network of over 600 managers and experts responsible for the environmental management of sites, countries, product design, and marketing. The network of leaders driving environmental transformations consists of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 For the design and development of new offers : Sustainable Offers managers and leaders in each business are in charge of integrating key environmental considerations into the development of new products and producing expected environmental information for customers.\n- \u00b7 For the management of industrial, logistics, and large tertiary sites: Safety, Environment, and Real Estate VicePresidents are nominated in each region, with dedicated teams. They are responsible for implementing the Group's policies across all sites in their geographical remit. In each region, directors coordinate teams across a group of sites (clusters), as well as on site. These environmental and safety leaders are in charge of reporting on performance as well as executing environmental progress plans in the field.\n- \u00b7 For logistics: The Logistics Senior Vice-President and his/her teams within the Global Supply Chain department are in charge of measuring and reducing CO 2 emissions from freight at Group level.",

There are 10 specific domains in which Edison experts are identified, one of them being environment. Each year, an Environment Edison expert is expected to dedicate 10% to 20% of his/her time to lead a global initiative related to his/her expertise, such as the development of an e-learning course, a new standard, or an innovation.\n\nVarious governance bodies enable those communities to meet every month or quarter to ensure consistent adoption of environmental policies and standards throughout the Group. This network has access to a wide range of resources including standards, policies, best practices, benchmarks, and guidelines, all of which are shared on the dedicated intranet site and databases.\n\n## Group Operations' Environment policy\n\nSchneider Electric's operational environment strategy aligns with its broader sustainability strategy. Under this strategy, the Group's ambition is to operate sustainably within the limits of the planet and reconcile beneficial global economic growth and progress with the need for environmental preservation and regeneration.\n\nWithin its global environment policy, Schneider sets operational goals that emphasize the steps necessary to help advance towards its ambition. These goals are:\n\n- \u00b7 Continuously improve the environment management system and meet compliance obligations (see section 2.4.4.1);\n- \u00b7 Continue protecting the environment, preventing pollution, limiting emissions, and promoting biodiversity (see section 2.4.2 The Group's commitment to product sustainability);\n- \u00b7 Decouple our supply chain from natural resource consumption (see section 2.4.2 The Group's commitment to product sustainability).\n\nTargets enabling those goals are defined in the Group's Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) and Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) scorecards. Relevant SSI and SSE targets are SSI #5, SSE #8, SSE #9, and SSE #11.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 2.4  Being efficient with resources\n\n## 2.4.2  The Group's commitment to product sustainability\n\nAt Schneider Electric, every product or solution fulfils strict environmental performance. The Group has embraced a circular approach throughout the lifecycle of its products, and aims to design products with minimal material footprint and maximal lifetime value. Implementing a circular model that minimizes waste requires interventions up and down the value chain - innovative design, materials, service business models, reuse and redistribution processes, collection, and more.\n\n## 2.4.2.1  Design with circularity in mind\n\nCircularity is a key enabler and lever to climate change mitigation and biodiversity preservation. With circularity in mind, the Group can maximize the value retention of everything it produces through the products' lifetime.\n\nTo embed circular principles in its products and offers, the Group adopted EcoDesign Way \u2122 , a process developed to understand and manage the environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of products, and to coordinate efforts across the value chain.\n\nAny circular journey starts with the design phase, designing new business models, products and systems that use less resources, reduce the CO 2 emissions and keep materials in use. Schneider's designers embed circular design, integrate recycled and biobased materials, and aim to design durable, repairable and upgradable products that can be either repaired on-site while they're being used, retrofitted on-site or taken back to the Group's ECOFIT TM and repair centers.\n\nThe designers benefit from Ecodesign tools, playbooks and trainings that are regularly updated, easily available on the Group intranet. From the corporate level to the design squads, several teams define the Ecodesign and circularity strategy, develop materials to support the designers' upskilling and deployment of the circular design, and contribute actively to the development of standards at European and international level regarding circularity and material efficiency. This ensures that the internal practices are aligned with the latest standards and that the Group's expertise is well incorporated in the standardization landscape.\n\nFinally, the circular design actions are valued through the Green Premium TM program, communicating the environmental performance of Schneider's offers, with transparency, on aspects relating to durability, repairability, recycled content or recyclability.\n\n## 2.4.2.2 Ecodesign approach\n\nEcodesign is the design of products or services that aims to minimize the environmental impact throughout a product's lifecycle.\n\nIn 2015, to respond to customers' growing demand for products with a smaller environmental foootprint, and to embed circular principles in its products and offers, Schneider Electric adopted EcoDesignWay \u2122 , a process to understand and manage the environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of products, and to coordinate efforts across the value chain. In each phase of the product lifecycle, ecodesign principles are defined and followed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Human Resources department performed a thorough assessment to ensure each business unit was correctly staffed to foster ecodesign. It includes roles and responsibility descriptions and upskilling plans.\n- \u00b7 Environmental attributes (green materials, circular performance, low-carbon were included systematically in R&D priorization. The inclusion of a carbon price in R&D projects has also been tested. The objective is to include a carbon price in all R&D investment decisions in 2023.\n\n## Ecodesign in projects:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group has continued to rely on the EcoDesign Way TM process to incorporate ecodesign principles into every project. EcoDesign Way is a project scorecard that provides an exhaustive list of ecodesign performance attributes, fully aligned with the Green Premium TM program.\n- \u00b7 Apart from the EcoDesign Way Scorecard, environmental footprint tools such as Simplified Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) have been tested. In 2023, Schneider aims to develop a web-based ecodesign calculator to enable easier and faster environmental footprint by project teams, and help identify the most relevant ecodesign features.\n- \u00b7 Group Ecodesign experts have working with the Offer Excellence Academy to define an ecodesign training path to ensure all resources are available for the R&D community to raise awareness, train and upskill their teams. The training modules of the ecodesign training path will progressively be available in 2023.\n- \u00b7 Help customers improve resource efficiency through EcoStruxure TM solutions (SSI #2)\n- \u00b7 80% of product revenues covered by Green Premium \u2122 (SSE #6)\n- \u00b7 Deliver digitized environmental footprint information\n- \u00b7 Offer circular services such as maintenance, repair, refurbishment to maintain the products in use\n- \u00b7 Waste regulation compliance by providing transparent information for the proper dismantling and end-of-life management of products\n- \u00b7 Scale-up take-back programs to give a second-life to products or recycle them if no better option is feasible\n\n## 2.4.2.3  Substances management to eliminate hazardous substances\n\nSchneider Electric continues to remove hazardous chemicals from its products, processes, and supply chain, to minimize the potential harm for the environment and people health. The Group has tackled this issue for many years as part of its environmental programs reducing and managing its waste, emissions- and water-related risks, including pollution. It constantly substitutes substances or substance groups listed among the declarable and regulated substances in its products, whenever this is technically possible. The recent development of the new medium voltage switchgears without SF 6 (one of the most impacting greenhouse gases) is an illustrating example.\n\nThe Group operates in different jurisdictions with evolving regulations on environmental, health, safety, and product compliance. The regionalization of environmental regulations (e.g. California Prop 65, China RoHS, UAE RoHS) creates complexity, with thousands of suppliers. Therefore, Schneider has put in place a strong governance, relying on a worldwide approach of environmental product stewardship directives fed by a regional and local environmental steward network. Because substance presence identification and traceability is key, the Group is investing in robust digital systems to preform and report the environmental compliance of its wide portfolio of products, across several hundreds of thousands of commercial references.\n\n## RoHS and REACH\n\nSchneider Electric has adopted, for many years, a proactive implementation of the RoHS European Directive. This means the Group strives to have products compliant with RoHS and REACH substances restriction even if it is not in the legal or geographical scope of the directive. This includes all Schneider's offers, its local or independent name brands, manufactured in its plants or only labelled.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

It continues to work to reduce the number of products under the RoHS directive exemptions, and it continues to reduce the number of global exceptions to REACH and RoHS. 79% of products globally (83% of revenue) are compliant with RoHS restrictions, among which 36% without directive exemptions.\n\nResearch programs are carried out to find alternative solutions to the presence of lead in some metallic alloys, brominated flame retardants in PCBs, cobalt in surface treatments, to anticipate future possible restrictions. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is a wide family of substances that are targeted by both Europe and the United States of America in coming regulations. A first identification action was carried out in order to map the different usages both in the Group's products and manufacturing processes. The concept of 'essential use' will be associated to the regulation and Schneider must identify which of its applications are in line with this concept (which is not yet fully defined by the legislator) and where substitutions will be required.\n\nIn Europe, the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) directive are engaged in a refit process. Schneider actively participates in the public consultations through the professional organizations (FIEEC, Orgalim, Digital Europe), making some key proposals to improve efficiency and limit the administrative burden.\n\n## Compliance system\n\nA strong data management system is key to ensure product compliance and anticipate substitution actions. Internal IT processes are continuously adjusted with the goal of taking a more proactive and safe approach to the use of materials and substances, and to more efficiently fulfill the declaration requirements such as those of the European Substances of Concern In Products (SCIP) database through direct link or IEC 62474/IPC1752 structured data exchange formats.\n\nIn addition to IT tools, supplier compliance data collection is continuously improved with a new workflow and a wider scope of requests, pushing for full material disclosure information.\n\n## WEEE\n\nRelated to RoHS is WEEE, which stands for Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (also known as 'e-waste'). It refers to regulations, typically passed at a country or state level, aimed at promoting the reuse and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment and thereby reducing resource consumption and the amount of e-waste going to landfill. Requirements of WEEE regulations include, among others, financing the collection, treatment, recovery, and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE. With the rapidly expanding use of electrical and electronic products globally and the resulting growth in e-waste, more and more jurisdictions are enacting WEEE regulations.\n\nThe European Union (EU) WEEE Directive, is implemented through national regulations in all European Economic Area (EEA) countries including all EU member states, Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland. Schneider closely monitors developing WEEE legislation and complies with the EU WEEE Directive and EEA national regulations, as applicable.\n\nRequirements of the EU WEEE Directive 2002/96/EC and national regulations generally include, among others, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 financing the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE resulting from products on the corresponding market which have reached their end of useful life ;\n- \u00b7 labeling products with a crossed-out wheelie bin symbol to help minimize WEEE disposal as unsorted municipal waste and facilitate its separate collection. All applicable Schneider Electric products in the European markets need to comply with WEEE regulation and carry the 'Wheelie Bin' sticker.\n\n## 2.4.2.4  Reach 50% of green materials in products by 2025\n\n## Risk relating to sourcing materials\n\nThe acceleration of electrification globally is increasing competition to access some critical raw materials. For example, renewable power generation is shifting dependency of the energy sector from fossil fuels to mineral resources. The electric vehicles industry is expected to increase the demand for lithium 50-fold by 2040 and the demand for cobalt and graphite 30-fold, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nEvolving economic trend, global overexploitation, and limited access can result in shortages of natural resources within the Group's operations and its value chain. This can result in business disruptions and rising costs in both the short- and long-term, and additional challenges to secure supply for sustainable transformation programs (green materials, substances substitution, sustainable packaging).\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nRisks are taken into account in the STRIVE initiative of the Group's Global Supply Chain and covered by the Property Damage and Business Interruption program at site level.\n\nThe Group approaches access to resources at different time horizons, to ensure supply resilience both now and in the future. The Group is:\n\n- \u00b7 building short-term resilience in securing supply and protecting operations against price volatility with real time alerts to notify and activate action plans;\n- \u00b7 de-risking its portfolio with technological solutions and circular business models;\n- \u00b7 shaping the future with long-term material resilience and sustainability with disruptive actions.\n\nTo address uncertainty in long-term resource disruption, Schneider has added resource parameters in product EcoDesign and defined substitution strategies for critical resources. R&D actions are in place, focusing on materials with main strategic functions accompanied by communication channels to escalate and alert.",

With that commitment, the Group aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 Be a change agent to accelerate the transformation toward a low-carbon and circular economy of the material industry;\n- \u00b7 Reduce Scope 3 upstream emissions, in line with the Group's Net-Zero Commitment;\n- \u00b7 Differentiate Schneider's products by using low CO 2 , circular, and safer materials.\n\nAccording to Schneider, a green material has a lower environmental and social footprint, meaning low greenhouse gas emission, high recycled content, and no negative impact on people and the planet.\n\nTherefore, performance could be achieved, either through selecting material and/or supplier with a proven lower environmental footprint (e.g. proof of a material produced out of a 100% recycled content), or strengthening the traceability of sustainable initiatives in the value chain.\n\nWhile the first action is particularly relevant for thermoplastics materials, the second action is a priority for metal commodities where visibility of the environmental impact and technology-origin of procured metals is low.\n\nThe lower environmental footprint attributes are defined for each commodity in scope, as the environmental performance of metal cannot be based on the same attributes as plastic. In 2022, the scope of green materials focused on three types of commodities covering around a third of purchased materials in volume:\n\n- \u00b7 Thermoplastics (including both direct and indirect procurement). Thermoplastics are qualified as 'green' when the supplier provides evidence of a minimum recycled content, biobased content (the minimum threshold depends on whether the compound is halogenated or not) or is using a green flame retardant.\n- \u00b7 Steel (direct purchases). Steel is qualified as 'green' when the supplier provides evidence that the mill of origin is an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) or has a Green certificate such as the ones delivered by Responsible Steel.\n- \u00b7 Aluminum (direct purchases). Aluminum is qualified as 'green' when the supplier provides evidence that the product carbon footprint is below 8 tonnes of CO 2 per tonne of aluminum, is using a minimum of 90% of recycled content in its product or that the mill of origin has a Green certificate such as the ones delivered by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative.\n\n## Volume and distribution of 'green materials' (in kt)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Definitions of 'green thermoplastics' and 'green metals'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1)  Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) / Latest versions\n- (2)  According to IEC 63355\n- (3)  According to ISO 14021 & EN 45557\n- (4)  According to EN 16785 or ASTM D6866\n- (5)  According to GreenScreen used in TCO Certification\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1)  E.g.

In 2022, Schneider Electric businesses strengthened their green materials implementation targets and roadmap to accelerate the demand for greener alternatives from suppliers.\n\n## Partnerships to accelerate the sourcing of green materials\n\nIn 2022, Schneider Electric accelerated its engagement with suppliers regarding their sustainable transformation by building stronger connections and by securing the first volume of certified green steel.\n\nIn 2022, Schneider purchased 700 tons of Bluemint \u00ae Steel, a high-quality flat steel with reduced carbon intensity, from ThyssenKrupp. Purchasing Bluemint \u00ae Steel comes with a third party certificate to ensure CO 2 is directly reduced at the ThyssenKrupp Duisburg production site. Opting for such branded products helps Schneider to reduce its Scope 3 upstream emissions, enhance traceability in the steel supply chain and strenghten trust with suppliers. The Group is working to further develop this alternative and to leverage environmental benefits at offer level.\n\nSchneider also contributed as official partners to industry-wide associations and certification schemes. For example, the Group participated in Responsible Steel working groups, the world's first global scheme for responsibly sourced and produced steel. The Group supported the definition and publication of the latest ResponsibleSteel \u2122 International Standard V2.0, launched in September 2022, and incorporating additional requirements on GHG emissions and the sourcing of input materials. ResponsibleSteel \u2122 International Standard defines 13 principles\n\ncovering environmental, social and governance issues.\n\nIn 2022, Schneider became an official partner of The Copper Mark, which aims to accelerate responsible material sourcing for metals. Joining The Copper Mark will help the Group to improve the environmental and social aspects of the copper value chain. Schneider is looking forward to engaging further in pursuit of responsible materials sourcing goals together with The Copper Mark, and encourages its suppliers to participate in The Copper Mark Assurance Process, and aim collectively at responsible copper production.\n\nUltimately, Schneider aims to include all types of products, which is why definitions for copper and thermosets were prepared and tested with its suppliers in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increase green material content in our products to 50%\n\nThe Merten Ocean Plastic family of products was recognised in 2022 by the CES of Las Vegas as a 2022 Innovation Award honoree in the Sustainability Category. To develop this range from postconsumer recycled plastic, the Group partnered with DSM, a Netherlands-based company, converting fishing net waste into high-grade technical plastic that can be used in electrical devices. DSM collaborates with several local communities in India to recover and collect discarded fishing nets, providing a significant benefit to the local economy and environment. The abandoned fishing nets are then cut up, cleaned, extruded, and inspected for quality before being sent to DSM for processing into Akulon Repurposed compound.\n\nThe carbon footprint of this new compound is 82% lower than the traditional virgin material used in similar products, reducing the potential impact on global warming, air acidification, and photochemical ozone formation in its manufacturing process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020 Baseline\n\n2025 target\n\n7%\n\n50%\n\n2022 Progress\n\n18%",

Schneider Electric sustainable packaging program aims to foster innovative packaging solutions to ensure a safe and frustration-free packaging experience with a reduced impact on the environment.\n\nGlobally, a growing number of regulations require the development of packaging alternatives, with a focus on recyclability. To comply with these regulations and avoid current or upcoming polluter-pays packaging taxes, innovation and partnership with suppliers are key. Schneider suppliers are required to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including compliance with the European Union's Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste (1994/62/EC), as amended by 2018/852/EU and CEN packaging standards (EN 13427:2005), as well as the US Toxics in Packaging legislation.\n\nSchneider is working with its suppliers to ensure adequate supply of sustainable packaging materials.\n\nBy 2025, Schneider Electric is committed to reach:\n\n- \u00b7 100% of primary and secondary packaging with recycled cardboard. Cardboard is considered as recycled when it includes at least 70% of recycled fiber by weight, if legally accepted. Exception may be approved to avoid any compromise in product protection, safety or quality standard. Temporary exemption is made for North America, where an average of 50% of recycled fiber by weight is required to be considered as recycled.\n- \u00b7 100% of primary and secondary packaging free from single-use plastic. At Schneider, the definition of Single Use Plastics (SUP) is based on the European Plastic Pact : 'A single-use plastic product means a product that is made wholly or partly from plastic and that is not conceived, designed or placed on the market to accomplish, within its life span, multiple trips or rotations by being returned to a producer for refill or reused for the same purpose for which it was conceived.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Directive 2019/904/EC of 5 June 2019 on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment.\n\nIn 2022, Schneider's packaging teams worked to:\n\n- \u00b7 establish partnerships with key suppliers to secure alternative packaging options;\n- \u00b7 build up traceability in the supply chain by collecting suppliers' declarations and certificates for recycled cardboard;\n- \u00b7 update the sustainable packaging guideline and associated tools to facilitate sustainable packaging adoption in projects.\n\nIn 2023, the teams will work on:\n\n- \u00b7 accelerating SUP phase-out program to ensure new and legacy products switch to more sustainable packaging options;\n- \u00b7 strengthening procurement systems to better track single-use plastic packaging.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The Green Premium label means that a product follows the EcoDesign principles, and :\n\n- \u00b7 is compliant with RoHS and REACH regulations;\n- \u00b7 has an estimated lifecycle assessment impact (LCA);\n- \u00b7 has clear end-of-life instructions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGreen Premium introduced to provide transparent information on regulated substances and to share the environmental information of our products\n\nIn 2022, Schneider has redefined the program to encompass three pillars: Trust, Transparency, and Performance.\n\n- \u00b7 Trust means Schneider continues to be transparent with customers, providing RoHS and REACH substance information and going beyond regulations by applying the same rules regardless of the geographies. That is and will remain the core of the Green Premium \u2122 program.\n- \u00b7 Transparency is the commitment from Schneider to disclose in a digital way the environmental impacts of its products, their end-of-life treatment, as well as any environment-related attributes meaningful for customers. This is crucial in the Group's strategy, as the first step for improvement is measurement and quantification.\n- \u00b7 Performance is Schneider's commitment to deliver products with reduced environmental impact. Performance can take several forms:\n- - use of lower impact materials such as recycled plastics;\n- - enhanced product recyclability to reduce waste, and loss of critical raw materials;\n- - energy efficient products with at least 10% of improved energy efficiency with respect to the market average or to previous generations;\n- - improved durability and the ability to function as required under defined conditions of use, maintenance, and repair, until a final limiting state is reached (which should be at least 5% higher than market average);\n- - SF 6 -free products;\n- - easy repair of product parts.\n\n## Transparency\n\nDigital environment disclosure (PEP)\n\nCircularity profiles to provide guidance on responsible product end-of-life treatments\n\nTransparent environment attributes (ie.

For example, the Green Premium label signals circularity business models, such as 'take-back' programs. An example of a take back program is for customers who have purchased one of the Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPS) to have access to complementary recycling when the battery in the product reaches its end of useful life. In 2022, this service collected more than 15,000 tonnes of batteries globally for recycling.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In 2022, Schneider revamped the pages of its online catalogue to make all environmental information more easily available to customers, so that they can quickly identify Green Premium products and can choose the product they want according to environmental features.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsult digital conformity declarations, Product Environmental Profiles (PEP) and End-of-Life Instructions, on product pages, on the mySchneider mobile app, and on the 'Check a Product' website at https://checkaproduct.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.3.2 Product Environmental Profiles\n\nA greater number of customers, regulators, and standards bodies request quality and detailed environmental data. Many building standards and local regulations demand or promote offers providing Environmental Product Declarations.\n\nAn environmental footprint is a product or solution-related measurement that provides quantitative information based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA, according to ISO 14040-44 standard). It enables the assessment of multiple environmental impact indicators, including the carbon footprint, for all product or solution lifecycle stages. The scope of this assessment is also referred to as 'cradle-to-grave'. Environmental footprint is a mandatory requirement in the Green Premium \u2122 program.\n\nSchneider Electric relies on Product Environmental Profiles (PEP) to fulfill this requirement. A PEP is defined as a product-oriented 'summarized' version of a full LCA. It relies on Product Category Rules (PCR) or Product Specific Rules (PSR).\n\nAt Schneider, there are two types of PEP available:\n\n- \u00b7 Certified - a type III Environmental Declaration in compliance with ISO 14025. The certified PEP is externally reviewed by an accredited verifier and published by a program operator according to the rules provided by this operator (for example, PEP Ecopassport).\n- \u00b7 Internal - the internal PEP follows the exact same rules as the certified one. However, an internal PEP is reviewed internally and therefore cannot be registered through an independent program operator. A process of accreditation for internal verifiers guarantees the adequate level of internal PEP verifications. Verifiers check PEPs from lines of business other than their own, thus ensuring independence. Internal PEPs comply with the ISO 14021 self-completed declaration.\n\nIn 2022, more than 2,000 valid PEP were publicly available online, covering all of Schneider's product lines, and 87% of product lines are covered by an ISO 14025 type III declaration.\n\n## PEP Ecopassport PCRed4\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric made a major contribution to the development of the new Product Category Rules of the PEP Ecopassport association (PCRed4 issued in September 2021), which are:\n\n- \u00b7 Compliance with the EN 50693:2019 standard: Product category rules for lifecycle assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems - currently being mirrored in the IEC/TC111 Working Group 15 (IEC 63366);\n- \u00b7 Full alignment with the EN 15804+A2 standard: Sustainability of construction works - Environmental product declarations - Core rules for the product category of construction products;\n- \u00b7 Integration of key elements of the EU Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), such as mandatory impact indicators, end-oflife formulae, and quality ranking;\n- \u00b7 Alignment with ISO 14067:2018: Greenhouse gases - Carbon footprint of products - Requirements and guidelines for quantification, integrating the latest requirements of the French regulatory texts from RE2020.\n\nThe application of PCRed4 enables electrical and electronic equipment manufacturers to produce product environmental declarations in accordance with the best-known international standards, thus fostering cross-region and cross-industry recognition. Schneider aims to use this new PCR document to influence and strengthen the environmental footprint practices of the sector through standardization (TC111 Working Group, ZVEI initiative) and regulations (Sustainable Product Initiative of the European Commission, Green Taxonomy).\n\nIn 2022, Schneider updated its LCA tools in order to include new requirements from the PEP Ecopassport PCRed4. From 2023 onwards, all PEPs published by the Group will be compliant with the PCRed4.\n\nBy relying on the PEP Ecopassport PCRed4 methodology and the acceleration of environmental impact data digitization, Schneider strives to provide quantified environmental footprint information systematically and seamlessly to customers to differentiate its sustainable offers, and therefore, be a change agent towards a low-carbon and circular economy.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Around two thirds of this surface is occupied by large industrial facilities for manufacturing and logistics purposes. The remainder consists of office buildings, that vary in size and characteristics. Overall, Schneider's largest 100 sites account for about 50% of the Group's footprint and its largest 200 sites account for approximately 80%. For this reason, the KPIs in the following sections are built around those 200 largest sites, ie those with the most material impacts.\n\n## 2.4.4.1  Risks and opportunities within manufacturing operations\n\nEnvironmental risks related to manufacturing include soil, water, and air contamination. For instance, the release of hazardous substances can be harmful for fauna, flora, and human health. It can also disrupt continuity of operations and tarnish reputation. In addition to that, with factories and distribution centers spread across dozens of countries and different national environmental regulatory frameworks, risks of non-compliance exist. These risks include effluent management, handling of waste, and greenhouse gas-related expectations.\n\nA proactive approach towards site and property environmental risks and compliance helps preserve the continuity of operations, reduce reputational and legal risks, and avoid expensive remediation steps.\n\nResource and energy efficiency not only delivers financial savings, but also limits the Group's exposure to commodity-price volatility and shortage risks. Electrification megatrends are increasing competition to access some raw materials, creating shortage risks for Schneider Electric. The risk extends to the reliability of the energy on which a facility relies to maintain production.\n\nThe Group's CO 2 emissions contribute to climate change and may also incur additional costs as carbon taxes become implemented worldwide. Facilities and industrial assets themselves are also at risk of acute and chronic climate events which can disrupt the supply chain and endanger lives.\n\nThe Group believes environmental performance is a powerful tool to innovate towards a more efficient and resilient supply chain and generate bottom-line savings. By using its own EcoStruxure \u2122 architecture to achieve this ambition, the Group also showcases carbon efficient architectures to its customers.\n\nEnvironmental regulatory compliance, environmental management systems, and engagement programs with key stakeholders are the foundation of Schneider Electric's environmental risk management, prevention, and continuous improvement program for current, former, and prospective operations.\n\n## Compliance with environmental regulations\n\nHistorical environmental liabilities are managed at a regional level to ensure that local expertise, regulatory knowledge, and cultural awareness are applied. Using external consultants, known environmental issues are thoroughly investigated, and, if appropriate, remediated or otherwise managed through engineered or institutional controls to reduce potential risks to non-significant levels and in compliance with local regulations. Environmental risks and provisions are reviewed with local and corporate finance, as well as legal functions.\n\nDuring 2022, no new material environmental impacts were identified. See section 2.4.4.4 page 193 for more information. Furthermore, no Schneider Electric sites are Seveso-classified.\n\n## Environment management systems\n\nSchneider has put in place an Integrated Management System (IMS) which allows for standardized, streamlined, and collaborative deployment of its various management systems. The IMS covers the Group's plants, distribution centers, and large offices, and hosts ISO 14001, ISO 50001, ISO 9001, and ISO 45001 compliance management systems. Each site is audited periodically, either externally by Bureau Veritas (every three years), or internally. In particular, the relevant management system for the environment is ISO 14001.\n\nISO 14001 certification allows Schneider Electric to define and maintain robust environment governance on its sites, supporting continuous improvement to deliver environmental performance. The Group certifies all industrial and logistics sites with more than 50 employees and all large tertiary sites with more than 500 employees, within two years of their acquisition or creation.",

Robust governance with key stakeholders across the entire organization is critical to achieve and maintain success in the numerous areas surrounding environmental risk and prevention.\n\nThe Group has therefore established the following engagement programs:\n\n- \u00b7 The Company-wide Look at Environmental Assessment and Risk Review program (CLEARR), which focuses on historical and current potential environmental site risks, surveys new and existing selected manufacturing sites each year.\n- \u00b7 Thorough environmental due diligence reviews of mergers, acquisitions, and disposals, at any site where chemicals are or have been used. Any environmental risks or liabilities identified are addressed through proper risk management activities.\n- \u00b7 Third-party services assess the risk profiles of key sites in relation to certain external risks such as fires, earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters.This process is combined with the business continuity planning efforts to gauge related risks and anticipate possible steps which would be required.\n- \u00b7 Risks and mitigation actions are presented to the Board Audit & Risks Committee.\n\n## Resilience materials program\n\nThe Group approaches the access to resources at different time horizons, to ensure materials supply resilience both now and in the future. The Group is:\n\n- \u00b7 building short-term resilience in securing supply and protecting operations against price volatility with real-time alerts to notify and activate action plans;\n- \u00b7 de-risking its portfolio with technological solutions and circular business models;\n- \u00b7 shaping the future with long-term material resilience and sustainability with disruptive actions.\n\nTo ensure materials sourcing resiliency, Schneider has added resource parameters in product EcoDesign and defined substitution strategies for critical resources. R&D actions are in place, focusing on materials with main strategic functions accompanied by communication channels to escalate and alert.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Two main levers have been identified through the 'Waste-to-Resource' program. First, all sites generating hazardous waste ensure visibility of handling and end-of-life treatment paths. They must also seek to add value to waste where possible (through material or energy recovery) while neutralizing its hazardous nature. Secondly, top hazardous waste-generating sites should work to reduce the volumes of waste generated in the first place, notably by implementing 'Best Available Techniques' (BAT) in their industrial processes. Such BAT processes lead to superior performance from a resource efficiency perspective, and/or chemical substances use, and/or emission reductions.\n\nIn 2022, global challenges with supply chains, material shortages, and increased visibility towards waste pollution such as ocean plastics have confirmed that Schneider is heading in the right direction with its circularity strategy.\n\nIn its previous 2018-2020 program, 'Towards Zero Waste to Landfill', the Group placed strong emphasis on diverting waste from landfill through alternative solutions.\n\nIn its new program called 'Waste-to-Resource' (SSE #9), Schneider Electric takes its waste recovery program even further: sites must now achieve 99% recovery for all waste not classified as hazardous and still achieve 100% hazardous waste recovery using the best available handling/treatment options locally. Additionally, to promote and emphasize the importance of circular economy, 'Waste-to-Resource' sites are not allowed to use waste-to-energy solutions for more than 10% of their waste. This provides an opportunity for sites to work collaboratively within their internal supply chains, and alongside external suppliers and waste management providers, to find innovative reduce, reuse, and recycle solutions.\n\nIn 2022, the Group did successfully add 19 new Waste-toResource sites in 2022, but removed 18 sites that were Waste-toResource in 2021, of which half were either closed, sold, or transferred to third parties for business reasons. The other half, while collectively achieving a commendable 98.7% recovery with only 5.2% waste to energy, still missed the very challenging 99% recovery target.\n\nIn 2023, the Group will pursue its Waste-to-Resource efforts to more sites, thereby strengthening its culture of circular economy across its operations.\n\nSchneider generated around 131,000 tons of waste in 2022, most of it being solid waste. Continuous improvement plans have been deployed to manage this waste, in line with the ISO 14001 certification. Despite the challenges with the Waste-to-Resource program, the Group still managed to improve from 96% to 96.3% recovery of reported waste, and from 91% to 91.3% recycling rate without energy recovery in 2022 compared to 2021. The recovery ratio has increased from 81% to 96.3% since 2009, thanks to site-by-site waste management action plans.\n\nBy 2025, the ambition is to reduce hazardous waste intensity by 30% against the 2017 baseline. In 2022, hazardous waste generation intensity was 0.24 tonnes/million EUR of revenue, which represents an evolution of -44% versus 2017.\n\n## 96.3%\n\nwaste recovery in 2022\n\nTarget:\n\n100% by 2030",

Sheet metal is a mandatory raw material in this production process. While the site takes action to reduce scrap metal where possible, there is still some remaining scrap in the process. Instead of simply recycling or selling the scrap, the site has undertaken a circular economy project to reuse the scrap metal internally.\n\nThe site analyzed opportunities to reuse the scrap and discovered there were wooden pallets being used for in-house material movement and storage, but that these pallets would routinely need replacement, and there were issues with shortages of the needed pallets. By fabricating pallets from the scrap metal, the site was able to increase the longevity of the pallets' lifespan, decrease the reliance on wooden pallets, eliminate shortages issues, and reduce the metal waste linked to the production process.\n\nThis project has saved the site 220 wooden pallets to date and resulted in more than \u20ac36,000 savings annually. Moving forward, the site continues looking for ways to implement circular economy practices and reduce the waste generated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.4.3  Water withdrawal, discharge, and stress\n\nSchneider Electric regularly assesses water-related risks. The Group conducted a materiality analysis, with both internal and external stakeholders. In 2022 a specialized consultancy was mandated to map its corporate water footprint across the value chain, covering water consumption, scarcity, eutrophication, ecotoxicity, and acidification. The assessment showed that direct water use and indirect energy water use in facilities amounts for less than 1% of Schneider Electric's overall water footprint. This is explained by the nature of most of Schneider's industrial processes (manual and automatic assembly), which have limited water use.\n\nThe impact on water quality is considered minimal as well; the highest impact on water quality indicators comes from the use of products and upstream purchases categories. In 2022, water management and performance information were disclosed in the CDP Water Security program, and Schneider was awarded a B rating.\n\n## Water withdrawal\n\nThe Group measures water withdrawals per source, with details on water withdrawn from the public network, groundwater, surface water (for example lakes and rivers), and other sources of water (including rain and recycled water).\n\nWater is primarily used for cooling and sanitary purposes and, at a few selected sites, for processes such as surface treatment. Water drawn for the sole purpose of cooling is immediately released without alteration and is also monitored separately.\n\nSchneider Electric aims to reduce water intensity (in m 3 of water withdrawn per euro of turnover) by 35% in 2025 versus 2017, with a focus on sites with high water withdrawal and within water-stressed areas. In 2022, water withdrawal intensity was 56 m 3 per million euro of revenue, an evolution of -48% against the 2017 baseline.\n\n## Annual water withdrawal intensity (m 3 /million \u20ac)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 2.4 Being efficient with resources\n\n## Water discharge\n\nThe majority of water discharged by Schneider Electric is sent to a third party for treatment without requiring additional prior treatment in Schneider's facility. Whenever water is used for industrial processes requiring additional internal treatment (e.g. surface treatments), resulting water discharges are subject to appropriate treatments to reduce pollutant potential and subject to a monitoring plan. All sites with such water usage have designated water quality and treatment experts to ensure all local regulations are followed regarding water discharge.\n\nFor example, at the Isle Espagnac plant (Poitou-Charentes, France), water is used as part of a chrome plating process and systematically treated before being discharged in sewers with adequate water quality as set by the local water discharge convention, which is monitored by an independent laboratory accredited by the local public administration. In addition, the site is investing EUR 1.7 million between 2022 and 2024 to transform its operations and discharge no water thanks to a closed water loop approach. This means that the site will no longer discharge water in sewers, with estimated savings of at least 2,000,000 liters per year and 330 tonnes of CO 2 per year as the site will ship less filtered waste to incineration/landfill.\n\n## Water stress\n\nSchneider Electric is also committed to minimizing its impact on water. The Group fully realizes the importance of water to local communities, especially those that are located in water-stressed areas. The Group therefore monitors the water stress level of all ISO 14001 sites using the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. Using the baseline water stress methodology, the Group considers sites classified as 'high' or 'extremely high' to be a water-stressed site, regardless of the amount of water withdrawn. 85 sites have been identified under this methodology, accounting for about 44% of total water withdrawals, including factories, distribution centers, and large offices, with water usages such as process-based, HVAC, sanitary/canteen, and irrigation. The Group has set the target that 100% of its sites in water-stressed areas have a water conservation strategy and related action plan by 2025 (SSE #11). In 2022, the Group achieved 48% of its 2025 target.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## -48%\n\nwater intensity in 2022 compared to 2017\n\nTarget:\n\n-35% by 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 100% of sites in water-stressed areas have a water conservation strategy and action plan\n\nThe E&A Vadodara plant in India has a plating operation which represents a significant amount of the site's water withdrawal. The site is located in a water-stressed area, so it is especially important to be efficient with water at the site. Hence, the site's effluent treatment plant (ETP) was designed to recycle & reuse wastewater. Three major actions were implemented to optimize the process:\n\n- 1. Segregation of input effluent to ETP (generating source).\n- 2. Improve the existing treatment process.\n- 3. Develop a new system to recycle and reuse of treated ETP water to make it suitable for the plating process.\n\nThe existing ETP treatment system was improved by converting two sand filters to one sand and one carbon filter and installing a new five-micron bag filter in the existing cartridge to improve treated water quality. A two-stage reverse osmosis system was also installed along with a special process to avoid chemical accumulation and biological growth on repeated water use in the closed loop.\n\nThese actions and improvements resulted in the following impacts:\n\n- \u00b7 80% recycling of treated wastewater to reuse in the plating process\n- \u00b7 60% reduction in the freshwater intake for the plating process\n\nThe site continues working to improve efficiency and has a target to achieve an 80% reduction of the freshwater intake in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEffluent treatment plant at Vadodara site in India\n\n2020 Baseline\n\n2025 target\n\n0%\n\n100%\n\n2022 Progress\n\n48%",

None of the Group's businesses involve extraction or land farming. In 2022, Schneider's manufacturing sites conducted their annual review of pollution risks as part of the ISO 14001 monitoring. No spills or discharges causing soil pollution occurred in 2022.\n\nHazardous materials are stored, handled, and used in compliance with regulations and with appropriate pollution protection mechanisms. As part of the 'Waste-to-Resource' program, additional focus is placed on hazardous waste, with efforts to eliminate, substitute, or improve treatment.\n\n## Discharge into the water and the air\n\nBecause Schneider is mainly an assembler, its discharge into the air and water is very limited. The Group's manufacturing sites are carefully monitored, as part of the ISO 14001 certification. Discharges are tracked locally as required by the current legislation. No spills or discharges causing water or air pollution occurred in 2022.\n\nEmissions of NOx (Nitrogen oxides), SOx (Sulphur oxides) and particles into the air are monitored at site level in accordance with applicable legal requirements, with monitoring of these emissions verified via ISO 14001 audits.\n\nSchneider is committed to preventing air pollution and adverse health impacts from Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, and for this reason, the Group works to reduce VOC emissions from industrial activities by 10% every three years. VOC emissions, which are primarily linked to production, decreased from 29 kg/ million EUR in 2017 to 9 kg/million EUR in 2022 (-69%). The Group engages with each of its industrial sites that contribute the most to VOC emissions, and which together account for over 90% of the Group's VOC emissions. For these sites, environment, health and safety, and industrialization teams, come together and actively collaborate to ensure conditions of use are strictly adhered to, and health and environmental risks are known and mitigated. Those top VOC-emitting sites also investigate opportunities to reduce and phase-out concerned chemicals from industrial processes wherever possible.\n\nFinally, chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and Hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) emissions are monitored locally, in accordance with applicable regulations. These emissions are mainly due to the operation of air conditioning systems and are not directly linked to Schneider's industrial activities.\n\n## Noise, odors, and light\n\nAll Schneider's sites comply with local regulations on noise and odor. Given the nature of its activities and distribution model, the Group does not have any significant external light pollution.\n\n## 2.4.4.5  Biodiversity actions at sites\n\nWith the objective of gaining an overview on biodiversity priority sites, informing risk management, and addressing potential biodiversity impacts, the Group ran a multi-site report with the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT). Developed through a partnership with Bird Life International, Conservation International, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and United Nations Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), IBAT collects and enhances the underlying datasets and maintains that scientific information.\n\nThe IBAT report enables users to assess the biodiversity-related features of multiple operational sites for risk management and strategy setting. In particular, the report is relevant for Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard GRI 304: Biodiversity.\n\nFor each operational site, the report provides the counts of protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) within a 1-kilometer radius.\n\nThe results of the 'IBAT multi-site Report, 2021' include all Schneider sites and show that, within a 1-kilometer radius:\n\n- \u00b7 21% of its sites are in proximity of a protected area as defined by the IUCN, of which:\n- - 8% are in category 1a, 1b and 2 (just 6 sites are in proximity of a category-1-protected area);\n- - 29% are in category 3 or 4;\n- - 31% are in category 5 or 6;\n- - 32% are not applicable, not assigned or not reported.\n\nAmong the sites in proximity of a protected area, 33% are either industrial sites (characterized by discrete industrial processes such as assembly lines) or distribution centers (warehouses and logistics); the remaining 66% are office buildings.\n\n- \u00b7 3% of the Group's sites are in proximity of a key biodiversity area (defined by IBAT as either 'Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE)' or 'Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs)).\n\nAll the results are made available to sites, so that they can better understand the local threat to biodiversity and restoration potential. Sites use these results at their discretion to drive the local bodiversity actions previously described.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind IBAT Multi-site Report generated under license 26614-25299 from the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool on 15 December 2021 on www.ibat-alliance.org\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Site activities such as energy consumption, water withdrawal, building infrastructure, food, landscaping, waste generation, light, sound and other forms of pollution, exert a pressure on biodiversity that can be reduced. For example, manicured, non-native landscaping could potentially increase water withdrawal and promote invasive species that don't support native wildlife.\n\nThe objective is to achieve 100% of sites with a local biodiversity conservation and restoration program by 2025 (SSE #8). To meet this target, Schneider sites have to define and deploy a biodiversity program consisting in the elimination of single-use plastics (relating to office use) and at least one local action with significant ecological impact, structured governance and stakeholder involvement.\n\nThe scope of the single-use plastics ban for the biodiversity program is 'consumer' plastics (e.g. cups, cutlery, gifts/souvenirs, etc.). 'Industrial' plastics (e.g. primary/secondary packaging, products) are covered in Schneider Electric's SSI #4 and SSI #5 programs.\n\nThe program was launched in 2021 and many sites have already started on their journey, understanding the complexities of biodiversity, assessing their impact and identifying the right local stakeholders to engage in a preservation or restoration program. The program requires a complete elimination of single-use plastics, and the adoption of impactful biodiversity actions. As projected, there has been a slow ramp-up in terms of global performance. Nevertheless, the new governance structure adopting in 2022, allowed to accelerate the deployment of the program. The current governance is based on nominated country biodiversity leaders who lead and animate a group of sites biodiversity leaders that follow the daily operation of the biodiversity actions.

To achieve such ambition, the Group develops services and business models to extend the useful life of its products, and when no option is possible, take back the product, assess whether a second-life is possible, and ultimately ensure the product or components are recycled.\n\nThis section presents the Group's actions to keep products in use and increase their recyclability at the end-of-life, through:\n\n- \u00b7 services for maintenance and repair;\n- \u00b7 business models to take products back and give them a second life;\n- \u00b7 the maximization of the products' recyclability at the end-of-life.\n\n## 2.4.5.1 Services for maintenance, repairability and circularity - EcoCare & ECOFIT TM\n\nSchneider Electric Services experts and partners are dedicated to extend the lifespan of assets and systems while making customers' operations safe, efficient, and resilient every day.\n\nWith EcoStruxure's digital capabilities, innovation, and expertise across multiple technologies, the Group advises, modernizes, monitors, and maintains the health of its customers' energy and automation assets and systems around the clock and the globe.\n\nThroughout the lifecycle of the installed base, Schneider Electric Services' expertise answers customers' needs by:\n\n- \u00b7 providing EcoCare recurring services to monitor and maintain the installed base during its use;\n- \u00b7 providing access to spare parts and repair services;\n- \u00b7 advising and triggering optimization recommendations to increase safety, reliability, and efficiency;\n- \u00b7 digitizing and modernizing the assets to increase life and prolong reliable operations;\n- \u00b7 supporting the handling of end-of-life through recovery services (for example, for batteries, SF 6 , and modernized equipment)\n\nThese historical activities are critical to address the 'maintain and prolong' loop of circularity, no matter the customer typology or sector of activity.\n\n## Retrofit of equipments with ECOFIT \u2122\n\nSchneider quantifies its circular economy efforts (repair, reuse, refurbish, and recycle) and targets to avoid 420,000 metric tons of primary resource consumption through 'take-back at end-of-use' by 2025, cumulatively since 2017 (SSE #10). This program enables savings in waste, material, energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, and/or water.\n\nActivities in this program will be extended in line with the Group's increasing focus on circularity business models, and currently include:\n\n- \u00b7 Take-back and recycling of batteries;\n- \u00b7 Volume of devices refurbished and repaired in our repair centers (such as UPS or drives);\n- \u00b7 Volume of medium voltage, low voltage and transformers refurbished or recycled in our ECOFIT \u2122 Centers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nModernizing and upgrading low voltage and medium voltage switchgear equipment does not necessarily mean demolishing the existing infrastructure.

The equipments that cannot be retrofitted can be taken-back to be reused, rebuilt and sold as second-hand products.\n\nThis approach makes ECOFIT TM service an end-to-end value proposition to customers, avoiding up to 90% waste.\n\n## 2.4.5.2  Circular business models\n\nSchneider Electric creates shared value for its customers through circular capabilities such as local models of reuse, retrofit, repair, refurbish, and take-back, and by unleashing the potential of IoT, connecting and digitizing products (predictive maintenance, performance optimization, leasing, pay-per-use, performance contracting).\n\nMost of Schneider's new products are digital, connectable, ensure full product lifecycle management and predictive maintenance, and guarantee optimum performance, hence enabling the Group to move towards customer-intimate models like subscription, performance contracting, and leasing.\n\nThe first focus, before considering end-of-life, is to prolong the lifespan of products. These solutions, using up to 60% less materials than using brand new equipment, enable pull-through and constant payback, increase customer stickiness, and build long-term relationships.\n\nThere are opportunities to leverage the circular economies, both externally with customers and internally in operations. Schneider's value propositions have long delivered resource efficiency, enabling customers to 'do more with less'.\n\nThe risks that Schneider Electric has identified are around the perception of 'one size fits all' for circularity, as well as the temptation to see it through a waste or recycling lens, and the focus on developing the related guidelines, governance, and standards based on this perception.\n\n- \u00b7 Product durability versus shorter-term waste loops : All resources are not equal in their thermal, mechanical, or electromagnetic profiles. For the industrial sector, the biggest impact of the circular economy will come from the promotion of repairability, upgradability, 'retrofitability', extension of lifespan, and of related 'product second- and third-life services'. Schneider's products are highly technical in nature with a long lifespan and are highly unlikely to end up as ocean plastic waste. Yet a risk that the emerging regulations may be too 'resource/waste-centric' can be identified. To meet quality and safety expectations, and adhere to stringent electric and electronic equipment standards, recycled materials are sometimes not available in either quantity and/or quality. The Group actively advocates sector-specific approaches.\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring the safety of people and assets through qualified and certified services. In fact, while promoting services to extend the products' lifespan, Schneider grows the ranks of certified experts on its products (through thousands of Field Services Representatives). Leveraging the circular economy, there is a fantastic opportunity to enable more repair, retrofit, and recycling services, on condition that concerned product categories are adequately maintained and serviced by qualified and certified experts.\n\n## Second life distribution center\n\nSince 2019, Schneider has developed additional capabilities to address more circularity loops, to ensure a maximized second life for its products.\n\nThese capabilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 repack: repackaging of Schneider products when packaging has been damaged.\n- \u00b7 give a second chance: sorting, selecting, redistributing never-energized Schneider products which cannot be sold anymore.\n- \u00b7 refurbish and remanufacture: developing refurbishment and remanufacturing capabilities for relevant products to deliver on manufacturer-level circularity and provide state of the art second life solutions across selected markets.\n- \u00b7 recycle: dismantling of products to recover and resell the valuable materials.\n\nIn 2022, Schneider significantly increased its offer of circular products to serve the growing demand for circular products, doubling the number of references available up to 6,400. In 2023, the Group expects to add more than 3,000 new references to its offer.\n\nTo achieve that, new refurbishment capabilities have been developed on the industrial sites, increased take-back from various sources. Spare parts production has also been expanded to enable the repair of new references.\n\nIn 2023, Schneider Electric will continue to grow circular industrial capabilities to support business innovation and differentiating offers to customers:\n\n- \u00b7 more repack and reuse;\n- \u00b7 more refurbish;\n- \u00b7 easier access to take-back and second life solutions.",

In 2022, 71.5 tonnes of CO 2 emissions were avoided thanks to the remanufactured MasterPacT MTZ sales.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.5.3  Managing the end-of-life of products\n\n## End-of-life regulations\n\nSchneider Electric has deployed a process that ensures a safe treatment and recycling of its products at the end of their lifecycle.\n\nIn compliance with the Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, Schneider implements product identification and selection actions, establishing recycling streams, and pricing the taxes to be applied following the regulations of each country where the Group's products are sold.\n\nFor products falling within the scope of the WEEE directive, a circularity profile including detailed end-of-life instructions is systematically provided through the 'Check A Product' public website.\n\n## Enhance recycling\n\nSchneider's unique approach for the modernization of aging equipment, minimizing waste and maximizing safety, efficiency, and resiliency, avoids up to 90% of waste by upgrading customers' equipment with the latest technologies using sensors and connectivity to optimize uptime and extend the assets' lifespan replacing the core components. This approach also enables the take-back of products, to reuse, rebuild, resell and recycle them when no other option is possible.\n\n## Case study: Azalys, Suez H\u00e9lys\u00e9o Carri\u00e8res-sous-Poissy, France\n\nAzalys Suez site in Carrieres-sous-Poissy (France) is a household waste to energy facility, managing 125,000 metrics tons of waste and producing 50 gigawatts/hour of electricy each year.\n\nThe goals of the project were to add capacity to the electrical installation replace outdated equipment without a lengthy interruption to service, and to enable predictive maintenance. This involved installing state-of-the-art RM6 and SM6 switchgears in place of FluoKit units, which were later recycled. In addition, starting in 2022, recovered Fluokit equipment by Schneider are reused as part of the circularity offers: providing prolonged service life and spare parts to customers.\n\nDeveloping a win-win solution through circularity models is good for the Group's customers and the environment, and is the avenue Schneider Electric continues to innovate and accelerate in this area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

At the same time, digital transformation and changing social needs demand greater inclusion.\n\nThe post-pandemic world followed by ever growing supply chain constraints due to geopolitical issues are creating more opportunities for Schneider Electric to be the most local of global companies.\n\nBeing agile by demonstrating resilience and adaptability is the most important prerequisite for success in today's unprecedented environment of uncertainty. It requires the leverage of both human capabilities and digital technologies. Schneider Electric's People Vision and People Strategy help achieve this.\n\n## 2.5.1.2  Schneider Electric's People Vision - Employee Value Proposition, Core Values, and Leadership Expectations\n\n## People Vision\n\nSchneider Electric's People Vision provides the impetus to change the way we work and accelerate the cultural transformation at the company. Comprising Employee Value Proposition (EVP), Core Values and Leadership Expectations, the People Vision is a strong anchor to the People Strategy.\n\n## Our Employee Value Proposition\n\n## MEANINGFUL\n\nOur mission is to be your digital partner for Sustainability and Efficiency.\n\nWe empower all to make the most of their energy and resources , ensuring Life Is On everywhere, for everyone, at every moment.\n\nWe adhere to the highest standards of governance and ethics .\n\n## INCLUSIVE\n\nThe People Vision consists of the following:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nOur Employee Value Proposition is our commitment to engage existing and future talent. It's the reason why people join, stay, and remain engaged and shows how we differentiate ourselves as an employer.\n\nOur Core Values determine who we are, what we do, and define the way we work together and deliver on our EVP promises. Our values guide our choices and illustrate the behaviors we expect our employees to demonstrate.\n\nOur Leadership Expectations show how we expect leaders to drive the Company for the future. They emphasize how our leaders will transform Schneider Electric by stepping up individually and collectively.\n\n## Employee Value Proposition\n\nThe Group is also looking to establish a strong name as an employer and communicate around its Employee Value Proposition, which is our promise to current and future employees.\n\nWe believe that great people make Schneider Electric a great company. We are driven by our meaningful purpose and continuously create an inclusive environment where employees are empowered to be at their best and innovate.\n\nOur Employee Value Proposition continues to evolve in line with the business. Making the emotional connection as to 'Why Schneider Electric?' is fundamental to the ability to not only attract the best talent and be an 'employer of choice', but also to have it resonate as authentic with employees as a form of encouragement, motivation and inspiration\n\n## EMPOWERED\n\nWe want to be the most diverse, inclusive and equitable company, globally.\n\nWe value differences , and welcome people from all walks of life.\n\nWe believe in equal opportunities for everyone, everywhere.\n\n## Freedom breeds innovation.\n\nWe believe that empowerment generates high performance, personal fulfillment and fun.\n\nWe empower our people to use their judgement , do the best for our customers , and make the most of their energy .",

So, not only do we put ourselves in their shoes, but we also anticipate their needs and go the extra mile. We champion our sales people, because they are the face of our Company. Whatever our role, we can have an impact on the customer's experience.\n\nDare to Disrupt. Innovation is our middle name. Good is never good enough, and that's why we are constantly experimenting, taking risks, and disrupting the status quo. We think fast, and we act even faster. Setbacks don't hurt us. They motivate us. That's why we are not afraid to make our bets bigger and our decisions bolder to power the digital economy through energy management and automation. We, at Schneider, ensure Life Is On.\n\nEmbrace Different. We are 100% committed to inclusion. 'Exclusion' is not even in our vocabulary. We believe in equal opportunities for everyone, everywhere. This means welcoming people from all walks of life, ages, and cultures, embracing different perspectives and calling out bias when we see it, so that every person feels uniquely valued and safe to be at their best. To us, a stranger is simply a friend we haven't met yet.\n\nLearn Every Day. To stop learning is to stop growing. We are genuinely curious, never done with learning. To us, there is no such thing as knowing it all or having all the answers. We believe in life-long learning. Every minute of every day brings a new chance to listen, open up our minds, and widen our horizons. We are never too experienced to learn.\n\nAct Like Owners. Entrepreneurs at heart, we take responsibility and ownership of everything we do. This is not somebody else's company. It's ours! We are individually empowered and collectively driven to collaborate and beat the competition together. In the end, we do what is right for Schneider first - always with integrity and honesty.\n\n## Our Leadership Expectations\n\nShape our future. In a world that is in constant flux, we cannot sit around and wait for the future. We have to imagine, disrupt and lead our industry. Be an entrepreneur of digital transformation with customers. Think big and be bold, create disruptive strategies and architecture ahead of the curve and execute with agility, quality, and speed. Take initiative and learn from success and failure. After all, the only thing certain in the next normal is change.\n\nFree up Energy. Free up your and your team's energy to focus on customers, transformation and what really matters in life and work. Keep things simple, but never at the expense of ethics or safety. Remove roadblocks and unnecessary bureaucracy. Champion new ways of working - more digital, flexible, and efficient. Empower teams throughout multi-local, multi-hub model and agile methods. Speed is our ultimate differentiator.\n\nBuild the Best Team. Step up to lead in a digital world while building strong human connection with customers and colleagues. Give and ask for coaching and feedback every day. Care for your health and well-being and that of others. Be inclusive and build psychological safety. Hire great and diverse talent and develop them to their fullest potential. Drive team engagement and high performance. The sign of a great leader is a great team.\n\nAchieve together. It all starts with making a human connection and working together with customers, partners and colleagues. Connect across our teams with an 'easy to do business with' spirit. Share information freely, don't hide it. Engage in constructive dialogue, don't avoid tough conversations. Collaborate with focus and in attitude; be inclusive but efficient on who to involve. Collaboration is the seed for innovation and winning.\n\nUse your judgement . Ultimately, we are accountable and empowered to make the right decisions for the company. Trust your own judgment and common sense and empower teams to do the same. Don't overcomplicate decision-making. Give clear direction in the face of ambiguity. Be agile and curious and use your best intuition and logic. Let 'doing the right thing, in the right way' be your compass.\n\n## Core Values\n\n## EMBRACE DIFFERENT\n\nDifferent is Beautiful.\n\n## DARE TO DISRUPT\n\nConstantly in Beta\n\nLEARN EVERY DAY\n\n#Whatdidyoulearntoday?\n\n## Our Leadership Expectations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccelerate and Simplify\n\nBUILD THE BEST TEAM\n\nCoach and Care\n\nACHIEVE TOGETHER\n\nCollaborate to Win\n\n## CUSTOMER FIRST\n\nAbove and beyond for our Customers.\n\nSHAPE OUR FUTURE\n\nDisrupt ahead of the curve\n\nACT LIKE OWNERS\n\nAll in.

The Group acts with agility and trust to innovate for its customers and strives to win in the market.\n\nLaunched in 2021, Schneider's People Strategy provides the Group with the framework to support business growth and culture transformation. To achieve the mission of its People Strategy and shape the workforce of the future in the 'next normal', the framework includes three outcome-based themes:\n\nOrganizational agility - a growth and innovation culture, enabled by a leaner, agile and multi-hub structure, customer proximity, and fast decision making, supported by new ways of working.\n\nFuture ready talent - a diverse, empowered, and digitally skilled team. All talents develop current and future skills through a personalized experience to realize their potential.\n\nLeadership Impact - leaders deliver impact on results and transformation through disruption, collaboration and inclusion. They build great teams, coach and care to achieve together.\n\n## 2.5.1.4  Organization and Governance\n\nAt Schneider Electric the 3-pillar model has been followed within the HR function by adapting the various responsibilities in accordance with organizational context.\n\nHR Business Partners focus on defining and implementing strategic people transformations (key talents, competencies, workforce planning, training for their community, footprint) in their respective entities. They provide strategic support and deliver day to day local support towards operational activities for managers and employees.\n\nHR Solutions shape the future in line with the people vision, focus on a limited number of global priorities, define strategic transformation and priorities, develop global governance, policy & processes, and drive digital.\n\nHR Services manage HR operations, standardize programs and systems, simplify processes, and drive digital transformation to free up energy.\n\nSince 2020, Schneider Electric reinforced the governance of the Group, the professionalism of its processes, and its foundations for trust. In line with our Corporate Governance directions, the Group follows HR Governance led by a single point of contact with corporate organizations such as M&A, Internal Audit, Internal Control, Ethics & Compliance, and Data Privacy, which facilitates an agile response to corporate directions.\n\nParticipation\n\n85%\n\n107,916 responses.\n\nEngagement 70%\n\n-1 point since 2021 +1 point since 2020\n\n## 2.5.1.5 Employee Engagement\n\nEngaged employees are key to enable the company to be at its best and support the achievement of the Group strategy. By measuring engagement and responding to feedback, Schneider Electric can foster an environment in which people feel connected to their work and strive to perform.\n\n## Key updates in 2022\n\n- \u00b7 High survey response rate of 85%, with a relatively stable engagement score, against the backdrop of an increasingly uncertain world.\n- \u00b7 Employees feel empowered in their work, with flexibility to enable how they work, while remaining connected to Schneider Electric's purpose in an inclusive environment.\n- \u00b7 Emergence of two critical areas related to the employee experience and engagement: recognition and effectiveness.\n\n## 1.  OneVoice Survey\n\nAs an inclusive company, all employees are asked to provide their honest feedback through the annual OneVoice survey, which evaluates their engagement and measures nine drivers of engagement, including leadership, development, and empowerment. This process helps the Group identify key avenues for improving employees' engagement and their unique life at work.\n\nAttributable to a continued high participation rate, the results of the survey are robust and representative, empowering leaders to focus on the right topics to drive change in their teams. The ability to maintain an engagement score above pre-pandemic levels illustrates the positive impact of providing stability and a vision for the future in the face of an increasingly uncertain global landscape. Schneider's ambition is to achieve 75% engagement score by the end of 2025 (SSE #24).\n\nThe Top 4 Drivers of Engagement from the 2022 results demonstrate that employees feel empowered in their work, benefitting from flexible work arrangements, while drawing inspiration from Schneider Electric's purpose and goals in an inclusive environment.\n\nAction plans\n\nManagers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrecorded since July 2022\n\n41%\n\nof managers have access to a customized report.",

Turning insight into action\n\nSupported by a global network of engagement partners, leaders communicate results to their teams, followed by formulating impactful action plans.\n\nA holistic approach is taken to guide leaders on next steps following survey closure:\n\n- \u00b7 Communicating the high priority of the topic among leaders\n- \u00b7 Ensuring full understanding of the why, what and how of engagement\n- \u00b7 Manager resources to facilitate action planning with their teams\n- \u00b7 Embracing transparency through open dialogue with teams on what could or could not be acted upon\n- \u00b7 Committing to continuous communication of the action plan progress\n\nOne example of local teams turning insight into action is France's 'Next Normal' program, which is delivering on 10 initiatives for an improved employee experience. With an updated work from home and office policy, supported by remote work training, a system of management for hybrid teams, and an emergency protocol, leaders have responded to employees' feedback. The program also includes training and hosted discussion forums for managers, bringing the program to life across all teams, driving strong leadership with employee empowerment and recognition at the top.\n\nNew in 2022, a nudge communication template was developed to bolster communication of actions taken in response to employee feedback.\n\n## 3. Focus on recognition and effectiveness to sustain the employee experience\n\nWith a Recognition score of 63% across 2021 and 2022, Schneider Electric launched the refreshed recognition platform, Step Up, introducing enhancements to how employees can be appreciated for their work. Read more about this initiative in section 2.5.4 'Compensation and Benefits', page 218.\n\nA second engagement driver of attention relates to Effectiveness , ensuring teams have the tools and resources to support their work, while simplifying processes where possible. In response, the Schneider Digital team has prioritized simplifying the digital landscape, including several initiatives aimed at creating a 'Lovable Employee Experience'. Focused on offering a best-in-class digital workplace, the aim is to engage employees with a personalized digital environment that enhances employee efficiency, supports new dynamic ways of working, and improves their sense of purpose and well-being, while boosting their overall experience at Schneider Electric.\n\n## 81%\n\nfeel they have flexibility to modify their work arrangements when needed.\n\n## 80%\n\nfeel empowered to choose how best to complete their work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 62%\n\nfind the collaboration is good between entities.\n\n## 68%\n\nsay they have the necessary tools and resources to process their jobs.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 2.5  Great people make Schneider Electric a great company\n\n## 2.5.2  Diversity, equity, inclusion, and well-being\n\n## 2.5.2.1 Context\n\nAt the turn of the decade, Schneider Electric observed a clear shift regarding the risks and expectations surrounding Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI). With continuous global social unrest and a global pandemic that exacerbated inequalities and impacted underrepresented groups the hardest, inclusion and care is needed now more than ever. This paired, with the rising importance of Envrionmental, Social, Governance topics (ESG) for organizations, stakeholders and investors puts DEI at the forefront of Schneider Electric's business, and people priorities.\n\nData shows that companies with a diverse set of employees experience greater financial performance. For example, one study from McKinsey 1 found that over a three-year period companies with ethnically-diverse and gender-diverse workforces experienced an increase in cash flow. These companies were 36% and 25% more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians than those with less diverse workforces. The bottom line is that more diverse companies can attract and retain top talent, improve overall employee and customer satisfaction, and achieve greater innovation.\n\nTaking all of this into context, Schneider Electric is keenly aware of the ever-increasing need to focus on mental health. The pandemic has accentuated existing vulnerabilities. According to Mercer 2 , 81% of employees felt at risk of burnout in 2021, compared to 63% in 2019. Companies must make mental health a priority and integrate it into their overall inclusion and care efforts.\n\n## 2.5.2.2  Risks and opportunities\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion is a business imperative. Without a clear focus on these priorities, companies open themselves up to risks. For example, fair and equitable talent practices are imperative to providing equitable access to job opportunities, career development and advancement. When companies do not have a focus on these areas, they risk making biased and discriminatory talent decisions. In addition, companies without clear policies and practices that embrace an inclusive culture are not as attractive to talent, leading to challenges in recruitment and retention. All of these risks, entail costs for companies and loss in efficiency. It can also lead to legal ramifications and a negative impact on the company's image.\n\nSchneider Electric defines its strategy taking into consideration those risks and opportunities, internal and external trends, insights and feedback from leaders and employees, and it's desire to become the most inclusive and caring company in the world. Schneider Electric believes this leads to greater engagement, performance, and innovation.\n\n## 2.5.2.3 Group Policy\n\nIn its Trust Charter, Schneider Electric clearly expresses that its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ambition aims to offer equal opportunities to everyone, everywhere. The Group wants its employees - no matter who they are, or where they live in the world - to feel uniquely valued and safe to contribute their best, free from harassment, victimization and discrimination of any kind.\n\nThe Group's DEI policy recognizes that diversity comes in many forms; visible and non-visible, including cognition, experience, education, gender and gender identity, age, nationality, race and ethnicity, color, sexual orientation, disability status, religious, cultural and socio-economic background, life experience, location, and more, depending on local adaptations.\n\nRead more about our DEI policy on the Diversity and Inclusion page on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince 2016, the company enriched its strategy beyond a gender focus to better address inclusion and psychological safety for all diversities. This included developing and implementing global polices that empowered our employees to manage their unique life and work as well as ensured our employees felt valued and safe (Global Family Policy Leave, Flexibility at Work, Hidden Bias Education and Global Anti-Harassment Policy). In addition, partnerships were expanded with organizations to address important topics related to other diversities, such as LGBT+ community and people with disabilities.\n\nLooking ahead with the UN SDGs as a compass, Schneider's strategy has been extended to embrace diversity, equity and inclusion and well-being. The group brings its ambition to life by empowering all employees to develop inclusive practices and behaviors, ensure fairness and equity in core people processes and policies, and, advocate internally and externally for change with partners, like UN Women through the Generation Equality Forum, and the World Economic Forum. Schneider is committed to becoming among the most inclusive and caring companies in the world.\n\n## 2.5.2.4 Governance\n\nThe implementation of Schneider Electric's DEI strategy involves several different bodies and stakeholders, working hand in hand with the global DEI team.\n\nThe Global DEI team, led by the Chief Diversity Officer, SVP of Talent and Diversity, defines the strategy and is accountable to deliver on Schneider Electric's DEI transformation, working with the Group's Executive Committee and the Group Global DEI Board. Progress and results of the DEI ambition are also reported to the Board of Schneider Electric (HR & CSR Committee) on an annual basis. The team works in close collaboration with the HR Center of Excellence (Talent Acquisition, Talent Management, Learning and Rewards), Sustainability, Compliance, Internal communications, and Marketing and Employer Branding teams, as well as with the broader HR and Communication ecosystem.\n\nSchneider Electric's Global DEI Board is a group of top leaders from all the Group's markets, sponsored by the Executive Committee, which acts as a sounding board for the Global DEI and Well-being strategy, and as internal and external DEI champions. Board members are nominated by the Executive Committee to serve a two to three-year term. Schneider Electric entities develop local DEI and Well-being action plans based on the global strategy and employee feedback, while meeting local regulations and addressing country-specific situations. To support the local focus, leaders, ambassadors, and champions have been appointed in more than 100 countries/zones and entities to develop and lead local action plans. This global network convenes bi-monthly to share progress and best practices.",

In 2018, the Group formalized its zero-tolerance stance on harassment by launching a Global Anti-Harassment Policy. The policy explicitly prohibits any kind of harassment (sexual or non-sexual) in the workplace, and states that 'no Schneider Electric employee shall be subjected to harassment, victimization or retaliation based on - including but not limited to - race, sex, national origin, religion, political opinion, age, medical status, disability, gender, marital status, pregnancy, sexual orientation or gender identity'.\n\nThe policy sets clear and consistent expectations of workplace conduct, outlines the roles and responsibilities of employees, managers, and witnesses in creating a workplace free of harassment of any kind, and highlights the different reporting channels available to report concerns, while maintaining confidentiality and protection against retaliation.\n\nLastly, the policy lays out the type of corrective or disciplinary actions that can be taken in case of discriminatory behavior or harassment, or failure to report such incidents. A revised and expanded policy will be launched for all employees globally in 2023.\n\nRead more about our anti-harassment policy on the Ethics and Compliance page on www.se.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Inclusion and Care By Design\n\n## Ho w w e get t here\n\n## In all processes\n\n- \u00b7 We hardwire inclusion and care in all our processes.\n- \u00b7 End-to end, with clear accountability.\n- \u00b7 From employee to customer interaction and business process.\n\n## In our behaviours\n\n- \u00b7 We lead with Respect and extend Trust.\n- \u00b7 Living our EVP, Core Values and Leadership Expectations.\n- \u00b7 Demonstrating empathy, care and openness.\n\nFor more information on core values,\n\nplease see page 220 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Creating a standard of inclusion and care for all\n\nThe Group's Core Values, Leadership Expectations, and Trust Charter ensure all employees, managers and leaders are trained and held accountable to a standard of inclusion and care for all.

In 2022, these campaigns generated more than 30 million impressions through external social networks.\n\n## Inclusion and respect building programs:\n\n- \u00b7 'Overcoming Hidden bias' eLearning: Understand what hidden bias means, explore clear steps to keep decisionmaking objective, and how to call out bias when seen. In 2022, 82% of employees had completed this training.\n- \u00b7 'Building a Culture of Respect' eLearning: Explore the importance of building a culture of respect, learn to recognize the different forms of harassment, and understand the actions to take (as employees and managers) when witnessing such conduct. In 2022, more than 93% of employees had completed this training.\n- \u00b7 Employee Resource Networks (ERNs): Employee volunteer led networks, globally and locally, made up of individuals with similar backgrounds, experiences, characteristics and/or who share a passion or interest, play a key role in building an inclusive and equitable culture. ERNs within the Group include, Women professionals, Emerging professionals, Black, Hispanic and Asian professionals, LGBT+, and People with Disabilities and Allies networks.\n\n## Fair and equitable talent processes\n\nSchneider Electric is committed to transparent and equitable access to career opportunities, growth and development to the fullest potential, and equal pay for equal work for all its employees worldwide.\n\nTalent decisions are based on skills, values, performance, and potential, and the Group counts on each leader to be fair and equitable when making a hiring or promotion decision to help advance its overall goal to create a skilled and diverse workforce for the future. To check and mitigate hidden bias in its main human resource programs, the Group has built in reminders and prompts for moments that matter, including performance and salary review processes.\n\nFair and equitable pay is a core component of the Group's compensation philosophy, in line with the principle of equal pay for equal work. More details on SE's compensation and benefits are provided in 216 of this report.\n\n## Supporting employees' well-being, mental health and unique lives and work\n\nBuilt on a foundation of trust and respect, Schneider Electric seeks to support the unique needs of a diverse workforce with flexible ways of working, global inclusive benefit standards, and programs that care for its employees' well-being. It is the Group's belief that this makes them stronger and more resilient in today's world. The Group has implemented several policies to support employees and respect their unique lives and ways of working.\n\nThe Group's global benefits standard is reviewed annually by the rewards and benefits teams for compliance with its global benefit policies and principles. This review ensures that the Group's inclusive global benefit standards are delivered for everyone, everywhere. More details on SE's compensation and benefits are provided in p.218 of this report.\n\nTo ensure they are creating a supportive and healthy working environment where every individual thrives, the Group has a holistic view of well-being (physical, mental, emotional, and social) as key components of the current strategy, tackling three areas of impact:\n\n- 1. The ways of working and flexible work arrangements,\n- 2. Overall employee well-being,\n- 3. Mental health support.\n\nSchneider Electric has implemented many services at its sites throughout the world (gym facilities, concierge, creativity rooms, cultural events, mindfulness activities, back-up dependent care, and more) to support all employee's mental load, energy recovery and overall resilience.\n\nAs of 2020, 90% of employees worldwide have access to a comprehensive workplace wellness program, including medical coverage and dedicated programs to educate and support employees on new, smarter ways of working, mindfulness in the workplace and working in a hybrid world.\n\n## Flexibility at Work\n\nSchneider Electric's Global Flexibility@Work Policy creates a global standard to work from home (WFH) two days a week for all eligible employees, and one day for employees working in distribution centers and plants (1) . This global standard was introduced in response to feedback in the Group's 2020 global employee survey in which a large proportion of employees stated that they preferred a hybrid work model (mix of WFH and 'work from office'). The policy addresses hybrid work holistically, providing employees with mental health resources and training on best practices. The policy reflects the broader shifts of a global, digital, and ever-changing environment, and contributes to a more agile, inclusive, empowered, and trusting Group culture. At the end of 2022, 99% of the countries have implemented the new Flexibility@Work policy.\n\nAs part of this new Flexibility@Work Policy, countries can explore additional measures such as flexible working hours, flexible holidays, part-time work, and volunteering. Some examples of Schneider Electric countries raising the global standards with no fixed limit on the number of WFH days are Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Slovakia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, operating with a fully flexible, output driven philosophy.\n\n## Global Family Leave\n\nSchneider Electric's Global Family Leave Policy supports all employees globally with personal time at critical life stages and empowers them to manage their unique life and work so that they can be at their best. To find out more about our Global Family Leave Policy please refer to section 2.5.4 'Compensation and Benefit' on page 218.\n\n- (1)  Eligibility is based on employee's role and requirements for on-site work and is determined by country/territory with additional input from managers. Some essential roles, e.g., Plant & Distribution Center blue-collar workers, Field services engineers due to role specifications are excluded from this 2-day work-from-home policy. Recognizing that many critical roles need to be on site, this policy was adjusted to 1 day for the eligible Plant & Distribution Center specific roles.",

        "page_content": "## Mental Health Support\n\nSchneider Electric integrated mental health into its global wellbeing focus in 2019, and has provided all employees with a playbook, and series of trainings (available in multiple languages) on how to deal with mental health challenges. In addition, the Group actively participates in World Mental Health Day, and a volunteer-based global mindfulness team holds annual events to support employees and annually in October.\n\nIn 2022, 98% of employees completed 'We All have Mental Health,' an eLearning module focused on what mental health means, and how to recognize the signs of mental health challenges and take action. Nearly 1,500 employees shared mental health tips and personal commitments on Schneider Electric's internal social media platform reaching many through the #MentalHealthMatters. During the annual mental health campaign, beyond local actions organized by country, more than 3,000 employees attended live global webinars on dealing with emotions, managing the mental health of teams, and financial well-being. In addition, 18 mindfulness practice sessions were organized, in English, Spanish, French, and Italian to promote this practice.\n\n## 2.5.2.7 Diverse teams at Every level\n\nSchneider Electric desires to be among the most inclusive and caring workplaces. This includes visible and non-visible dimensions of diversity, including cognition, experience, education, gender and gender identity, age, nationality, race and ethnicity, color, sexual orientation, disability status, religious, cultural and socio-economic background, life experience, location, and more, depending on local requirements. To achieve this ambition, the Group recognizes that it must continue to build an understanding of the demographic makeup and experiences of inclusion by its employees. As a global organization, the Group collects limited demographic information on its global workforce (gender, generation, and nationality) aligned with globally accepted definitions and legalities. In addition, the Group's local operations collect additional demographic information based on local regulations (Race/Ethnicity in the US; Disability status in the US, France and India, etc).\n\n## 2025 Gender Diversity Commitment\n\nSchneider Electric began its journey to becoming a genderbalanced organization more than 15 years ago and has identified increasing the share of women in its workforce and leadership as a business imperative. To support this aim, the Group has stated ambitions on increasing female representation in the overall workforce, and seeks to engage all genders in the journey.\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric renewed its commitment to gender balance with the 2021 - 2025 SSI gender balance ambition, SSI #8, 50/40/30 - with women representing 50% of all new hires, 40% of frontline managers, and 30% of senior leadership by 2025. This commitment is a testament to the progress the Group has made, and a clear signal that it intends to double-down on its efforts to achieve more gender balance across all levels of the organization.\n\nAt the leadership level, Schneider focuses on 30% representation because research has shown that 30% is the tipping point for diversity to have a real impact on teams. To support this ambition, the Group invests in development programs for female talent to grow within the organization, and access senior levels, while also recruiting great talent from the external market.\n\nWhile significant progress has been made in the representation of women, especially on the Board and Executive Committee level (respectively, 41% and 45% female as of end of 2022), the Group recognizes that there is more work to do at all levels in the organization.\n\nOne of the programs the Group created to support this is Schneider Women Leaders' Program (SWLP), a global program focused on enabling mid-career women to build the skills and confidence to step up their leadership capability and impact. SWLP is delivered through coaching, group and individual learning, and a global summit. Since its launch in 2019, more than 320 women have benefited from this targeted leadership development program and thousands more through programs delivered at the local level.\n\nEmployee Resource Networks (ERNs) also play a significant role in empowering women locally and helping drive efforts to advance women in leadership. As of the end of 2022, local ERNs have contributed to the Group's efforts towards gender equality and inclusion in more than 40 countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncrease gender diversity in hiring (50%), front-line management (40%) and leadership teams (30%)\n\nThe group is advancing gender equity through innovative programs designed for experienced professionals who have spent two or more years out of the traditional workforce. Through a structured program, the 'returnees' receive nurture-based coaching, hands-on work experience, and a built-in support system to aid their return to work. The program focuses on soft skill development and technical upskilling, with a specific focus on the Schneider Electric business. At the end of the program, they become eligible for full-time or extended contracting work in varied roles across the Group, including pricing, marketing, customer success, supply chain, and finance.\n\n2020 Baseline\n\n2025 target\n\n41/23/24\n\n50/40/30\n\n2022 Progress\n\n41/27/28\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The Group is committed to creating new opportunities for the next generation through apprenticeships, internships, and its annual global student competition for innovation, Schneider Go Green. With tailored career development opportunities including career week, coaching, development plans, and mutual mentoring the Group is harnessing the power of all generations. With this, Schneider Electric is committed to supporting talent in the later stages of their career to have meaningful and fulfilling development, and to recognize and leverage their unique expertise and experience to boost learning and innovation across generations. For more information, see 2.5.3 Talent attraction and development , page 211.\n\n## Generation breakdown\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Origin, Race, Ethnicity and Nationality\n\nSchneider Electric believes in a multi-local world with locally tailored solutions supported by diverse teams across the globe to best meet its customers' needs with customization, quality, and speed. The Group's multi-hub model is key to delivering on this ambition with teams that represent diverse origins, nationalities, ethnicities and races, locations and cultural backgrounds. The multi-hub model focuses on attracting and developing local talents for global and local roles, and ensuring leadership reflects the diversity of nationalities and ethnic backgrounds present in local markets. The opportunity for Schneider Electric to be the 'most local of global companies' with a balanced multi-hub footprint to enable customer proximity, innovation, speed, collaboration, and diversity, is a key differentiator for long-term success.\n\nBecause these diversity of origin dimensions are addressed differently depending on the local context and culture, and their categories and definitions vary widely from country to country, there is no internationally accepted criteria and our local country teams drive local ambition and actions.\n\n## Race and ethnicity in the US\n\nSchneider Electric US is committed to evolving the racial and ethnic diversity of its employee population, with a specific focus on increasing ethnic representation. To support its ambition, in 2021, the Group became a member of the National Society of Black Engineers' (NSBE) Board of Corporate Affiliates (BCA). A group of sponsored and volunteer employees formed SExNSBE, an internal NSBE community, to focus on increasing the attraction, recruitment, and retention of Black professionals at Schneider Electric through a company-funded multi-touch transformational partnership. The Group's SExNSBE Community includes 240 employee members who spent more than 850 volunteer hours mentoring school-aged children in 2022 through the NSBE Jr program, and more than 600 volunteer hours mentoring collegiate NSBE members.",

As a follow up to this commitment, in March 2022 the Group announced the creation of the Global Accessibility Office, addressing the holistic needs of people with disabilities through a strategy of Inclusion and Care by Design, for people with disabilities. This is underpinned by global awareness and education about what is the largest minority group in the world, consisting of 1.3 billion people. The Group focuses on all dimensions of disability: visible, invisible, permanent, and temporary. These include Physical Motor or Physical Health, Sensory, Cognitive and Neuro diversities, and Psychological, Emotional or Behavioral.\n\nThe Group's approach of 'accessibility by design' creates holistic disability inclusion through four pillars:\n\n- 1. Customer First design: Fully accessible product, software, and UI/UX design\n- 2. People, processes, and tools: Accessibility by design in all processes (including recruitment), platforms and tools\n- 3. Brand and Communication Accessibility: For all events and communication - internal and external, digital, physical, and virtual\n- 4. Built environment: Accessible buildings and workplaces applying Universal Design principles, local legislation, and the International Accessibility Standards\n\nIn June 2022, Schneider Electric joined The Valuable 500 (V500) - a global business collective made up of 500 CEOs and their companies, innovating together for disability inclusion - with a commitment to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure that disability inclusion is on our senior leadership agenda.\n- \u00b7 Make at least one firm commitment to action.\n- \u00b7 Share our commitment with the business and the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith inclusion and care for all as a major focus of the Group's DEI and Well-being ambition, building awareness and education about People with Disabilities and Accessibility was a major focus in 2022. In December 2022, the Group then celebrated the UN International Day of Persons with Disabilities, with a focus on addressing 'ableism' and 'inclusive decision making' for people with disabilities, using the tagline 'Don't make decisions about me, without me'.\n\n## 84%\n\nof Country Presidents are either local or regional\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 56%\n\n## Focus on France\n\nIn France, an employee with disabilities is one who is recognized as such by the French commission for the rights and autonomy of people with disabilities.\n\nSchneider Electric France (SEF) reports 6.4% of the direct workforce (as of end of 2021) are employees with disabilities. In December 2021, SEF entered an agreement with unions, to recruit at least 100 people with disabilities over the next three years. In addition, they agreed to more accessibility (physical and digital), and more collaborative actions to allow employees facing health issues to work with more involvement of Union representation.\n\nSchneider Electric France works closely with a diverse panel of partnerships and the Group remains committed to the recruitment of People with Disabilities.  In 2022, 24 new permanent workers, 23 apprentices and 8 new interns were recruited.\n\nAnnually, the Group hosts an internal competition for 'The Handi Trophy', to recognize and promote the involvement of teams with regards to the inclusion of people with disabilities.\n\nIn addition, Schneider France works with a start up specializing in behavioural science analysis with a group of employees, including managers, people with disabilities, Human Resources Business Partners, individual contributors, and in-house medical staff. As a result of their analysis, Schneider France has greater understanding of the barriers preventing employees from talking about their disability. Resources have been created in collaboration with a group of employees to address recruiters, managers, and people with disabilities.\n\n## Focus on India\n\nIn 2018, Schneider Electric India launched a program 'SAKSHAM' (which means capable), focused on the inclusion of People with Disabilities through continuous education, enabling infrastructure and equitable processes and policies. The program focuses on employing, engaging, enabling and empowering those with disabilities. Two awareness and educational sessions of SAKSHAM were conducted in 2022, covering more than 700 employees. Within the SAKSHAM program, Schneider India has also launched a Digital Accessibility campaign which educates and empowers all employees on how to be digitally inclusive in both personal and professional interactions.\n\n## LGBT+ inclusion\n\nWe recognize and celebrate the Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans and Intersex People (LGBT+) community and its members for its diversity and uniqueness. The Group aims to build awareness and advocate for the community and wants its employees to be allies, playing a decisive role in creating an open and safe community where individuals are comfortable bringing their whole authentic self to work.\n\n182\n\nOf employees are in New Economies; and 36% of leadership teams\n\nNationalities represented in our global workforce across 109 countries\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Across the globe, Schneider Electric has also made public statements of support to advance LGBT+ inclusion. By adopting these standards, the Group pledges to respect and stand up for the human rights of LGBT+ workers, customers, and members of the public; to support our LGBT+ employees, further build inclusion in the workplace, and to prevent discrimination, including workplace discrimination, against LGBT+ people.\n\nSchneider Electric partnered with l'Autre Cercle, a French LGBT+ association, and contributed to the 'Odyssey for Equality' project. The project aims to bring concrete recommendations on LGBT+ inclusion for corporate members and partners for the next ten years.\n\n## Building allyship\n\n- \u00b7 LGBT+ and Allies Employee Resource Network (ERN): A volunteer, employee-led network of employees focused on co-creating internal and external awareness and education campaigns and feedback and design of the Group's benefits and policies. In 2022, the ERN developed and launched a Transgender Playbook, piloted in South America. The playbook is designed to guide employees, managers, and HR teams in supporting those transitioning in the workplace with inclusion and care.\n- \u00b7 Focus on France: In 2022, Schneider Electric France took part in the 'StOpE initiative', which defines eight actions to combat sexism and LGBT+ phobia. With senior leader sponsorship, the initiative deployed educational resources for managers on recognizing and responding to signs of sexism. In 2022, more than 100 managers completed the training. For all employees, an eLearning provides essential information on how to recognize and act against signs of sexism and LGBT+ phobia. The Group has also created a network of 60 harassment, sexism, and LGBT-phobia referents located all over France.\n\n## 2.5.2.8 Driving change by impacting society and advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion\n\nSchneider Electric is committed to driving change within its broader ecosystem and society at large, through advocacy and rolemodelling. The Group works closely with its strategic partners and suppliers and invests in local actions through the Schneider Electric Foundation, with the goal of addressing systemic inequities and becoming a leader in corporate citizenship. In addition, Schneider Electric US has committed to diversifying its supply chain through its Supplier Diversity program (see section 2.2.12.12 'Supplier diversity program in the United States' page 144).\n\n## Inclusive Mindset for Children Program in India\n\n- \u00b7 Focus on North America : In 2022, Schneider Electric North America launched a 'Pronouns in the Workplace' program, providing stickers and pins with the pronouns, He/Him, She/Her and They/Them in selected US, Mexico and Canada sites. This initiative is intended to raise awareness around self-identification as well as fostering a safe and welcoming work environment and will serve as a catalyst for expansion into other countries and regions.\n\nJAGRITI was launched in 2016 to focus on impacting young minds to build an inclusive and equitable society. The program aims to educate and influence school children on equity, culture of respect, inclusion, gender stereotypes and biases. In 2022, this program was extended to schools in Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad, engaging more than 200 students from five schools. Since 2016, we have engaged 7,500+ students in over 45 schools across India.\n\nA snapshot of some of our global recognitions are summarized here:\n\n## Global Awards\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider joined for the 5th consecutive year the 2022 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, measuring gender equality performance of public companies\n\nSchneider ranked 20th globally, and third in France, among the 100 leading companies included in Equileap's milestone report\n\nSchneider ranked 2nd in its industry, 5th in France and 61st in the overall Refinitiv's annual Diversity and Inclusion Index\n\nSchneider Electric ranked 16th among its 41 industry peers in the Financial Times' Diversity Leaders 2023 ranking, for the fourth consecutive year\n\nSchneider was listed on the 2022 'Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion' list, recognizing its Diversity and Inclusion commitments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2022, Schneider Electric contributed to the publication of the group's Operational Recommendations on Ethnic Diversity & Inclusion.\n- \u00b7 WeQual - WeQual is on a mission to achieve 50/50 gender parity at the top of the world's largest companies.\n\n## 2.5.2.9  Recognitions and awards\n\nSchneider Electric has been included in many global and local indices for multiple years due to the Group's commitment, transparency and impact in the DEI and Well-being space.\n\n## 2.5.3  Talent attraction and development\n\n## 2.5.3.1 Context\n\nAttracting, developing and retaining talent is crucial to the ongoing success of companies. Business growth in markets around the world, in conjunction with the rapidly evolving 'next normal', requires an acceleration of skill development to prepare for greater organizational agility and resilience, developing leaders who build strong and caring connections in a digital world, and shape the workforce of the future.\n\n## 2.5.3.2  Risks and opportunities\n\nSchneider faces the risk of talent and skills attrition given the current talent scarcity in the market, the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world we live in, the demand for a more local world, and the unprecedented changes in the future of work.\n\nThe risk of not attracting, developing and retaining the best talent in the market, especially for critical skills, would have an impact in terms of:\n\n- \u00b7 Cost of recruiting and onboarding\n- \u00b7 Gaps in critical skills to stay ahead of the competition\n- \u00b7 Talent's brand perception\n\nAt the same time, with the right policies and programs in place, these risks become opportunities for the Group to strengthen its brand as talent developer for everyone, everywhere, leading to greater talent attraction. The policies and programs from the Group include:\n\n- \u00b7 A new talent acquisition platform to simplify the overall candidate experience, migrate to more digital, borderless, and self-paced offers to attract talent, and create a more equal playing field for those interested in Schneider.\n- \u00b7 An annual performance and development approach with fair, transparent, and competitive rewards and development, supported by regular meaningful career conversations.\n- \u00b7 A digital ecosystem powered by AI to enable access to development opportunities (internal mobility, project, and mentoring) via Open Talent Market (OTM).\n- \u00b7 Programs for employees at different stages of their professional career and specific talent segments (e.g. Digital, AI, Software, R&D, Supply Chain, Sustainability), with a strong focus on digital skills, commercial excellence, leadership and functional expertise.\n- \u00b7 A Global Flexibility@Work policy and a balanced Multi-hub footprint to enable its employees to have more flexibility and manage their unique life and work in the way that works best for them\n\nThese key policies and programs ensure the investment in the attraction and development of talent at all levels. They create equitable opportunities and the environment for employees to learn and grow, while empowering them to own their career by developing critical skills to support their personal and professional growth, supported by their manager and enabled by digital tools.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Establishing a strong brand as an employer is communicated in the EVP (Meaningful, Inclusive, Empowered); the promise to current and future employees, driven and anchored by a meaningful purpose. In addition, the Group invests in learning and development for the wider ecosystem, including universities and schools, partners, customers, and the wider community.\n\nThe Group has a two-pronged approach to talent development, in order to prepare the workforce of the future - for all employees and for specific target groups. Most activities are driven through an annual People Calendar, which is adopted globally to ensure that development is accessible to all employees.\n\n- \u00b7 For all employees, the Group ensures there are tools and processes in place to set individual performance and development goals, and access learning and development opportunities for their current role, as well as preparing themselves for diverse career paths around the world. #LearnEveryDay as one of the Core Values, sets the tone for employees to be open to new challenges and continue to upskill for themselves, their teams, and their communities. In the OneVoice employee survey, 76% of employees responded favorably to being able to renew their skills through learning and development opportunities.\n- \u00b7 For specific groups of talent, there are targeted programs for specific skills to support Schneider commercial, digital, and leadership transformations and equip our blue-collar workers for the supply chain of the future. There is a strong focus on high potentials, expert talent, and employees at different career stages, including early career talent and those who are in a later stage of their career. An annual talent review process operates across the Group to help ensure high potential talent, including technical and digital talent, is identified, recognized, and supported with an accelerated development path.\n\nIn the 'next normal', the role of leaders to transform culture, build great teams, and deliver impact is more critical than ever. The 2021 Culture & Leadership survey of around 2,000 Schneider leaders validated steady progress on the overall Group leadership and culture transformation started in 2017. Key strengths include strong ethics and integrity, sense of purpose, and customer focus, as well as a positive spirit and willingness to go above and beyond. The 2022 OneVoice results amongst leaders also show progress in a shared meaningful purpose and innovative capabilities. The Group has identified a future leader profile that will be used as a framework moving forward.\n\nAt Schneider Electric, feedback is key to building trust and care, and transforming its leadership and culture. In 2022, over 7,000 leaders opted-in to participate in the Upward Feedback campaign. This is an anonymous questionnaire which gathers input from employees on how well they think their leaders demonstrate the Core Values and Leadership Expectations, as well as suggestions for behaviors to Start, Stop, and Continue. This questionnaire gives leaders additional insights about their behavioral strengths and development areas and helps them identify opportunities to continue to deliver greater impact as leaders, and together with their team.\n\n## 2.5.3.4 Governance\n\nThe Executive Committee regularly discusses the overall health of the leadership pipeline and succession strength for top positions, including during the monthly Executive Committee people committee and the year-end global talent reviews with the CEO and CHRO. In addition, the Executive Committee meets regularly to make critical selection and succession decisions and review specific talent attraction and development strategies, for example expert talent, digital talent and global top potential talent. This is supported by integrated HR information systems and analytics platforms which provide data and analysis in the areas of workforce planning and talent management. In addition, Regional, Business, and Function People Committees also meet regularly to review talent in their perimeter.\n\n## 2.5.3.5  Actions and impacts\n\nThe Group strives to provide a meaningful experience for their talent from talent attraction and onboarding, to performance and development.  Schneider empowers all employees to grow their fullest potential, deliver with impact based on the 'what' and the 'how', build sustainable careers, refresh and learn new skills for today and tomorrow.\n\n## Attracting talent to shape the workforce of the future\n\nAttracting talent at all levels is more crucial than ever before - not only in terms of enabling the delivery of the Group strategy, but also to continue to innovate for our customers and build a long-term pipeline of future talent that could join Schneider Electric.\n\nHaving improved the ability to manage a talent network through the introduction of new tools and systems in 2021, the focus through 2022 has been on three key areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Technology and Digital Experience: continuing to simplify and optimize the overall experience for both candidates and colleagues involved in the recruitment process, reducing our time to apply from thirty minutes to one minute.\n- \u00b7 Strategic Sourcing: focusing on priority talent groups for skills and diversity with specialized campaigns and recruiter taskforces.\n- \u00b7 Employer Branding: increasing awareness of Schneider Electric as a company, especially among the next generation of talent, including Always On recruitment to help build a sustainable pipeline of talent.",

As part of SSI #10, the five-year ambition is to achieve a doubling of growth in the early-career pipeline. This involves leveraging traditional approaches today but migrating to more digital, borderless, and self-paced offers, ensuring the Company can de-bias practices and create a more equal playing field for those interested in Schneider and sustainability. This will be achieved through flagship global programs and partnerships, supplemented by countryspecific initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 Schneider Global Virtual Student Experience: completely digital experience designed to provide students with a way to engage with Schneider Electric through eLearning modules and on project simulations.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Go Green: an annual global competition for business and Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) students around the world to find innovative solutions for energy management and automation. In 2022, Schneider Go Green has had over 140,000 registrations and more than 22,000+ students have submitted ideas from over 200 countries.\n- \u00b7 Development programs around the world that are structured to help support the acceleration of early career talent through a robust training and development path including graduate programs, internships, apprenticeships, and co-ops.\n- \u00b7 Sponsorship initiatives, virtual Careers Fairs, office/site tours, Innovation Summit tours, digital and face-to-face speaking engagements and networking opportunities, mentoring relationships.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2x number of opportunities for interns, apprentices, and fresh graduate hires\n\nSchneider Electric is doubling its commitment to the Next Generation of Talent. During 2022, the Company recruited a diverse mix of 60% students and 40% recent graduates, and engaged brand ambassadors on campus through global programs and partnerships as well as by enhancing its development program offers. One of the newest programs is the Sustainability Development Program which brings Next Generation Talent into our Sustainability Business and develops them as future leaders.\n\n2019 Baseline\n\n2025 target\n\n4,939\n\nx2.00\n\n2022 Progress\n\nx1.33\n\n## Driving high performance\n\nSchneider Electric's approach to performance and development is anchored by the Group's Core Values and, for leaders, by the Leadership Expectations. This approach encourages learning and growth, enabling employees, teams, and the Company to reach their full potential. The Group's robust process of setting individual performance and development goals annually with regular reviews during the year provides everyone with a clear roadmap to deliver with impact based on the 'what' and the 'how' to ultimately achieve collective success. Schneider Electric employees are encouraged to seek, give, and receive feedback, empowering them to take ownership for driving their individual performance, and managers are encouraged to support them with coaching and frequent conversations, driving the business forward. In 2022, 98% of eligible employees* completed a performance and development review.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*This includes employees with  a valid Schneider email address, whose employment status is active (or suspended, which is country specific), who are on permanent/ fixed term contract type and those who were hired on or before 30 Sept 2022, in addition to country or entity specific conditions.\n\n## Enabling sustainable careers\n\nDeveloping employees in their current role and for future career growth is critical to enable growth of the Group's businesses. In line with the conviction that all employees are talent and the aim to provide equitable development opportunities for all, Schneider Electric believes that all employees should take ownership of their own unique career development, supported by their managers and enabled by digital tools. To empower and engage employees with this approach, Schneider Electric held its second Career Week for all employees in 2022. Over 100 events took place with employees participating from over 99 countries, sharing career stories, unleashing the power of networking, having career check-in conversations with their manager, learning about different roles and skills, and being equipped with tools and resources to develop, grow, and shape their future. 94% of employees surveyed were positive about the event, especially appreciating the time to discuss and learn about career development.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Both their HR Business Partner and managers were equipped and briefed on how to manage those meaningful conversations and better support the employees. The conversations helped recognize their unique contribution, set expectations and provide clarity on future opportunities.\n\n'I believe the Senior Talent Conversation was a good focus point to plan and become clear about the next years of my career and what it will mean to the company and my personal development. You get so engaged in your day-to-day work that you hardly think about what the remaining work life will look like and what motivates you.

The Group has a renowned expert program called 'Edison' to recognize individual employees who have demonstrated outstanding achievement, expertise, and leadership throughout the Company. The 'Edison' expert program offers them a chance to continue to extend their contribution and increase their impact and exposure to the Group's strategy. Employees in this program are identified as Level 1 - Expert, Level 2 - Senior Expert, or Level 3 - Master Expert. A revamp of the Edison program is planned for early 2023.\n\nThe Group actively promotes a learning and teaching culture by developing its internal trainer capability. There has been a strong focus on equipping internal trainers to develop and facilitate virtual classroom training, including using tools, such as Klaxoon and BlendedX, for additional interaction and engagement. A Global Virtual Internal Trainer Conference was organized in October with the purpose of recognizing, developing, and connecting internal trainers. This year it was a 2-day conference, on the theme of 'Engaging Learners in a Virtual World' with keynote speakers from MIT-Sloan & INSEAD sharing insights on the 'Future of Learning'. There are currently over 5,000 identified internal trainers who collectively delivered over 18,000 sessions in 2022, accounting for 63% of formal training.\n\nAdditionally, Schneider Electric currently has 300 communities of practice as part of the Communities@Work (C@W) program encompassing more than 35,000 members. Each community has a leader and a robust animation plan, and each year, the communities' activities are reviewed, with the most active communities being recognized for the value they bring to the organization. These communities are an effective way to enable learning, personal growth and productivity.\n\n- \u00b7 They promote knowledge sharing through conversations and other activities (such as webinar, training, and gamification), creating collective intelligence and enabling innovation.\n- \u00b7 They offer opportunities for employees to grow - learning from their peers through best practices and experience sharing in the community.\n- \u00b7 They are a natural support system - providing immediate support, agility and speed to their members.\n- \u00b7 They also contribute to increasing Employee Satisfaction, addressing the need of belonging in the next normal through social interactions (90% of the Active Community respondents feel enthusiastic about being part of a community).",

Roles requiring digital and human skills are growing due to the rise of AI, automation, and digitization. Purposeful renewal of skills is necessary to ensure sustainable careers and a resilient, future-ready business. To support this ambition, business and function academies are in place to partner with the business in identifying learning needs and spotting gaps in core and future skills for relevant employee populations.

The platform is available to all connected employees globally and leverages AI (Artificial Intelligence) to match the supply and demand of internal talent with a transparent, digital, and borderless approach. The ambition for usage is to increase 4x the number of employee-driven development interactions in the OTM by 2025 (SSE #21). At the end of 2022, more than 80% of eligible employees were registered on the platform resulting in 26k digital development opportunities since registration. Through OTM in 2022, ~1,500 employees were given visibility to over 16,000 open positions, 6,000 mentoring relationships were formed and 2,700 project roles were assigned. An average of ~20,000 employees visit the platform each month.\n\n2022 Progress\n\nSchneider Electric also has an open learning ecosystem comprised of interconnected platforms at the center of which is My LearningLink (MLL). This platform provides digital and classroom learning opportunities and was made available to all employees on mobile since 2021. Schneider Electric also continues to invest in providing My LearningLink connectivity to shop floor employees either through the 'Digital Learning Corner' (a computer or kiosk installed in their facilities) or, from their mobile phones.\n\n## In 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 More than 300,000 training completions every month\n- \u00b7 More than 30,600 modules of learning content were available in more than one language\n- \u00b7 Digital learning consumption stood at 69%, which has remained stable since 2020\n\nSchneider Electric also offers a broad catalogue of online courses and webinars to partners and customers, accessible via free registration at mySchneider Partner Portal (an extranet). The mySchneider Partner Portal is deployed in 140 countries and provides a customized learning experience with targeted training content that is most relevant to over one million Schneider Electric's partners and customers who have completed around two million courses since its inception in 2015.\n\n'Open Talent Market was a turning point in my professional career . After browsing through multiple opportunities, I got to understand different domains and teams that SE has better than ever.\n\nOTM really identified my career dream job, to be honest, because I landed exactly in the role which I wanted and have the global exposure together within this position.\n\nWithout OTM I would never know about this opportunity.\n\nIt's a great tool to use like LinkedIn but internally.

These engagements include via projects (internal gigs), mentorships, and new positions. By leveraging AI the company empowers employees and creates more connections that support development across departments, countries, and functions. In 2022, Schneider Electric focused on increasing the number of employees registered in the Open Talent Market closing the year with 81% of their workforce on the Open Talent Market +16pts vs 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, Schneider Electric expanded the pilot program to 12 countries/entities including France, India, Japan, China, Germany, Brazil, Australia, UK & Ireland and South Africa among others, and will continue to scale progressively in the upcoming years to reach its SSE #23 ambition by 2025. The program is anchored in career conversations resulting in a robust development plan linked to their unique career aspirations and supported by different offers including new contractual schemes, upskilling, knowledge transfer, pivoting, recognition, care, and personal planning among others. The launch of the program was received positively by this group of talent.\n\nSchneider Electric also started to observe in 2022 the positive impact of the program through different initiatives deployed by the pilot countries. For example, India tapped into the wealth of experience of Senior Talent by engaging some retired employees as consultants. They possess not only the depth of knowledge and breadth of experiences but also a powerful network, allowing Schneider to continue benefiting from long-term customer relationships.\n\nSimilarly, in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, Senior Talents are offered the opportunity to make an impact with their experience and network in the Talent Acquisition team. Senior Talent became great recruiters and brand ambassadors - they have a comparable network to headhunters, and they can best describe the job requirements authentically, speaking from their own experience.\n\nOther countries such as France and China focused on facilitating workshops with Senior Talents and their managers, to help them reflect and understand their personal and career aspirations, their opportunities and how to take ownership of their development. According to their feedback, participants felt valued, listened to and positive about the company supporting them in this stage of their career. At the same time, the structured methodology and tools to make a career discussion and build a strong development plan were highly appreciated both by them and their managers.\n\nTo learn more about how Senior Talent Program connects with the Future Ready program and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion please check section 2.6.5 Social Impact in France, sub-sections Future Ready Program and Senior Talent program page 240.\n\n## 2.5.3.6 Recognitions and awards\n\nSchneider Electric achievements include:\n\n- \u00b7 2022 Brandon Hall Group HCM Excellence Award- Bronze in the category of 'Best Advance in Compliance Training' for two training programs: 'Schneider Essentials', which is a series of mandatory training on Ethics, Risk Management and Cultural topics deployed to all employees, and 'Anti-Corruption' training for customer facing, finance, procurement or employees exposed to the risk.

As we are now in a post-pandemic era, people and specifically younger generations have higher expectations in terms of creating better work and life balance, and rely on their employer to ensure that this need is met.\n\n## 2.5.4.2  Risks and opportunities\n\nHaving the best talent and attracting new talent is the main goal of inclusive compensation and benefits offerings.\n\nSchneider Electric is committed to delivering best in class benefits and opportunities to its employees; and aware that unfit compensation and benefit could risk talent attraction.\n\n## 2.5.4.3 Group policy\n\nTo support Schneider Electric's mission to create a great place to work and to cater for the diverse needs of its global existing and future workforce, the Company is committed to providing a competitive, inclusive compensation and benefits offering, which attracts, motivates, and retains talent.\n\nSchneider Electric takes its responsibility as a leading employer seriously and ensures its diverse global workforce is treated in a fair and ethical way. Its inclusive reward portfolio is designed to support employees to be at their best, and goes beyond pay and benefits. The portfolio is a meaningful mix of programs to engage employees, including recognition to celebrate great work, incentives to reward high performance, an award-winning employee share ownership plan, and benefits to suit employees and their dependents.\n\nSchneider Electric ensures that all compensation and benefits decisions and policies are based on the principles outlined above and follow local statutory and collective agreements.\n\nSchneider Electric believes in rewarding, recognizing, and differentiating fairly employees who contribute to the success and live the values of the Company. By putting recognition at the center of a high-performance ambition, employees feel engaged and motivated to do more. Delivering high performance is rewarded by competitive market pay, incentive programs, employee shareholding, and opportunities to grow careers within Schneider Electric.\n\nThe Group offers a portfolio of benefits to care for employees' needs at each life stage. Its diverse and multi-generational workforce is provided with meaningful choices covering a holistic range of well-being, flexibility, and financial protections to provide peace of mind to employees and their dependents.\n\n## 2.5.4.4 Governance\n\nThe implementation of group policies on compensation and benefits are overseen by the highly experienced global, regional and local reward organizations.\n\n## 2.5.4.5  Actions and impacts\n\n## Compensation\n\n## Job architecture and compensation process\n\nSchneider Electric has implemented a global job architecture to support HR processes and programs and to enable\n\nSchneider Electric to engage, develop, and move talent across different businesses and geographies. The job architecture provides alignment to market practice and organizational structure to ensure the reward package offered for a role is fair and competitive. This supports working towards creating greater transparency for career development and progression.\n\n## Pay competitively and pay-for-performance\n\nEmployees are empowered to receive ongoing feedback, recognition, and coaching from their managers, and their individual performance is assessed in a fair manner based on their goals and behaviors. In line with the Group's pay-for-performance philosophy, the compensation structure typically includes fixed and variable (incentive) elements. Compensation programs and decisions are based on individual performance and behaviors, Company performance, and competitive market positioning.\n\n## Equal pay for equal work\n\nThe basic foundational principles of fairness, equity, ethics, and transparency are fully embedded in the company values. Through reward policies and processes, employees are compensated fairly and equitably for the skillset they possess and value contributions as a business imperative. Over the past eight years, Schneider Electric has successfully transformed the Pay Equity Framework covering all employees across all countries of operation. The company has created a fair and equitable ecosystem of HR processes and taken proactive actions to prevent new pay gaps from being created. Salary changes when hiring new recruits, promoting employees, and reviewing salaries internally are closely monitored. Managers and HR professionals are trained to be mindful of every pay decision they make, and to ensure that their decision process is bias-free.\n\nAs part of the Schneider Sustainability Essentials for 2025, the company has committed to attain and maintain a pay gap below 1% by 2025 for both females and males. At of the end of 2022, the pay gap was -1.6% for females and 1.02% for males. Note: this measurement will differ from country figures that may be required to be reported due to statutory requirements.",

A country-level governance framework has also been established to facilitate the attainment of our ambition to achieve pay gaps of <1% for both females and males.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Living wage\n\nSchneider Electric believes earning a living wage is a basic human right and a key element of decent work. Schneider Electric is committed to paying all employees at or above the living wage to meet their families' basic needs. The Group considers basic needs to include food, housing, sanitation, education, healthcare, plus discretionary income for a given local standard of living. This is guided by our Human Rights Policy and Trust Charter. All permanent direct employees of Schneider Electric with open ended contracts or fixed term contracts that are above 1 year are in scope of the annual gap analysis. Third parties such as suppliers or contractors or interns are out of scope.\n\nIn 2018, Schneider Electric started working with an independent advisor - Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) - to implement its living wage commitment as part of its fair and equitable policies. Schneider Electric has initiated a global process to analyze wage levels and employment practices against local living wage standards set by BSR. Moving forward into 2020, the COVID-19 crisis highlighted even more strongly the need for a safety net to guarantee a minimum income level for employees. Given the complexity of evaluating and mitigating the macroeconomic impact of the crisis, the Group did not run a gap analysis that year. In 2021, the new gap analysis covered 63 countries (representing over 99% of Schneider Electric footprint globally). As of 31 December 2022, 100% of in scope employees, i.e. all Schneider employees treated as permanent workforce, were paid at least a living wage. Where living wage gaps were identified, corrective actions were taken to ensure that all employees are paid a living wage and no new gaps are created. In addition to guaranteeing that all in scope employees are paid at least a living wage, Schneider continues to comply with all applicable federal, state and local regulations regarding minimum wage requirements.\n\nIn 2021, the analysis covered 63 countries (representing over 99% of Schneider's global footprint). As of December 31, 2022, 100% of relevant employees had received at least a living wage. Where living wage gaps were identified, corrective action was taken to ensure that all employees received a living wage and that no new gaps emerged. In addition to ensuring that all employees within the scope are paid at least a living wage, Schneider continues to comply with all applicable federal, state and local minimum wage regulations.\n\nFrom 2021 onwards, the Group underlined its commitment to pay 100% of employees at least a living wage as part of its SSE #20. This commitment will be audited annually with the support of an independent third party. Schneider Electric also continues to be part of leading corporate coalitions and notably became a Decent Work patron for the UN Global Compact. These global coalitions work together to implement living wage standards within their workforce and their entire ecosystem. In 2022 the Group started working with a new consultant, Fair Wage Network, with the aim of improving the geographical coverage, having a dynamic and web-based living wage benchmark and initiating an independent review and certification of the living wage gap analysis. As of December 2022, 100% of the employees were covered by the review, in 111 countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 2.5  Great people make Schneider Electric a great company\n\n## Short-term incentive\n\nFor employees, the annual short-term incentive is linked with the overall Company performance and individual objectives. It is designed to encourage and motivate employees to deliver on collective ambitions through accountability and collaboration, driving better performance collectively and individually. With a strong sustainability component included, the annual short-term incentives for the Group's executives and around 64,000 eligible employees helps focus on what matters to Schneider Electric. Since 2011, sustainability performance criteria have been embedded in the incentive goals for Group executives. They are directly linked to the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) targets.\n\nFrom 2019, the weight of the SSI criteria has increased from 6% to 20% in the collective part of the annual short-term incentive, highlighting further the importance of sustainability on Schneider Electric's business agenda. In France, since 2012 the SSI has also been included in the profit-sharing incentive plan for the French entities, Schneider Electric Industries and Schneider Electric France. The reduction in the occupational accidents severity rate is also considered in the profit-sharing incentive plans of 24 other French entities.\n\nFrom 2022, Schneider have introduced a Customer First Performance Criteria in the incentive goals for Group executives. The Group is building Trust through Superior Customer Experience and Quality. It measures the Net Customer Satisfaction (NCS) through real-time digital customer surveys covering six critical touchpoints as part of the customer operational interactions. Every employee is part of this journey and is fully empowered to bring Customer Experience to the highest level. All the results on Customer Satisfaction are available in the Customer Feedback Management Platform where all employees are engaged and empowered to improve the Customer Experience.\n\nTo promote a superior sales culture where sales people go above and beyond to surprise and delight customers, Schneider Electric offers levels of differentiated reward for sales people to enhance motivation and results.\n\n## Long-term incentive\n\nSchneider Electric's long-term incentive plan offers share ownership opportunities to the Group's key talents and critical roles to align their rewards with the interests and experience of Schneider Electric shareholders. Similar to the short-term incentive, a portion of the award under the long-term incentive plan is subject to the achievement of sustainability objectives. From 2020, the long-term sustainability performance is measured through the Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI), a combination of external indices which cover a range of environmental, social, and governance indicators wider than and different from the SSI criteria included in the annual incentive plan. See more details on SSERI in Chapter 4.2 'Compensation Report', page 376.\n\n## Recognition in the company DNA\n\nEvery day, Schneider Electric employees make important contributions to help the organization achieve its mission and key business objectives. The global recognition portal 'Step Up' gives employees a way to formally recognize and celebrate people who consistently demonstrate the Company's Core Values and go above and beyond. Schneider Electric creates a culture where employees receive regular feedback and coaching from their managers and colleagues and encourages the recognition of small and big achievements by simply saying 'thank you'.\n\nIn 2022, Schneider Electric refreshed the global recognition program and launched a new platform for recognition with a new partner. With this program, Schneider brought recognition in the work ecosystem for employees and also introduced functionality to put emphasis on the importance of sharing and acknowledging gratitude in the workplace. Throughout 2022, the recognition culture remained strong, with many employees continuing to utilize the dedicated platform to appreciate and recognize colleagues.\n\n## Benefits\n\nBenefits provided by the Group represent a considerable business commitment by Schneider Electric everywhere in the world. The company ensures that all employee benefits are locally and globally compliant, as well as market relevant. Because employee benefit plans vary significantly between countries due to different levels of social, tax, and legal regulations, Schneider Electric's benefits portfolio is primarily country-driven and aims at providing similar benefits within a country territory.\n\n## Global benefit standards\n\nSchneider Electric regularly reviews compliance with its global benefit policies and principles to ensure that its inclusive global benefit standards are delivered for everyone, everywhere. These standards cover healthcare, family leave, and life cover.\n\nOne of Schneider Electric's underlying benefit objectives is to ensure all its employees are equipped to manage their basic health and well-being and to provide adequate security to employees and their dependents. Health and well-being are embedded in the Schneider Electric strategic people priorities and contribute to its sustainability mission. The Group is committed to provide its employees access to a well-being at work program - translated into a dual standard of access to healthcare and well-being training programs (detailed further in subsection 'Supporting employees' well-being, mental health and unique lives and work', page 206). It also provide access to an inclusive and comprehensive standard of healthcare coverage (outpatient, hospitalization, key health risks/ chronic conditions, maternity, children) defined by local regulations and employment agreements. Schneider also supports its employees with personal time off at critical life stages and this is fully deployed in 100% of countries as detailed below. In addition, the Group commits to provide financial security to employee dependents, in the event of an employee's death, in the form of a minimum standard of life assurance coverage of at least a multiple equivalent to one year's salary.",

        "page_content": "## Global Family Leave Policy\n\nAs a caring and responsible employer, Schneider launched its Global Family Leave policy along with care leave in 2017. Through its policy, the Group supports employees with personal time at critical life stages and empowers everyone to manage their 'unique life and work' so that they can be at their best. The group applies a continuous improvement approach to all employee benefits and policies and has made several notable improvements with employees' inputs. While the countries have flexibility to define eligibility and policy details per statutory/market requirements, the policy sets global minimum standards for paid leave. In 2020, Schneider expanded its care leave from 1 to 2 weeks for employees to care for their dependents diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nIn 2022, the Group conducted extensive internal and external research and will be expanding its Global Family Leave policy from 2023 for all employees globally. Parental leave for birth adoption or surrogacy will go from 12 weeks paid to 20 weeks paid for primary leave, and from 2 weeks to 4 weeks for secondary leave. Care leave will increase from 1 paid week to 2 paid weeks. Bereavement will remain the same 1 week. Ahead of that, beginning in July 2022, the Group's North America operations were the first ones to benefit from these new expansions. All employees eligible for benefits have access to this global policy.\n\n## Employee share ownership\n\nThe Worldwide Employee Share Ownership Plan (WESOP) is one of the Group's recurring key annual reward programs, offering employees across the world an opportunity to become owners of the Company, at preferred conditions.\n\nWESOP is strongly ingrained in the Group's culture, as a cultural and reward differentiator with a positive impact on engagement, attraction and retention. Schneider Electric has strongly developed and reinforced its offer over the years in order to build a sustainable group of employee shareholders reflecting the workforce diversity, to create a strong feeling of belonging, and to link employees to the performance of the Company, acting like owners of Schneider Electric. In that spirit, WESOP has become part of the Group sustainability commitments towards its 2025 roadmap (SSE #19).\n\nIn 2022, the Group successfully offered WESOP in 42 countries, achieving 60.5% subscription rate, a higher rate than in 2021 which was already at 59%. As of December 31, 2022, the employee shareholding represented 3.8% of Schneider Electric SE's capital and 6.6% of the voting rights. 78% of the Group employee shareholders were located outside of France, of which 13% are in China, 15% in India, and 9% in the US. This also includes employee shareholding resulting from the long-term incentives grants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The objective for a company to ensure regular and safe social dialogue is to build consensus amongst all employees' of the company. To do so, companies integrate a third unbiased party in discussions to help resolve issues and encourage change to adapt to global and local workforce expectations.\n\n## 2.5.5.2 Risks and opportunities\n\nSocial dialogue and freedom of association must be seen within the wider context of Ethics & Responsibility. As a global company, Schneider Electric believes that its responsibility goes beyond compliance with local and international regulations and is therefore committed to conducting its business ethically, sustainably and responsibly.\n\nThe Group constantly interacts with all its stakeholders across the world: its borders are expanding, its environment is changing ever faster, its activities are becoming globalized, and its social responsibilities are growing.\n\nThe challenge is to gain and maintain the highest confidence of its stakeholders. To support each employee in this approach, the Group emphasizes the importance of placing responsibility at the heart of its corporate governance.\n\n## 2.5.5.3 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric considers freedom of association and collective bargaining as fundamental rights that must be respected everywhere and therefore in its Trust Charter commits to complying with local laws in every country where it operates.\n\nIn its Human Rights Policy, Schneider confirms that it considers freedom of association as the basis of a regular dialogue between a company and its employees. To that purpose, Schneider respects the individual right of its employees to freely join, participate in or quit labor organizations to assert and defend their interests. Subsequently, Schneider guarantees that any employee wishing to do so shall be protected against any internal measure limiting his or her freedom of association such as discrimination of any kind, pay loss or dismissal. Schneider also recognizes the importance of dialogue with freely appointed employee representatives, employee representative bodies (such as Works Councils or employee forums) or organizations (like trade unions) and supports collective bargaining.\n\nIn addition, Schneider joined the Global Deal initiative in 2017. The Group is promoting social dialogue as a means to foster decent work, quality jobs, increased productivity and, by extension, greater equality and inclusive growth.\n\n## 2.5.5.4 Governance\n\nSocial dialogue is managed at country level by HR leaders with the employee representative bodies and unions, and at transnational level with the European Works Council (EWC) which covers most of geographical Europe. Social dialogue is also taken into consideration by the Group's social reporting system, where local HR teams report on the presence of trade unions, works councils and Health and Safety Committees every year.\n\nIn 2014, while changing the corporate form of its parent company, Schneider Electric SA, into a European company (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne), Schneider Electric negotiated an agreement with employee representatives of European countries about the involvement of these countries' employees in the Company's decision-making processes, thus reaffirming its commitment to promoting social dialogue at international level.\n\n## 2.5.5.5 Actions and impacts\n\n## European Works Council (EWC)\n\nSince 2014, Schneider Electric has significantly enhanced the intensity and the impact of social dialogue at European level. This channel for dialogue aims to enable management to make more efficient decisions by giving employee representatives the opportunity to be informed of such decisions and to understand their reasoning, as well as to put forward proposals to supplement or improve them.\n\nIn this respect, new spaces for discussion were explored in order to strengthen the contributions of the members of the EWC on strategic issues. Several workshops for reflection and ideation were organized, namely during the implementation of the new alert system and the review of the approach to the duty of vigilance. The benefits of these workshops were several, starting with a better awareness of these topics by the members of the European Works Council, and an opportunity to contribute upstream on decisions impacting the company's strategy.\n\nEuropean Works Council members visiting the Innovation Hub in Le Hive (Rueil-Malmaison)\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, with 80% employee coverage, Schneider Electric Industries and Schneider Electric France SAS set the tone for social dialogue in France mainly through the Central Works Council and the Group Committee. During the first quarter of 2022, Schneider Electric negotiated a new 'work from home' agreement for its employees in France with the following main objectives: an increase in the number of beneficiaries, more flexibility, and the introduction of financial compensation. Around 8,000 employees currently use telework, up from 6,000 at the beginning of the year.\n\nIn addition, the introduction of a new collective agreement for the Metallurgy branch, the largest Branch in France, effective from January 1, 2024, has led to the opening of various negotiations, including one on classification.\n\nThis is a major transformation for Schneider Electric in France. All the trade unions began participating in this deployment during the second half of 2022, and the project will continue throughout 2023. At the same time, all the members of the works council have received specific training regarding roles, Company organization, and its financial culture.\n\n## Social dialogue in the United States\n\nIn North America, and more specifically in the US, regular communication takes place with both union and non-union employees on key business topics and trends affecting their jobs. Company officials meet with key international union leaders and local union leadership on an ongoing basis, and formally on an annual basis, to advise and discuss competitive issues impacting the Company's business, and to ensure alignment with the Company's business strategies and challenges. In 2022, Company officials met with the local unions to discuss strategic investments intended to upgrade equipment, improve efficiency to support expected demand, enhance the smart factory profile, and reduce CO 2 emissions in several factories. In addition, Company officials have continued to partner with union representatives to discuss COVID-19 and ensure safety protocols are in place for employees, customers, and vendors.\n\n## Social dialogue in Mexico\n\nIn addition to regular communications and in accordance with Mexican law reform, during 2022 the Group conducted the legitimization process with the Mexican unions at all Schneider Electric sites where employees had the opportunity to review their collective agreements and confirm their agreement and commitment to the unions and the company. All of these processes were supported by the Legal and Human Resources teams.\n\nCommission to legitimize Collective Contract in Reynosa Plant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Social dialogue in China\n\nSchneider Electric China has a strong culture of social dialogue with all employees in over 30 legal entities and at more than 100 sites across the country.\n\nThe HR department, in partnership with the union, facilitates active and open communications with employees and takes action on employee feedback to enrich their career experience as well as ensure sustainable talent development. Specific effort has been made on several key topics in line with employee suggestions, notably around Learning, Development and Well-being:\n\n- \u00b7 Upskilling programs are now more diversified for all employees and in targeted job roles, from customer-facing teams to support functions, with face-to-face and virtual options including mobile and AI-facilitated, based on 3E methodology (education, experience and exposure). Employee individual average learning time has increased to 21 hours.\n- \u00b7 There are also more opportunities for employees to develop and grow in an inclusive workplace that promotes agile organization, internal talent mobility, and specific development focus for different genders and generations. 91% of China employees are now users of the Open Talent Market platform which enables them to search for internal jobs, projects, and mentorship opportunities proactively and freely; 200+ project engagements and 300+ mentorship pairings have been achieved.\n- \u00b7 Well-being remains a priority to support the continual enhancement of the employee experience. In collaboration with the union, a new Employee Assistance Program was launched in 2022 with 24/7 online counseling via phone, laptop or mobile to help employees address work and non-work issues such as stress management, interpersonal and family problems. Furthermore, a flexible benefit platform has been introduced which integrates all employee benefits from both company and union, allowing employees to make certain personalized choices based on their own situations.\n\n## Social dialogue in India\n\nSchneider Electric India has a strong culture of social dialogue with all employees, both unionized and non-unionized. Schneider Electric India continues to engage in equitable industrial relations across its plants and associated establishments.\n\nIndustrial harmony has been achieved through a time-tested collective bargaining process involving unions or through worker representative committees. In some of the plants where there are no recognized unions, this bargaining process is conducted with elected employees on committees such as Welfare (Works Committee). The Company also has strong engagement with other committees such as Health & Safety, Canteen, Sports and Transport, including a special committee for women employees. In addition, a prevention of sexual harassment committee, which is fully compliant with the prevention of sexual harassment governance as per local laws, comprises employees and external women with specialist knowledge of the subject and with legal backgrounds. These committees provide a platform for employees to present their concerns, collective grievances and workplacerelated issues to the management. All employee engagement programs are run through these committees with the active participation of every employee.\n\nThe process of social dialogue also includes monthly employee communication at plant level, as well as through Quarterly Town Hall communications on company performance, strategy and challenges.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

These objectives have always taken into account all dimensions of responsibility - environmental, social, territorial, and governance - encompassing all the Group's stakeholders on a global scale.\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric was recognized by Corporate Knights as the World's Most Sustainable Corporation out of 5,000 companies surveyed. This accolade, together with the success of the Schneider Sustainability Impact, further inspired the Group to do even more and to think about the world of tomorrow by developing forecasted scenarios, both in the environmental and climate fields - without forgetting the social and territorial dimensions. If the transition is not inclusive and fair, it will not allow people in underserved communities to build their future and create their own businesses. The planet has to be saved, and that also means saving its inhabitants.\n\nFour main action priorities have been defined within the Corporate Citizenship Department. The first is to ensure that the Group's business partners respect all human rights for everyone, everywhere, at all times and in all situations, from decent work standards to the creation of a social label for the Group's products. In 2022, a new version of the Human Rights Group Policy was\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npublished in order to embark on eight new challenges such as respect and dignity, Human Rights in cyberspace, conflict minerals, intergenerational solidarity, Human Rights activities within the Group's value chain, migrant workers, civic space and Human Rights defenders, and access to healthy environment.\n\nThe second priority is to ensure that everyone is supported in building their futures, regardless of their generation: young people as well as seniors. Schneider has always played an active role in the economic development of the communities in which it has a presence, in order to have an impact and to accelerate the just transition. In 2022, a new program called Future Ready defined the Group's roadmap for the coming years.\n\nYouth is also the focus of the third major priority. There have never been so many young people on the planet, but many have no access to education Yet it is young people who drive innovation.The Company has a role to play in supporting them.\n\nThe fourth priority is to make citizenship a collective commitment to co-construct the future in a dynamic way by learning and sharing across many different initiatives.\n\n'2022 was another year of crisis leading to growing inequalities, but also a year of progress and stronger commitments to go further along the road to the just transition in favor of youth, human rights, respect and dignity. We strongly believe that we have an invaluable asset: young people. There has never been a generation this vast and receptive. They really are the main drivers and players.'\n\nGilles Vermot Desroches, Senior Vice President Corporate Citizenship & Institutional Affairs",

        "page_content": "## 2.6 Delivering social impact for a just transition\n\n## 2.6.1 Improving lives through access to green electricity\n\n## 2.6.1.1 Context\n\nToday (1) , more than two billion people have little or no access to electricity.\n\nIn 2020 (2) , 733 million people had no electricity. Although notable progress has been made in recent years, in the words of SEforAll (3) , 'electricity access is growing, but not for everyone'.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, colossal additional efforts are required to achieve universal access:\n\n- \u00b7 Today, around 570 million people in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to electricity. That is close to one in two people in the region.\n- \u00b7 The pace of electrification is not sufficient relative to population growth, and the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed progress even further.\n- \u00b7 Therefore, in 2030, still close to 570 million people would remain without electricity in sub-Saharan Africa. That would be 85% of the unelectrified world population.\n\nAsia-Pacific is approaching universal electrification, thanks to ambitious government programs. Nevertheless, the grid can be unreliable or insufficient for productive use in remote areas where it must be supplemented with renewable energy solutions.\n\nAccess to green electricity offers a chance to live a better life, because it can have a positive multiplier effect on all socioeconomic dimensions of the individual or community: livelihood, health, education, security, and empowerment of women, while fighting against climate change by replacing fossil solutions.\n\n## 2.6.1.2 Group Policy\n\nAccess to Energy's purpose is to bring green and reliable electricity to populations in emerging markets, both as a fundamental right and a means for social and economic development, by providing a safe, affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy offer. At Schneider, we call this Electricity for Life and Electricity for Livelihood.\n\n## 2.6.1.3 Action & Impact\n\nSchneider's ambition is to bring green and reliable electricity to 50 million people by 2025, and 100 million people by 2030, cumulatively since the start of the program in 2009.\n\n- (1) Source: Off-Grid Solar Market Trends Report 2020, World Bank\n- (2) Source: Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report, produced by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n- (3) Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) is an international organization that works in partnership with the United Nations and leaders in government, the private sector, financial institutions, civil society, and philanthropies to drive faster action towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) - access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030 - in line with the Paris Agreement on climate.\n\nElectricity for Life means providing access to green electricity to off-grid populations and refugees. These communities need energy as a fundamental right to meet essential needs in homes (such as lighting, communication and education).\n\nElectricity for Livelihood means providing access to green electricity to people connected to an unreliable grid and in order to enable productive businesses. These communities need quality energy with solar backup equipment as a driver of economic development and poverty reduction. For example, electricity can make a real difference to the lives of farmers and ensure food security through irrigation, food storage, and processing, and by connecting farmers to markets to ensure better prices, while allowing people to be the agents of their own transformation.\n\nThe Access to Energy social business works in synergy with the Schneider Training & Entrepreneurship program and the Impact investment funds, in a virtuous circle of providing products and solutions, capacity building and support to startups.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The rising importance of SII forces companies to think of new ways to support social businesses. Hence many are building partnerships with local and international actors to drive and nurture innovative and responsible initiatives.\n\n## 2.6.2.2  Group Impact Investing policy\n\nThe ambition of Schneider Electric's Impact Investing practice is to contribute to a transition towards a fairer and more inclusive society. Supported by its strong and deep knowledge of the energy ecosystem, Schneider Electric focuses its Impact Investing mission on funding and supporting high social and environmental impact initiatives, which are contributing to a better future and positively impacting climate and resources.\n\nThe goal is to generate high social impact while protecting the assets under management. Accordingly, Schneider Electric has adopted strict management rules, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Always investing in partnerships with recognized players;\n- \u00b7 Never taking a majority stake;\n- \u00b7 Always providing efficient company support (such as helping develop a business plan or provide technical advice) to deliver the optimum social impact while minimizing risk;\n- \u00b7 Ensuring alignment with the Schneider Electric ecosystem; and\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that ethical business practices and rules are implemented and respected.\n\n## 2.6.2.3 Governance\n\nEach investment vehicle has its own governance structure generally composed of at least two bodies:\n\n- \u00b7 The first one is a Board of Directors or a Supervisory Board which is in charge of ensuring compliance with all legal and ethical regulations. In most cases investors are represented on this board.\n- \u00b7 The second one is a Management Investment Committee which can either be totally independent or composed of investors, according to the legal structure. All Management Investment Committee members bring specific competencies and knowledge to assess investment decisions. In some cases, they can also rely on external experts. They are responsible for ensuring compliance with investment policies and are regularly updated on investment performance, both in terms of impact and finance.\n\n## 2009\n\n## 2011\n\n## 2015\n\n## 2017\n\n## 2020\n\n## 2021\n\nLaunch of Schneider Electric Energy Access (SEEA)\n\nInvestment in Livelihoods Carbon Fund #1\n\nLaunch of Energy Access Venture (EAV)\n\nInvestment in Livelihoods Carbon Fund #2\n\nLaunch of Schneider Electric Energy Access Asia (SEEAA)\n\nInvestment in Livelihoods Carbon Fund #3\n\n- \u00b7 In some cases, an investment vehicle can also rely on an Advisory Committee or Strategic Committee to help them setting up and managing their investment strategies and policies.\n\nAll investment vehicles are supervised by independent auditors.\n\n## 2.6.2.4  Actions and Impacts\n\nAs early as 2009, Schneider Electric was a pioneer in the Corporate Impact Investments space and launched its first investment vehicle, Schneider Electric Energy Access (SEEA). Since then, the company has never stopped innovating. In total, it has initiated or participated in four vehicles targeted at:\n\n- 1. Contributing to an inclusive economy with Schneider Electric Energy Access (SEEA)\n- 2. Bringing access to green energy and contributing to Net Zero in South and South-East Asia with Schneider Electric Energy Access Asia (SEEAA)\n- 3. Enabling green energy access in Africa with E3 Capital impact fund (formerly EAV)\n- 4. Contributing to global decarbonization with the Livelihoods Carbon Funds\n\nRegardless of geographies or the type of investment vehicle, all these Impact Investing activities aim to catalyze and facilitate multiple coalitions with different stakeholders (Schneider Electric Foundation, employees, DFIs, NGOs, social businesses, impact investors, asset management companies) to leverage Schneider Electric competencies towards a fair and inclusive transition.\n\n## 1. Contributing to an inclusive economy with Schneider Electric Energy Access (SEEA)\n\nSEEA is an Impact Investing structure in the form of a variablecapital SAS (simplified joint-stock company), certified as a social and solidarity investment company (ESUS certification) and open to French employee savings through the Group's Employee Savings Plan ( Schneider Energie Solidaire Fund ).\n\nSEEA contributes to an inclusive economy for the benefit of the most vulnerable people and communities worldwide. SEEA brings together different stakeholders by inviting Schneider Electric's employees and business partners around the world to play an active role in this commitment. At the end of August 2022, 6,487 (past or present) Group employees in France had invested EUR 43.2 million in the Schneider Energie SICAV Solidair e fund.\n\nSince 2009, SEEA has invested in 25 companies and exited from ten. In 2022, SEEA invested in three new companies (Kajou, Enogrid, GoParity), re-invested in two companies (Dor\u00e9mi and Okra Solar) and exited from two (SunFunder, Fonci\u00e8re Ch\u00eanelet).",

Bringing access to green energy in Asia with Schneider Electric Energy Access Asia (SEEAA)\n\nIn recent years, electrification rates in Asia have improved due to strong government policies supporting national electrification. As Asian countries are now approaching universal access to electricity, the focus is shifting to integrating renewable energy into the energy mix. However, at the micro level, there are still a considerable number of rural areas without access to electricity. Even when access is available, electricity is often not reliable as power grids struggle with load and connectivity issues.\n\nSchneider Electric envisioned the SEEAA impact investing vehicle in 2018 to help the region tackle these challenges and advance towards SDG 7 'Affordable and Clean Energy'. Three other investors joined forces with Schneider: the European Development Finance Institution Management Company (EDFI MC), Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries (Norfund), and Amundi Finance et Solidarit\u00e9 (Amundi), committing a total of EUR 20.9 million.\n\nSEEAA, through its dedicated Schneider management team based in Singapore, invests primarily in equity in start-ups that work toward increasing quality of life and boosting economic development in Asia, thanks to access to affordable, clean, and sustainable energy. As of December 2022, SEEAA had invested in seven start-up companies, Freyr Energy, Xurya, Frontier Markets, Oorja Development Solutions, ATEC, Carbon Masters and SMV, for a total of EUR 4.5million, contributing to both of the SEEAA's goals:\n\n## Goal to increase access to affordable and reliable energy.\n\nThis goal primarily targets unprivileged communities where last mile energy access is either not available or unreliable. SEEAA aims to create social impact for these rural communities. For example, this can be achieved through companies that provide access to energy for productive and income-generating purposes, like Oorja Development Solutions.\n\nOorja provides clean energy agri-services such as reliable irrigation, agro-processing and cold-storage, powered by solar, and is cheaper than the diesel options. The services are offered on a pay-per-use basis, which make them affordable to the small and marginal farmers targeted in remote weak-grid areas of Northern India.\n\nAs well as having a positive impact on CO 2 emissions, Oorja helps farmers increase income and reduce food waste. The company also creates jobs by hiring operators to run the solar systems.\n\nSome key impact figures for Oorja, as of September 2022 and cumulative since the company inception:\n\n- \u00b7 880 tons CO 2 equivalent saved\n- \u00b7 12,750 direct and indirect users\n- \u00b7 + 30 jobs created in last-mile rural communities\n- \u00b7 28.5 tons of food waste saved\n- \u00b7 57% increase in user's agricultural income in a year\n\nIndia: a farmer irrigates his crop using water from a solar-powered pump operated by Oorja in Bahraich district, Uttar Pradesh. \u00a9 Oorja Development Solutions India Private Limited.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Goal to accelerate transition towards renewable energy and net zero.\n\nEnabling the transition of economies to clean renewable energy sources and supporting solutions that reduce CO 2 emissions can be achieved by investing in companies like Xurya which are developing renewable energy assets such as solar or biogas.\n\nXurya is a clean energy services company that provides solar installation services for clients via process management from installing and monitoring to maintenance and billing.

Contributing to global decarbonization with the Livelihoods Funds\n\nSchneider Electric is a founding member of the Livelihoods Carbon Fund. The first sustainable carbon fund with high social impact, was created in 2011 and is managed by an independent team based in Paris.\n\nSchneider Electric invested EUR 35 million in Livelihoods Carbon Funds #1, #2 and #3.\n\nA total of EUR 290 million, invested by private companies and financial investors, is dedicated to investing in high potential carbon offset projects to generate positive impact for people and the planet.\n\nProjects supported by Livelihoods Carbon Fund #1 (2011) have already impacted 1 million people and avoided or sequestered over three million tons of CO 2 . Carbon Fund #2 (2017) aims to benefit 2 million people and to avoid or sequester 12 million tons of CO 2 over 20 years while Carbon Fund #3 (2021) objectives are to benefit another 2 million people and to avoid or sequester 30 million tons of CO 2 over 20 years.\n\nThe Livelihoods Funds support three types of projects: reforestation, agroforestry, and agricultural practices and rural energy.\n\nThe Livelihoods Carbon Funds #1 and #2 have contributed to three mangrove reforestation projects in Senegal, India, and Indonesia. These projects have enabled local communities to improve their living conditions by restoring the ecosystem and encouraging lifeforms such as fish and crabs.\n\nLivelihoods Agroforestry projects enable farming communities to increase their revenues thanks to improved conditions for cash crops such as coffee or cocoa and the planting of fruit trees such as mangoes. In addition, the Livelihoods Funds contribute to the creation of new downstream activities such as food processing and commercialization.\n\nRural energy projects play an important role in improving women's lives and create jobs through the construction and distribution of cookstoves.\n\nAll these projects are an integral part of Schneider Electric's Carbon Pledge: the carbon credits generated are used to offset carbon emissions. For example, part of these carbon credits is used to offset all the carbon emissions generated by the Schneider Electric Paris Marathon; the race is carbon-neutral since 2019.\n\nAs of December 2022, the total carbon credits accumulated since 2011 was 426,548 tons, of which 100,546 tons have been used to offset Schneider Electric's Paris Marathon carbon emissions.",

        "page_content": "## 2.6.3  The Schneider Electric Foundation\n\n## 2.6.3.1  Context and goals\n\nToday's younger generation is the first generation to feel the direct impact of climate change and certainly the last generation capable of doing anything about it.\n\nBeyond simply being aware, younger generations are already heavily involved in climate and social transition initiatives led by civil society, for example through climate marches and citizen movements emerging all over the planet, but also through their career choices, volunteering, involvement in NGOs and more.\n\nConnected to each other like never before, young people today want to contribute to the resilience of their communities, by putting forward innovative solutions, stimulating social progress and inspiring new political movements. They are also agents of change, taking action to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and thereby improve people's lives and the health of the planet.\n\n## 2.6.3.2 Group policy\n\nTo successfully secure a sustainable future for humanity, younger generations express the same need for guidance, training and recognition. At the Schneider Electric Foundation, under the aegis of Fondation de France, our goal is to support these young people and empower them to get involved and innovate, so that they can take their rightful place in the world of tomorrow being built before our eyes today. We go about fulfilling this objective each and every day, all over the world, through concrete initiatives and programs.\n\nThe Group's first philanthropy policy was published in 2022, with full implementation planned for 2023. Its objective is to define Schneider Electric's position on philanthropy, its priorities and its principles of action, in line with the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It will provide a coherent and consistent framework enabling Schneider Electric entities and employees to contribute and act.\n\nIn 2022, more than 170 projects were active, supporting 69,393 young people through 13,112 days of volunteering. With an annual budget of EUR 4 million, the Schneider Electric Foundation contributes to partnerships that are made possible by more than EUR 17.5 million support from Schneider Electric's entities. Group employees are also involved in these partnerships. In total, more than EUR 23.5 million has been invested to help local communities worldwide.\n\n## 2.6.3.3 Governance\n\nFondation de France is a non-profit organization that, since its creation in 1969, has been the bridge between donors, founders, and field structures in order to support projects in a range of general interest areas. It supports other foundations (945 in 2022) whose operations are governed separately, but who are legally part of Fondation de France . It is responsible for ensuring that their actions comply with its by-laws and the legal framework of the sponsorship. The Schneider Electric Foundation's Executive Committee determines the major focuses of its actions and the projects it supports. It then informs Fondation de France of its decisions, and the latter verifies the projects' compliance and implements them.\n\nSince 2019, the composition of the Schneider Electric Foundation's Executive Committee is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 10 Members: 5 from Schneider Electric (including The Chairman and 2 representatives of the employees) and 5 external experts.\n- \u00b7 1 observer from Fondation de France\n\nIts missions are the following :\n\n- \u00b7 Define the strategic directions of the Foundation;\n- \u00b7 Validate the activity report and financial report;\n- \u00b7 Decide on the allocation of budgets by program;\n- \u00b7 Validate commitments exceeding EUR 200,000.\n\nOne to two Executive Committee meetings are organized each year.\n\nThe members of the operational team are:\n\n- \u00b7 General Delegate;\n- \u00b7 Corporate Philanthropy Director;\n- \u00b7 Employee Engagement Leader;\n- \u00b7 Administrative and financial Assistant;\n- \u00b7 Mentorship Leader;\n- \u00b7 Social impact assessment Leader.\n\nLastly, the Foundation's Selection Committee is composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 General Delegate;\n- \u00b7 Corporate Philanthropy Director;\n- \u00b7 Program Director, Training & Entrepreneurship.\n\n## 2.6.3.4  Key actions driven by the Schneider Electric Foundation\n\nSchneider's global presence allows it to have a greater reach and impact on underserved communities. The Group believes in contributing through different initiatives such as the Schneider Electric Foundation programs and initiatives. Through charity and donations, teaching and lending its time, the Company will support local organizations and stimulate communities.\n\nIn fact, Schneider focuses on two key elements:\n\n- 1. Developing access to education and entrepreneurship for the youth with its Youth Education and Entrepreneurship Program deployed globally.\n- 2. Acting as a corporate citizen by supporting international causes with its Tomorrow Rising Fund, in 2022, it was dedicated to employees in Ukraine and their families.\n\n## 2.6.3.5 Youth Education and Entrepreneurship Program\n\n## Context and goals\n\nToday's young people are forward-thinking and creative. We need to empower them with the necessary skills and support to create a life aligned with their dreams and aspirations. Education, technological and social innovation and entrepreneurship are all essential ingredients to ensure that these initiatives are relevant and effective, that they have the biggest possible impact and are appropriate responses to the needs of beneficiaries.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Each zone has a defined ambition up to 2025 and a pipeline of projects that is reviewed under regular review. Corrective actions are implemented if necessary.\n\nThe program is led by zone representatives and in-country leaders that share ideas on a daily basis. A global coordinator sets regular meetings to support the zone representatives and guarantee the progress of the program in each zone.\n\nThe program is part of the Schneider Sustainability Impact. Every quarter, the zone representatives use a centralized tool to report on the impact of the program, and data is reviewed by an external auditor. With rare exceptions, all projects benefit from monitoring by employees of Schneider Electric entities operating in the countries concerned.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation has broken new ground in the measurement of social impact and aims to enable its partners to better fulfill their missions by identifying areas for improvement. The Foundation is assisted in particular by KiMSO, a social impact assessment consulting firm. A first study was conducted in 2018, as part of the fight against energy poverty, to draw up an innovative methodology to assess the social impact of missions. This methodology is placed at the disposal of project sponsors. For example, CLER, the Energy Transition Network, has used this methodology. In 2020-2021, the Foundation conducted an impact assessment study of its involvement in the COVID pandemic.\n\nMore recently, the Foundation conducted a study of employees' volunteering, working with the Goodwill company.\n\n## Actions\n\nThe program is divided into three main areas :\n\n- 1. Support access to qualitative jobs through vocational and entrepreneurship training in the energy field , key drivers of socio-economic and sustainable development across generations.\n- 2. Learn new skills for the future, technical and soft , giving younger generations the boost they need to succeed and build the world of tomorrow.\n- 3. Create the right ecosystem to spread entrepreneurial spirit and encourage innovation , enhancing younger generations to define their future and take part in social and environmental challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Train 1 million people in energy management\n\nThe Youth Education and Entrepreneurship program has supported the training of 397,864 people worldwide since 2009. More than 6,500 trainers and 5,500 entrepreneurs have also been supported. After COVID-19. we are committed to go further and faster by reaching a total of one million people trained by 2025, 10,000 entrepreneurs supported, and 10,000 trainers trained.\n\nIn June 2022, we celebrated 'Indonesia-France Partnership with Schneider Electric' in Jakarta. Since 2017, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research & Technology Indonesia (MoEC), Ministry of National Education of France (MENESR), SE Foundation and SE Indonesia, have created one Center of Excellence in Bandung and renovated 125 vocational high schools (SMK) in Indonesia. The partnership's focus is on electrical installation, industrial automation and renewable energy. More than 14,900 students and 1,300 trainers have been impacted.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 1. Support access to qualitative jobs through vocational training and entrepreneurship in the energy sector\n\nTraining in the energy field provides an inclusive answer to several challenges of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For more than 10 years the group has been supporting technical and vocational education and training (TVET). TVET plays two major roles regarding social and economic development. The first role is to provide training and career opportunities for people, in particular, those who are not in education, employment or training. Its second role is to build a generation of skilled manpower, which is required at all levels of the economies. Furthermore, TVET can also be a valuable tool for sustainable development, as it allows the development of environmentally sound skills, critical for shifting toward a more sustainable economic model. Schneider Electric's strategy, backed by its Foundation for training people in the energy sector, includes three key priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Basic training over a few months, which is free and accessible to many people and adapted as much as possible to the local situation. These training courses lead to the issuing of a certificate of competence by Schneider Electric;\n- \u00b7 Single or multi-year trainings leading to qualifications, in partnership with local Ministries of Education, or even under bilateral agreements;\n- \u00b7 The training of trainers to support the effective and quality roll-out of training down the line.\n\nSchneider Electric and its Foundation are developing digital training to complement the training offered in energy and automation. Theoretical courses but also practical courses will be created to deliver comprehensive training curricula, that can be followed online only or through blended learning (a mix of in-class and online training).\n\nThe Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program has a specific focus on supporting youth, refugees, women in vulnerable situation, and marginalized groups of people. The actions are always implemented in partnership with local players and/or national or international non-profit organizations (NGOs, governments, etc.) and with Schneider Electric's local subsidiary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. Learn new skills for the future\n\nSince 2022, the Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program supports the spread of the skills to unlock current and future opportunities for the youth.\n\nCurrent uncertainty and a fast-changing environment require every individual to be able to adapt. The future of work will look more flexible and encourage every individual to reinvent themselves during their professional career. The programs help build digital skills, relational and collective intelligence, and encourage the youth to become change makers and create a future aligned with their aspirations. The value of technological competence cannot be underestimated but is not the only goal in equipping the youth with skills for life, employment, and entrepreneurship. We believe in integrating both formal and non-formal education to provide a flexible and personalized learning experience and ensure the youth can adapt to changing and diverse circumstances, identify opportunities for growth and innovation.\n\nThe projects deliver support to young people over a period of 3 months minimum.\n\n## Conserve My Planet program India\n\nThe objective of the Conserve My Planet program is to embed sustainability into communities where there are both energy and environmental challenges, by educating young people on energy conservation. Conserve My Planet (CMP) is a participative educational green initiative created by Schneider Electric India Foundation for students of class 5th Standard-7th standard (10-14 years). The whole program follows the activity-based learning model. We teach them about Energy Efficiency, Recycling Concepts, Reduction in E- waste, Water conservation, Plantation etc. They are taught the preliminary concepts of Energy Audits etc. It is also a fun program where children are given the role of Green Cops and Green Detectives and by the end of the program are termed as 'Green Ambassadors'. In 2022, CMP program was introduced into 50 schools across 5 metro cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai) of India in collaboration with SHARP NGO, impacting 6,000 students.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Create the right ecosystem to spread entrepreneurial spirit and encourage innovation\n\nThe Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program, with a wide range of partners is designed to engender a sense of creativity, innovation and risk taking among young people. Innovation and creativity can help young people become resources in co-creating solutions for the social and energy transition. They can inspire policy making and help solve problems adapted to the local context.\n\nPrograms are specifically designed to inspire young people, delivering soft and technical skills, mentoring young people and supporting their network development, to help them create their own project from conception to completion. This builds creative and innovative thinking and the ability to turn challenges into opportunities. They can choose to become effective entrepreneurs or to continue with another activity. We encourage them to work in groups and participate in collective thinking.\n\nThe projects deliver support to young people over a period of 3 months minimum.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation also supports emblematic and international programs by making available its knowledge of energy systems management, through donations in resources and/or knowledge, to encourage innovation for the energy transition. It has made a four-year commitment to the Solar Impulse Foundation, which selects 1,000 solutions that contribute to the achievement of at least five SDGs:\n\n- \u00b7 Clean, Accessible Water for All (SDG 6);\n- \u00b7 Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7);\n- \u00b7 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9);\n- \u00b7 Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11); and\n- \u00b7 Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12).\n\nThe selected solutions must meet the following criteria: technical feasibility, environmental benefits, and economic viability. Schneider Electric employees are mobilizing their skills to analyze the various solutions within their field of expertise.\n\nThe Solar Sound System project by Atelier 21, a Foundation partner, has been granted two Solar Impulse Efficient labels:\n\n- \u00b7 Solar sound systems for events powered by renewable energies (solar or bike-powered). With seven systems in place in France and Switzerland, Solar Sound System has set up solidarity projects in Haiti, Brazil, India, Taiwan, and Cameroon and has projects in Reunion, the United States, and South Africa.\n- \u00b7 Regenbox, the first do-it-yourself 'non-rechargeable' alkaline battery charger. Regenbox aims to be ecological and antiplanned obsolescence. This project is also an educational tool and a means of raising awareness about a different use of batteries in order to reduce the amount of electronic waste so present in our daily lives.\n- \u00b7 Bertrand Piccard, Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, is promoting this portfolio of solutions to corporate and political leaders worldwide. At the end of 2021, 1,000+ solutions had already been granted the Solar Impulse Efficient Solution label. These included insulating blocks made from hempcrete, wind turbine floats, and a web-based pallet exchange platform.\n\nIn 2022, with the support of the Schneider Electric Foundation an exhibition of the solutions was organized in the Schneider Electric premises in Grenoble, known as Intencity, this exhibition was attended by more than 2,000 visitors.\n\n## Impacts of the Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program\n\n## The involvement of women in the energy sector\n\nSince the beginning of the Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program, female participation in energy training has remained low. Indeed, the energy sector is still a male dominated environment, and young women are sometimes discouraged by social norms and even by their family to venture down this path. For Schneider Electric and its Foundation, it is essential to include women in all stages of the energy value chain. Most programs today only include women in non-technical and non-essential activities, such as selling solar products.",

It was something new in my life, but I always say it was one of the best experiences I've ever had - I fell in love with electric!'\n\nVitoria Eliziario - 17 years old - former student at AFESU\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince 2021, Schneider Electric Brazil, the Schneider Electric Foundation and the Non-Governmental Organisation, associacao feminina de estudos sociais e universitarios (AFESU), come together to improve the equipment required for technical training in industrial automation and spread the know-how in AFESU training centre.\n\n## Promoting self-employment initiatives in the energy sector\n\nEmployment markets in emerging economies are characterized by high proportions of informal sectors, underemployment and people holding multiple jobs to make ends meet. In addition to specific skills training, entrepreneurs need business startup support and access to funding, both being key factors in the creation of long-lasting businesses. The Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program is providing informal entrepreneurs and those trained in the electricity sector with support in setting up their own businesses.\n\nSince 2017, 52 technical laboratories in electricity and energy management have been upgraded in Pakistan's Punjab province, 7,129 youths have been trained and 2,331 have become entrepreneurs.\n\nThis project was financed by Schneider Electric and implemented in Pakistan by Muslim Hands Pakistan (as the lead agency) in partnership with the Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (TEVTA) Punjab, and Punjab Vocational Training Council (PVTC), to improve and expand vocational training in Pakistan's dynamic energy sector. Due to the floods in 2022, Muslim Hands, Schneider Electric Pakistan and the Schneider Electric Foundation have decided to join forces and provide 1,000 tool kits to the young qualifying graduates in the flood affected areas to ease their access to the employment by promoting self-employment initiatives.\n\n## Supporting trainers' skills development in the energy sector\n\nThe international community has pledged to provide quality education for all by 2030. School leaders and trainers play a key role in delivering quality education. The key challenge for trainers in the energy sector is to provide young people with the knowledge and skills to be able to carry out a trade in a safe and responsible way, providing them and their families with economic self-sufficiency.\n\nThe Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program provides valuable support to trainers involved in projects at its partners' training centers. The aim is to help trainers thoroughly grasp the training approach and materials, enabling them to efficiently convey full and relevant knowledge to the students in short and long-term courses. The program also supports the trainers in upgrading training curricula and adding new modules relevant to the market needs. We actively work to develop our trainer instruction program by opening more and more centers dedicated to this type of training. Training of trainers ensures effective long-term transmission of quality, up-to-date knowledge. Training of trainers is supported by the VolunteerIn association via missions at the partners training centers: IEEM, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India (Institute of Electricity and Energy Management) was established in collaboration with the Karnataka Government, Schneider Electric Foundation, Schneider Electric India and the French Ministry of Education in January 2014.\n\nAt IEEM, trainers and teachers from Industrial Training Institutes and Schneider Electric India Foundation's partnered training centers, get trained in an intensive and comprehensive 24 days training program. They are trained in the latest technologies and practices in a field of electricity such as safety and security, domestic distribution and installations, industrial distribution and installations, energy quality, renewable energies and energy management. More than 1,480 trainers have been trained since the beginning.\n\n## Develop volunteering and mentorship as a key contribution to the success of youth projects and initiatives\n\nIn December 2022, a new mentoring partnership was launched allowing employees to take extended volunteer leave to become youth mentors through the Raise Foundation. These employees will be able to take more than double their usual volunteer leave allocation of 21 hours per year to meet the requirements of the program and best support their young mentees.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "One to two Executive Board meetings are organized each year.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation draws on a network of around 85 delegates, covering 80 countries. Their role is to select local partners in the fields of vocational training in the energy sector, and to support entrepreneurship, sustainability awareness and volunteering initiatives, particularly mentorship. The delegates inform employees about their entity's activities, and also about the Foundation. Each proposed project is subject to a review process based on administrative and financial data by the Schneider Electric Foundation and by Fondation de France before funds are released. Following a project's launch, progress and reporting is monitored by the delegates.\n\nThe delegates manage a digital platform known as VolunteerIn, that brings together all the missions proposed by the Foundation locally and internationally. Available in 34 languages, the platform can be accessed from anywhere in the world and enables employees to apply for volunteer assignments for the benefit of the Foundation's partners and their beneficiaries.\n\nFinally, the delegates co-ordinate the organization of the Schneider Electric Foundation's campaigns for international mobilization. During 2022, these included the Tomorrow Rising fund and the Giving Tuesday dedicated for Mentoring scheme as well as the International Volunteer Day which focused on mentoring and will continue for the next two years. These campaigns showcase local initiatives to a global audience. Delegates also participate in campaigns following natural or other disasters. For example, in 2022 employees responded enthusiastically to the launch of the Tomorrow Rising Ukraine campaign. In 2023, an assignment campaign will be conducted to renew the Foundation delegates' mandates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.6.3.5 Tomorrow Rising Ukraine: an incredible spirit of solidarity\n\n## Context and Goals\n\nThe war in Ukraine has had profound humanitarian, geopolitical and economic ramifications for Europe and the world. In addition to disrupting global food and energy supplies, the conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives. It has devastated critical civilian infrastructure and has displaced more than 13 million people.\n\n## Actions and Impacts\n\nSchneider Electric employees have always demonstrated an incredible spirit of solidarity in the face of crisis. Through the Tomorrow Rising Campaign Schneider Electric employees have donated over EUR 500,000 matched by Schneider Electric which decided to add EUR 1 million to the fund. Schneider Electric Foundation also donated EUR 400,000.\n\nA special steering committee is being established to take charge of organizing the appropriate release of funds to support Ukrainian colleagues and families, based on their needs. The actions of our employees from around the world are already contributing by providing material donations, hosting families and children, or supporting refugees and NGOs' missions.\n\nThe budget has been leveraged to provide more than 500 individuals (Schneider Electric Ukraine employees, agency workers and their families) with hardship allowance, settlement allowance, housing support, psychological support, foreign language lessons, and legal support over more than six months.\n\nThe project supported the following NGO initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 SOS Children village\n- - Providing complex and long-term care for over 150 Ukrainian children and caregivers who were welcomed in SOS Children's Villages in Poland, Romania and Lithuania, and also revamping electrical installations\n- \u00b7 SOS Attitude\n- - Providing support to set up a refugee camp in Moldavia with tents and electrical equipment, and distributing food and water\n- \u00b7 Global Compact Ukraine\n- - Providing on-line psychological support\n\n## 2.6.4 Schneider Electric Sister Foundations\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation operates in 100 countries across all continents. Its impact is reinforced in some regions through the activities of sister foundations in North America, India and Australia.\n\n## 2.6.4.1 North America\n\nThe Schneider Electric North America Foundation provides monetary support, products, expertise, and volunteers to non-profit organizations that align with business priorities, values and geographies.

In addition, 140 entrepreneurs started their journeys in the energy profession through SEIF's skill development program, which is spread across 27 states in India.\n\n## Clean to sustainable livelihood project\n\n2,400 indigenous farmer families were supported to ease access to reliable irrigation through solar powered pumps and grow two or three crops in a year under the 'Clean Energy for Sustainable Livelihood' project. This took place in the very remote villages of Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. The project impacted the community by doubling the annual income of women smallholders and farmers, and ensured food and nutrition security.\n\n## Conserve my planet project\n\nTo build responsible communities which are sensitive towards conserving energy and environment, we are training 6,045 school children, the future leaders of tomorrow, across five metro cities under the Conserve My Planet Program. Additionally, SEIF will provide scholarships to 55 meritorious engineering and diploma graduates from underprivileged backgrounds by the end of the year.\n\n## Planting trees project\n\nMore than 150,000 trees have been planted in order to help save the environment and increase Carbon Sequestration.\n\nSEIF encourages in-house employees to participate in all the above initiatives, and during 2022 more than 450 volunteers contributed to 500 volunteering days. Approximately 300 Schneider Employees shared their knowledge with underprivileged young people training to be electricians by taking part in guest lectures delivered under the Teacher's Mission Initiative.\n\n## 2.6.4.3 Australia\n\nIn 2022, Schneider Electric Pacific Fund contributed AU$385,000 to major Australian charity partners - Live and Learn, Australian Wildlife Conservancy, Kokoda Track Foundation, Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Centre for Appropriate Technology. In New Zealand, NZ$40,000 has supported Sustainable Coastlines and Te Pai Roa Tika. Through our Giving@SE program, a total of more than AU$100,000 was donated to charities thanks to individual employees and matched donations from Schneider Electric (up to AU$5,000/employee/year)\n\n## 2.6.5 Social Impact in France\n\n## 2.6.5.1 Empowering All generations through the Future Ready Program\n\n## Context and goals\n\nSchneider Electric has been actively engaged in social corporate responsibility for many years with activities ranging from local economic development to youth empowerment. Thanks to this strong foundation and with the goal of addressing new challenges, the Corporate Citizenship team created the Future Ready Program in 2022, to expand the Group's positive impact globally and accelerate a just transition.\n\nThere is a growing gap between the skills and competencies needed to drive the energy transition and those that our ecosystem (e.g., workforce, partners, suppliers, NGOs, customers, etc.) currently has. These skills, including knowledge in electricity and digital, are becoming increasingly essential for the transformation needed and can be hard to acquire. Part of this gap is due to many groups (particularly young adults) in situations of unemployment and/or with no access to education (for diverse reasons of social inequality). Investments are required to close this gap and give everyone the opportunity to take control of their professional future. The group's workforce, as well as our external communities must be supported, trained, and knowledgeable.\n\nThe Future Ready Program is dedicated to empowering all, regardless of their generation, to build their desirable future based on their individual aspirations by providing opportunities for everyone, everywhere.\n\n## Youth Empowerment in France\n\nToday's youth is the future, however, many of them are in situations of low education or unemployment and therefore have lower access to resources to build their skills. To support our conviction of empowering young adults especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, Schneider Electric is significantly involved in three major National French programs dedicated to young people facing concerns related to education, apprenticeship, network, or unemployment.",

        "page_content": "The 'paQte' and 'La France une chance, les Entreprises s'engagent' both sponsored by the French Government, and 'Le Collectif pour une \u00c9conomie plus Inclusive,' gathering 39 major French companies engaged. These companies are deploying collective actions concerning youth employment (particularly in 10 French areas), inclusive offers and procurement. The actions on youth employment are being led by Schneider Electric and Engie.\n\n15 years after having created it, Schneider Electric still strongly supports the NGO '100 Chances 100 Emplois (100 Opportunities 100 Jobs). This initiative (focused on coaching, mentoring, and networking) has already helped more than 9,000 young people make progress towards employment when they were previously facing difficulties and roadblocks, such as discrimination or/and a lack of network. '100 Chances 100 Emplois' is now engaged in an ambitious scale-up plan (launched in early 2022) aiming to provide its benefits to 6,500 young people (1,000 in 2022) in 100 areas (44 in 2022) to cover all French regions by 2026.\n\nSchneider Electric is also focusing on this mission of empowering young adults by offering more opportunities for professional integration to apprentices, interns, and doctoral students.\n\n## Senior Talent Program\n\nWithin this journey to further develop our talent and enable all to take control of their career path, the Senior Talent Program was launched in 2021 connecting the people and sustainability together. Throughout all stages in an employee's career, there is the potential and opportunity to continue growing one's skill set, so Schneider Electric wants to offer all employees the chance to learn and design their professional journey. Accompanying employees in the later stages of their career can accelerate the transfer of knowledge and skills across all generations, which is a great enabler to a just transition. To learn more about this program go to section 2.5.3 'Talent attraction and development' pages 211 to 217.\n\n## Contribution to local communities in France\n\nTo accompany employees in creating a future based on their individual aspirations, Schneider Initiatives Impact (which regroups Creation Pass, Solidarity Pass, and Competencies Pass) was created in France to offer three innovative pathways to support employees in designing their professional future. The Creation Pass (Schneider Initiatives Entrepreneurs) is an internal support system to help employees start their own business. Since 2010, 1,042 projects have been supported and 577 of them have resulted in the creation or takeover of a business. These businesses have created more than 699 jobs in France and range in sectors including electricians, organic trades, restaurants, consultants, asset managers, and tech start-ups. The second option is the Solidarity Pass which allows employees to experience a skill sponsorship for a certain period where they offer their skills, energy, and dedication to an NGO. There are approximately 38 assignments each year. Finally, there is the Competencies Pass where employees offer start-ups/SMEs their knowledge and skills to enable local economic development. There have been 11 assignments in the past 5 years. These final two options allow for a mutually enriching experience where employees share their competencies to the wider community and gain knowledge in a new area/working structure.\n\nSchneider Initiatives Impact's structure in France is totally connected and represented in local business networks such as Chambre de commerce et d'industrie, R\u00e9seaux Entreprendre, DIESE association made up of other major groups, local public stakeholders (Direction du Travail et de la Solidarit\u00e9, Pr\u00e9fecture\u2026) and local NGOs such as Emmaus Connect or La Cravate Solidaire.\n\nIn the next few years, the ambition is to continue offering these meaningful career opportunities to as many employees as possible, so the team is focused on expanding Schneider Initiatives Impact to other countries. In the first quarter of 2023, these programs will be deployed in Belgium and Germany.\n\n## 2.6.5.2 The Schneider Electric School\n\nIn 1929, Schneider Electric founded its own school - Paul-Louis Merlin - in Grenoble, to address the difficulty of recruiting skilled labor in the energy industry and help young people in precarious situations to access promising jobs. Today, it continues to focus on vocational training in Schneider Electric areas of expertise, with innovative training approaches and close alignment with actual industry practices.\n\nStudents leave with qualifications enabling them to continue in higher education or take employment in innovation-rich energysector fields such as renewable energies, home automation, and smart buildings, as well as energy management.\n\nIn 2019, to reinforce the link with the Group, the school changed its name to \u00c9cole Schneider Electric and new vocational training was added to support the creation of its CFA ( Centre de Formation d'Apprentis ).\n\nIn July 2021, to meet the ever-increasing need for skills in the energy and electrical sectors, and against the backdrop of increasing concern about the professional future of young people, the CFA took a new step forward and expanded its range of training courses both geographically and in terms of content by forging new partnerships. In addition to the current BTS 'Fluids Energies Home Automation' and the Licence professionnelle 'Connected Buildings and Intelligent Energy Management' courses, which are currently offered by the CFA, there are now:\n\n- \u00b7 The BTS CRSA (Design and Production of Automatic Systems) with the Vaucanson High School in Grenoble (France);\n- \u00b7 The vocational baccalaureate MELEC (Electrical Trades and Connected Environments) with the Lyc\u00e9e Pablo Neruda in Saint-Martin-d'H\u00e8res (France);\n- \u00b7 The BTS FED Home Automation and Communicating Buildings, extended to a new geographical area, with the Lyc\u00e9e Maximilien-Perret in Alfortville (France).\n\nIn 2022, the CFA has signed a new partnerhip to increase its footprint.in France.\n\n2022 was a successful year with 101 internships. Of these students, 92% graduated, 48% continued studies and 52% gained employment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Reporting coverage is provided together with indicators' tables.\n\nTiming for inclusion may differ between indicators. Typically financial or HR data are deployed more rapidly as acquired companies usually have existing systems and teams in place, which is not necessarily the case for environmental systems.\n\n## Progressive consolidation of new acquisitions into the Group CSR reporting\n\nAll majority-owned, financially consolidated, entities shall participate in all relevant Schneider Electric's SSI, SSE and other environmental, social and ethical programs and adopt the required policies and reporting practices as per each respective Trust Standard. Unless otherwise agreed with Schneider Electric's Sustainability team for practical or cost-effectiveness reasons, the following calendar shall be respected:\n\n- \u00b7 Year +1: strategic alignment and material KPIs selection\n- \u00b7 Year +2: data cleaning and baseline and target setting\n- \u00b7 Year +3: start of consolidated reporting into Group public reporting\n\nWhen an entity is not fully integrated into Schneider's IT systems, the consolidation of CSR data is done manually and may take longer than the standard calendar above. For those entities, if the cost of reporting is deemed unreasonable compared to the size of the company, the entity may ask to opt-out from CSR reporting. This may be granted on a case-by-case basis. However these entities still need to follow applicable Trust Standards.\n\nThe scope of environmental reporting is that of ISO 14001-certified sites, and certain non-certified sites on a voluntary basis and without interruption in time. All production and logistics sites with 50 or more FTE employees must obtain ISO 14001 certification before the end of the third full calendar year of operation or membership of the Group. Administrative, R&D and sales sites with 500 FTE employees or more also have to obtain ISO 14001 certification. Other sites may seek certification and/or report on a voluntary basis. A difference can be thus recorded with respect to the scope of financial consolidation.\n\nNotable exclusions in 2022 (apart from SSI #1 Schneider Impact revenues which is calculated on the same scope as the financial perimeter due to data availability) are presented in the table below. Details for data coverage are specified in tables page 274 for each topic and are generally well above 85%.",

This frame of reference includes the scope, collection and consolidation procedures and definitions for these indicators.\n\nThe Human Resources (HR), safety and environmental data come from our HR Analytics for the HR data, Resource Advisor for Environmental data and GlobES (Global Environment and Safety) for the safety data. Its consolidation is placed respectively under the Global Human Resources, the Global Environment and the Global Supply Chain functions. Data reliability checks are conducted at the time of consolidation (review of variations, inter-site comparison, etc.).\n\n## External Assurance\n\nOnce a year, an external auditor reviews the procedures in place and data accuracy in order to provide limited assurance on extra-financial information as required by Article R225-105-2 of French Commercial Code, notably the indicators of the Schneider Sustainability Impact, Schneider Sustainability Essentials and other Human Resources, Safety and Environmental indicators, (see independent verifier's report on page 270). This external assurance practice is in place at Schneider Electric since 2006.\n\nIn keeping with its commitment to continuous improvement, Schneider Electric asked the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit to conduct an additional review in order to obtain a 'reasonable' level of assurance for strategic indicators (Energy consumption, Scope 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions, Safety, Gender diversity - SSI #8).\n\n## 2.7.1.1  Indicators from the Schneider Sustainability Impact\n\n## SSI #1:  Grow Schneider Impact revenues to 80%\n\nSchneider Impact revenues are defined as offers that bring energy, climate, or resource efficiency to our customers, while not generating any significant harmful impact to the environment. Schneider Impact revenues are split into four categories described thereafter. Activities included are:\n\n- 1. Energy efficiency architectures bringing energy and/or resource efficiency to customers. Offers include building management systems, power management systems, lighting and room control, thermal control, variable speed drives, Sustainability Business (SB), and industry automation. Neutral technologies such as signaling, racks and enclosures, access control, or emergency lighting are excluded.\n- 2. Grid reinforcement and smart grid architectures contributing to electrification and decarbonization. This includes all technologies and architectures contributing to a New Electric World, helping grid and electrification come to life: smart grid and microgrid technologies, EV charging infrastructures, medium voltage systems to upgrade electricity distribution networks, low voltage connectable offers enabling smart grid management and energy efficiency, secure power and switches that enable security, and security of supply;\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 2.7  Methodology and audit of indicators\n\n- 3. Products with differentiating green performance, flagged thanks to our Green Premium program. Green Premium products offer environmental transparency (with digital life cycle analysis and circular end-of-life instructions), superior compliance to stringent environmental regulations, and differentiating environmental performance through specific environmental attributes (note: double-accounting with categories 1 or 2 is removed);\n- 4. Services that bring benefits for circularity (prolonged asset lifetime and uptime, optimized maintenance operations, repair, and refurbish) and energy efficiency (maintenance to maintain the operational performance of equipment and avoid a decrease of energy efficiency over time).\n\nAdditionally, revenues derived from activities with fossil sectors and others are systematically excluded, including Oil & Gas, coal mining, and fossil-power generation, in line with prevailing corporate responsibility reporting and sustainable finance practices, even though Schneider Electric's technologies deliver resource and carbon efficiency in such sectors as well. In line with Schneider Electric's strategy to phase out SF 6 from offers by 2025, SF 6 -containing switchgear for medium voltage applications are also excluded. In addition, neutral technologies such as signaling, racks and enclosures, access control, or emergency lighting are excluded.\n\nAll revenues consolidated in financial accounts are taken into account. Calculation is based on revenues per line of business. Exclusion of fossil revenues is based on orders per customers' end-segment, with extrapolation to estimate destination of transactional sales.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSI #2:  Deliver 800 million tonnes of saved and avoided CO 2 emissions to our customers\n\nThis indicator measures CO 2 savings and avoidances delivered by Schneider Electric offers to customers.\n\nCO 2 savings and avoidances are calculated for global sales of the reporting year and cumulated over the offers' lifetime. Net emissions are calculated as the difference between emissions with Schneider Electric's offer and emissions in the reference situation. The ambition for this indicator has been increased in 2021 with the definition of the new sustainability strategy: Schneider is committed to save and avoid 800 million metric tons of CO 2 thanks to EcoStruxure \u2122 for its customers.\n\nThe difference between 'saved' and 'avoided' emissions is key: saved CO 2 emissions correspond to brownfield sales that enable reduction of global CO 2 emissions compared to previous years, and avoided CO 2 emissions correspond to greenfield sales that enable a limitation of the increase of global emissions.\n\n- \u00b7 Brownfield sales correspond to the situation where the offer sold replaces or upgrades an existing system, leading to a change of GHG emissions of installed infrastructure versus the previous year. For 'saved' emissions, the 'brownfield reference situation' is defined as the situation before the new solution is sold and installed at the customer's site.\n- \u00b7 Greenfield sales correspond to the situation where the solution is installed into a new system, allowing a better performance with respect to the market alternative.\n\nThe calculation of CO 2 impact of offers over their lifetime is based on sales data per product range. The electricity emission factors are forward looking, integrating the decarbonization of the global energy mix as per scenario of the IEA. Market data and expert assumptions are used to determine the use-case scenario of offers and the associated CO 2 impact. This methodology is associated to typical uncertainties of CO 2 corporate accounting methodologies, and conservative assumptions are preferred.\n\nMore methodological details can be found in our website that has been made public in 2019.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSI #3:  Reduce CO 2 emissions from top 1,000 suppliers' operations by 50%\n\nUnder this program, also called Zero Carbon Project, the Group partners with 1,000 of its suppliers, who commit to reduce their company's CO 2 emissions (mandatory Scope 1 & 2; Scope 3 is optional) and not just on the proportion of sales to Schneider Electric. The active participation of upstream supply chain is critical because it represents multiple times GHG emission compared to Schneider Electric's own operations. The top 1,000 suppliers come from 64 categories across direct material, indirect material and project procurement and have been nominated by the respective procurement teams.\n\nTo ensure suppliers get adequate handholding during the implementation, several capacity building and engagement modules have been deployed. These initiatives sensitize the suppliers on various approaches and technical levers for decarbonization, including training on basic requirements and calculations. Moreover, Schneider attempts to support and drive collaborations with suppliers through services and EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions.\n\nAs a first step in the long-term journey to decarbonize, top 1,000 suppliers are required to quantify their carbon emissions and take ambitious reduction targets and deploy roadmap to achieve them. Suppliers are required to share the carbon emission performance via the dedicated Schneider Supplier Portal-Supplier Relationship Management (SSPSRM). To measure the carbon emission reduction achieved, we calculate the average carbon intensity reduction achieved by responding suppliers, multiplied by the percentage of suppliers reporting carbon emission data. Carbon intensity is calculated as Scope 1 & 2 CO 2 emission divided by financial turnover.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.",

        "page_content": "## SSI #4:  Increase green material content in our products to 50%\n\nA Green Material is defined as either of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 a material with a lower environment footprint;\n- \u00b7 a material that is the output of an industrial technology which is a key enabler for a 1.5\u00b0C climate scenario and/or a more circular economy.\n\nFor 2021, the scope of this KPI covers commodities identified as relevant in terms of volume (circa 29% of total products volume in 2019), environmental impact (carbon footprint and biodiversity assessment) and industry readiness, meaning:\n\n- \u00b7 Steel and aluminum direct purchases;\n- \u00b7 Thermoplastic direct and indirect purchases.\n\nOverall, the materials in scope represent approximatively 400,000 metric tons.\n\nCross-functional experts at Schneider Electric (Procurement, R&D, Environment) have worked in close relationship with suppliers to define the Green attributes for each commodity in scope, based on existing international schemes and standards.\n\nThermoplastics are qualified as 'Green' when the supplier is bringing evidence of a minimum recycled content, biobased content (minimum threshold depends on whether the compound is halogenated or not) or is using a green flame retardant.\n\nSteel is qualified as 'Green' when the supplier is bringing evidence that the mill of origin is an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) or has a Green certificate such as the ones delivered by Responsible Steel.\n\nAluminum is qualified as 'Green' when the supplier is bringing evidence that the product carbon footprint is below 8 tons of CO 2 per ton of Aluminum, is using a minimum of 90% of recycled content in its product or that the mill of origin has a Green certificate such as the ones delivered by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative.\n\nThe scope will be yearly reassessed as the program maturity and the transparency of supply chains improve.\n\nTo consolidate the KPI, several sources of data are used. The volumes of green materials are identified using Prism extract for metals and Puma extract for thermoplastic, both tools are providing budgeted volumes. The total volume in scope (the denominator of the KPI) is determined using RMI extracts for thermoplastic, steel and aluminum providing purchased volumes in metric tons. For silicon steel there is no consolidation in RMI since silicon steel is not a market index, thus the volume is estimated based on a negotiation file RCM. Schneider Electric decided to identify reported and tracked Green Materials using 'budgeted' volume since the precision of the reporting tool is better compared to RMI extract. Actually, Prism and Puma allowed to track suppliers and material grade that make the two levers mentioned above possible to activate.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSI #5:  100% of our primary and secondary packaging is free from single-use plastic and uses recycled cardboard\n\nThis program has been designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure legal compliance through the selection of our packaging materials and the availability of adequate take-back, collection and sustainable options for our customers.\n- \u00b7 Support the achievement of our 2025 Green packaging commitment:\n- -  100% of our primary and secondary packaging uses recycled cardboard.\n- -  100% of our primary and secondary packaging is free from single-use plastic.\n- -  Define the best practices to offer differentiating green packaging solutions to our customers.\n\nThe scope includes tier-one strategic suppliers with a direct purchase of cardboard and plastics in the Schneider Electric procurement system. Geographically, all regions under the global supply chain will be covered, as well as Equipment & Transformers.\n\nCardboard is considered as recycled when it includes at least 70% of recycled fiber by weight. Temporary exemption is made for NAM, where an average of 50% of recycled fiber by weight is required to be considered recycled.\n\nEvery reporting period, the spend on cardboard and plastics is extracted from the system and each element is classified as sustainable or none based on criteria mentioned above. Verification is done for sustainable declarations on the definitions already provided as well as certificates and other documentary evidence from suppliers. The list of eligible certificates/documents is continually updated to make it exhaustive and to cover countries specificities.\n\nA global campaign is being run in all global supply chain regions to progressively move the spend to sustainable sources and remove single use plastic usage with sponsorship from top management.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSI #6:  100% of our strategic suppliers provide decent work to their employees\n\nSchneider Electric has deployed a series of engagement on the topic of working conditions to correct mal practices, but also proactively work to implement measures which will prevent such violations in future. This philosophy is the foundation of the Decent Work program.\n\nTaking inspiration from the pioneering work of ILO, Schneider has defined 10 pillars of Decent Work :\n\n- 1. Employment opportunities;\n- 2. Adequate earnings and productive work;\n- 3. Decent working hours;\n- 4. Stability and security of work;\n- 5. Social dialogue and workplace relations;\n- 6. Fair treatment in employment;\n- 7. Safe work;\n- 8. Social protection;\n- 9. Purchasing practices; and\n- 10.

        "page_content": "## 2.7  Methodology and audit of indicators\n\nThe program requires strategic suppliers to develop a pro-active policy and provide a safe, attractive, inclusive workplace to their employees, and treat all workers as we treat our own workforce. Criteria defined for each Decent Work pillar may overlap with ISO26000 standard and are validated by Global Procurement, Human Resources, Supply Chain and Sustainability teams.\n\nThe suppliers will be assessed through remote questionnaires supported by relevant documentation as well as onsite visits, spot audits and their performance will be monitored by experts. All questions have a minimum acceptable answer defined. Suppliers responses will be evaluated against the minimum acceptable criteria to qualify as Decent Work compliant. Program deployment is ensured by Global Procurement Services to onboard, train and assess suppliers.\n\nThrough Decent Work standard setting and compliance, Schneider employment aims to enhance social integration, equity, security, dignity, satisfaction and overall improvement in the quality of life for the workers, and their family. For each Decent Work issue identified, the Global Procurement team will ask for corrective actions to be undertaken and supported by documentation. If the supplier effectively deploys corrective actions, it can be counted in the KPI calculation. Otherwise, it is still counted as non-compliant regarding the requirements of the program.\n\nA pilot for this indicator will be launched early 2022. As such, this KPI is excluded from the 2021 SSI score computation, and will be integrated in 2022.\n\nThe methodology for this indicator was reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSI #7:  Measure the level of confidence of our employees to report behaviors against our principles of Trust\n\nSpeak-Up helps to maintain high standards, a strong reputation, and a healthy and productive working environment, and protects Schneider Electric and its employees from multiple risks. Misconduct situations will be less likely to occur if people, employees and stakeholders feel safe to speak up about concerns, dilemmas or issues in good faith, respectfully and without fear of retaliation.\n\nOur Trust Charter and Ethics & Compliance program participate to transform this belief into practical actions, notably offering multiple fair, neutral and confidential reporting channels to our employees to make them feel confident to report an unethical conduct.\n\nIn order to assess this KPI, the question 'I can report an instance of unethical conduct without fear' is annually asked to all Schneider Electric employees included in the OneVoice survey scope. The percentage of 'Agree' and 'Strongly Agree' amongst the answers determines the level of confidence of Schneider Employees to report unethical conduct. Responses are anonymized and aggregated for compliance purposes.\n\nThis indicator was calculated for the first time in 2021 and reached an 81/100 performance. As such, this KPI is excluded from the 2021 SSI score computation, and will be integrated in 2022.\n\nThe methodology for this indicator was reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSI #8:  Increase gender diversity, from hiring (50%) to front-line managers (40%) and leadership teams (30%)\n\nSchneider Electric is strongly committed to building a diverse organization at every level, with a workforce that reflects the diverse markets in which we operate. This indicator measures female representation within Schneider, at the hiring, frontline manager, and leadership level.\n\nIt covers all new hires within the company, including both non direct variable costs (NDVC i.e. white-collar) and direct variable costs (DVC i.e. blue-collar) positions; managers who are in NDVC positions, at the junior and mid-management level and whose direct reports are individual contributors only; and all leaders in Senior Vice Presidents & Vice Presidents positions.\n\nThis is a composite indicator: the progress of each metric (new hires, frontline managers, leaders) is being evenly weighted (1/3) to calculate the achievement of this commitment.\n\nAt the end of each quarter:\n\n- \u00b7 Percentage of female new hires: Count number of new hires that are women divided by total new hires in the current year *100.\n- \u00b7 Percentage of female frontline managers: Count number of frontline managers that are women divided by total frontline manager population *100\n- \u00b7 Percentage of female leaders: Count of women leaders divided by count total leaders *100\n- \u00b7 Blended achievement percentage: Weighted 1/3, based on annual % progression from Base Year to total 5-year achievement.\n- -  50% new hires progression: Subtract current period % of women who are new hires from 2020 base line and divide by targeted 5-year progression target (9%).\n- -  40% frontline managers progression: Subtract current period % of women who are frontline managers from 2020 base line and divide by targeted 5-year progression target (15%).\n- -  30% leaders progression: Subtract current period % of women who are leaders from 2020 base line and divide by targeted 5-year progression target (6%).\n- -  Calculate blended progression achievement %: 1/3 of each KPI current period progression\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSI #9:  Provide access to green electricity to 50 million people\n\nSchneider aims to provide access to electricity from renewable sources to 50 million people, thanks to the products and solutions that are developed and/or commercialized under the Access to Energy (A2E) program, from 2009 to end-2025.\n\nGeographical scope are countries where the A2E program is operating, in APAC, Africa, Middle East, and South America.

In this case, the technologies sold by Schneider can go beyond the strict A2E references, but their value must be at least equal to the estimated price of the project's inverters.\n- \u00b7 Impact funds (SEEA, SEEA Asia and EAV): 100% of the impact of companies that contribute directly to the Schneider A2E mission of providing green and reliable electricity in Africa and in Asia are taken into account, as well as 50% of the impact of companies that contribute indirectly. To this result, we apply the percentage of participation of SE in the fund.\n\nAn exhaustive list of products and solutions considered with reference codes is available and maintained. Considered products and solutions are those already available at the end of 2020, and the forthcoming products and solutions providing access to electricity. Products and solutions that are out of scope: A2E products and solutions that are sold out of A2E countries; other A2E products and solutions, not directly providing access to electricity (e.g. MPPT, EcoStruxure \u2122 for Energy Access, batteries, etc.).\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The methodology and 2021 performance was audited, not values cumulated before 2021.\n\n## SSI #10:  Create 2x opportunities for the next generation\n\nThe purpose of this initiative is to ensure Schneider Electric has a sustainable talent strategy to develop a Next Generation (Next Gen) pipeline of talent through full-time, temporary, and self-paced opportunities. Our goal is to provide access to professional opportunities for young adults, educating them about sustainability and how Schneider Electric plays a part in this endeavor.\n\nTo achieve this ambition to double opportunities, the Group accounts for the various ways it interacts with talent considered to be part of the next generation pipeline, including Student Opportunities and Recent Graduate Hires:\n\n- \u00b7 Student opportunities are defined as the workforce on the cusp of entering the job market, engaged in a temporary relationship with Schneider Electric with a defined start and end date at the onset (i.e.: Intern, learning event about Schneider and sustainability).\n- \u00b7 Recent Graduate Hires are recent graduates or early career professionals hires from a formal education program whose relationship with Schneider has a defined start date but open-ended end date (i.e.: Contract type: open ended contract, fixed term contract).\n\nCalculations are based on actual external requisition positions filled in the Global Applicant Tracking System and opportunities tracked via connect Candidate Relationship Management.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSI #11:  Train 1 million people in energy management\n\nThe deployment of professional training programs in energy management enable people to acquire skills to pursue a career that offers them, as well as their families, the means for a decent standard of living. These courses must benefit to disadvantaged people. They are defined according to a local reference and justifiable by the partner who must be able to justify the BoP nature of the people trained, related to the defined local benchmark.\n\nIn partnership with local and international NGOs and local authorities, the Schneider Electric Foundation and the Company's local entities provide direct and indirect contributions to professional training centers. The objective is to help them improve the level of vocational training courses with diploma or certification in energy management. As a technical partner, Schneider Electric does not pay operating expenses.\n\nThe minimum duration of these courses is three months (or totaling 100 hours). Schneider's Contributions may be (cumulative possible):\n\n- \u00b7 funding of electrical and didactic equipment, donation of request equipment, first generation, for practical work;\n- \u00b7 knowledge transfer through trainer training, and support for future entrepreneur training.\n\nThe KPI score is calculated with the number of students enrolled in trainings courses, supported by Schneider Electric through partnership agreement (supporting documents (list of young people) required).'\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSI #+1:  100% of Country and Zone Presidents define 3 local commitments that impact their communities in line with our sustainability transformation\n\nSince its creation in 2005, the former Planet & Society barometer (now Schneider Sustainability Impact), has focused on measuring progress against key sustainability performance indicators at worldwide level.\n\nIn SSI 2021-2025 Schneider Electric introduces a new component to measure local impact because:\n\n- \u00b7 There is a high internal demand for local communication on progress, as well as to locally empower collaborators to contribute to our meaningful purpose;\n- \u00b7 Sustainability priorities are highly dependent on local context therefore it makes sense to not only deploy worldwide programs, but also local actions close to local context and needs.\n\nIn order to boost local impact towards communities close to Schneider Electric, Countries with at least 100 employees have set 3 commitments aligned with the Group's sustainability strategy, on different pillars: Climate, Resources, Trust, Equal, Generations and Local.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The assessment of this objective goes as follow: KPIs are validated by zone/ country presidents, and a local SSI lead is designated and communicated to the Sustainability Team. This local Lead is in charge of consolidating KPI performance on an annual basis.\n\nThis indicator was not audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers and is not included in the SSI score.\n\n## 2.7.1.2  Indicators from the Schneider Sustainability Essentials\n\n## SSE #1:  150 Zero-CO 2 sites\n\nA site achieves Zero CO 2 site status if it emits zero greenhouse gas emissions related to energy consumption and has in place Digital Energy Monitoring. Additionally, the site must have no SF 6 leaks. Exclusions for energy-related greenhouse gas emissions are considered for small sources (<3%) of a site's total energy where no feasible fossil-free solution exists today. Digital Energy Monitoring is defined as having energy data connected to a Schneider Electric solution (such as Power Monitoring Expert, EcoStruxure \u2122 Building Operation, Resource Advisor, etc.). For larger sites, this requires a significant proportion of the site's energy to be measured and monitored through real-time connected meters. For smaller sites, this requires energy invoices to be available in Schneider Electric's Resource Advisor solution. This indicator relates to all sites within the Group's full real estate footprint.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #2:  100% substitution with SF 6 -Free medium voltage technologies\n\nThis indicator measures the ability of Schneider Electric to offer to the market (i.e. SELL gate of our Offer Creation Process) industrialized SF 6 -Free solutions for all geographies.\n\nThe range considered for the calculation of this KPI are Primary & Secondary switchgears up to 40.5 kV, Indoor only:\n\n- A SF 6 free ranges ready in 2020: Vaccuum components, Premset, primary AIS with vaccum CB, HVL, Masterclad\u2026\n- B SF 6 ranges in 2020: RM6, FBX, Ringmaster, DVCAS, Flusarc, SM6, RN2C, GMA, GMAe GHA, WS, WSG, CGBS-0, CGBS-1, HVL-CC, Mcset, F400\n- C SF 6 free offers to be launched from 2021-2025: SM AirSeT, Air PacT, RM AirSeT, RingmasterX, GM AirSeT, HVLCCX, \u2026\n\nProducts above 40.5kV (WI, CBGS-2, Kite), Outdoor Equipment such as Pole mounted, Reclosers, Sectionalizers, Instrument transformers, as well as ranges manufactured by JVs and local offers adaptation are excluded.\n\nThe performance is measured as the percentage of the quantity of SF 6 free offer range available for order (A+C above) compared to the total quantity of the current ranges sold in the 2019 reference base (for both MV switchgears and components). The current range for 2019 reference base is defined as the sum of the current SF 6 and non-SF 6 (Air, Vaccum) ranges sold in quantities (A+B above).\n\nFor the calculation, as an example, 1 RMairSet =1 RM6.\n\nCalculation: KPI % = (A + C) / (A + B). Reference Base: total quantities by range sold in 2019.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #3:  90% of electricity sourced from renewables\n\nThis program measures the share of renewable electricity in Schneider Electric electricity supply, on the scope of environmental reporting (industrial sites >50 employees and tertiary sites >500 employees certified ISO 14001).\n\nFour different types of renewable sourcing are taken into account:\n\n- \u00b7 Renewable electricity produced onsite and consumed onsite;\n- \u00b7 Renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs);\n- \u00b7 Green tariffs; and\n- \u00b7 Renewable certificates (depending on the country: REC, iREC, GO, EAC, etc.).\n\nElectricity purchased with no specific renewable electricity claim is not taken into account, even if the electricity mix of the supplier includes a share of renewable power.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #4:  15% CO 2 efficiency in transportation\n\nTransport within Schneider Electric is a significant generator of CO 2 due to dependence on fossil-fuels. To achieve its net-zero target, the Group must engage with its transport providers on both efficiency opportunities as well as technical advancements in transport assets.\n\nThis KPI measures the Group progress against an annual 3% CO 2 emissions for its paid transportation footprint for each of the next 5 years, or 15% total reduction from 2020 to 2025. The scope of the program covers all shipments globally with all transportation providers and modes where the freight is paid by the Group. This equates to approximately two-thirds of the total freight CO 2 impact to the Group. The base calculation for CO 2 efficiency uses an activity-based method of weight multiplied by distance and by mode/equipment CO 2 factors. Progress is measured using CO 2 emissions per tonne shipped as unit.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #5:  15% energy efficiency in our sites\n\nThis program measures the normalized energy reduction of the Group's largest energy-consuming sites against a baseline. The objective is to reduce energy consumption by ~3% each year, for a total reduction of 15% over the whole duration of the company program (2021-2025) using Schneider Electric solutions and services. The program focuses on Schneider sites within the scope of environmental reporting that consume >3 GWh of total energy, along with other sites the Group considers strategic (213 sites in 2021).",

This normalization is based upon a site-specific linear regression model enabling climate and changes in production levels to be taken into account. All energy consumption that can be modelled is taken into account and converted into MWh.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #6:  80% of product revenues covered by Green Premium \u2122\n\nSchneider Electric provides environmentally conscious products to customers that support their sustainability goals and ambitions. The 2025 target is a transformation of the existing program, for products focused on green materials, low CO 2 , circularity and digitization of data.\n\nGreen Premium products provide detailed information on their regulatory compliance, material content, environmental impact and circularity attributes. They deliver market driven value propositions through third-party labels, such a Green Building and product certifications, that support our customers' sustainability ambitions. All globally sold products are within the scope of Green Premium. The product must be identifiable by an individual commercial reference number sold under a recognized brand of Schneider Electric. The Group provides resources efficient products (energy at usage, low CO 2 , material efficiency) whose footprints are fully available through the 'Product Environmental Profile' relying on Life Cycle Assessment; Green Premium offers also come with 'Circularity profiles', providing information on a product's Circularity through product end-of-life instructions and take-back services. Green Premium offers are regulatory compliant. Schneider is going beyond regulatory compliance with step-by-step substitution of certain materials and substances from our products. All this information is provided digitally to our customers.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #7:  One-third of corporate vehicle fleet comprised of electric vehicles\n\nSchneider Electric has joined the EV100 initiative of Climate Group to reduce its carbon emissions by committing to electrify 100% of its fleet by 2030. The fleet reporting structures the fleet carbon emissions calculations, the calculation of EVs share in the fleet and allows to support countries in the transition. As a mid-term objective, by 2025, Schneider commits to switch a third (1/3) of its fleet to electric vehicles (EV).\n\nSchneider Electric uses the definition by the Climate Group for electric vehicles, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV),\n- \u00b7 Plug-in hybrids (PHEV): Extended Range vehicle (EREV) and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) - with at least 50km of electrical autonomy\n\nVehicles' count is a picture at 31/12. The share of electric vehicle in fleet is calculated by dividing EV count by total vehicle count.\n\nFleet leasers are the source of information; global leasers operate the largest share of Schneider Electric's fleet and provide data on multiple countries by region. A detailed reporting is asked to all countries to eventually correct, complete or complement the information (considering for instance vehicles under local leasers).\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #8:  100% of sites with local biodiversity conservation and restoration programs\n\nThis program measures, for each site in scope, the percentage completion of a set of biodiversity-related actions. The scope is Schneider Electric sites within full real estate footprint that have >50 people.\n\nInitiatives are defined as 'eliminate single-use plastic', and 'local biodiversity action' (2 required for large ISO14001 sites, 1 for small sites).\n\nEach site reports initiatives at completion. At Group level, performance is calculated by dividing completed initiatives by total required initiatives.\n\nThis indicator is audited annually by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #9:  200 'Waste-to-Resource' sites\n\nA site achieves 'Waste-to-Resource' status if it recovers more than 99% (by weight) of its non-hazardous waste while leveraging waste-to-energy solutions for less than 10% of its non-hazardous waste. Additionally, if a site generates hazardous waste, it must ensure 100% proper handling and treatment of that waste. Proper handling and treatment of hazardous waste means that hazardous waste shall be handled as per Schneider Electric's requirements and local regulations, whichever is the most restrictive. Waste is considered as recovered if it is reduced, reused, or sent to a waste provider for recycling or disposal in any manner except landfill and incineration without energy recovery. Waste composting and energy recovery systems qualify as recovered. This indicator relates to all sites within the Group's full real estate footprint.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #10:  420,000 metric tons of avoided primary resource consumption through 'take-back at end-of-use' since 2017\n\nThe aim of this KPI is to measure Schneider Electric's Circular Economy efforts, meaning all the industrial activities that contribute to the Circular Economy model, such as repair, reuse, refurbish and recycling, thus avoiding waste, material & energy consumption, CO 2 emissions and/or water depletion.\n\nActivities in this KPI will enrich on the basis of SE increasing focus on circularity business models, and are currently constituted of:\n\n- \u00b7 Batteries take back and recycling;\n- \u00b7 Volume of devices refurbished and repaired in our repair centers (eg UPS, Drives);\n- \u00b7 Volume of MV, LV and Transformers refurbished or recycled in our Ecofit Centers.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The scope is Schneider Electric sites within the scope of environmental reporting that are classified as 'high' or 'extremely high' baseline water stress, as defined by World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. Actions are defined based on the amount of water that a site consumes along with the application(s) that the site uses water for. At the Group level, performance is calculated by totaling all completed site actions and dividing by the total required actions.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #12:  Deploy a 'Social Excellence' program through multiple tiers of suppliers\n\nThis indicator has not yet been deployed by Schneider Electric.\n\n## SSE #13:  100% of employees trained every year on Cybersecurity and Ethics\n\nAs per to our Ethics & Compliance and Cybersecurity programs, training of employees on ethics, corruption risks (for eligible employees) and cybersecurity is mandatory. To do so, Schneider Electric launched 3 new trainings as part of the Global Schneider Essentials training campaign reconducted every year with new content:\n\n- \u00b7 Since 2018: Training on the Principles of Responsibility (PoR document replaced in September 2021 by Trust Charter Schneider's Electric Code of Conduct) and Anticorruption.\n- \u00b7 Since 2020: Training on Cybersecurity.\n\nThe scope of this KPI is all employees registered in TalentLink (legal entities integrated in Talent Link, Core HR data system) as of November 15:\n\n- \u00b7 Principle of Responsibility and Cybersecurity e-learnings: all active employees with Open Ended Contracts (OEC) (exception: Chinese and Bulgarian Fix Term Contracts - FTC are included), present in the Group on December 31st and hired before December 1st\n- \u00b7 Anticorruption e-learning: exposed employees identified based on the job description (Schneider Electric System of Reference - description of functions), active, with connectivity type online-corporate credentials, with OEC (exception: Chinese and Bulgarian FTC) present in the Group on December 31st and hired before December 1st\n\nThis KPI is calculated as followed: the number of employees who completed all required e-learnings assigned based on defined criteria (2 or 3) divided by the number of employees x 100.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #14:  0.38 or below Medical Incident rate\n\nSafety is one of the 5 pillars of Schneider Trust Charter, which emphasizes the importance Schneider Electric is placing on its employees, customers, and contractors. Schneider works with many VIP global customers, and they demand the highest standards of Health & Safety management and performance before they engage and continue to do business with Schneider Electric.\n\nMoreover, at Schneider Electric our mission is to protect Occupational Health and Safety of employees, customers, contractors, and visitors to our locations. The Group also strives to provide employees safe, pleasant, and efficient workplaces for enhanced wellbeing and effectiveness. As such, we aim to reduce the Medical Incident Rate (MIR) to 0.38 by 2025.\n\nThe MIR is the number of work incidents requiring medical treatment per million hours worked (i.e. average hours of 500 employees working for one calendar year). Work related injuries and occupational illnesses requiring medical treatment are included. Work incidents may or may not have resulted in time off work.\n\nAll work-related incidents reported on Schneider Electric sites are counted (including therefore incidents affecting Schneider employees and other employees working under the supervision of Schneider, i.e. temporary workers). All Schneider sites within scope are considered. Medical incidents do not include: visits to a physician or other licensed healthcare professional solely for observation or counselling; the conduct of diagnostic procedures, such as x-rays and blood tests, including the administration of prescription medications used solely for diagnostic purposes (e.g. eye drops to dilate pupils); or first aid.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #15:  Reduce total number of safety recalls issued to 0\n\nWhen sustainability supports Customer Satisfaction, it translates into new processes and policies to allow returns of adapted products for reuse, remanufacture and refurbishment. The benefits can be seen at customer satisfaction level: by producing and delivering back order impacted by components in shortages, by serving new customers orders and on Sustainability level with anticipation of upcoming regulation compliance (Anti-Waste law), reducing carbon footprint of our supply chain and reducing cost of poor quality due to product recall.\n\nSchneider Electric has an Offer Safety Alert (OSA) process to alert the relevant Line of Business and other interested parties as soon as it is suspected that customers' health or property safety may be put at risk by Schneider products, solutions, or projects.\n\nThe Offer Safety Alert Committee (OSAC) is a permanent corporate committee that oversees and regulates the management of OSA. Its mission is to ensure all OSA are managed with the due diligence and urgency to minimize safety risks to customers. Its independent, multi-discipline nature allows the OSAC to make decisions in our customers' best interest. As part of the Trust pillar of SSE 20212025, Schneider is committed to reduce total number of safety recalls issued to 0.\n\nThis KPI covers customer notification and containment actions from any suspected condition in Schneider's Offer that may cause customer bodily injury or property damage with Offer Safety Alert Committee (OSAC) Go decision.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.",

This rating is calculated in real time with a proprietary algorithm that examines two classes of externally observable data:\n\n- \u00b7 configuration information, which represents how diligent a company is in implementing best practices to mitigate risk.\n- \u00b7 observed security events, which are evidences of cyber events like system compromises or data breaches etc.\n\nSecurity incidents or identified vulnerabilities can negatively impact the company's rating. They are addressed in a timely manner and the Group strives to maintain the score above 800.\n\n- * Bitsight scores for non-integrated entities (e.g. Aveva) are not included and are monitored separately.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #17:  4,000 suppliers assessed under our 'Vigilance Program'\n\nSchneider Electric seeks to be a role model in its interactions with customers, partners, suppliers, and communities, when it comes to ethics and the respect and promotion of human rights. The Group's vigilance plan reflects this ambition. It also complies with the provisions of 2017 French law on Corporate duty of vigilance: Duty of Vigilance introduced a new legal framework by which French authorities could hold corporations accountable.\n\nRisks within our Supply Chain are multiple: potential violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, serious bodily injury, Environmental damage, Health and Safety risks, etc. Impact are therefore quite various: reputation impacts, legal impacts, people health & safety, environmental pollution\u2026\n\nTo mitigate these risks with suppliers, the 2021-2025 plan is to deploy on site and remote audits for 4,000 suppliers:\n\n- \u00b7 1,000 identified in 'high risk' level (by a 3rd party methodology, RBA or other) with one site audits; and\n- \u00b7 3,000 others through remote self-declarative assessment. Suppliers answering are counted, removing, if any, suppliers that have been audited in the current year or in past.\n\nThe KPI adds the total number of audits performed. The baseline takes into account on site audits performed between 2018 and 2020 (i.e. 374 audits); this value has been audited and validated by PricewaterhouseCoopers in the previous years.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #18:  <1% pay gap for both females and males\n\nOver the last five years, Schneider Electric has proactively worked to identify and address female pay gaps with appropriate corrective actions through a country driven approach. Given the progress made on Pay Equity and to support its inclusion philosophy, starting in 2021, Schneider Electric has engaged in best practices to maintain a pay gap below 1% by 2025 for both females and males.\n\nMeasurement of the individual pay gap is achieved by comparing each employee to a universal median total target salary 'TTC' (base salary + target short term incentive) for all genders. In other words, an individual's TTC is assessed against the median TTC of their comparator group (individual TTC/median of comparator group TTC - 1). The comparator group is defined by the drivers of job level (grade) and salary structure within a country.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #19:  60% subscription in our yearly Worldwide Employee Share Ownership Plan (WESOP)\n\nThe World Employee Share Ownership Plan (WESOP) is one of the Group's recurring key annual reward programs, offering employees across the world an opportunity to become owners of the Company, at preferred conditions. Schneider Electric commits to achieve a 60% subscription rate among eligible employees in the yearly WESOP by 2025.\n\nThe scope concerns 29 recurring participating countries, representing 91% of the eligible headcount, which are all long-term employees of countries participating in WESOP with seniority of 3 month in the company. The KPI is calculated by collecting the number of subscribers from the subscription tool, divided by the number of eligible employees in the 29 countries as per data from our global HRIS system.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #20:  100% of employees paid at least a living wage\n\nIn line with its Human Rights Policy and Trust Charter, Schneider Electric believes earning a living wage is a basic human right. Schneider Electric is committed to paying 100% of employees at or above the living wage to meet their families' basic needs. By basic needs, the Group considers basic household expenditures (food, housing, clothing, sanitation, education, healthcare, transport), plus discretionary income for a given local standard of living.\n\nThere is no universal benchmark or methodology on how to calculate a living wage, which is why Schneider Electric has been working with an external consultant since 2018 to calculate living wages for all its locations worldwide. To calculate a living wage, the external consultant estimates the basic household expenditures of employees, as well as the number of persons earning a wage in a 'typical' household based on various sources of cost of living and macroeconomic data (national statistics, OECD, United Nations agencies, etc.).\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The Reward team centrally compiles and analyses total employee remuneration data (base salary, bonus, and allowances) to compare it with agreed living wage. Employees are benchmarked to their work location living wage. To calculate employee remuneration, the Reward team uses data available in its global HRIS system, as well as local payroll. For final reporting of the year end results, Schneider Electric can disclose a final score that considers living wage gaps closed by countries until the end of the year after they have been identified.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #21:  4x the number of employee-driven development interactions on the Open Talent Market\n\nThe purpose of this initiative is to create an integrated and digital Open Talent Market (OTM) that enables employees to drive their own career development. The platform is borderless, neutral, and uses AI to help achieve best matches. The ambition is to multiply the number of employee-driven interactions within OTM by 4 in the next 5 years.\n\nInteractions are tracked in the tool for each feature of OTM. At the start of 2021, current features available to employees are:\n\n- \u00b7 Positions;\n- \u00b7 Projects; and\n- \u00b7 Mentorships.\n\nThese 3 features work best when employee profiles are robust and rate a 3/4 for completeness. The scope of this initiative extends to the connected population of Schneider Electric as defined in January 2021, thus excluding non-connected workers (ie: plant), as well as contractors, and interns/apprentices.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #22:  >90% of employees undergo digital upskilling\n\nThe Group is committed to growing employee digital citizenship and aims to achieve digital upskilling for >90% employees by 2025. The progress combines white collars and workers populations KPIs.\n\n- \u00b7 For white collars, the Group aims to achieve >90% eligible employees reaching Intermediate, Advanced or Expert Digital Citizenship level by 2025. The Digital Citizenship level of all employees will be assessed by their managers each year. Eligible employees in 2021 are active employees hired before January 31 2021, Open-ended and fixed-term contracts, and excludes employees in non-integrated entities & further exclusion defined by country.\n\n- \u00b7 For workers, the Group aims to achieve >90% workers complete 2 hours of training per year offered by the GSC Academy on digital transformation, such as Smart factory program, Cybersecurity, Digital knowledge. The scope covers active workers populations and plant team leaders defined by specific job codes and hired before January 31 2021, Openended and fixed-term contracts (China only) in relevant operating units, and excludes workers on extended leave of more than 6 months during the year and factories which planned to be closed before Q2 of the following year.\n\nThe scope and exclusions of this indicator will be reviewed at the beginning of each year.\n\nThe KPI is an aggregated % based on the % of employees meeting the target defined for white collars and workers to the total employee population in scope (white collars & workers).\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #23: 90% of employees have access to a program that supports meaningful development in the later stages of their professional career\n\nThis indicator aims to support and recognize talent who are near or at the later stages of their professional career through a robust career plan and development options, in order to strengthen key skills, leverage expertise and ensure knowledge exchange.\n\nIn 2021, the strategy and approach were defined. Pilot programs will start fully in 2022. As such, this indicator was not measured in 2021.\n\nFrom 2022, the indicator will be calculated as total headcount in the countries which meet the global minimum standard for a program, compared with overall Schneider Electric headcount. All countries with >250 employees are in scope. The minimum standard for a program include:\n\n- \u00b7 Training, coaching or one to one support available for employees (and their managers) in the later stages of their professional career enabling them to have a career check-in/ next-step conversation that results in a meaningful career development plan.\n- \u00b7 A selection of support options available in the employees' country that may include flexible work, upskilling and career growth options, career pivot options, personal planning options or workplace adjustments.\n\nThe methodology for this indicator was reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## SSE #24: 75% employee engagement score\n\nA high Employee Engagement index is linked to higher sales growth, higher operating income and ultimately higher customer satisfaction and loyalty toward the company. This index is calculated once a year through a survey called OneVoice, sent to 100% of Group employees, and serves a starting point to adapt the Group's people strategy, and action plans.",

They principally fall into actions benefiting young people, underprivileged families, the environment and are organized depending on the personal or professional skills of the volunteers as well as the needs identified by the supported organizations (specialized or non-specialized needs). Missions are posted on a dedicated digital and multilingual platform called VolunteerIn enabling Group employees to apply for volunteer missions among the Foundation's partners. Local and spontaneous initiatives organized by the Schneider Electric Foundation delegates and their partners in which employees engage are also taken into account.\n\nIn 2021, the Schneider Electric Foundation and partner NGOs increased the number of digital missions offered to employees, enabling employees to continue on engaging even under restrictions due to the pandemic. One day of volunteering is counted when a staff member dedicates five hours of his or her time to one of these partner organizations. The indicator also includes the training missions organized abroad for a period of five days minimum. However, due to the pandemic this type of mission has not been organized in 2021 for safety reasons. Only missions lasting a minimum of 0.5 days are considered.\n\nThis indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n## 2.7.2 Methodology elements on EU taxonomy indicators\n\nRegarding the calculation of the proportion of activities considered eligible and aligned in accordance with the Disclosure Delegated Act in turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditures (OpEx), Schneider Electric provides the following additional details:\n\n## Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned turnover\n\nThis calculation is using two combined approaches, including an offer-based approach (i.e. by nature of technology), whereby each line of business' products are reviewed against the definition of economic activities as defined in the EU Climate Delegated Acts, and an end-segment approach, whereby the amount of revenues generated from offers fitting with the economic activities description sold to Taxonomy-eligible end-segments (Green Transport and Renewables mainly) is reviewed. Double-counting between offer-based approach and end-segment-based approaches are then removed before consolidation.\n\nAs detailed in Annex 1 of the Delegated Act on Article 8, the denominator of Taxonomy eligible turnover is equal to the net turnover recognized pursuant to IAS 1.82(a) after removal of intra-group transactions. At Schneider Electric, this represents EUR 34,176 million, as disclosed in the first line of the consolidated statement of income in this Universal Registration Document (URD, page 344).\n\nFor 87% of revenues (excluding entities having their own reporting framework), eligibility calculation combines two approaches:\n\n- \u00b7 For 86% of revenues, eligibility and alignment calculation is using an offer-based (by nature of technology) approach, whereby workshops are conducted with offer management teams for each line of business to define whether products are in line with the definition of economic activities included in the EU Climate Delegated Act. The analysis is performed at the level of each product category, which enables a granular segmentation between Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-noneligible revenues. Compliance with the technical screening criteria is assessed along with the eligibility by the offer technical experts at product category level. For example, Building Management Systems (BMS) generally include energy efficiency systems, which are Taxonomy-eligible, and fire safety and access control systems, which are not. In this example, the analysis enables to account only for energy efficiency systems installed as part of a BMS. An eligibility ratio is then consolidated for each product line (which includes multiple product categories).\n- \u00b7 For 1% of revenues eligibility and alignment calculation is using an end-segment-based approach, whereby commercial teams indicate for each product line if it matches with the economic activity's as described in the Annex 1 of the EU Climate Delegated Act and provide with the related amount of revenues generated from Taxonomy-eligible end-segments (Green Transport and Renewables mainly). Potential double-counting between the two approaches is avoided in applying the end segment-based approach to only 1% of revenues issued from eligible businesses sold to end segments supporting climate change mitigation and the offer-based approach to the remaining 86% of revenues.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Therefore, the eligibility and alignment ratios are calculated by dividing respectively the amount of eligible net sales before rebate by the total amount of net sales before rebate, and then applied to the net sales after rebate.\n- \u00b7 At the granularity level of product categories, a non-significant share of revenues (<5%) is not allocated per product category. These are not considered in the calculation of Taxonomy eligibility and alignment per product line (the product line's average eligibility and alignment ratios are applied to those revenues).\n- \u00b7 End-segment sales data is based on net sales before rebate. A correction factor is applied to assess the value of net sales after rebate per end-segment.\n\nA rigorous assessment of the compliance with the technical screening criteria is performed for each activity. Under activity 3.6 (Manufacture of low carbon technologies), GHG emission savings are calculated using Schneider's saved and avoided emission methodology. This calculation method was audited by an independent third-party in accordance with ISO14067:2018 standard. Under activity 4.9, taxonomy-eligible revenues made in countries where the carbon intensity is above the threshold stipulated in the technical screening criteria (TSC), or contributing to connect to the grid a power generation source with carbon intensity above the threshold stipulated in the TSC are considered as not aligned.\n\nProportion of turnover from Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned activities in the template required by EU Taxonomy Delegated Act on Article 8 available page 258.\n\n## Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned Capital Expenditure (CapEx)\n\nAs per specification of CapEx as detailed in Annex 1 of the Delegated Act on Article 8, the denominator of Taxonomy-eligible CapEx KPI is equal to additions to tangible and intangible assets of the financial year 2022 (including IFRS 16 rights of use), considered before depreciation, amortization and any re-measurement, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments for the financial year 2022 and excluding fair value changes. The denominator also covers additions to tangible and intangible assets resulting from business combinations that occurred during the financial year 2022.\n\nAt Schneider Electric, total tangible assets resulting from the above definition represents EUR 727 million over 2022, including EUR 721 million from additions, as disclosed in the note 11 of the Group financial statements in this URD, and EUR 6 million from business combinations.\n\nThe total covered IFRS 16 rights of use over 2022 represents EUR 356 million, as disclosed in the note 11 of the Group financial statements (page 452).\n\nThe total intangible assets resulting from the above definition represents EUR 490 million over 2022. This amount is split as follows: EUR 386 million from additions, as disclosed in the note 10 of the Group financial statements (page 449) - this includes EUR 357 million of capitalized Research and Development (R&D) projects, as disclosed in the note 10 of the Group financial statements, and EUR 104 million from business combinations.\n\nAs per specification of CapEx as detailed in Annex 1 of the Delegated Act on Article 8, all capital expenditures based on IFRS 16 related to long-term leasing of buildings are considered eligible. None of these are aligned since the Group rental real estate portfolio does not meet all Taxonomy-alignment criteria described in EU Taxonomy activity 7.7. CapEx related to assets, processes and business combinations associated with Taxonomy-eligible and aligned activities were calculated using allocation keys of eligible, and respectively aligned, turnover per business and operations, except for Research and Development (R&D) and IFRS 16 CapEx. As described more exhaustively in section 2.3.4 Investing to achieve the Group's climate strategy and vision page 158, R&D projects of the Group aim at and demonstrate substantial life cycle GHG emission savings and substantial carbon footprint saving. Thus, all 2022 R&D capitalized expenditures directly linked to capitalized R&D projects are considered both eligible and aligned according to EU Taxonomy activity 3.6.\n\nThe Group launched in December 2022 a reporting process to track additional EU Taxonomy -eligible and -aligned individual CapEx from 2023. Taxonomy analysis is now required for each non-financial capital expenditure, through a Group tool dedicated to investments validation and follow-up.\n\nTo not only simplify the reporting exercise but also to support the divisions in their sustainable transformation, providing them with more visibility on the proportion of their activities qualified as sustainable under the European Taxonomy regulation, Schneider Electric is automating the reporting of the turnover KPI.\n\nSee detailed proportion of CapEx and OpEx from Taxonomyeligible and -aligned activities on pages 260 and 262.\n\n## Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible and aligned Operating Expenditure (OpEx)\n\nTo determine the Group's European Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned operating expenditure, only non-capitalized costs related to Research and Development (R&D) are analyzed for the establishment of the numerator of the OpEx KPIs.\n\nThe denominator of Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned OpEx KPI represents EUR 1,716 million over 2022, corresponding mainly to non-capitalized Research and Development costs of the Group for EUR 1,488 million presented before offsetting with the R&D Tax Credit for EUR 51 million, as disclosed in the note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in this URD (page 445). This includes non-capitalized costs relative to R&D projects but also, among others, costs incurred in relation with support and platforming, costs of IT global applications dedicated to R&D, costs relative to continuous engineering costs for quality, productivity and obsolescence.",

The total of these categories represents less than EUR 178 million and is therefore considered as non-material for Schneider Electric business, so excluded from the OpEx analysis and OpEx KPIs numerators.\n\nAs described more exhaustively in section 2.3.4 Investing to achieve the Group's climate strategy and vision page 158, R&D projects of the Group aiming at and demonstrating substantial life cycle GHG emission savings and substantial carbon footprint saving, Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned OpEx KPIs numerator corresponds to operating expenditure directly associated to Group's R&D projects: these OpEx are both Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned under the European Taxonomy activity 3.6.\n\nDetailed templates required by EU Taxonomy Delegated Act on Article 8 are available page 258.\n\n## Does Not Significantly Harm (DNSH)\n\nAs defined in Article 3 of the Taxonomy regulation, an activity shall qualify as environmentally sustainable only if it does not significantly harm any of the other Taxonomy objectives. For activities specified in Annex 1 of the EU Climate Delegated Act, this means that they must not do significant harm to:\n\nClimate change adaptation: Schneider has assessed physical climate risks that are material to its activity. The Group has put dependencies analysis at the heart of its risk management and performed a forward-looking climate risk and vulnerability assessment to identify and price the materiality of physical climate risks that may affect Schneider Electric sites, extended supply chain and economic activities under different IPCC scenarios and different timelines (short-, medium- and long-terms). In line with these assessments, the Group has implemented adaptation solutions consisting of several resilience initiatives as detailed in previous sections.\n\nRead more about the Group climate risk management and adaptation measures in the chapters 2.3.1.1 Risks and opportunities | Climate-driven risks and 2.3.1.2. Adapting to climate change on page 150.\n\n## The sustainable use and protection of water and marine\n\nresources: Schneider Electric regularly assesses water-related risks. In 2022, the Group conducted a water footprint analysis along the value chain, covering water consumption, scarcity, eutrophication, ecotoxicity, and acidification. Due to the nature of most of its industrial processes (manual and automatic assembly), water withdrawal of the Group's operations is considered limited. The Group has implemented initiatives to preserve water quality and avoid water stress - read more about the Group's water management in the section 2.4.4.3  Water withdrawal, discharge and stress on page 191.\n\nTransition to a circular economy: Schneider Electric assesses the availability of and, where feasible, adopts techniques that maximize the value of its resources, considering waste as a resource and ensuring its waste stays within a circular system. Beyond avoiding landfill and looking at traditional recycling solutions, Schneider strives to move up the waste hierarchy and find 'reduce and reuse' solutions for its resources.\n\nRequirements related to construction and demolition waste management in low carbon mobility infrastructures are not applicable to Schneider as the Group only operates as an electrical and automation solution provider in those projects.\n\nRead more about the Group's transition to a circular economy in section 2.4.5.2, page 196.\n\nPollution prevention and control: On the manufacture, placing on the market or use of chemicals, Schneider Electric provides the following precisions:\n\n- \u00b7 Regarding regulation (EU) 2017/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2017 on mercury and repealing is not applicable to Schneider Electric as we do not use mercury in our products nor in our manufacturing activities.\n- \u00b7 Regarding the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS), Schneider reports only 1% of its eligible revenues not aligned with this requirement. The Group has deployed significant efforts to measure and further comply, even outside of the European Union (i.e. beyond the scope of the regulation).\n- \u00b7 Regarding substances laid down in Article 57 of Regulation (EC) 1907/2009 and identified in accordance with Article 59(1) of that Regulation, as the concept of essential use has not yet been defined by the EU Commission, Schneider has considered the worst-case scenario, and declared as non-aligned all revenues coming from products using substances meeting those criteria. 3% of Schneider Electric's eligible revenues are generated by products including substances part of the candidate list for eventual inclusion in Annex XIV.\n- \u00b7 Regarding substances laid down in Article 57 of Regulation (EC) 1907/2006, the Group notes that obtaining material declarations and data from suppliers beyond tier 1 is particularly challenging and is not in a position to quantify the impact of excluding products using substances that may be included in the list of substances subject to authorization but not currently identified in the candidate list. The Group plans to improve the traceability of the components of each products beyond tier 1 year over year, and to make this information digitally available to its customers.\n\nOther requirements are met and included in Schneider Electric Global Environmental Directives and all restrictions are applied globally.\n\nRequirements related to pollution prevention and control on overground high voltage lines and noise, vibration, dust and pollutant emissions reduction during construction and maintenance of low carbon mobility infrastructures are not applicable to Schneider as the Group only operates as an electrical and automation solution provider in those projects.\n\n## The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems:\n\nAs Schneider Electric is not a project developer as defined in the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (2011/92/EU) but only operates as a contractor of projects listed in Annex 1 and 2 of this directive, the Group is not subject to completing an Environmental Impact Assessment or screening. For the same reason the requirements related to the biodiversity risk mitigation on low carbon mobility infrastructures are not applicable to Schneider. Schneider's assessments and actions on biodiversity are detailed in section 2.4.1 \u00abMinimize the Group's impacts and dependencies on nature' page 176.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Schneider Electric has an Offer Safety Alert (OSA) process to alert the  relevant Line of Business and other interested parties as soon as it is suspected that customers' health or property safety  may be put at risk by Schneider products, solutions, or projects. The Offer Safety Alert Committee (OSAC) is a permanent  corporate committee that oversees and regulates the management of OSA. Its mission is to ensure all OSA are managed  with the due diligence and urgency to minimize safety risks to customers.

It is also one of the pillars of the Group's Code of Conduct (Trust Charter). Overall, transformations linked to climate change are a source of opportunities for Schneider Electric, the main risk being to fail leading by example and thereby lose traction with customers, investors, new talents and collaborators in the company. Concrete climate-related programs to either grab opportunities, or mitigate risks are deployed every 3 to 5 years in our Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) and complement the Group's Climate Pledge - our short-term (2025), mid-term (2030) and long-term (2040, 2050) objectives, aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory. We present below our main climate-related disclosures in line with TCFD recommendations.\n\n| Recommended   | CDP Climate Change    | Brief description (please refer to CDP Climate Change response and other sections of this   |\n|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Disclosure    | & URD 2022 references | Universal Registration Document for further details)                                        |\n\n## 1. Governance: Disclose the organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n- 1. a) Describe the board's oversight of climaterelated risks and opportunities.\n- 1. b) Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nCDP - C1.1b\n\nDEU - chapter 2 (2.1.7;\n\n2.3.1); chapter 3 (3.3.4)\n\nCDP - C1.2, C1.2a DEU - chapter 2 (2.1.6, 2.3.1)\n\nThe process for designing a new Schneider Sustainability Impact program (SSI) includes a sustainability risks and opportunities assessment (including climate), which leads to the design of concrete transformation initiatives to align the company on the challenges identified. The risks and opportunities are then monitored and managed on a continuous basis. Several governance bodies are involved in this process:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors has oversight of climate-related issues notably through its Human Resources & CSR Committee. This Committee has 6 Director members who report to the Board of Directors, and reviews Schneider's CSR strategy, SSI performance and the Group's positioning vs. its peers.\n- \u00b7 The Executive Committee has a dedicated Function Committee, which meets two to three times a year and decides on the sustainability strategy and validates the SSI and carbon pledge.\n- \u00b7 The SSI Steering Committee was formed in 2020 to propose precise and measurable transformation programs for the 2021 - 2025 SSI, which were then submitted to the Group Sustainability Committee for approval.\n- \u00b7 The Sustainability Department coordinates the overall sustainability strategy of the Group and rollout of action plans.\n- \u00b7 Three Committees involving Group Executive Vice-Presidents and Senior Vice-Presidents are dedicated to oversee the implementation of the Group's decarbonization roadmap, respectively focusing on the supply chain, low-carbon product design, and the decarbonization of Schneider's operational emissions.\n\nAdditionally, environmental transformations are driven by a network of leading experts in various environmental fields such as eco-design, energy efficiency, circular economy, or CO 2 . Environment leaders coordinate a network of more than 600 managers responsible for the environmental management of sites, countries, product design and marketing.\n\n## 2. Strategy: Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities in the organization's businesses, strategy and financial planning where such information is material.\n\n- 2. a) Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the\n\norganization has identified\n\nover the short, medium,\n\nand long term.\n\nCDP - C2.1a, C2.2a, C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a\n\nURD - chapter 2 (2.1.6,\n\n2.3.1)\n\n- 2. b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's business, strategy, and financial planning. CDP - C2.3a, C2.4a, C3.1, C3.2, C3.2a, C3.3, C3.4, C3.4a URD - Chapter 2 (2.3)\n\nThe growing demand for greener, low-carbon products and services creates a strong business opportunity for Schneider Electric. The Group is uniquely positioned to grab these opportunities because it acts on both sides of the equation:\n\n- \u00b7 The solutions Schneider Electric brings to the market are directly linked to activities to mitigate, adapt, and improve humanity's resilience to climate change;\n- \u00b7 At the same time, Schneider Electric acts to reduce its end-to-end CO 2 footprint, aiming for a net-zero CO 2 supply chain by 2050, with precise steps for 2025, 2030 and 2040.\n\nIn 2022, 72% of the Group revenues qualify as Impact revenues, following Schneider Electric's definition, meaning revenues from offers that bring energy, climate, or resource efficiency to customers, while not generating any significant harmful impacts to the environment. The Group aims to grow its Impact revenues to 80% by 2025. Additionally, maintaining the best offers on the market for greener, more efficient products and services that support the transition to a low-carbon economy needs adapted investments in Research and Development in the short term. Schneider Electric invest about 5% of its annual revenues in R&D each year. It is estimated that more than 90% of its innovation projects contribute to solutions contributing to climate change mitigation.",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\n## Schneider Electric SE\n\n35, rue Joseph Monier 92500 Rueil-Malmaison (France)\n\nIn our capacity as Statutory Auditor of the company Schneider Electric (hereinafter the 'Entity'), appointed as independent third party ('third party') and accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Cofrac), (Cofrac Inspection Accreditation, n\u00b03-1862, scope available at www.cofrac.fr), we have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on the historical information (observed or extrapolated) in the consolidated non-financial statement, prepared in accordance with the Entity's procedures (hereinafter the 'Guidelines'), for the year ended December 31, 2022 (hereinafter the 'Information' and the 'Statement',\n\nrespectively), presented in the group management report pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles L. 225-102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed as described under the 'Nature and scope of procedures' and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that cause us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement is not prepared in accordance with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nWe draw attention to section 2.7.1 - 'Methodology elements on the published indicators', where it is stated that the scope of published indicators excludes certain Schneider Electric's entities. Our opinion is not qualified in respect of excluded entities.\n\n## Preparation of the non-financial performance statement\n\nThe absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure the Information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the Information needs to be read and understood together with the Guidelines, summarised in the Statement.\n\n## Inherent Limitations in preparing the Information\n\nAs stated in the Statement, the Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the Statement.\n\n## Responsibility of the Entity\n\nManagement is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Information;\n- \u00b7 preparing a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model,\n\na description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented considering those risks and the outcomes of said policies, including key performance indicators and the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy);\n\n- \u00b7 preparing the Statement by applying the Entity's 'Guidelines' as referred above; and\n- \u00b7 implementing internal control over information relevant to the preparation of the Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been prepared by the Board of directors.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor appointed as independent third party\n\nBased on our work, our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- \u00b7 the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- \u00b7 the fairness of the information provided pursuant to part 3 of sections I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, i.e. the outcomes of policies, including key performance indicators, and measures relating to the main risks, hereinafter the 'Information.'\n\nAs we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Information as doing so may compromise our independence.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to report on:\n\n- \u00b7 the Entity's compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory provisions (particularly with regard to the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy), the French duty of care law and against corruption and tax evasion);\n- \u00b7 the fairness of information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy)\n- \u00b7 the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations.\n\n## Applicable regulatory provisions and professional guidance\n\nWe performed the work described below in accordance with Articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) applicable to such engagement, in particular the professional guidance issued by the Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes, Intervention du commissaire aux comptes Intervention de l'OTI - d\u00e9claration de performance extra-financi\u00e8re, and acting as the verification programme and with the international standard ISAE 3000 (revised) - Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information .\n\n## Independence and quality control\n\nOur independence is defined by the provisions of Article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code and French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) of our profession. In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, ethical requirements and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors ( Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes ) relating to this engagement.",

Carbon footprint SE - Reporting Protocol) and the basis of preparation set out in the section 2.7.1 of the URD 2022 as for the year ended December 31 st , 2022.\n\nWe do not express an assurance opinion on information in respect of earlier periods or on any other information included in the URD 2022.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nWe draw attention to section 2.7.1 - 'Methodology elements on the published indicators', where it is stated that the scope of published indicators excludes certain Schneider Electric's entities. Our opinion is not qualified in respect of excluded entities.\n\n## Understanding how Schneider Electric has Prepared the Identified Sustainability Information\n\nThe absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure Identified Sustainability Information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the Identified Sustainability Information needs to be read and understood together with the reporting framework defined by the Company in internal methodological guidelines specific to each family of indicators (available at the Company's headquarter on request) and the basis of preparation set out in the section 2.7.1 - 'Methodology of published indicators' of URD 2022 as for the year ended Decembrer 31st, 2022 (together 'the Reporting\n\nCriteria'), which Schneider Electric has used to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information.\n\n## Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Identified Sustainability Information\n\nAs indicated in the section 2.7.1 of URD 2022, the Identified Sustainability Information may be subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Moreover, some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions and/or estimates used for its preparation and presented in Schneider Electric's URD 2022.\n\nIn addition, greenhouse gas quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases.\n\n## Schneider Electric's Responsibilities\n\nManagement of the Company is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting the Identified Sustainability Information;\n- \u00b7 the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria;\n- \u00b7 designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nWe are responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;\n- \u00b7 forming an independent opinion, based on the evidence we have obtained; and\n- \u00b7 reporting our opinion to the Directors of the Company.\n\nAs we are engaged to form an independent opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information as doing so may compromise our independence.\n\n## Professional Standards Applied\n\nWe performed our reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) applicable to such engagement and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information , and, in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements , issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.",

The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on professional judgment, including the assessment of risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in the Identified Sustainability Information. In making those risk assessments, we considered internal control relevant to the Company's preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information.

All Group industrial and logistics sites, in addition to certain major tertiary sites are covered. As per the Group' s Environmental Policy, all industrial and logistics sites with more than 50 people and tertiary sites with more than 500 people must be ISO 14001 certified within 2 years after their acquisition or creation. A difference can, therefore, be noted with respect to the scope of financial consolidation.\n\n## 2.8.1.2  Perimeter and Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001)\n\n| Indicators                         | Units   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| ISO 14001 certified sites (1)      | #       | 243    | 244    | 232    | 241    |\n| Industrial and logistics sites     | #       | 204    | 211    | 212    | 220    |\n| Tertiary sites                     | #       | 39     | 33     | 20     | 21     |\n| % of sites certified ISO 14001 (2) | %       | 86%    | 87%    | 90%    | 89%    |\n\n- (1)  ISO 14001 certification is systematic for all large industrial, logistics and tertiary sites within two years of acquisition. A reduction in the number of ISO 14001 certified sites usually results from sites closing during the year.\n- (2)  the percentage of sites certified ISO 14001 is calculated based on waste generation from certified sites vs total sites, as the majority of sites - in number - are small leased offices where certification is not relevant.\n\n## 2.8.1.3  Group site consumption, emissions and waste\n\n## Materials\n\n| GRI   | Indicators                                                                                            | Units       | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 301-2 | SSI #4 - Green material content in our  products (1)                                                  | %           | 18%    | 11%    | 7%     | UP     |\n| 301-2 | SSI #5 - Primary and secondary packaging  free from single-use plastic using recycled  cardboard (2)  | %           | 45%    | 21%    | 13%    | UP     |\n|       | SSE #6 - Product revenues covered by Green  Premium \u2122                                                 | %           | 80%    | 78%    | 77%    | 55%    |\n|       | SSE #10 - Metric tons of avoided primary  resource consumption through 'take-back at  end-of-use' (3) | metric tons | 57,052 | 46,488 | 60,149 | 53,867 |\n|       | SSE #15 - Reduce total number of safety  recalls issued to 0  (4)                                     | # recalls   | 24     | 14     | 25     | UP     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 audited indicators.

Examples of waste reduction projects include creating a closed-loop system for pallets between the site and the supplier, or reducing packaging waste from incoming shipments. Normal operational decreases of waste due to reduced activity do not count as waste reduction.\n- (2)  Non-hazardous waste recovered or reduced is calculated as the ratio between waste reused/recycled, incinerated with energy recovery and reduced, divided by the total non-hazardous waste generated and waste reduced. The Group's waste recovery percentage without waste reduction is: 95.9%, 95.5% 96.3%, and 95.2% for 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n- (3)  'Schneider Electric expectations' for hazardous waste means: 1) Waste meets/exceeds all local legal requirements for handling/treatment, and either 2a) waste is neutralized of its hazardous nature, or b) waste is handled/treated using the feasibly best available technique which provides the most environmentally beneficial impact.\n- (4)  2017 hazardous waste intensity was 0.42 metric tons per million euros of revenues.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\n| GRI Indicators            | Units                                                                                                                  |   2022 |   2021 | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 304-1                     | Number of sites owned, leased or managed in  or adjacent to protected areas and/or key  biodiversity areas (KBA) (1) # |    260 |    260 | UP     | UP     |\n|                           | of which industrial sites or distribution centres #                                                                    |    107 |    107 | UP     | UP     |\n| of which office buildings | #                                                                                                                      |    153 |    153 | UP     | UP     |\n\n- 2022 audited indicators.

UP = Unpublished.\n- (1)  Out of scope energy consumption concerns mainly AVEVA, RIB Software and Larsen & Toubro and to a limited extent other small non-integrated entities.\n- (2)  For sites below size thresholds for mandatory environmental reporting, energy consumption by source is estimated by multiplying site surface (m 2 ) with energy intensity ratios (kWh/m 2 ) measured in larger sites. For sites located in countries with country-level renewable electricity contracts, 100% of the estimated electricity consumption of the site is counted as renewable, as such supply contracts cover all sites within a country. 2022 includes 44,286 MWh of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) applied to sites in the estimated energy scope.\n- (3)  2005 estimated energy productivity is 12,408 \u20ac per MWh\n- (4)  Renewable electricity reported here includes renewable electricity purchased through Power Purchasing Agreements (PPA) or green tariffs, and electricity covered by Energy Attributes Certificates (EAC). The 2022 EAC account for 35.9% of total measured purchased renewable electricity reported.\n\n## Greenhouse gas (GHG)\n\n| GRI           | Indicators                                                                                        | Units    | 2022       | 2021       | 2020       | 2019       |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|               | Estimated coverage (% total GHG emissions)                                                        | %        | 99%        | 99%        | 99%        | 100%       |\n| 305-1,  305-2 | Estimated Total Scopes 1 and 2 GHG  emissions (market-based) (1)                                  | TCO 2 e  | 229,347    | 294,051    | 287,865    | 437,293    |\n| 305-5         | Absolute reduction vs base year (2021) (2)                                                        | %        | -22%       | 0%         | NA         | NA         |\n| 305-4         | Total Scopes 1 and 2 per euro turnover                                                            | TCO 2 e/ | 6.7        | 10.2       | 11.4       | 16.1       |\n| 305-1         | Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions (1)                                                                | TCO 2 e  | 119,617    | 140,936    | 142,658    | 180,751    |\n|               | of which fuel oil                                                                                 | TCO 2 e  | 4,414      | 4,520      | 4,451      | 5,748      |\n|               | of which gas                                                                                      | TCO 2 e  | 47,271     | 56,776     | 52,197     | 61,733     |\n|               | of which coal                                                                                     | TCO 2 e  | 0          | 0          | 0          | 0          |\n|               | of which vehicle fleet                                                                            | TCO 2 e  | 55,598     | 62,683     | 73,229     | 91,169     |\n|               | of which SF 6  emissions (3)                                                                      | TCO 2 e  | 4,777      | 6,104      | 7,557      | 13,601     |\n|               | SF 6  leakage rate                                                                                | %        | 0.08%      | 0.10%      | 0.14%      | 0.24%      |\n|               | Target SF 6  leakage rate                                                                         | %        | 0.11%      | 0.19%      | 0.25%      | 0.25%      |\n|               | of which estimated Scope 1 GHG emissions  of sites out of reporting perimeter (4)                 | TCO 2 e  | 7,557      | 10,853     | 5,224      | 8,499      |\n| 305-2         | Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions (1)                                                       | TCO 2 e  | 109,730    | 153,115    | 145,207    | 256,542    |\n|               | of which grid electricity (market-based)                                                          | TCO 2 e  | 49,674     | 66,692     | 70,145     | 134,122    |\n|               | of which renewable electricity   (market-based) (5)                                               | TCO 2 e  | 703        | 701        | 694        | 795        |\n|               | of which district heating                                                                         | TCO 2 e  | 8,358      | 14,714     | 11,550     | 35,020     |\n|               | of which estimated scope 2 GHG emissions  of sites out of reporting perimeter (market- based) (4) | TCO 2 e  | 50,995     | 71,008     | 62,818     | 86,605     |\n| 305-3         | Other relevant indirect (scope 3) GHG  emissions (6)                                              | TCO 2 e  | 60,952,497 | 68,901,866 | 65,921,222 | 74,256,245 |\n| 305-5         | Absolute variation vs base year (2021) (6)                                                        | %        | -11.5%     | 0%         | NA         | NA         |\n| 305-4         | Total scope 3 per euro turnover (6)                                                               | TCO 2 e/ | 1,783      | 2,384      | 2,620      | 2,733      |",

In addition, SSI #8 obtained a 'reasonable' level of assurance in 2022. Please refer to page 242 for the methodological presentation of each indicator. The 2022 performance is also discussed in more details in each section of this report.\n- (3)  Calculation methodology for SSI #8 has been expanded in Q2 2022 to include blue collar managers in the scope of front line managers. Due to this methodological change, the 2020 baseline for front line managers has been recalculated to 23% instead of 25%.\n- (4)  SSE #12 'Social Excellence' program currently under development.",

It's becoming increasingly difficult for companies to anticipate, understand and prepare for the extensive range of risks that can impact their operations. Novel risks arise every day, fueled by the rapid pace of technology developments and social and political movements. Even with the best risk management systems in place, setbacks are bound to occur. The manner in which a company prepares for and responds to the ever-increasing risk environment stands as a true testament of its resilience.\n\nBuilding a strong risk management culture and mechanisms takes a great deal of work and effective collaboration. In 2021, the Group started strengthening its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, aiming to increase its overall level of resilience. This framework offers a holistic approach to managing risk, bringing the right forces together in a common effort with a few focus areas: protecting the Group's value, assets, and reputation; identifying and measuring the major risks to which the Group is exposed; anticipating and foreseeing changes in these risks; implementing risk prevention, mitigation, and transfer measures, and building crisis response capabilities.\n\nMore precisely, the Group's ERM framework looks at trust from three vantage points. The first is integrity; this entails creating a hospitable context for principled behaviors. The second is transparency, which involves fostering objective, transparent and data-backed decision-making processes to earn and sustain trust. The third is resilience, which is focused on ensuring thoughtful, considered risk taking throughout the organization.\n\nAs one key element of this framework, internal control procedures are designed to drive compliance with laws and regulations, application of policies and guidelines, effectiveness of the internal processes and timely remediation of deficiencies and reliability of financial reporting.\n\nUltimately, what guides us every day is the desire to cultivate and maintain trust in our ecosystem, with our customers, partners and employees. And we can only do so by acting with integrity, fostering transparency, and demonstrating resilience.\n\nThank you for your support and your trust,\n\n## Herv\u00e9 Coureil\n\nChief Governance Officer & Secretary General\n\n<!-- image -->",

Indeed, resilience is one of the fundamental elements of sustainable growth and belongs directly to the Group's Sustainability value. All Group entities, along the three lines of defense described hereafter, are encouraged to:\n\n- \u00b7 Develop a culture promoting resilience for the Group;\n- \u00b7 Raise resilience awareness and best practices, within their scope of work; and\n- \u00b7 Implement initiatives aimed at increasing the Group resilience, by decreasing the risk exposure and/or increasing its level of preparedness.\n\n## Hybrid risk management model\n\nSchneider Electric uses a hybrid risk management model. It means that while there is a Group Risk Management function and experts in charge of setting risk management mechanisms, establishing policies, and other activities, ownership of the risks belongs to the Business Units, Operating Divisions, or Global Functions who are responsible for deploying the central framework to manage their risks.\n\nThese are organized in three lines of defense:\n\n- \u00b7 1st line of defense: Business and Risk Owners Operating Divisions and Business Units take ownership of how the risks specific to their local market or function are managed on the ground, following the procedures set by the second line of defense.\n- \u00b7\n- 2nd line of defense: Group Risk Management, Internal Control, Risk Overseers Set risk management mechanisms, advise and monitor the first\n- line of defense, helps them build action plans to improve identification, mitigation, and control of risks.\n- \u00b7 3rd line of defense: Internal Audit Independent body, not dedicated to a specific risk area or region. Assesses if the first line of defense is managing risks\n- properly and if the second line of defense is setting mechanisms and supporting the first line adequately.\n\nThe section hereafter (3.2.2) goes over the three lines of defense and gives more detail about the hybrid risk management model and the governing bodies.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

It started in 2021, with most of the deployment having taken place in 2022 and continuing in 2023. The objective is to strengthen the overall risk management at Schneider Electric, with a more robust Enterprise Risk Management team to implement and deploy advanced mechanisms, support the first and second lines of defense, and consolidate and report to Senior Management and Audit & Risk Committee. It will ensure that the maturity level and effectiveness of the governance and organization, management systems, processes and controls, and communication and training will all increase.\n\nEngaging in this journey until 2024, the Group expect to reach optimized maturity level in the way it develops and maintains a Group risk appetite framework. 2022 has been a year of deployment with standardized risk reviews engaged for most of the Group's risk categories and geographical zones. It has resulted in an increased risk management maturity, and a consolidation of the risk exposure at the corporate level. The deployment will continue in 2023, with risk reviews done in a more robust and systematic way, while also taking care of subsidiaries.\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management framework is deployed by the Group Risk Management department, which reports to Senior Management and sits within the Governance function. The Group Risk Management department is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 The creation, deployment, and maintenance of the Enterprise Risk Management framework;\n- \u00b7 The planning and execution of risk reviews across various Group entities; and\n- \u00b7 The consolidation, in comprehensive reports, of the risks identified and assessed, of the Group's level of mitigation, and of the roadmaps in place to reduce the risk exposure and increase preparedness.\n\nThis framework relies on a network of Risk Overseers (in charge of supervising a specific risk category) and risk owners (in charge of managing risks efficiently with the support of all assets provided). The Group Risk Management team engages with these stakeholders and supports them to increase their risk management maturity by driving several types of assessments and by evolving standardized methodologies.\n\nThe Group Risk Management department strives to not only manage event triggered risks, but rather to maximize value through more informed and calculated risk taking. With this mandate, it studies strategic issues and long-term strategy and continuously monitors emerging trends, risks, and opportunities, sometimes with the support of risk intelligence companies.\n\n## Internal Control\n\nIn close collaboration with Risk Overseers and the Group Risk Management team, the Internal Control function uses a risk-based approach to define the key controls to be embedded in the processes and to monitor the effectiveness of the controls.\n\nThe Internal Control department reports to the Group Chief Accounting Officer. It had an average of 40 internal controllers in 2022, with a central team leading and co-ordinating the Group Internal Control activities and a network of Internal Controllers for day-to-day operations. The main objectives of Internal Control department is to:\n\n- \u00b7 Define key controls to be embedded in end-to-end processes following a risk-based approach in close collaboration with Risk Overseers and subject matter experts - in line with the recommendations of the French Financial Market Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers (AMF)) reference framework;\n- \u00b7 Ensure internal control is anchored in the managerial practices for a better control environment. Drive self-assessment campaign, accuracy of controls, self-assessment, and compliance to minimize risks and protect assets;\n- \u00b7 Monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls and support timely remediation of deficiencies in a sustainable manner;\n- \u00b7 Partner with operations to increase standardization of key controls across the Group for effective and efficient operations; and\n- \u00b7 Support design and implementation of anti-corruption and bribery controls.\n\n## Risk Overseers\n\nThe various Group functional departments and Risk Overseers assist the Enterprise Risk Management team with the identification and evaluation of risks. Each department defines and rolls out risk management systems in its activity sector and ensures the consistency of actions undertaken in the Business Units and Operating Divisions. Risk Overseers and Global Functions assist all Group entities by facilitating the sharing of risk management and internal control best practice.\n\nRisk Overseers are global leaders and experts overseeing risks within their scope.\n\nDepending on the risk category, Risk Overseers must:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and manage the adoption of regulatory and legal standards;\n- \u00b7 Initiate first risk identification as a base for risk-specific programs design;\n- \u00b7 Own risk-specific policies and ensure proper deployment; specifically ensuring they have adequate representation in the Trust Charter, the Group's Code of Conduct;\n- \u00b7 Define risk-specific processes and controls;\n- \u00b7 Engage in the annual risk assessments run by the Group Risk Management team;\n- \u00b7 Perform risk maturity self-assessments on a regular basis; and\n- \u00b7 Define risk thresholds and review them regularly.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Additionally, this community partners closely with the senior business leaders. This has been done to ensure a simple structure so that technology can be close to business and to maintain consistency across all Divisions of Schneider Electric.\n\nThe Human Resources department is responsible for deploying and ensuring the application of procedures and compliance with HR regulations concerning employee development, promoting diversity, and well-being. The department is also responsible for establishing guidelines on rewards and compensation, hiring, on and off boarding, and learning, amongst other human resourcesrelated duties.\n\nThe Procurement department within the Supply Chain function is responsible for establishing guidelines concerning the Procurement department's structuring and procedures, relationships between buyers and vendors, and procedures governing product quality, level of service, and compliance with environmental and safety standards.\n\nGlobal Functions also issue, adapt, and distribute policies, target procedures, and instructions to Business Units and individuals assigned to handle their specific duties. Global Functions have correspondents who work with the Internal Control department to establish and update the Key Internal Controls deployed across the Group.\n\n## 3rd line of defense: Internal Audit\n\nIn accordance with professional standards governing this activity, Internal Audit independently assesses the effectiveness of internal control and risk management procedures given that, irrespective of how well they are implemented and how strictly they are deployed, these procedures can only provide reasonable assurance - and not an absolute guarantee - against all risks.\n\nThe Internal Audit department reports to Senior Management. It had an average headcount of 20 global auditors and 26 regional auditors in 2022. The internal auditors are responsible for ensuring that, at the level of each Business Unit, Global Function, or Operational Entity in the countries where the Group is operating:\n\n- \u00b7 The identification and control of risks is performed and relevant remediation is put in place;\n- \u00b7 Significant financial, management, and operating information is accurate and reliable;\n- \u00b7 Compliance with laws and regulations and with the Group's policies, standards, and procedures is ensured;\n- \u00b7 Compliance with the instructions of the Chairman & CEO is ensured;\n- \u00b7 Acquisition of resources is carried out at a competitive cost, and their protection is ensured;\n- \u00b7 Expenses are properly engaged and monitored; and\n- \u00b7 Correct integration and control of acquisitions are ensured.",

        "page_content": "An annual internal audit plan is drawn up based on a combination of a risk-based and audit universe coverage-based approach. The risk-based dimension is embedding risk and control concerns identified by Senior Management, taking into account the results of the Group Enterprise Risk Management system, the outcome of past audits, the results of Key Internal Control self-assessments returned by the Business Units, and other indicators such as the evolution of a set of financial metrics, the Corruption Perception Index, and the recent replacement of holders of key managerial roles as the case may be. When necessary, the audit plan is adjusted during the year to include special requests from Senior Management.\n\nAfter each internal audit, a report is issued setting out the auditors' findings and recommendations for the Business Unit, Global Function, or Operational Entity audited. The management of audited entities or audited domains is requested to define for each recommendation an action plan aiming at implementing corrective actions. Measures are taken to monitor implementation of the recommendations and specific follow up audits are conducted if necessary.\n\n## 3.3  Risk management mechanisms\n\n## 3.3.1  One unique risk taxonomy is established to have a common risk language\n\nOne of the core assets of the Group risk management practice is a unique risk taxonomy, used by the different domains within the organization (Sales Regions, Business Units, Global Functions). It is key to ensure all Group entities speak the same risk language and collaborate efficiently on decreasing the risk exposure. This document is updated once a year based on the relevance and characteristics of identified risks in a business context. The taxonomy contains several risk classification levels, described in the illustration below.\n\nEach risk is mapped to the pieces of the risk flywheel (see section 3.3.3, page 301) to ensure there are no gaps in the Group monitoring and mitigation of the risk universe.\n\n| Risk Level    | Description                                                                                                           | Objective                    | Responsible                               | Example                                         |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Risk nature   | Differentiation between three  risk natures: event triggered  risks, management practice  risks, trend driven risks.  | Making  strategic  decisions | Senior  Management                        | Event triggered risk                            |\n| Risk category | All risk categories included   in the Taxonomy are mapped   to a Risk Overseer who is  responsible for all assets and | Taking  accountability       | Risk Overseers                            | Third party  screening &  sanctions  compliance |\n| Risk type     | More specific risks under   a Risk Category.

This is complemented with specific strategy cadences.\n\nFor the event triggered risks , the objective is to reduce the risk exposure and increase the level of preparedness. Examples of the assets used to achieve this goal include: crisis management and business continuity planning, strong policies and procedures adoption, and continuous risk and incidents monitoring.\n\n## For management practice risks\n\n,\n\nthe objective is to avoid or eliminate occurrences cost-effectively with a risk culture and compliance model embedded in Operating Divisions, strong policies and procedures adoption, and an effective set of internal controls.",

        "page_content": "## 3.3.3  Each Risk Overseer is in charge of moving the risk flywheel for his/her respective domain\n\n## Risk taxonomy\n\nThe Group established a unique risk taxonomy to have a common language with all stakeholders. All risk categories included in the risk taxonomy are mapped to a Risk Overseer who is responsible for all assets and processes around the risk flywheel (see figure below). The risk taxonomy is reviewed once per year, with inputs from the three lines of defense.\n\n## Trust Charter\n\nThe Trust Charter is the Group's Code of Conduct. Each section is mapped to the risk taxonomy and has the goal, among others, to bring a level of awareness to employees that will contribute to decreasing the Group risk exposure. See more details about the Trust Charter in Chapter 2, section 2.2.1.\n\n## Policies\n\nA policy is an official statement and process description produced and supported by the leadership team and states where the organization stands on important topics or issues. They create the backbone of an organization and are important for all stakeholders to enable and reinforce trust. Each Risk Overseer is responsible for ensuring needed policies are written and published, then, that they are implemented, communicated, and their implementation is being monitored. See more details about policies in Chapter 2, section 2.1.7.\n\n## Mandatory PMI 1 tasks\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management framework applies not only to the Group's core and legacy activities, but also to recently acquired companies as part of the post-acquisition integration process. Trust Standards are defined to ensure the integration process is addressing risks and compliance matters, meeting legal obligations, creating a more standardized back-end, and providing clarity regarding integration requirements across the portfolio of companies.\n\n## Key Internal Controls\n\nThe Group uses a set of internal controls that is reviewed and updated annually, with the feedback of the Risk Overseers and subject matter experts (among others). One of the goals of internal controls is to assess the effectiveness of the mitigation put in place to address a risk. For the controls that are risk specific, the outcome of the yearly self-assessment campaign is twofold: provide a high-level view of the situation to the top management and Risk Overseers, and provide action plans to the risk owners to improve their mitigation, if relevant.\n\n## Key risk metrics\n\nRisk metrics are defined to measure the Group risk exposure for each risk category and type. They are defined by the Risk Overseers and reviewed on a regular basis. Defining risk thresholds helps to foster a risk centric culture and take business decisions based on risk appetite.\n\n## Risk reviews and yearly risk assessments\n\nThe Group's entities perform frequent risk assessments.\n\nThere are three types of assessments:\n\n- \u00b7 Zone or country risk reviews, where the leadership team and risk owners review the top risks affecting their territory and legal entities, as well as the mitigation in place.\n- \u00b7 Function or risk category reviews, where the leadership team and Risk Overseers review the risks affecting their domain of expertise, as well as the mitigation they put in place.\n- \u00b7 Leadership risk assessment, also called risk matrix, where the leadership team is interviewed about the full Group risk universe, to gain an understanding of the perception of the risk exposure and level of mitigation.\n\nAdditionally, the Internal Audit and Internal Control departments perform consolidated reviews and audits aiming, in particular, to assess the internal control framework and risk management system effectiveness.\n\nFigure 4: Risk flywheel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

It helps drive constant improvements to the ways in which the risk is managed within the Group. Among other things, it ensures the Group takes the right steps towards an optimized risk maturity level including:\n\n- \u00b7 Governance and organization with dynamic resource allocation;\n- \u00b7 Management systems are aligned and optimized across all three lines of defense;\n- \u00b7 Processes and controls rely on digital and advanced analytics to optimize effectiveness and efficiency; and\n- \u00b7 Communication and training are adapted to specific needs, with a measured impact.\n\n## 3.3.4 Risk identification and management\n\n## General risks at the Group level\n\nThe Group Risk Management department conduct interviews to update the list of general risks at Group level each year. In 2022, around 40 of the Group's top leaders were interviewed in addition to external analysts and Board members.\n\nThe risks identified through these interviews are ranked by a risk score (comprising impact and likelihood of occurrence) and level of mitigation.\n\nIn complement of the risks identified through interviews, the Group Risk Management function also consolidates all the risks identified and assessed through the category risk reviews and zone risk reviews. A consensus is then reached on the Group's major risks for which control, monitoring, and mitigation will be prioritized.\n\nRisk factors related to the Group's business, as well as procedures for managing and reducing those risks, are described in 'Key risks and opportunities' in section 3.4 on page 304.\n\nThe results of the yearly risk assessments mentioned in section 3.3.3 (risk matrix, risk reviews) and the analysis of changes from one year to the next contribute to the development of an internal audit plan for the following year. Around two-thirds of the risk categories identified in the Group's risk matrix are audited by the Internal Audit department over a period of five to six years to assess action plans for managing and reducing these risks.\n\n## Local risks at the Business Unit or Operating Division level\n\nLocal risks related to the Company's business are managed first and foremost by the Business Units in conjuction with the Operating Divisions, based on Group guidelines (particularly via the Key Internal Controls). Each subsidiary is responsible for implementing procedures that provide an adequate level of internal control.\n\nThe Operating Divisions implement cross-functional action plans for key risks related to the Company's business identified as being recurrent in the Business Units or as having a material impact at the Group level, as appropriate. The internal control system is adjusted to account for these risks.\n\n## Specific risks related to Projects\n\nThe Projects Risk Management stakeholders define and implement principles and tools designed to manage contractual (such as limitation of liabilities), technical (such as technical discrepancy versus customer specifications), and financial risks (such as factors that may impact margin at solution execution phase).\n\nThe network of Project Risk Managers assesses the risks and mitigations related to major projects in conjunction with the subject matter experts and Tender Managers during the preparation of offers. Project Risk Managers then provide a comprehensive, 360-degree view on project risk and mitigations to support the opportunity approval process.",

The insurance strategy includes the identification and quantification of the main insurable risks, the determination of levels of retention, and the cost benefit analysis of the transfer options. The Risk and Insurance department also defines, proposes, and implements action plans to prevent these risks and protect assets.\n\n## Management of risks by the Global Security department\n\nThe Group's Global Security department defines corporate governance regarding loss prevention in the area of willful acts against property and people.\n\nThe Global Security Group Committee was created in 2017, uniting the Zone Security Leaders. Some of these leaders report directly to the Global Security department and some to local management with functional reporting to Global Security. In close co-operation with the Compliance department and the Risk and Insurance department, Global Security is involved in assessing the nature of risk to our people, as well as defining adequate prevention and protection measures.\n\nGlobal Security provides support to local teams for any security issues (site audit, expatriates or local employee security, security on assignments, etc.). The team also:\n\n- \u00b7 Publishes internally, a table of 'Country Risks' for use in security procedures that are mandatory for people traveling, expatriates, and local employees;\n- \u00b7 Provides daily co-ordination with the Group's worldwide partner in the field of medical and security assistance (International SOS & Control Risks - start of contract in January 2011);\n- \u00b7 Organize, as needed, psychological support in some crisis context (Eutelmed - start of contract in April 2015).\n\nIt brings its methodology to develop emergency plans (evacuation plans, crisis management plans, etc.) and co-ordinates the corporate crisis team (SEECC - Schneider Electric Emergency Coordination Center, created in 2009) each time that it is activated. Global Security also participates in crisis management, in managing the corporate crisis cell, and in supporting local entities (to limit the consequences of the occurrence of certain risks such as civil war, weather events, pandemics, attacks on people, terrorism, etc.). In addition, it regularly organizes Security Audits (R&D centers, head offices, sensitive plants, etc.).\n\nGlobal Security sits on the Group Operations Compliance Committee (previously named Fraud Committee) alongside the Compliance, Internal Audit, and Legal departments. Global Security supports internal investigators as well as contributing to the Group's methodology and procedures to conduct investigations properly and in accordance with the law.\n\n## Management of cyber and product security and associated risks across Schneider Electric\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Product Security departments inside the Governance function define the Company's cyber and product security strategies and approaches. The departments are accountable for protecting Schneider Electric's business operations; securing the digital assets and offers for Schneider Electric and subsidiaries; managing the Cyber Risk Register; driving cybersecurity awareness across the Company; owning the creation, maintenance, and enforcement mechanisms of cyber and product security policies; ensuring the execution of cyber and product security initiatives across Schneider Digital functions and entities; and managing the Cybersecurity Incident Prevention, Detection, and Response process.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The assessment is the result of the process performed as part of the overall risk management mechanism described in 'Risk identification and management', section 3.3.4 on page 302. The impact considered for the assessment is the potential net impact which corresponds to the potential gross impact (financial/ human/ legal/ reputation), after having taken in consideration the current mitigation measures, as well as the probability of occurrence of this risk. The assessment by Schneider Electric of this level of materiality may be changed at any time, in particular should new facts, whether external or specific to the Group, come to light.\n\nThe

Event triggered risks\n\n## 1.1 Risk of cybersecurity on Schneider Electric infrastructure and its digital ecosystem (including connected products used as a gateway to attack Group's customers and partners)\n\n## Risk description\n\nSchneider Electric, like other organizations with a similar global footprint and presence, is exposed to the risk of cyberattacks and data privacy breaches. The Energy Management and Industrial Automation sectors, in particular, are becoming more digital with pervasive Internet of Things (IoT) usage and augmented data being major accelerators for mobility, the cloud, pervasive sensing, big data, and analytics.\n\nAs an industrial and technology company, the Group has IT and Operational Technology (OT) activities spread over dozens of R&D sites, and more than 200 production and logistic units. On those sites, OT systems have been converging more and more with IT systems, especially through the use of IoT, expanding the overall attack surface.\n\nThe digitalization of products, including native connectivity, is increasing the exposure to cybersecurity risk, where connected products and digital offers (e.g., remotely managed services like 'Advisor') at Schneider Electric or customers' sites could be used as a gateway for malicious cyberattacks. Additionally, the move from a product-centered business model to a service-oriented business model with software and augmented data naturally increases cybersecurity risks, such as data breaches and intellectual property theft.\n\nSchneider Electric Exchange is an ecosystem collaboration platform with over 50,000 users, approximately 300 leverageable applications, more than 150 service providers, and around 100 communities. These types of digital offers and platforms, if compromised, could negatively impact a customer's business and consequently affect the service quality, profitability, and reputation of Schneider Electric.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nTo mitigate the risk of Schneider Electric's connected products being used as a gateway to attack Group's customers and partners, the Product & Systems Security Office (PSO) is reinforced with a strong mandate of developing products and securing the ecosystem in conformity with cybersecurity standards (such as the ISO 27000 suite and IEC 62443). As an illustration, the IoT Cloud Platform (EcoStruxure \u2122 Technology Platform) has implemented controls that are mappable against the ISO 27001 standard.\n\nSchneider Electric follows a Secure Development Lifecycle process to build cybersecurity into its products, even before the design stage. In 2019, security and privacy design were enhanced with a new Secure Development Lifecycle and certified to IEC 62443-4-1.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince 2020, all digital offers (mainly 'Advisor' software suites) were assessed in the framework of digital security and privacy conformance.\n\nSchneider Electric enforces digital security and privacy conformance for products, systems, software, platforms, applications, and digital offers through security reviews and, when applicable, the Digital Certification process.\n\nSchneider Electric addresses cybersecurity vulnerabilities affecting products, software, and systems to support the security and safety of our customers. Schneider Electric works collaboratively with researchers, Cyber Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), and asset owners to ensure that accurate information is provided in a timely fashion to adequately protect customer installations. In case of a cyber incident, a process of response, connecting, and debriefing is organized with partners and customers.\n\nIn line with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (1) with its five concurrent and continuous functions, Schneider Electric has five stages of risk management as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify: Schneider Electric has identified cyber risks stemming from main business scenarios (2) with its Cyber Risk Register, including assets categories to be protected known as HighValue Assets.\n- \u00b7 Protect: Cyber threats are mitigated by implementing cyber practices and capabilities, policy-driven controls, and enforcing mechanisms. For example, the Group implemented a Data Protection program, Source Code Management framework, and System & Solution security program. Moreover, 99% of employees were trained on cybersecurity in 2022. In addition, specific employee categories (e.g., IT administrators, customer facing employees) received mandatory trainings for risks linked to their activity.\n\n## \u00b7 Detect:\n\n- - Independent 'reality checks' were performed: three crosscutting internal audits and external assessments.\n- - Multiple cyber risk assessments were completed in 2022 by the Group's cybersecurity consulting partners.\n- \u00b7 Respond: Global cyber incident management and response process is in place. Events and incidents are monitored through a Security Operations Center, driven jointly with the Group's partners.\n- \u00b7 Recover: Schneider Electric's posture is continuously revisited and adapted through reality checks including emergency, business, and IT recovery and improvement plans across the Company. Furthermore, the Group is conducting regular crisis simulation exercises on different scenarios.\n- (1) National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce - https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework\n- (2) 1.

        "page_content": "## 3.4  Key risks and opportunities\n\n## 1. Event triggered risks\n\n## 1.2 Export controls\n\n## Risk description\n\nInternational, foreign, and national export control laws and regulations govern the transfer of goods, services, and technologies within a country or between countries and/or their nationals. Elements that may trigger restrictions and licensing requirements may include, but are not limited to, countries, parties, product, and end-uses.\n\nSchneider Electric being a multi-national corporation (MNC) with international operations spanning across more than 100 different countries worldwide, must constantly ensure full compliance to such laws and regulations by implementing a robust corporate export control compliance program. Any implications may result in a significant impact on the Group's businesses, results, reputation, and financial position.\n\nAlbeit that Schneider Electric's product portfolio only has a limited product range that may have dual-use goods features as well as non-dual-use goods (e.g., breakers) that may be used in sensitive applications; restriction or licensing requirements may apply to these products, especially if associated with politically sensitive countries and destinations.\n\n## 1.3 Product quality\n\n## Risk description\n\nSchneider Electric has more than 290,000 references produced in 162 factories, spread across 40 countries around the world.\n\nOperating in essential industries, product quality and safety is a critical topic for the Group as product malfunctions or failures could result in Schneider Electric incurring liabilities for tangible or intangible damages, or personal injuries. The failure of a product, system, or solution may involve costs related to the product recall, result in new development expenditure, and consume technical and economic resources.\n\nSchneider Electric's products are also subject to multiple quality and safety controls and regulations and are governed by both national and supranational standards. New or more stringent standards or regulations could result in capital investment or costs of specific measures for compliance.\n\nThe above-mentioned costs could have a significant impact on the profitability and cash equivalent of the Group. The business reputation of Schneider Electric could also be negatively impacted. Indeed, the Group has been impacted by several recalls recently, more or less ranging from \u20ac10 million to \u20ac40 million, depending on the case.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nIn 2022, the Group launched a specific program called Quality Reinvention to continue to strengthen quality for design, manufacturing, supplier, and field tools and processes, and to settle 'quality' inside of the Company culture. This is extended to all the value chain and leverages processes digitization across all entities that have an impact to quality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nSchneider Electric has comprehensive policies and processes to ensure compliance with applicable export control laws and regulations (Schneider Electric Export Control program) and to mitigate the above described risks. The Global Export Control Center of Excellence, as part of the Global Legal and Risk Management function, oversees the monitoring and enforcement of the Schneider Electric Export Control program.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Export Control program may include, but is not limited to: embargo and restricted country, denied party, dual-use goods, and sensitive end-user screenings; incorporation of export control provision in the main sales and procurement contractual template; and conducting of regular awareness and online and classroom training sessions for all relevant Schneider Electric employees.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Export Control program will continue its enhancement and updates to ensure compliance with applicable export control laws and regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis program includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Launch of the new Quality Fundamentals for Design domain, to increase both robustness and reliability of new offers; CS&Q function puts a strong focus on stopping any launches that do not comply to quality standards. In addition, roles and responsibilities got better defined and the number of resources focused on design quality has greatly increased.\n- \u00b7 Unification of all manufacturing quality initiatives, fundamentals and principles into the Schneider Performance System; CS&Q function puts strong focus on the reduction of high-risk activities through fully automated and interlocked systems.\n- \u00b7 Significant strengthening of supplier quality processes by adopting high maturity industry standards (i.e., APQP and IATF); CS&Q function strives to secure an ever more robust supplier, parts and supplies qualification process, and improved performance management.\n- \u00b7 Expansion of the quality system into Field and Project Execution, to secure the right standards in this area.\n\nTo ensure that the culture of quality supports efforts being made, three main changes have been introduced: 1) Quality became part of our Trust Charter to make sure that everyone understands that a quality deviation could become a compliance issue; 2) Quality became an 'essential' as part of the values that anchor our culture 3) 'Quality academy' is being created to allow learning of both, what is quality and non-quality, and to increase the technical knowledge of our teams.",

        "page_content": "## 1.4 Competition laws\n\n## Risk description\n\nSchneider Electric's products are sold in markets worldwide and are subject to national and supranational competition laws and antitrust regulations.\n\nBoth currently or in the past, Group entities including, but not limited to, entities in Brazil, Pakistan, Belgium, France, and Spain have been directly or indirectly cited in antitrust proceedings or investigated.\n\nIn Pakistan and Belgium, the Group inherited, and subsequently discontinued, local operations from AREVA. These operations were investigated and sanctioned by the World Bank and the Belgium Competition Authority respectively.\n\nIn France, further to on-site investigations conducted in 2018 concerning electrical distribution activities in France, Schneider Electric SE, received on July 4, 2022, a statement of objections (notification de griefs) from the French Competition Authority (FCA) alleging that the pricing autonomy of some distributors in the French market would have been limited, in breach of competition rules.\n\nSchneider Electric strongly disagrees with the allegations of the statement of objections and submitted its response to the FCA on October 4, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis statement of objections is the first step of an adversarial procedure and is without prejudice to the final assessment that will be made independently by the board (College) of the FCA.\n\nIn Spain, the local subsidiary was indicted for anti-competitive behavior related to a previously owned subsidiary. The investigation was concluded in February 2020 without any significant consequence for the Group.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe whistleblowing system of Trust Line for employees and external stakeholders such as suppliers is managed to identify any inappropriate practice or behavior with competitors or business partners that may be reported.\n\nFurthermore, internal controls and internal audit missions have been reinforced on compliance risks, including in respect of competition and antitrust risks.\n\nA revised Compliance Due Diligence program for mergers and acquisitions was issued to strengthen upfront identification of compliance issues with potential acquisition targets.\n\nThe Group launched the Trust Charter in September 2021, with reinforced guidance regarding competition and antitrust rules, and issued various other policies and directives related to competition and anti-corruption.\n\n## 1.5 Corruption linked to B2B and project business\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe exposure of the Group to corruption risk has been increasing for several years, due to the expansion of the Group's activities in new economies, especially in Asia and Africa, through organic growth, and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe business model of the Group relies on a large ecosystem of partners, including more than 53,000 suppliers throughout the world representing a procurement volume in excess of \u20ac16 billion, and also, resellers and distributors. This ecosystem may represent a risk for the Group, being accountable for activities performed on its behalf, and in regards to potential conflicts of interest or unethical solicitations.\n\nIn addition, the Group is participating in complex projects involving a large range of partners in sectors at risk, such as oil and gas, and with end-users from the public sector in countries at risk.\n\nOver the past years, the increase of law enforcement by public authorities, higher press coverage of fines imposed on companies, and new regulations requiring a strong compliance program have significantly changed the potential impact of corruption risks.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nSchneider Electric has created an Ethics & Compliance department, chaired by a dedicated Chief Compliance Officer, notably in charge of defining an anti-corruption program based on three inseparable pillars.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFirst, Senior Management sets Schneider Electric's zero tolerance for corruption and promotes a culture of integrity throughout the Group and its operations. In addition, middle management walks the talk by complying with rules, spreading the right message in their teams, and supporting the reporting of misconducts.\n\nSecond, a Group-wide Ethics & Compliance risk assessment was carried-out in the second half of 2021, which led to regional and Group level risk maps on corruption matters. Related action plans were deployed in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThird, the identified risks are managed by means of effective measures and procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Code of Conduct and policies - As stated in our Trust Charter, Schneider Electric's Code of Conduct, and Anti-Corruption Policy, Schneider Electric is committed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and applies a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption. Two operational policies complete the set: Gifts & Hospitality Policy and Conflict of Interest Policy.\n- \u00b7 Training and awareness - 97% of employees exposed to corruption risks have been trained thanks to the yearly mandatory Anti-corruption e-learning.

Event triggered risks\n\n## 1.5 Corruption linked to B2B and project business (continued)\n\n- \u00b7 Third parties' integrity - Schneider Electric has put in place a Business Agent Policy and related procedures for assessing its intermediaries. In 2022, 100% of direct customers have been screened. A pilot was also launched to have an automatic real-time screening of all direct customers. Moreover, the Group is working to screen its vendors and started an initial screening of its strategic direct vendors in 2022. Moreover, all compliancerelated aspects are part of the due diligence undertaken for mergers and acquisitions, in line with the specific M&A Compliance framework put in place in February 2020.\n- \u00b7 Specific accounting controls - Schneider Electric has developed accounting control procedures to ensure that books, records, and accounts are not used to hide fraud. Since June 2021, work has been initiated to strengthen specific anticorruption controls for a defined set of sensitive-judged accounts and transactions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Whistleblowing - A global whistleblowing system, available to employees and external stakeholders, is also managed to combat this risk. In 2022, 645 employee and 74 external stakeholder alerts have been received and managed through follow-up inquiries.\n- \u00b7 Corrective actions - Deficiencies associated with the implementation of procedures are analyzed to identify their cause and correct them.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and audit - Second-level controls and internal audit missions were reinforced on compliance risks with several audits performed.\n\n## 1.6 Human rights and safety issues through the value chain\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe exposure of the Group to human rights and health and safety risks has been increasing for several years, due to the expansion of the Group's activities in countries with lesser regulatory framework regarding human rights. Some specific topics are emerging quite rapidly, for example, as the context (global warming, famine, war, geopolitics etc.) is pushing people to cross borders and to work elsewhere, migrant workers protection is becoming a key topic for companies.\n\nSchneider Electric's procurement volume represents more than \u20ac16 billion with more than 53,000 suppliers. As part of the Duty of Vigilance program in the supply chain, Schneider Electric has performed a risk analysis through its network of suppliers and identified potential risks on several topics including human rights and health and safety.\n\nThe occurrence of these risks with third parties may result in the following impacts on Schneider Electric:\n\n## Reputation\n\nSchneider Electric's image may be negatively impacted by third parties who:\n\n- \u00b7 Do not respect human rights or safety rules for their workers; and/or\n- \u00b7 Are conducting business in a non-compliant or illegal manner.\n\n## Disruption of supply chain\n\nIt may occur due to:\n\n- \u00b7 Short-term termination of relations with a supplier; and/or\n- \u00b7 Events resulting from a lack of safety or insufficient protective measures (e.g., fire prevention) that may affect the supply of components.\n\n## Legal\n\nOver the past two years, laws regarding human rights protection, such as modern slavery matters in Australia, the European Union's new framework on restrictive measures against serious human rights violations and abuses, or the German Supply Chain Act, have increased. Higher coverage of fines imposed on companies, and new regulations requiring a strong compliance program have significantly changed the impact of human rights and health and safety violations risks.\n\nSchneider Electric expects that the exposure will continue to grow, in reference to the current drafting of a Duty of Vigilance directive at European level, as well as the European Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020-2024, which sets out ambitions and priorities for the next five years in this field.\n\nIn addition, the current discussions on human rights due diligence framework at United Nations level, supported by the Global Compact that Schneider Electric is part of, will certainly increase the pressure on the private sector to tackle human rights challenges in the supply chain.\n\n## 2022 specific events\n\nThe competent court regarding Duty of Vigilance (DoV) cases was confirmed on December 22, 2021, by the French High Court. The Paris judicial court will have jurisdiction over such cases, which is composed of dedicated professional lawyers. Regarding the cases related to non-compliance with the DoV, there has been no update on the substance of the cases.\n\nIn 2022, four new cases have been opened regarding noncompliance to the French DoV. These cases concerned freedom of association, social and environmental rights, or human rights violations. At the end of 2022, seven litigations and six formal notices were pending regarding the French DoV.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The European Commission published a draft proposal for the European Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive on February 23, 2022. This directive should be adopted in 2023 and enter into force in 2024. The text of this European Directive is very close to the French DoV law and will concern Schneider Electric's operations and supply chain (potentially Tier 2 suppliers and above). Regarding the actual draft of this Directive, approximately 50,000 companies based in Europe should be concerned; in comparison, approximatively 260 companies are concerned by the French DoV.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nHuman rights are part of the Ethics & Compliance program which is managed by the Ethics & Compliance Committee and the Legal and Corporate Citizenship departments. More specifically, human rights are managed by the Corporate Citizenship department with the support of the Ethics & Compliance Committee in regards to risk identification through risk assessment as well as risk detection, with the whistleblowing system available for employees and for external stakeholders.\n\nRegarding training, e-learning on the Trust Charter is mandatory for all employees and, in 2022, focused on human rights and health and safety amongst other ethics and compliance topics. 93% of employees completed the training by the end of 2022.\n\nSuppliers are selected according to the 'Schneider Electric Supplier Quality Management' system, which includes sustainable development criteria weighing 15% of the total evaluation of a supplier. These criteria include human rights and health and safety topics.\n\n## 1.7 Counterparty risk\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe Group has a particularly wide international presence (more than 115 countries), with revenue almost equally spread across the four regions (Asia Pacific, Western Europe, North America, Rest of the World), and 41% of the revenue generated in new economies.\n\nThe Group is therefore facing multiple counterparty risks, as any economic downturn could lead to local liquidity issues with consequences in terms of cash collection and delay of payments from the customers, affecting adversely the Group's cash conversion rate.\n\nThe Group is also exposed to counterparty risks coming from financial operation with financial institutions. It includes activities such as deposits and asset management and transactions implying flows in future value dates.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, 13% of trade receivables were overdue, of which 3.5% by more than three months (refer to Note 16 in 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', section 5 of Chapter 5, page 456).\n\nIn 2019, Schneider Electric organized the Global Suppliers Day. During this day, the Trust Charter was introduced to suppliers.\n\nAs part of the Group's five-year objective for 2021 - 2025, strategic suppliers are requested to submit themselves to an ISO 26000 evaluation. Consistent with a continuous improvement effort, these suppliers have achieved on average a +6.3 points increase between 2018 and 2020 and a +1.2 points increase in 2022 to reach an average score of 58.6.\n\nSchneider Electric has built a supplier vigilance plan in which risky suppliers are identified using criteria that take into account the geographical location of the supplier, the technologies, and the processes used. An audit plan is then built to perform either on-site supplier audits or remote self-assessments. When nonconformances are identified, corrective actions are deployed.\n\nThe suppliers are then re-audited to verify that the actions have remediated the non-conformances. In 2022, in the scope of 2021 - 2025 Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) objective #17 '4,000 suppliers assessed under our 'Vigilance Program'', the Group conducted 223 on-site audits and 657 remote selfassessments. At the end of 2022, 94% of non-conformances from 2021 have been closed. The supplier vigilance plan also includes an internal training program for Schneider Electric Procurement teams and workshops with suppliers. The Group has also defined, in 2022, a specific program with the objective to ensure that 100% of Schneider Electric's strategic suppliers provide decent work to their employees, in the scope of Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) indicator #6. The program launched in 2022. Schneider Electric is also currently developing a program to ensure 'social excellence' for the Group's suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nFinancial transactions are entered into with carefully selected counterparties and adapted terms and conditions are included in contracts with customers. Banking counterparties are chosen according to the customary criteria, including the credit rating issued by an independent rating agency. Group policy consists of diversifying counterparty risks and periodic controls are performed to check compliance with the related rules.\n\nIn addition, the Group takes out substantial credit insurance and uses other types of guarantees (letters of credit and bank guarantees) to limit the risk of losses on trade accounts receivable.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the amount of the provision for receivables impairment is EUR 489 million (as described in Note 16 in 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', section 5 of Chapter 5, page 456).\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Event triggered risks\n\n## 1.8 Currency exchange risk\n\n## Description of risk of fluctuation of exchange rates\n\nThe Group's international operations and the particularly wide international presence expose it to the risk of fluctuation of exchange rates.\n\nFluctuations in exchange rates between the reporting currencies of the Group entities and the currencies of transactions can have an impact on the Group's results and distort year-on-year performance comparisons. The same applies to the fluctuations between euro and the reporting currencies, in a more significant proportion.\n\nThe main exposure of the Group in terms of currency exchange risks is related to the US dollar, Chinese yuan, and currencies linked to the US dollar.\n\nIn 2022, revenue in foreign currencies amounted EUR 27.29 billion, including around EUR 9.9 billion in US dollars and EUR 4.8 billion in Chinese yuan.\n\nThe Group estimates that in the current structure of its operations, a 10% appreciation of the euro compared to the US dollar would have a translation effect of around minus EUR 147 million on adjusted EBITA.\n\nThe result of exchange gains and losses of 2022 amounts to EUR -27 million (as described in Note 7 in 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', section 5 of Chapter 5, page 446).\n\n## Monitoring and management of the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates\n\nThe Group manages its exposure to transactional currency risk to reduce the sensitivity of earnings to changes in exchange rates. Receivables and payables of the Group's subsidiaries denominated in currency other than their functional currency are hedged primarily by means of rebalancing assets and liabilities per currency (natural hedge).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore than 20 currencies are involved, with the US dollar, the Chinese yuan, the Singapore dollar, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar and Swedish krona representing the most significant sources of those risk.\n\nDepending on market conditions, risks in the main currencies may be hedged based on cash flow forecasting using contracts that expire in 12 months or less.\n\nThe financial instruments used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates are described in Note 23 in 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', section 5 of Chapter 5, page 468.\n\n## Description of risk of deliverability of currencies\n\nThe Group has a particularly wide international presence (more than 115 countries), which consists in purchasing and selling, intragroup and outside group, goods and services in various currencies.\n\nThe Group is therefore facing the risk that the currencies of purchasing and selling are the subject of interdictions or restrictions linked to geopolitical contexts, access to foreign currencies, currency control, or other reasons. The Group estimates that in the current structure of its operations, such limitations and interdictions might arise from some countries with emerging economies.\n\n## Monitoring and management of the risk of deliverability in currencies\n\nThe Group policy consists in the diversification enabled by the widespread geographical presence and follow up of such risk to reduce it, when needed through repatriation of cash exposed.\n\n## 2. Trend driven risks\n\n## 2.1 Operational disruption due to global political and economic disruptions\n\n## Risk description\n\nStable trade is beneficial for economic growth. Trends of increased mercantilism is leading towards possibly long-term regionalization of trade around the United States, China, Russia, Europe, and India poles. Regionalized, rather than globally balanced government regulations and policies on digitization, circularity, carbon, supply chain management, and others could handicap Schneider's offer development efficiency. This may force the Group to significantly adapt operations, for example through redundant efforts, and result in negative impacts on the Group's profitability. In addition to the trade regionalization trend, technology decoupling, specifically between the United States and China, has been observed through increased regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the global trends above, the Group acknowledges upcoming potential challenges caused by a lingering energy crisis and monetary tightening, negatively impacting economic activities across the world. It will result, to a degree to be determined, in heightened social, political, and economic risks.\n\nAs a global company operating in more than 115 countries, Schneider is increasingly impacted by this acceleration of regional (versus global) trade and new technology policies are putting pressure on supply chains in the forms of both tariff and non-tariff barriers.\n\nThe armed conflict in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions is another example of challenges the Group is facing and could face in the future in other contexts. This is covered in 'Specific events 2022', on page 318.",

        "page_content": "As such, trade wars and sanctions compliance could disrupt Schneider Electric's operations and global supply chain. The above-mentioned combination of both nationally orientated tariff and non-tariff burden could increase the cost to market and potentially adversely impact Group profitability. It also increases quality risks as the Group could be forced to work with new suppliers.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nTo mitigate the risk on supply chain efficiencies, tariff impacts, and sanctions compliance, Schneider Electric has implemented a multi-hub organization. The Group has R&D and supply chain activities, suppliers, and commercial networks in the main international hubs, which are North America, Europe, India and Asia. In this multi-local context, Schneider Electric can rebalance\n\nits activities across geographies. A strong focus is given to duplicating active R&D, factories, and suppliers in different hubs through a global orchestration, in order to be resilient and flexible when needed.\n\nThis setup has proved pertinent as the Group has demonstrated a solid resilience over the past years' crises, from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 to the armed conflict in Ukraine in 2022, and the increased decoupling between the United States and China over the last years.\n\nSchneider Electric uses prospective scenarios planning, focusing on geopolitics and trade. While the pace of external changes continues at a historically unprecedented scale regionally, global teams are working across stakeholders from Business Units, Regional Operations, and Transversal Functions (i.e., Finance, Supply Chain, Legal, Marketing, R&D, HR).\n\n## 2.2 New competitive landscape on energy, technologies, and business models\n\n## Risk description\n\nSchneider Electric operates to make the most of our energy and resources, bridging progress and sustainability for all, which attracts new players and creates a new competitive landscape. Indeed, the energy industry is undergoing major transformations and disruptions driven by the following main trends:\n\n- \u00b7 A net-zero world: Pressure on climate change and sustainability call for a change in business practices;\n- \u00b7 Resource scarcity and resource security: Increased demand for energy efficiency solutions with necessary acceleration for agility, resilience, transformation, circular and shared economy, and the creation of new business models;\n- \u00b7 An All Digital world: ISncreasing influence of digital giants and software players; and\n- \u00b7 An All Electric world: Oil majors urged to reduce their impacts on carbon emissions.\n\nIn this context, Schneider Electric's competition landscape is evolving, and the Group can now see:\n\n- \u00b7 On one hand, some digital giants, software players, or large companies such as energy majors positioning themselves directly or indirectly - as providers of energy efficiency, which may compete with the digital services Value Propositions currently developed by the Group.\n- \u00b7 On the other hand, more local experts adopted by local markets eager to interact with agnostic solutions and interconnect seamlessly with other players.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt is also noted that the competitive landscape is being shaken by increased challenges for global companies, resulting in:\n\n- \u00b7 Some global companies actively descaling by withdrawing from markets they have been present in for decades;\n- \u00b7 Many battles for innovation being won by new and small players backed by venture capitalist money against established large, global firms; and\n- \u00b7 Local scale disadvantaged consumer companies gaining share from global scale advantaged players.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Group is driving competition performance analysis and follow-up of organizational changes and M&A news and reviewing its competitors peer group and all key players in its environment.\n\nTo anticipate these changes in the competitive landscape, the Group is communicating more widely its values and positioning on climate change and sustainability.\n\nSchneider Electric also reinforces its offer portfolio with acquisitions or investments in software companies, such as RIB Software in 2020, and OSIsoft with AVEVA in 2021.\n\nSchneider Electric provides a full portfolio of solutions for customers (hardware and software) - as EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions - and energy and automation digital solutions for efficiency and sustainability.\n\nIt is also developing the Group's network of partners and reinforcing its Strategic Technology Alliances.\n\nThe Group is keen to integrate the best experts or local players in an open architecture with agnostic solutions, to offer a flexible and scalable solution and ensure the best value for users.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Trend driven risks\n\n## 2.3 Supply chain resilience\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe Group is exposed to supply chain dependency and business continuity risk.\n\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, constrained labor availability, global shortages of raw materials, and unreliable transportation have challenged suppliers and put pressure on global and regional supply chains across industries. Due to market dynamics, these constraints are still taking time to abate, particularly in electronic components such as semiconductors.\n\nSchneider Electric has over 200 industrial and logistics sites globally and is exposed to the physical effects of climate change in the form of more frequent and severe acute weather events. This can result in damage to assets, disruption to business operations, and human consequences. Extreme weather events do not only threaten Schneider Electric's assets and properties but also the overall supply chain. Shortages or logistic bottlenecks in the upstream and downstream supply chain can translate directly into revenue losses, increased costs, and increased working capital requirements. Delays in production and delivery can impact customer experience.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Group's supply chain strategy team is responding to the global supply chain crisis to ensure supply chain flexibility and resilience is continually improved.\n\nThe Group is working closely with its suppliers and research and development teams to qualify alternate components to support increased demand and improve continuity of supply. Components have been mapped according to risk and business impact. As of end 2022, 75% of electronic ranges related risks are covered by strategic safety stocks, and 8% have been fully contained through a multi-source design. 85% of Electromechanic ranges related risks are covered by strategic safety stocks, and 26% have been fully contained through a multi-source design. Our resilience three-year plan targeting building a redundant network, launched in 2021 and named Power of Two, is progressing as planned and was even enriched with new plans; we have roughly implemented half of our Power of Two resilience plans for logistics and manufacturing and should reach 80% completion in 2023, targeting to have all implemented in 2024.\n\nRare earth material supply risk related to potential scarcity in the market has been fully assessed and is acknowledged in our design roadmap. Top strategic partnerships with key suppliers have been reinforced through long-term agreements and C-Level connections, with a particular focus on electronic semiconductor players. A procurement and planning hub will be implemented in next two years to establish a direct connection to critical material sources and manage strategic stocks, demand, and supply.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnergy supply risks in Europe have been assessed and business continuity plans have been anticipated on critical factories and suppliers, while we accelerate move towards net-zero carbon sites and suppliers.\n\nChina dependency is continuously reducing through our plans to produce and source 90% of what we sell in the same region. This ratio reached 80% in 2022 and is planned to progress 1 to 2 points per year over the coming five years. While Taiwan dependency remains high on electronics rank 3 supplies, China-Taiwan tensions triggered more focus and acceleration on reducing dependency although this will be a multi-year roadmap.\n\nLeveraging its network of more than 162 factories and 84 logistic centers globally, and network of seven control towers (in each region), the Group is able to monitor global transport reliability, labor availability, and overall market dynamics in real time, adjusting lead times as necessary, while enacting mitigating actions to ensure lead times are as short as possible. All strategic distribution centers will have a ready-to-deliver backup logistic center; as of today business coverage is 50% and will rise to 80% in 2023. Sites prevention plans including cybersecurity practices are fully deployed and monitored centrally.\n\nTeams are empowered to proactively communicate with customers to continue to support them and their operations.\n\nTo address the risk of supply chain disruptions caused by extreme weather events, Schneider Electric performed a forward-looking climate risk and vulnerability assessment to identify and price the materiality of physical climate risks that may affect its sites, its extended supply chain, and overall economic activities in different scenarios. This assessment combines a qualitative screening of the acute and chronic climate-related perils to calculate the exposure of the Group's economic activities in the short-, medium- (2030) and long-term (2050) under different scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), from 1.5\u00b0C to >4\u00b0C temperature rise by 2100. The Group monitors events across 10,000 nodes (such as ports and critical supplier locations) to shorten reaction time when events occur and minimize business impact.\n\nIn addition, an analysis of criticality of industrial sites is performed by independent experts from Global Risk Consulting (GRC), covering areas including interdependency analyses, alternative supply, and time to recover in case of damage. To date, the magnitude of impact is considered 'medium to low', and likelihood 'as likely as not', however the Group is proactively monitoring this risk.",

Over the past years, the Group has been increasingly focused on building and selling software and digital offerings that help drive a prescription of offers, and help endusers best utilize offers. In doing both, the Group helps users decarbonize, reduce energy consumption, increase resiliency, and optimize occupancy effort. The whole range of software offering is contained in multiple Divisions. It includes, but is not limited to, a range of advisors and edge control products. The Group is also establishing a range of digital services that are designed to support its end-users and partners with added value such as data as a service, analytics, and cybersecurity.\n\nMajor transformation in several areas is impacting the markets in which Schneider Electric operates, including the digitization of the energy industry. In the age of IoT, customers expect ever smarter products with open interfaces enabling them to be tightly integrated into more and more complex software-based solutions and benefit from new services leveraging artificial intelligence and advanced algorithms.\n\nThe Group is investing in its digital transformation journey and as such is increasing the share of its digital offers. In 2022, software and digital services had a strong growth. As such, Schneider Electric is focusing on offering more digital services, generating more recurring revenues, and increasing customer retention.\n\nFor the Group and its competitors, the market is still fairly new and poses a risk of being partially misunderstood. The needs of the market are still being defined and are rapidly evolving. As a result, while the end goals are fairly clear (e.g., decarbonization), more precise end-user needs are less well-defined; in many cases because the end-users themselves are still maturing their needs.\n\nConsequently, the risk for the Group is double:\n\n- \u00b7 Long-term potential misalignment with end-users needs; and\n- \u00b7 Integration of already existing offers, solutions, and roadmaps owned by various Divisions into a comprehensive and customerrelevant portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBesides the digital offer readiness risks, and as a direct extention, the Group must also pay attention to:\n\n- \u00b7 Challenges in commercialization and selling (cross-selling, simplified offer for effective selling, etc.); and\n- \u00b7 Churn prevention.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nSchneider Electric is continuously performing strategic efforts and analysis across its multiple Divisions to better understand the near-term and long-term end-users' needs. Additionally, the transversal communication and collaboration has been dramatically improved. The Group has been focusing on how it leverages existing efforts and platforms to create common approaches and prevent overlaps in offers and solutions. It will focus on this path of continuous improvement, always striving to have a more focused set of offers with less overlap in functionality and more clear value propositions that are therefore easier to differentiate, understand, and sell.\n\nAlso, the Group has launched several initiatives including, but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Creation of a new organization dedicated to the growth of digital services with a clear ambition to leverage a robust strategy, a structured offer portfolio, and a segment market approach;\n- \u00b7 Monetizing critical connected assets with advanced Advisor offer through installed base, using Artificial Intelligence and algorithms;\n- \u00b7 Definition of a consistent connectivity path for partners and direct go-to-market;\n- \u00b7 Acceleration of the attachment of digital services from CapEx to OpEx business;\n- \u00b7 Animating a business platform (Exchange) to guide expert and local players; and\n- \u00b7 Proposing an agnostic solution within a large software portfolio and integrating open standards.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Trend driven risks\n\n## 2.5 Attracting and developing talent with a focus on critical skills\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe growth of the Group's businesses in markets around the world, the digital transformation, and the rapidly evolving context of the 'next normal' requires an increased focus on talent. Shaping the workforce of the future depends on the Group's ability to attract, hire, onboard, develop, and retain the best talent. Critical skills, especially in the areas of technologies, software, services, sustainability, supply chain, quality, and electronics must be prioritized. In addition to critical skills, workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion - especially gender, generation, and nationality/ ethnicity - also needs to be a priority to ensure equal opportunities for everyone, everywhere.\n\nCompetition for attracting and recruiting talent in a tight labor market is intense, in particular for critical digital and technical skill sets in key markets. Accelerating skill development (upskilling and reskilling) of employees and the development of leaders who can lead transformation and build human connections in a digital world is also necessary to reduce the risk of skill gaps and bring greater organizational agility.\n\nBeyond core programs and initiatives, there is a big focus on the overall sense of purpose, culture, and way of working for employees.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Group has a number of initiatives and programs in place to mitigate these risks, anchored in the Group's people strategy, at the heart of which is the Employee Value Proposition, Core Values, and Leadership Expectations. Schneider's approach focuses on the end-to-end talent pipeline from hiring to rewarding to developing for all employees as well as critical talent segments from a workforce size, quality, diversity, and velocity perspective. This systematic approach allows for data-driven monitoring of key gaps and risks. Supporting initiatives and programs include:\n\n- \u00b7 Annual performance and development goal setting and reviews, as well as talent reviews - culminating in year-end reviews of pipeline, succession, diversity, and skills by each entity with the Chairman & CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer. On an ongoing basis, a global pool of high-potential and expert talents at all levels in the organization, is reviewed and managed in context of development and succession. Overall health of the talent attraction and development strategy, leadership pipeline, as well as succession of key people and positions is reviewed monthly with the Executive Committee.\n- \u00b7 There is an enterprise focus on accelerating the early-career pipeline by twofold including internships, trainees, apprenticeships, and fresh graduates. Countries (top 10) all have next generation campus partnerships and recruitment programs. Additionally, the Schneider Global Student Experience and the Schneider Go Green annual competition each year attracts thousands of university talents who become part of the Schneider talent community on an ongoing basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdditional programmatic initiatives to attract, develop, and engage our key talents include:\n\n- \u00b7 Investing in a new talent acquisition and candidate relationship management platform to manage prospective talents and the hiring processes, providing a seamless digital experience and enabling the Group to compete in the market for top talent. To date, 40 countries are using the system with the remaining countries joining in 2023;\n- \u00b7 A 50/40/30 ambition towards gender: 50% of women in hiring, 40% in frontline management, and 30% in leadership (Vice President and above);\n- \u00b7 Policies for family leave, pay equity, and flexible 'new ways of working', supplemented with a strong program of activities to accelerate the diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda and focus on employee well-being, especially mental health;\n- \u00b7 Competitive reward and benefits practices to meet local market needs and attract and retain key talents. This includes Schneider's Worldwide Employee Share Ownership Plan (WESOP) allowing ~80% of all employees to share collectively in the Company's success, and building a stable and sustainable share owner group in the long-run;\n- \u00b7 An operating model with ~30 hubs enabling customer proximity, innovation, speed, collaboration, and diversity of talent opportunities;\n- \u00b7 Career development focus for all employees, leveraging Open Talent Market for internal mobility and anchored in an annual performance and development review;\n- \u00b7 A revamped 'Edison' expert program in areas of R&D, digital, supply chain, etc., to support levels of expertise certification and market recognition;\n- \u00b7 A global program in support of 'all generations' talent development with a particular focus on senior talents and their development and impact on the Company, including knowledge sharing, mentoring, and coaching;\n- \u00b7 Upskilling for today and tomorrow with a strong focus on digital skills, technical skills, commercial excellence, and functional expertise, led by global learning academies of experts;\n- \u00b7 A collective focus for leaders to disrupt, coach, and collaborate in order to transform culture and build great teams; includes clear criteria for leadership impact and selection/promotion based on skills, experiences, and behaviors; and\n- \u00b7 Continuous listening strategy to seek feedback from employees throughout their employment lifecycle.",

        "page_content": "## 2.6 Risk related to the environmental performance of the Group\n\n## Risk description\n\nSchneider Electric has set ambitious sustainability commitments translated into concrete targets in the Schneider Sustainability Impacts and Schneider Sustainability Essentials programs. The Group is already tackling the reduction of GHG emissions across all three scopes, working on its operations and bringing the value chain along, in line with its ambition to contribute to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nHowever, the risk of not meeting the ambition to decarbonize its operations and supply chain exists and could trigger significant financial losses if it materializes. Schneider committed to becoming Net-Zero across its entire value chain, which implies a strong engagement of suppliers to decarbonize Scope 3 upstream emissions and provide to its customers enhanced energy efficient products to reduce its Scope 3 downstream.\n\nAs an Impact company with sustainability at its core, failing short on its Net-Zero Commitment, or conveying misleading environmental claims on its sustainability progress and products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwould expose the Group to greenwashing accusations with potential reputational impacts.\n\nAs regulations tackling climate change develop, the Group could see market disruptions in geographies where it operates as well as where its supply chain is located. Schneider considers the possible financial impacts of future carbon pricing on its extended value chain.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nRegarding Schneider's offers, 100% of new products are ecodesigned, meaning that they are optimized to deliver environmental performance throughout their lifecycle. In addition, the Group has developed the Green Premium \u2122 label, a unique sign of its commitment to compliance, transparency, and sustainability performance. Today, more than 80% of Schneider's product sales come from Green Premium products. Finally, notification systems are set in place to understand external sustainability perceptions and guidelines are defined to ensure alignment between product characteristics and marketing communications.\n\n## 2.7 Natural resource crises: Shortage of resources used in Schneider Electric's products or in manufacturing\n\n## Risk description\n\nSchneider Electric is dependent on natural resources in both its operations and product offerings.\n\nAs a discrete manufacturing company, the Group is subject to business disruption risk due to energy security of supply. Electrification megatrends are increasing competition to access some raw materials critical for those new businesses. For example, renewable power generation is shifting dependency of the energy sector from fossil fuels to mineral resources. The Electric Vehicles industry is expected to increase the demand for lithium 50-fold by 2040 and the demand for Cobalt and Graphite 30-fold, according to IEA.\n\nWhile water consumption is not generally a critical resource for the Group due to its activities, Schneider fully realizes the importance of water in local communities, especially those that are located in water-stressed areas.\n\nChanging economic trends, lack of access and overexploitation can result in shortages of natural resources within the Group's operations and its value chain. This subjects the Group to business disruptions and rising costs in both the short- and long-term and additional challenges to secure supply for sustainable transformation programs (Green Materials, substances substitution, Sustainable Packaging).\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nBusiness disruption due to energy supply is taken into account in the Global Supply Chain STRIVE initiative and covered by the Group's Property Damage and Business Interruption program at site level.\n\nIn addition, Schneider leverages the power of its EcoStruxure \u2122 architectures to deliver energy savings in factories, distribution centers, and offices. These smart solutions enable offices to actively develop occupancy and facility management strategies to keep energy consumption to a minimum, while improving employee experience and comfort.\n\nThe Group is also accelerating the installation of on-site solar panels which, coupled with EcoStruxure \u2122 metering and power architectures, are further reducing Schneider Electric's risk of business disruption due to energy supply.\n\nWater risks are assessed as a standalone issue, and the global water-risk assessment covers all industrial sites above 50 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) employees and all service sites above 500 FTE employees. All these sites are certified ISO 14001, and water-risk is also considered in their environmental risk analysis. The Group's latest water-risk global study was performed in June 2022, covering 271 sites globally. This assessment is carried out every year as Schneider monitors its sites that are in water-stressed regions. The Group has set the ambition that 100% of its sites in water-stressed areas have a water conservation strategy and related action plan by 2025 (SSE #11).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Trend driven risks\n\n## 2.7 Natural resource crises: Shortage of resources used in Schneider Electric's products or in manufacturing (continued)\n\nThe Group approaches the access to resources at different time horizons, to ensure supply resilience both now and in the future. The Group is:\n\n- \u00b7 Building short term resilience in securing supply and protecting operations against price volatility with real time alerts to notify and activate action plans;\n- \u00b7 De-risking its portfolio with technological solutions and circular business models;\n- \u00b7 Shaping the future with long-term material resilience and sustainability with disruptive actions.\n\n## 3. Management practice risks\n\n## 3.1 Data residency\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe last decades have seen a sharp increase in globalization trends coupled with an acceleration of digital transformation. The advent of cloud-based infrastructure and SaaS offers have decreased time to market and increased global reach. However, while the importance of the data economy as an enabler for wealth and progress has been acknowledged by many governments who realize the benefits of the new trend, they have been observing with some apprehension the concentration of their citizens' and enterprises' data in just a handful of infrastructure players.\n\nThe clash of the technological trends with the geopolitical dynamics have therefore spawned a new breed of regulations aiming at extending the physical borders to the digital world. Such regulations are aiming at restricting either the flow of certain categories of data and/or their localization, and while referred to with different nomenclature such as Data Sovereignty, Data Localization, and Data Residency, they are for all intents and purposes data protectionist laws.\n\nSchneider Electric, being a global player that has been pursuing a strategy of shareholder value through efficiency of its global processes and availability of global offers, is exposed to such regulations across the globe, with a risk of increased cost due to possible redundant infrastructure, reduced management oversight, and degradation of its global customer service experience. The risk is exacerbated by a lack of technology players that would be able to respond globally to such challenges and by the unavoidable inconsistency of regulations across different jurisdictions, however, the latter is not specific to just data residency regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo address uncertainty in long-term resource disruption, Schneider has added resource parameters in product EcoDesign and defined substitution strategies for critical resources. R&D actions are in place, focusing on materials with main strategic functions accompanied by communication channels to escalate and alert.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nSchneider Electric has established an 'early warning system' that monitors emerging digital policies bearing a potential impact to the Company; each regulation (policy) is qualified with a flashcard highlighting its type (e.g., data, digital, electronic), characteristics (e.g., jurisdiction, scope, type of controls), and high-level impact. All the policies are followed in their approval trajectory and close to the enforcement date the necessary small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are called upon to start to translate the legislation requirements into internal policy, procedures, and internal controls (KICs) to be implemented and operated in the relevant geographies and functions.\n\nSpecific to the data residency laws, attention is dedicated to the analysis of the internal and external data flows that are crossing the borders of the in-scope countries in terms of their payload, their purposes, and their security (commonly known as Transfer Impact Analysis), which informs a technological decision on whether to localize processing application and/or data storage facilities.\n\nFrequently, a description of the flows is also required by the regulator as part of a formal approval process to export data, along with an obligation to monitor the changes that could potentially affect the flows and their integrity (e.g., data breach). Schneider has capitalized on the experience built in responding to substantial regulations such as GDPR in the European Union, and has successfully leveraged set capabilities, like process registry, in recent instances of data residency such as PIPL in China.",

        "page_content": "## 3.2 IT systems management\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe Group operates either directly or through service providers, a wide range of highly complex information systems, including servers, networks, data repositories, applications (to include software as a service (SaaS)), and databases with three targeted landing zones (on premise, colocation third parties, and in the cloud), that are essential for the efficiency of its sales and manufacturing processes, as well as platforms to enable digital offers such as EcoStruxure \u2122 . The Group is deploying various solutions aimed at enhancing commercial experience, employee experience, and supply chain efficiency as well as enabling digital commercial offers.\n\nSignificant failure in fulfilment by a service provider or a major network outage, hardware, and/or system failure could adversely affect the quality of service offered by Schneider Electric. In addition, the provision of safe and secure foundational information systems is critical to the ongoing expansion of digital offers and customer interactions. As the Group moves towards more digital offers, services, and software, the variety of legacy systems makes it harder and more complex to evolve and scale.\n\nDespite the Group's policy of establishing governance structures and contingency plans, there can be no assurance that information systems projects will not be subject to technical problems, execution delays, or a third-party outage. While it is difficult to accurately quantify the impact of any such problems, data loss, or delays, they could have an adverse effect on inventory levels, service quality, and, consequently, on the Group's financial results.\n\n## 3.3 Pricing strategy\n\n## Risk description\n\nIn 2022, raw material and foreign exchange rate fluctuation continued to impact the Group's cost base, as well as contributing to an increase in freight rates and a shortage of components worldwide. Such fluctuations, if not offset by tactical pricing decisions in compliance with national and international laws, can negatively impact the Group's profitability. The Group followed suit in overcoming these cost impacts by reacting adequately over the cycle. In addition, our strategic Pricing program contributed to a substantial amount.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Group regularly examines alternative solutions to protect against those risks, performs regular compliance checks on service provider and service level agreements, performs system monitoring, and has developed contingency plans and incident response capabilities to mitigate the effects of any information system failure.\n\nThe Group undergoes constant evolution and planning pertaining to its information systems, which encompasses, but is not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) transformation and the evolution of the Group's financial systems to prepare for digital offers;\n- \u00b7 Elimination of legacy IT applications and associated hardware to simplify the landscape and mitigate risks linked to obsolescence; and\n- \u00b7 Build and operate regional colocation (third parties) for high availability in an effort to ensure the sustainability of the IT landscape with ongoing focus on business continuity and disaster recovery planning for hardware and software.\n\nAll new applications are subject to certification testing, attempting to remove system vulnerabilities. These systems are housed either in data centers (either managed by the Group internally or by service providers), in colocations, or are cloud-based applications.\n\nIn 2022, the Group continued to reduce legacy IT applications through a dedicated 'Technical Debt Reduction' program as well as a new program to ensure hardware resiliency for future years (hardware as a service).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPricing risk is expected to persist in 2023 as the Raw Material Inflation (RMI) trend has slowed down and it may be harder to set prices in proportion to energy and labor inflation. Adding to that, accumulated backlog could pose a risk in the prospect of cancellations, which would lead to a substantial threat on price achievement. The ability to improve supply capacity faster than competitors will play an important role for the Group's pricing power.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nTo anticipate negative impact on profitability, the Group has reinforced its comprehensive global Pricing program with robust compliance, commercial policy, pricing, and quotation tools.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Continuous risk identification, assessment, and mitigation is being performed. It focuses, first, on the humanitarian aspects including the support provided by the Group to the Group employees and their families. Further, it encompasses, in no particular order: the financial and operational impacts resulting from sanctions and counter-sanctions, the cybersecurity increased threats on both the Group assets and its customers' safety and products, and the potential unavailability or loss of critical suppliers.\n\nThe Group has been winding down its presence in Russia, in particular via the divestments of Schneider Electric Russia.\n\nThe Group resilience strategy in place allows Schneider Electric to absorb the interruption of Ukraine and Russia factories and the supply chain due to a regional or global need.

The Risk and Insurance department reviews the current pricing and coverage conditions of the external insurance market in implementing the most efficient insurance program.\n\nThese policies are arranged on a global basis for all Group subsidiaries over which Schneider Electric has operational control. These policies are in all countries where the Group operates and are compliant with local regulations. All insurance companies used by Schneider Electric must meet certain credit and security requirements.\n\nAll insurance policies have aggregate limits determined based upon loss scenarios and available capacities on the market. However, there is the risk that an extreme claim could exceed the amount of insurance purchased.\n\nThe insurance policies that are purchased cover varying exposures including, but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 General liability risks arising from events where the Group is liable for damages to a third party as a result of the activities of its people or its products;\n- \u00b7 Property damage and business interruption resulting from an insured risk such as fire, flood, or earthquake at a Group site or, to a lesser extent, a customer or supplier location;\n- \u00b7 Risks associated with the transportation of assets by land, sea, or air;\n- \u00b7 Damage to equipment being installed at customer locations or construction sites;\n- \u00b7 Risks arising from data breaches and attacks on IT systems;\n- \u00b7 Local compulsory policies for employee safety and automobiles;\n- \u00b7 Liabilities of Executive Directors and Corporate Officers;\n- \u00b7 Environmental risks; and\n- \u00b7 Emergency assistance and repatriation for employees travelling.\n\n## Insurable risk mitigations\n\nThe Group identifies and measures the impact of the main insurable risks with a view to reducing or eliminating their impact.\n\n- \u00b7 In order to minimize the risks of damage and protect our production capacity, protection standards (including for the sites managed by third parties) are defined, and main industrial sites are audited by an independent loss prevention company with a process to action any recommendations from these audits.\n- \u00b7 Business continuity plans are implemented, reviewed, and tested, in particular for the Group's main sites and critical suppliers. These plans are developed to identify internal alternative manufacturing and storage solutions to reduce the disruption to the business.\n- \u00b7 Crisis management tools are implemented in conjunction with the Group's Global Security department. These are tested on a systematic basis. Regular exercises are performed to identify areas for improvement.\n- \u00b7 Hazard and vulnerability studies are carried out to protect our people and our equipment.\n- \u00b7 For transportation risks, the lessons learned from losses are communicated across the Group to improve the risk management of shipments and the Insurance department liaise closely with Logistic and Planning teams to minimize incident impact.\n- \u00b7 Employee safety and a safe work environment are priority topics at all site management meetings. Safety training for new employees combined with regular reviews ensure continuous learning and improvement in the recognition and elimination of hazards.\n\n## Self-insurance\n\nAs part of the overall insurance strategy the Group self-insures certain risks through two captive insurance and reinsurance companies located in Europe and North America.\n\nExamples of the policies reinsured by the Group, include property damage and business interruption, general liability, and transportation.\n\nThe total amount retained for these risks is capped at \u20ac20 million (except for USA and Canada).\n\nThe cost of the self-insured risks is not considered material at the Group level.\n\nThe Group assumes a deductible at a site/entity level - though this is not regarded as self-insurance.\n\n## Cost of insurance programs\n\nThe cost (including tax) of the Group's main global insurance programs, excluding premiums paid to captives, totaled around \u20ac28 million in 2022.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

This led the Board to propose a dividend of \u20ac3.15 per share; making 2023 the 13 th consecutive year of dividend growth. The Board is also proud of the progress made in the second year of the ambitious 2021-2025 Schneider Sustainability Impact program as the Company scored 4.91 against a target of 4.70, in accordance with the Board's commitment toward sustainability and our wish to be an Impact company. These strong results, achieved amidst ongoing headwinds, are testament to the success and robustness of the strategy implemented for the last 20 years under the leadership of Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman & CEO.\n\nAfter two decades where Jean-Pascal Tricoire has led the strategic transformation of the Group and further to his wish to step down as CEO as of May 3, 2023, the time has come for a change of governance at the head of the Company. In accordance with the intention disclosed in 2021, the Board of Directors has decided to separate the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nPeter Herweck who was the CEO of AVEVA, will succeed Jean-Pascal Tricoire as CEO on May 4, 2023, becoming responsible for the general management of Schneider as the sole executive corporate officer. Over the last four years, the Governance & Remunerations Committee, under the guidance of the Board of Directors, has conducted a comprehensive and robust succession planning process to propose a successor for the role of CEO. Several high-quality candidates were considered. Peter Herweck's level of global operational experience, technology and software acumen, skills and personal qualities were assessed by the Board as being particularly in line with the Group's strategy. His appointment was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors with Jean-Pascal Tricoire's full support.\n\nAt the unanimous request of the Board of Directors, who want to retain the benefit of his extensive experience, Jean-Pascal Tricoire will remain as Chairman. On behalf of the Board, I express our deepest thanks to Jean-Pascal Tricoire for the transformation of the Group in scale, performance, purpose and capability. His many achievements include the repositioning of Schneider Electric as a leader in the fields of digitization, electrification and sustainability, as well as building a distinctive culture and management system based on a meaningful and inclusive mission and the empowerment of people. This\n\nrobust foundation has made Schneider Electric\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand Sustainability. A separate Human Capital & Remunerations Committee will oversee all topics related to the compensation of the employees, Executive Committee members, as well as Corporate officers and Board members. The Chairman of the Board will be entrusted with extended powers and missions beyond those provided for by law to put his experience at the Company's service. Further to this, my own powers, as Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director, will now include the ability to request that the Chairman of the Board of Directors call a meeting of the Board of Directors to discuss a given agenda.\n\nDuring the year, the Board continued to improve and reinforce its composition, and invites you to support, at the Shareholders' Meeting, the appointment of two new Independent Directors. Abhay Parasnis, a US citizen, is Adobe's former Chief Technology Officer and Chief Product Officer and serves on the Board of Directors at Dropbox. He will bring to the Board his remarkable technology and digital skills, especially his experience in cloud transition and in SaaS transformation, as well as his spirit of innovation and reinvention. Giulia Chierchia, an Italian and Belgian dual citizen, is currently Executive Vice-President of Strategy, Sustainability and Ventures at BP. She will bring to the Board her expertise in Sustainability and the energy sector, in particular, her experience in energy transition strategy in large companies with a global approach including strategy, sustainability, capital allocation and ventures. I also invite you to renew the terms of office of L\u00e9o Apotheker, Gregory Spierkel, and Lip-Bu Tan, all of whom bring many complementary skills to the Board.\n\nThroughout 2022, I had the opportunity to discuss our compensation policy and practices by engaging with many of Schneider Electric's shareholders, as well as investor representative bodies. For 2023, the compensation policies proposed by the Board reflect the Group's governance change. Considering that Jean-Pascal Tricoire is stepping down as CEO on May 3, 2023, the Board decided not to increase his fixed remuneration for the period from January 1, 2023 until May 3, 2023 and to maintain his compensation policy broadly in line with that applied in 2022. When positioning the fixed compensation of Jean-Pascal Tricoire as Chairman for the period beginning on May 4, 2023, the Board used an in-depth study of industry practices for compensation and also took into account the specific missions assigned to him by the Board. In designing the remuneration policy applicable to the new CEO, the Board wished to maintain an overall stability in the existing compensation structure which has evidently driven positive behavior. It appears balanced, provides market competitive pay, and ensures a strong link between pay and performance. The policy also provides strong alignment with both employees and shareholders, as well as a focus on the long-term. The Board also took into account shareholders' feedback and proposed some adjustments, such as (i) the review of the targeted amounts for the different components of the compensation which will lead to a decrease of the on-target global remuneration opportunity by 23% compared to the previous Chairman & CEO remuneration policy, (ii) the strengthening of the performance targets linked to the involuntary severance indemnity, and (iii) the inclusion of a clawback provision. We hope that these proposals which appear balanced and fair will receive your support.\n\nFurther to this letter, I invite you to read the governance and compensation report and notice of meeting which provide more details on the resolutions you are asked to approve at the 2023 Shareholders' Meeting. We look forward to a successful AGM and sincerely hope that many of you will take part in the Company's decisions by voting on the resolutions, attending physically, and expressing your views during the Q&A session.\n\nThank you for your support and your trust,\n\n## Fred Kindle\n\nVice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director",

The Company complies with all the recommendations contained in the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code which may be consulted online at http://www.medef.com/.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-37, paragraph 6 of the French Commercial Code, this chapter constitutes the specific section of the Management Report on corporate governance and reports on the following, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board's composition and application of the principle of balanced gender representation on the Board;\n- \u00b7 The ways in which the Board's work is prepared and organized;\n- \u00b7 The remuneration policy for Directors and Corporate Officers;\n- \u00b7 Information relating to the remuneration and benefits of any kind for Directors and Corporate Officers during the previous financial year pursuant to Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code; and\n- \u00b7 Limitations placed by the Board of Directors on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe other information included in the section of the Management Report dedicated to corporate governance is published in Chapter 7 of this document, specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 The table summarizing the outstanding delegations relating to share capital increase and decrease granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting (see section 7.2.3 'Authorizations to issue and cancel shares' of this Universal Registration Document);\n- \u00b7 The special rules for shareholder participation in the Annual General Meeting or the provisions of the Articles of Association providing for these rules (see sections 7.4.1 'Annual Shareholders' Meetings' and 7.4.2 'Voting rights' of this Universal Registration Document); and\n- \u00b7 The elements with the potential to have an impact in the event of a public offer for the purchase or exchange of the Company's securities (see section 7.4.8 'Publication of information of Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code' of this Universal Registration Document).\n\n## 4.1.1.2 Governance structure\n\nSchneider Electric is being governed through a model considered by the Board of Directors to be best suited to the Company's culture, and specificities, with the ambition to constantly improve its effectiveness. The structure responsible for the General Management of Schneider Electric has always been selected in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders, with the objective that the corporate governance model will support the optimization of the Group's financial and sustainability performance, create the most favorable conditions for the Company's long-term development, respect the rights of Shareholders, and maintain the necessary balance of powers between the different governance bodies.\n\nIn 2013, after a period of 7 years (2006 to 2013) in which the duties of Chairman of the Supervisory Board and those of Chairman of the Management Board were separated to ensure a smooth transition from Mr. Henri Lachmann to Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire, the Board of Directors decided to change the governance structure and appoint Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Board regularly reviewed its structure and its functioning throughout since then. In accordance with the wishes of M. Jean-Pascal Tricoire to step down as Chief Executive Officer during his current term of office, alongside the intention of the Board of Directors to separate the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Board decided on February 15, 2023 to implement a new governance structure that splits the office of Chairman from that of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## 4.1.1.2.1 Governance structure as of May 4, 2023\n\n## Succession planning process\n\nAs publicly stated in 2021, when Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire's office as Director was coming to an end, the Board decided to renew Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire's board mandate for a further four-year term. The Board of Directors considered his performance as both Chairman & CEO to be outstanding and the combination of roles to be appropriate when considering his profile, excellent track record within the Company, and his openness to both Board Member recommendation as well as the governance mechanisms in place to safeguard the balance of power between the Board and the management. The Board also confirmed that it understood and acknowledged the general preference of investors for a clear distinction between the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and, therefore, announced its intention to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer before the end of M. Jean-Pascal Tricoire's upcoming 4 years term.\n\nOver the last four years, the Governance & Remuneration s Committee, under the guidance of the Board of Directors, has conducted a comprehensive process to propose the most appropriate governance structure for the Company, and succession plan for the role of Chief Executive Officer. The work of the Governance & Remuneration s Committee intensified in 2021 and 2022, driven by the ambition to preserve Schneider Electric's fundamental values, the Group and its Shareholders' interests, as well as the continuity of the strategy.\n\nThe Governance & Remuneration s Committee met 27 times between 2020 and early 2023, following an in-depth succession plan process:\n\n- \u00b7 identification of the required skills and qualities most suited to the Group's future challenges;\n- \u00b7 initiation of an external assessment of the Executive Committee members;\n- \u00b7 selection of top potential candidates of both genders, based on their respective careers and achievements in their managerial responsibilities;\n- \u00b7 evaluation of potential candidates internal and external;\n- \u00b7 resolution to favor internal candidates and further examine their suitability for the role;\n- \u00b7 further evaluation with closer exposure to the Board and its strategic priorities;\n- \u00b7 final selection of the new Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Committee led each of these steps which were then presented to the whole Board for discussion and validation.",

        "page_content": "When identifying the key skills required to take over the Chief Executive Officer function, the Board, on top of global managerial skill in complex environment, global knowledge of the industry Schneider Electric operates in, considered essential:\n\n- \u00b7 understanding of technology, in particular digital and software;\n- \u00b7 engagement on Sustainability and climate change;\n- \u00b7 commitment to keep building the Schneider's advantage in terms of globality (multi-Hub differentiated model) and diversity (strong commitment to diversity and inclusion);\n- \u00b7 ability to imagine, initiate and drive radical transformations to accelerate the implementation of the strategy;\n- \u00b7 resilience and courage to face complex situations.\n\nPursuant to this process, the Board has unanimously decided that Mr. Peter Herweck who was Chief Executive Officer of AVEVA, will succeed Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire as Chief Executive Officer of Schneider Electric on May 4, 2023 at the date of the Annual General Meeting. Mr. Peter Herweck joined Schneider Electric in 2016, where he successfully led the global Industrial Automation Business, before being appointed as Chief Executive Officer of AVEVA in 2021. He started his career as software development engineer with Mitsubishi in Japan, later joining Siemens, where he held several executive positions in Automation, Power Distribution and Building Technologies, before becoming Chief Strategy Officer. Mr. Peter Herweck has a diverse, cross-cultural mindset, derived from leading teams in both mature and emerging markets.\n\nHis level of global operational experience, technology and software acumen, skills and personal qualities as well as his passion for technology driving positive progress for the world, were assessed by the Board as being particularly in line with the Group's strategy making him the best candidate for the role of Chief Executive Officer of Schneider Electric. Mr. Peter Herweck will become responsible for the general management of the Company, as the sole executive corporate officer.\n\nMr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire will remain as Chairman of the Board, at the unanimous request of the Board members who want to retain the benefits of his experience at the Company's helm in significantly and successfully transforming Schneider Electric over the past 20 years. The Board believes his commitment to promoting the Group's culture and values, his governance expertise founded on transparency, and the close ties built with all Company's Stakeholders will be highly valuable for the Company. His many achievements include the repositioning of Schneider Electric as a leader in the fields of digitization, electrification and sustainability, and building a distinctive culture and management system based on a meaningful and inclusive mission and the empowerment of people.\n\nAs a consequence of this change of governance, the internal regulations of the Board were amended on February 15, 2023 to be effective as of May 4, 2023 with several key changes:\n\n## Key amendments of the Board Internal Regulations\n\n| Power of the Chairman  of the Board                       | The Chairman of the Board will be entrusted with additional powers and missions of those provided for by the  Law for which he shall organize his activities so as to ensure his availability and put his experience at the  Company's service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Power of the Vice-  Chairman & Lead  Independent Director | The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director will be empowered to request that the Chairman of the Board  of Directors call a meeting of the Board of Directors to discuss a given agenda, or to add such an agenda item  to an already scheduled Board of Directors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Power of the Chief  Executive Officer                     | Under French Law, the Chief Executive Officer has the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name  of the Company.

Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire will pursue his functions of Chairman & Chief Executive Officer until May 3, 2023.\n\n## The Chairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn 2022, the performance by Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire of the duties of Chairman & Chief Executive Officer seemed particularly appropriate to the Board of Directors for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 The results of the internal Board assessments that continuously confirmed that (i) all Board members individually support the current leadership structure and (ii) the level of transparency between the management team and the Board of Directors is considered to be excellent;\n- \u00b7 Jean-Pascal Tricoire's profile, his excellent track record within the Company, his leadership, and his openness to the Board members' recommendations;\n- \u00b7 The governance mechanisms in place to safeguard the balance of power between the Board and the management (appointment of a Lead Independent Director with specific powers, high rate of independent Directors within the Board (82%), independence of the committees mainly chaired by independent Directors, executive session proposed systematically at the end of each Board meeting); and\n- \u00b7 The requirement for the Board to deliberate each year on the unification of the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in pursuance of its internal regulations.\n\nThe Chairman & CEO represents the Company in its dealings with third parties. He is vested with the broadest authority to act in any and all circumstances in the name and on behalf of the Company. He exercises this authority within the limits of the corporate purpose, except for those matters that are reserved by law expressly to the Annual Shareholders' Meetings or the Board of Directors. In addition, the internal regulations of the Board of Directors provide that the Chairman & CEO must submit for approval to the Board any acquisition transactions or disposal of assets amounting to more than \u20ac250 million as well as any strategic partnership agreements.\n\n## The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director\n\nOn February 19, 2020, the Board of Directors designated Mr. Fred Kindle, whose biography is provided in section 4.1.2.2 of Chapter 4 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document to become Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director of Schneider Electric SE. Article 1 of the internal regulations of the Board of Directors defines the duties and missions of the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director who is mandatorily appointed when the Board decides to unify the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n- * Independent Directors as prescribed by the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code.\n- ** Excluding the Director representing the employee shareholders and the Directors representing the employees.\n- ***  Subject to his appointement as a Director by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held on May 4, 2023.",

However, in view of his age and his non-independence under the AFEP-MEDEF Code, since he has been a member of the Board since 2008, the Committee has proposed limiting his term of office to two years.\n- \u00b7 Mr. Gregory Spierkel holds two other mandates in listed companies (Director of MGM Resorts International and PACCAR Inc.), his attendance rate at the meetings of the Board and the committees in which he participates in 2022 is 100%. Mr. Gregory Spierkel brings to the Board the benefit of his experience as former Chief Executive Officer of Ingram Micro,\n\n## Skills\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPublic Company Management\n\nLaw, Governance, Ethics & Compliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorporate Finance\n\nInternational Markets\n\nDigital & Technology\n\n## Previous directorships\n\nPrevious directorships held in the past five years: None.\n\nSkills\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInc. and a solid profile in digital and technology matters, which leads the Board to propose the renewal of his mandate for a four-year term.\n\n- Mr. Lip-Bu Tan holds three offices in listed companies in addition to his office at Schneider Electric: Chairman of Cadence Design Systems, Inc., from which he retired as Chief Executive Officer in 2021 and will retire as Chairman on May 4, 2023 as he announced he will not seek re-election to the Board at the 2023 Annual Meeting (https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net / CIK-0000813672/ cd2ef8b8-abb5-4620-a08d-c5c49565fc6c.pdf), Chairman of the Board of Directors of Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd. and Director of Intel Corporation. After the 2023 Cadence's Annual Meeting planned on May 4, Mr. Lip-Bu Tan will therefore hold two offices in listed companies in addition to his office at Schneider Electric. In view of his commitments, the Governance and Remunerations Committee has carefully examined his situation. In particular, it has ascertained from him his willingness and commitment to devote sufficient and necessary time to the Board of Schneider Electric, as Mr. Lip-Bu Tan has always done in the past, as evidenced by his level of attendance at Board meetings in 2022 (100%) and at the meetings of the committees in which he participates (90%), as well as his physical participation in several meetings, including the Strategy Session in August 2022. His average attendance rate at Board and committee meetings over his term of office (2019 -2022) was 94% and 97.5% respectively, reflecting his commitment and availability. The Committee also took into consideration the assessment of Mr. Lip-Bu Tan's effective contribution to the work of the Board that was conducted among the Directors in October 2022 during the Board's self-assessment, which concluded that Mr. Lip-Bu Tan brings to the Board unique expertise in the areas of software and technology, particularly in the energy sector, venture capital, and in-depth knowledge of the Asian and US markets. For all of these reasons, the Board has determined that his continued service as a Director is in the best interests of the Company, its shareholders, and is consistent with the composition objectives identified by the Board, and therefore invites to reappoint Mr. Lip Bu-Tan for a four-year term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Among these candidates, the Governance & Remunerations Committee preselected a shortlist and the members of the Committee interviewed the short-listed candidates. Following these interviews, the Committee recommended two candidates to the Board of Directors, Mr. Abhay Parasnis and Mrs. Giulia Chierchia, who were appointed as Observers respectively on July 27, 2022, and February 15, 2023, with the aim to propose their appointment to the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nMr. Abhay Parasnis, a US citizen based in San Francisco and an entrepreneur, is Adobe's former Chief Technology Officer and Chief Product Officer and serves on the Board of Directors at Dropbox.

It relies on the works of the Governance & Remunerations Committee which reviews regularly and proposes as often as required, the relevant changes to the composition of the Board of Directors and its committees depending on the Group's strategy.\n\nIn that respect, in conformity with its internal regulations, the Board of Directors ensures through its proposals and its decisions that:\n\n- \u00b7 Its composition reflects the international nature of the Group's activities and of its shareholders by having a significant number of members of non-French nationality;\n- \u00b7 It protects the independence of the Board through the competence, availability, and courage of its members;\n- \u00b7 It ensures open and unrestricted speech;\n- \u00b7 It pursues its objective of diversifying the Board of Directors in compliance with the legal principle of attaining balanced representation between men and women on the Board;\n- \u00b7 It appoints persons with the expertise required for developing and implementing the Group strategy while considering the objectives of diversity based on criteria such as age, professional skills, nationality, and background;\n- \u00b7 Employee shareholders and employees shall continue to be represented on the Board in compliance with the provisions set forth in Articles 11.3 and 11.4 of the Articles of Association; and\n- \u00b7 It preserves the continuity of the Board by changing some of its members at regular intervals, if necessary, by anticipating the expiry of members' terms of office.\n\nAs prescribed by Article L. 225-18-1 and L. 22-10-3 of the French Commercial Code, the proportion of Directors of each gender must be at least 40%, it being specified that the Directors representing the employees and the Director representing the employee shareholders are not counted to assess said proportion of 40% (Articles L. 225-27 and. L. 225-23 of the French Commercial Code).\n\nThe gender diversity ratio of the Board of Directors, should the appointments of Mrs. Giulia Chierchia and Mr. Abhay Parasnis be confirmed at the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, will reach\n\n46% (excluding the employee Directors and the representative employee shareholders' Director).\n\nSchneider Electric is deeply committed towards diversity in general and gender diversity in particular. Schneider Electric focuses on taking proactive measures to encourage a balanced representation of men and women at the leadership level: the portion of women at the Executive Committee level was 46% in 2022 ( vs. 44% in 2021. For the leadership pool, comprising of the top leaders (around 1,000 employees), the female representation is 28% (an increase of +2 points vs. 2021).\n\nAt its meeting on December 14, 2022, the Board of Directors reviewed Senior Management's ambitions regarding the balanced representation of men and women at the leadership level and noted that the objectives are set to:\n\n- \u00b7 At least 40% of women at the Executive Committee; and\n- \u00b7 At least 30% of women among the leadership (Vice-President and above; around 1,016 employees).\n\nTo achieve these objectives and further improve gender diversity, the Group aims at attracting female talents by offering a training leadership program and dedicated mentoring, an equal treatment policy, and a tailored family leave policy.\n\n## Skills within the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors frequently assesses the skills to include in its skills matrix in order to meet the Company's strategic needs, and a review of some peer comparisons. It reviews its composition and expertise to identify skills, relevant to Schneider Electric's current and future activities, that could be strengthened in the future or would deserve a stronger disclosure/narrative.\n\nSchneider Electric's Board, assessed against these skills, appears strong and balanced, and globally well positioned. The Board comprises individuals from diverse and complementary professional and cultural backgrounds, true to the Group's history and values. This enables it to perform its duties collectively and constructively.\n\nThe experience and expertise brought to the Board by each Director at the date of this Universal Registration Document can be summarized as follows.\n\n|                                                  | Jea n -

Loss of the status of independent Director occurs on the date of the 12th anniversary.\n\n## Criterion 7: Status of non-executive Corporate Officer\n\nA non-executive Corporate Officer cannot be considered independent if he or she receives variable compensation in cash or in the form of securities or any compensation linked to the performance of the Company or Group.\n\n## Criterion 8: Status of the major shareholder\n\nDirectors representing major shareholders of the Company or its parent company may be considered independent, provided these shareholders do not take part in the control of the Company. Nevertheless, beyond a 10% threshold in capital or voting rights, the Board, upon a report from the Governance & Remunerations Committee, should systematically review the qualification as independent in light of the Company's shareholding structure and the existence of a potential conflict of interest.\n\nUpon recommendation from the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board of Directors, during its meeting of February 15, 2023, reviewed the independence of each Board member in regard of the criteria reminded above.\n\n- \u00b7 With regard specifically to independence in terms of business relations, the Board of Directors noted that, due to:\n- (i) The absence of business relations between the Directors and Schneider Electric;\n- (ii) The nature of Schneider Electric activities and those of the companies in which members of the Board of Directors are employed or serve as Directors; and\n- (iii) The amounts, either unitary or global, of operations performed or that may be performed between Schneider Electric and these companies that are agreed at arm's length and that are by no means likely to be referred to the Board of Directors;\n\nthe existing business relations between Schneider Electric and these companies in which the members of the Board of Directors are employed or serve as officers are not likely to prejudice their independence, indeed, when such operations exist, they are agreed at arm's length and their amounts, representing less than 0.1% of the consolidated turnover of each group, are without a doubt insignificant for each party, in particular with regard to respective size of the groups concerned.\n\nAmong fourteen Directors, nine are independent according to the definition prescribed by the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code: Mrs. Nive Bhagat, Mrs. C\u00e9cile Cabanis, Mr. Fred Kindle, Mrs. Linda Knoll, Mrs. Jill Lee, Mrs. Anna Ohlsson-Leijon, Mr. Anders Runevad, Mr. Gregory Spierkel, and Mr. Lip-Bu Tan.\n\n- \u00b7 Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire, as Chief Executive Officer, Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma, as the employee shareholders representative, Mrs. Rita Felix and Mr. Bruno Turchet as employee Directors, and Mr. L\u00e9o Apotheker, who has served on the Board for over 12 years, are not considered to be independent Directors under the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code.\n- \u00b7 The AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code recommends that, in non-controlled companies, the Board comprises at least 50% independent Directors (Directors representing employee shareholders and employees are not computed in calculating this percentage). The proportion of independent Directors of the Company, excluding Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma, Mrs. Rita Felix, and Mr. Bruno Turchet, is therefore 82%. The proportion would rise to 85% should the renewal of Mr. L\u00e9o Apotheker, Mr. Gregory Spierkel, and M. Lip-Bu Tan, and the appointments of Mrs. Giulia Chierchia and Mr. Abhay Parasnis, who will qualify as independent Directors with regard to all the criteria set by Article 10.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, be voted in by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting as per, respectively, the 12 th , 13 th , 14 th ,15 th , and 16 th resolutions.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

It was informed of the positions expressed by the shareholders met during the preparation of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and took note of the proxy-advisors' reports. It approved the responses to the written questions.\n\nThe 2022 Annual Shareholders' Meeting met physically. It approved all resolutions supported by management, including those relating to the composition of the Board of Directors, the compensation of the Corporate Officers, and the renewal of financial authorizations.\n\nIn application of the provisions of Article 1.C.3 of the internal regulations, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director convenes executive sessions of the Board of Directors (without the Corporate Officers) at the end of each Board meeting. In 2022, the Board of Directors held seven 'executive sessions', vs. five in 2021.\n\nIn addition, when the Board debated and determined the compensation of the Chairman & CEO, the interested party was not present, as prescribed by Article 10.2 of the internal regulations, unless solicited to provide information on specific issues.\n\n## 4.1.3.2 Succession planning\n\n## Board members\n\nThe Board of Directors shall have at least three and up to 18 members, all of whom must be natural persons elected by the shareholders at the Shareholders' Meeting. However, in case of death or resignation of a member, the Board may co-opt a new member. This appointment is then subject to ratification at the next Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nDirectors are appointed for four-year terms (renewable). However, from the age of 70, Directors are re-elected or appointed for a period of two years. No more than one-third of the Directors may be 70 years old or over.\n\nMrs. Xiaoyun Ma represents the employee shareholders in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-23 and L. 22-10-5 of the French Commercial Code. She was elected at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting upon the recommendation of the supervisory boards of the FCPEs.\n\nMrs. Rita Felix and Mr. Bruno Turchet represent the employees in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-27-1 of the French Commercial Code. They were appointed respectively by the European Works Council and by the most representative trade union organization in France in pursuance of Article 11.4 of the Articles of Association.\n\n## Director selection process\n\nThe independent Director selection process is led by the ViceChairman & Lead Independent Director and Chairman of the Governance & Remunerations Committee. When one or more directorships become vacant, or more broadly when the Board of Directors wishes to expand or modify its composition, the Governance & Remunerations Committee documents and ranks the selection criteria for potential candidates, taking into account the desired balance and diversity in the Board's composition. The Committee takes into account the diversity policy and the objectives defined by the Board of Directors in term of skillset.\n\nBased on these criteria, the Committee steers the search for and selection of new Directors, where appropriate with the assistance of an external consultant, and conducts the necessary verifications. The members of the Governance & Remunerations Committee then interview the candidates and issue a recommendation to the Board of Directors.\n\nIn preparation of the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Governance & Remunerations Committee focused on furthering the international diversification of the Board of Directors and maintaining the number of women Directors, as well as adding digital and sustainability expertise. A specific selection process exists for Directors representing employees and Directors representing employee shareholders, in accordance with prevailing regulations.\n\n## Succession planning for Corporate Officers\n\nSuccession plans at Schneider Electric correspond to a systematic, structured process for identifying and preparing employees with potential to fill key organizational positions, should the position become vacant. This process applies to all key positions including the Chairman & CEO position. Succession plans aim at ensuring a continued effective performance of the organization by providing for the availability of experienced and capable employees who are prepared to assume these roles as they become available. Succession plans are necessary processes to reduce risk of vacant positions or skill gap transitions, create a pipeline of future leaders, ensure full business continuity, and improve employee motivation and engagement.\n\nThe mission of the Governance & Remunerations Committee includes preparing for the future of the Company's executive bodies, in particular through the establishment of a succession plan for executive officers. The plan, which is reviewed at meetings of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, addresses various scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 Unplanned vacancy due to prohibition, resignation, or death; and\n- \u00b7 Planned vacancy due to retirement or expiration of term of office.\n\nThrough its work and discussions, the Committee seeks to devise a succession plan that is adaptable to situations arising in the short, medium or long term. The Governance & Remunerations Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Provides the Board with progress reports, in particular at executive sessions;\n- \u00b7 Works closely with the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer to (i) ensure the plan is consistent with the Company's own practices and market practices, (ii) ensure high-potential internal prospects receive appropriate support and training, and (iii) check there is adequate monitoring of key posts likely to fall vacant;\n- \u00b7 Meets with key executives.\n\nThe succession plan announced on February 15, 2023 is described in section 4.1.1.2.1 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director provided individual feedback on the assessments of the effective contribution of each Director.\n\n## Themes\n\n(i) Membership and dynamics of the Board; (ii) Mission, organization, and operation of the Board; (iii) Works of the Committees; (iv) On-boarding program of the new members; (v) Deep dive on the Strategy Session; (vi) 2022/2023 top Board priorities; and (vii) Effective contribution of each Director.\n\n## Key findings\n\n- \u00b7 Involvement and contribution of Board members is perceived as very high;\n- \u00b7 Excellent leadership and contribution of the Chairman & CEO who is described as best in class, strong, open, inclusive, engaged, charismatic, and strategic thinking;\n- \u00b7 Perfect fit between the Chairman & CEO and the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director who have developed a balanced and complementary relationship;\n- \u00b7 Quality of relations between the Board and management is unanimously seen as trustful and supportive (everyone feel free to express his opinion);\n- \u00b7 Board members are satisfied with the agendas, which are well designed and balanced between business, financial, and governance topics;\n- \u00b7 Social and environmental dimensions are systematically taken into account in all discussions with the Board;\n- \u00b7 Board size is considered adequate;\n- \u00b7 All committees operate properly, and their work are satisfactory and useful to the Board decision making process;\n- \u00b7 Overall, the on-boarding program is considered as very valuable by all the new Board members; and\n- \u00b7 High quality Strategy session which is very useful, well organized, and tailored to discuss the key strategic topics for Schneider Electric.\n\n## Areas for improvement\n\n- \u00b7 Large majority of Board members consider that the span of skills brought to the Board is adequate but could be reinforced in energy markets, Robotics/Automation/AI, and ESG;\n- \u00b7 Information provided in advance of Board meetings could be more selective and synthetic;\n- \u00b7 Allocation of committee assignments between members is adequate but there should be a periodic rotation of assignments; and\n- \u00b7 Reports to the Board by business/region function leaders could be provided with a regular cadence.\n\n## 4.1.3.4  Information and training of the Board of Directors and its members\n\n## Information given to Directors\n\nTo ensure that the Board of Directors is well informed at all times, Schneider Electric SE applies the following rules: members of the Board have access, via a secure dedicated platform, in principle, ten days before every Board meeting, to the agenda for the meeting and to the draft minutes of the last meeting and, four to five days before, to the Board's file.\n\nExecutive Committee members are invited, depending on the subject, to present the major issues within their areas of responsibility. Statutory auditors attend the portion of the Board's meetings at which the full year and half year financial statements are reviewed.\n\nIn addition, each year a Board meeting called 'Strategy Session' is held in the form of a seminar and invites key executives of the Group to contribute to Board discussions. These seminars also enable Directors to constantly refine their understanding of the challenges facing the Group through themed-based presentations and site visits.\n\nFurthermore, the Board organizes a range of specific training sessions throughout the year to help Directors increase their knowledge of the Group (through presentations of its ecosystem, challenges, businesses, and some of its regions) and its competitive environment, as well as recent market disruption trends and technological developments.\n\nBetween each meeting of the Board of Directors, aside from meetings that they may have with the Chairman & CEO, Directors receive information through relevant financial analysts' reports and other documents. Board members also have the opportunity to meet informally with key members of Senior Management.",

        "page_content": "Board of Director dinners are organized in order to offer more opportunities to interact with investors, customers, experts, etc . These dinners are meant to provide Board members with external views on the Group, to increase their understanding of the changes in its business environment, and to gain more insight on the needs and motivations of all stakeholders. In 2022, six dinners were organized.\n\n## On-boarding program of new Directors\n\nA complete on-boarding program is provided to any new Director in order to help him/her to get a deep understanding of the business, the challenges, and priorities of Schneider Electric as well as its governance and values. As such, new Directors are offered a training and information program on the Group's strategy and businesses, designed around a common core which comprises of:\n\n- \u00b7 A set of documents including, in particular, the last Universal Registration Document and integrated report, the Company's Articles of Association, the internal regulations of the Board of Directors, the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, the Compliance Code governing stock-market transactions (see below), the minutes of the Board's and committees' meetings for the period starting from the appointment back to the full year before, and the Directors' and officers' liability master policy;\n- \u00b7 A summary relating to the Group organization;\n- \u00b7 Working meetings with the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-Presidents of Strategy, Energy Management, Industrial Automation, and other EVPs as the case may be;\n- \u00b7 A work session with the secretary of the committee(s) he/she will join;\n- \u00b7 Concerning governance and values: a work session with the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director, the Chief Governance Officer, as well as with the persons in charge of compliance, ethics and sustainable development;\n- \u00b7 To know more about Schneider Electric's shareholding structure and shareholders' expectations, an interview with the Senior Vice-President Investors Relations;\n- \u00b7 Training on the use of the secure dedicated platform on which all the Board's files are filed and kept;\n- \u00b7 The designation of a mentor for any new Director to facilitate his/ her integration;\n- \u00b7 As the case may be, visits to sites which are particularly illustrative of Schneider Electric's activities.\n\nIn addition, the Directors representing employees, Mrs. Rita Felix and Mr. Bruno Turchet, benefit from a training program compliant with legal requirements and approved by the Board of Directors. In pursuance of new French regulations coming from law n\u00ba 2019-486 of May 22, 2019, relating to companies' growth and transformation, known as PACTE law, the Director representing the employee shareholders, Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma, was offered a tailored training session to address her needs.\n\n## Compliance Code governing stock-market transactions\n\nSchneider Electric has adopted a Compliance Code governing stock-market transactions for members of the Board of Directors and Group employees, designed to prevent insider trading. Under these provisions, both Directors and relevant employees are barred from trading in the Company shares and shares in companies for which they have inside information that has not yet been made public. In addition, they may not trade in Schneider Electric SE shares during the 31 days preceding the day following publication of the annual and interim financial statements, nor during the 16 days preceding the day following publication of a quarterly update, nor may they engage in any type of speculative trading involving Schneider Electric SE shares (including margin trading, purchasing, and selling shares in a period of less than four months). In addition, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, Corporate Officers also undertake not to enter into hedges of shares resulting from exercise of options and of Performance Shares they are required to hold (see section 4.1.2.6 of Chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document). These restrictions supplement the prohibition against hedging unvested stock options and Performance Shares during their vesting period.\n\nThe Compliance Code governing stock-market transactions was revised when the European 'Market Abuse Regulation' n\u00ba 2014/596 of April 16, 2014, entered into force, and subsequently updated in December 2018. The regulation obliges companies to draw up insider lists, and market operators to put in place mechanisms aimed at preventing and detecting suspicious transactions, enabling them to report to the Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers those that seem to them to constitute insider dealing.\n\nThe Compliance Code provides for:\n\n- \u00b7 The existence of an ethics officer, who is the Secretary of the Board of Directors, advising on whether information is inside or not; and\n- \u00b7 Rules for establishing, updating, and keeping in the prescribed electronic format a list of insiders whenever necessary, lists of persons subject to black-out periods, and possible confidentiality and abstention lists identifying the persons, whether from Schneider Electric or external to the Group, who have access to a piece of sensitive information that does not yet qualify as inside information according to the legal definition. Schneider Electric has deployed a digital tool to manage these lists which automates their processing and ensures better traceability.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Those internal regulations can be found in section 4.1.6 of Chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Information on the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director\n\nTo be able to carry out his duties, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director must have excellent knowledge of the Group and be particularly well informed about its business performance.\n\nAs such, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director is apprised of current events and the performance of the Group through weekly exchanges with the Chairman & CEO. He meets regularly with members of the Group Executive Committee and pursues regular interactions with managers and other employees of the Group in various sites of Schneider Electric.\n\nIn addition, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director interacts regularly with the other members of the Board of Directors. Twice a year, in June and in December, he meets individually with each of the other Directors to obtain their feedback on the current situation of the Company, their possible concerns, and their wishes.\n\nHe is continuously kept informed of the evolution of the competitive environment, technological breakthroughs, and business opportunities. Additionally, he is the Chairperson of the Governance & Remunerations Committee and a member of the Human Resources & CSR Committee.\n\n## Participation in the preparation of the meetings of the Board\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director participated in the preparation for meetings of the Board of Directors. As a result, he has participated in all the 'pre-Board' meetings. Each meeting of the Board of Directors is preceded by one or two pre-Board meetings, in which the Chairman & CEO, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Governance Officer, and the Secretary of the Board of Directors review the topics and issues addressed by the committees, and establish the agenda set by the Chairman & CEO and the content of the meeting file.\n\n## Executive sessions\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director chairs the executive sessions ( i.e ., the meetings where Board members meet without the presence of the Corporate Officer), convened at the end of each Board meeting. The employee Directors are invited to attend all executive sessions following meetings of the Board at which they are present.\n\nThe Board of Directors held seven executive sessions in 2022 during which its members expressed their views and observations on, among others, the Group's strategic options and the succession planning of the Corporate Officer. The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director reported the conclusions thereof to the Chairman & CEO.\n\n## Interaction with shareholders\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director is the designated contact for the shareholders on matters pertaining to corporate governance. He carried out two shareholder engagement campaigns in 2022: one before the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to present to those who so wished, the resolutions submitted for the shareholders' approval; the other one, in the fall semester, to freely exchange views on topical themes of corporate governance that do not necessarily materialize in resolutions submitted for the shareholders' approval. On this occasion, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director discussed investors' representatives the growing importance of social and environmental topics at the Board of Directors and their reflection in the Corporate Officers' compensation. Overall, these two campaigns comprised 24 face-to-face or phone meetings with governance analysts of major shareholders from a wide range of corporate governance cultures and covered around 39% of the share capital. The conclusions of these discussions have been reported in detail to the Governance & Remunerations Committee and contributed to its on-going thought process on governance matters. A report thereon was subsequently made to the Board.\n\n## Other duties\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director conducted the annual deliberation of the Board on its composition, organization, and operations as well as those of its committees. In 2022, this self-assessment was carried out internally. The conclusions of this assessment, which highlighted the quest for continuous improvement, are presented in section 4.1.3.3 of Chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director has also had frequent contacts with each of the Directors. He ensured that there was no conflict of interest within the Board of Directors, which he would have been responsible for bringing to the attention of the Chairman.",

        "page_content": "## 4.2 Compensation Report\n\nThe compensation report presented below reflects the Group's governance change announced on February 16, 2023. The Board of Directors nominated Mr. Peter Herweck to succeed to Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire as Chief Executive Officer at the date of the Annual General Meeting scheduled for May 4, 2023. Mr. JeanPascal Tricoire will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors from that date, while Mr. Peter Herweck will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer as the sole executive corporate officer.\n\nIn line with this new governance structure, the Group will have:\n\n- \u00b7 a governance structure with a Chairman & CEO (Mr. JeanPascal Tricoire) from January 1, 2023 until May 3, 2023;\n- \u00b7 a governance structure with a Chairman of the Board of Directors (Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire) and a Chief Executive Officer (Mr. Peter Herweck) from May 4, 2023.\n\nThis section includes a complete description of the components of remuneration for the corporate officers, including the following components on which the Annual General Meeting of May 4, 2023, is invited to vote:\n\n- \u00b7 with regard to 2022:\n- - for the Chairman & CEO (Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire): the components which make up the total remuneration and the benefits of all kinds paid during 2022 or awarded in respect of 2022 (subject of the 6 th resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting);\n- - for the Board members of Schneider Electric: the components of remuneration presented in the Report on Corporate Governance pursuant to Article L. 22-10-9 I of the French Commercial Code (subject of the 5 th resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting);\n- \u00b7 with regard to 2023, the remuneration policies which will be applicable:\n- - to the Chairman & CEO (Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire) for the period running from January 1, 2023 to May 3, 2023 (subject of the 7 th resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting);\n- - to the Chief Executive Officer (Mr. Peter Herweck) for the period running from May 4, 2023 to December 31, 2023 (subject of the 8 th resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting);\n- - to the Chairman of the Board of Directors (Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire) for the period running from May 4, 2023 to December 31, 2023 (subject of the 9 th resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting);\n- - to the Board members for the full year 2023 (subject of the 11 th resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting).\n\nThe information included in this section also takes into account the provisions of the AFEP-MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance for listed companies, as interpreted by the Haut Comit\u00e9 de Gouvernement d'Entreprise (French High Committee on Corporate Governance) and the AMF's recommendations.\n\n## 4.2.1 Overview\n\nThe compensation paid or granted to the Corporate Officer in 2021 was approved by more than 84% of our shareholders at the 2022 Annual General Meeting and the 2022 compensation policy was supported by more than 89% of the shareholders at the 2022 Annual Shareholders' meeting.\n\nAs in previous years, in 2022, key remuneration topics were discussed with Schneider Electric's largest shareholders. Schneider Electric representatives notably met with 24 investors during the year, representing more than 39% of the issued share capital, over 2 rounds of governance roadshow; in April, ahead of the Annual General Meeting to discuss matters submitted to the shareholders' vote and in the fall to discuss broader ESG topics. The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director took part into discussions with 19 of these investors. Feedback was reported to the Governance & Remunerations Committee and to the Board of Directors. This dialogue will be pursued in 2023 to ensure that the Board takes the feedback into account to determine the compensation policy of the Corporate Officers.\n\nThe Board values the comments received during these engagements with shareholders. Although there were no unanimous or major concerns being raised, the Board took the opportunity of the change of governance to incorporate some of the sensitivities mentioned by shareholders into its decisions.\n\nConsidering Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire is stepping down as Chief Executive Officer on May 3, 2023, the Board decided not to increase his fixed remuneration for the period from January 1, 2023 until May 3, 2023 and almost not to change his compensation policy from the one applied in 2022. When positioning the fixed compensation of Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire as Chairman of the Board for the period starting on May 4, 2023, the Board used notably an in-depth study of industry practices in term of compensation and also took into account the specific missions assigned to him by the Board.\n\nIn designing the remuneration policy applicable to the new Chief Executive Officer, the Board wished to maintain an overall stability in the compensation structure, which demonstravely drives the right behaviors, appears balanced, provides market competitive pay, and ensures a strong link between pay and performance, a strong alignment with both employees and shareholders, as well as a focus on the long-term. The Board also took into account shareholders' feedback and considered Peter Herweck's expertise and past experience, and proposed some adjustments (see section 4.2.3 of this Universal Registration Document presenting the remuneration policy).",

They are deemed to constitute the last policy approved by the shareholders in the meaning of Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code and govern the entirety of the compensation granted by the Group to the Corporate Officers until the next policy is approved by the shareholders.\n\n## Pillar\n\n## How it is reflected in the Group 2022 compensation policy\n\n## Pay-for-performance\n\n## Principle 1: Prevalence of variable components: circa 80% for CEO (at target).\n\n## Alignment with shareholders' interests\n\nA prevalent part of the Corporate Officer target package shall be variable; the 2022 target package thus consists of approximately 80% variable pay component (excluding pension payments).\n\n## Chairman & Chief Executive Officer:\n\n## On target pay mix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n17%\n\n83%\n\n## Principle 2: Performance evaluated via economic and measurable criteria.\n\nPerformance is evaluated via criteria that are mainly economic (80% of variable cash compensation and 75% of multi-year Performance Shares) and measurable, which are selected based on KPIs used in the market communication and drivers of the Group's strategy. All criteria have measurable targets approved by the Board at the beginning of the performance period, ensuring targets are achievable but demanding.\n\n## Principle 3: Financial and Sustainability objectives are fairly balanced and distributed between short-term (annual incentive) and medium-term (long-term incentive) components.\n\n2022 Annual incentive (80% financial/ 20% sustainability):\n\n- \u00b7 40% Group organic sales growth\n- \u00b7 30% Adjusted EBITA margin (organic) improvement\n- \u00b7 10% Group cash conversion rate\n\n2022 Long-term incentive (75% financial/ 25% sustainability):\n\n- \u00b7 40% Adjusted Earning per Share (EPS)\n- \u00b7 35% Relative Total Shareholder Return\n- \u00b7 25% Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI)\n- \u00b7 20% Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI)\n\n## Principle 4: Significant proportion of the total compensation delivered in shares.\n\nThe Corporate Officer's target package consists of approximately 60% long-term share-based compensation, meaning their compensation is subject to the same share price volatility that shareholders experience.\n\n## Principle 5: Performance conditions aligned to shareholders' expectations and Schneider Electric's strategic priorities.\n\nPerformance criteria were selected from financial indicators that are most representative of Group performance and that are closely linked to shareholder value creation. Performance levels required to reach targets were set at the beginning of the performance period in line with the objectives disclosed to the market at the same time as the results of the previous fiscal year and were supplemented by factors that enable the Group to offer a long-term and satisfactory development outlook for all stakeholders in the Company's success.",

Most of the Group's key competitors are headquartered outside France. To reflect this, the international peer group consists of 24 French, European, and US companies that are comparable to Schneider Electric in size or industry sector, or that represent a potential source of recruitment or attrition. Compensation levels for the Corporate Officer are reviewed annually and benchmarked by reference to the median of this peer group to ensure they remain reasonable and appropriately competitive. This benchmarking is primarily used to establish a frame of reference for what competitors are paying to comparable roles, rather than as the main factor for making compensation decisions.\n\nThe 2022 peer group comprises European and US-based companies:\n\n- \u00b7 Business competitors (in particular, those identified in the Long-term incentive plan as performance peers for TSR comparison purposes);\n- \u00b7 Talent competitors for operational and functional roles; and\n- \u00b7 'Acceptance' peers ( i.e. similar groups in terms of size, business, or structure).\n\n| Group 1:  European  (Capital  Goods)   | Group 2:  European  (Construction)   | Group 3:  European  (Technology  Hardware  & Software)   | Group 4:  European  (Industrial  B2B)   | Group 5:  US  (Capital  Goods)   | Group 6:  US  (Technology  Hardware  & Software)   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| ABB                                    | ACS                                  | Dassault                                                 | Airbus Group                            | Eaton                            | Autodesk  PTC                                      |\n| Atlas Copco                            | Lafarge                              | Syst\u00e8mes                                                 | Air Liquide                             | Emerson                          |                                                    |\n| Legrand                                | Holcim                               | Hexagon                                                  | Bayer                                   | Honeywell                        |                                                    |\n| Siemens                                | Saint-Gobain                         | SAP                                                      | BASF                                    | Johnson                          |                                                    |\n| CNH  Industrial                        | Vinci                                | TE  Connectivity                                         |                                         | Controls  Rockwell               |                                                    |\n\n## Principle 7: To reference the CAC 40 third quartile and the STOXX Europe 50 median.\n\nThe Board reviews the Corporate Officer's compensation with reference to the upper quartile of the CAC 40 companies and the median of the STOXX Europe 50 companies, in line with the Group's position within these panels.\n\n## Positioning relative to the market benchmarks\n\n## Chairman and CEO 2022 compensation relative to the market benchmarks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal compensation includes base salary, annual incentive at target, and IFRS value of Performance Shares granted during the year.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Therefore, the Board resolved to increase the targets linked to revenue growth in order to align them with the new guidance announced to the market at that time:\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue growth of +9% to +11% organic (previously +7% to +9% organic in February 2022);\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITA margin up +30bps to +60bps organic (unchanged vs. February 2022).\n\nThis decision has been made to ensure a better alignment with the shareholders' experience and to make sure that the Chairman & CEO was compensated only for the Company's intrinsic performance. Without this adjustment, the indicator linked to revenue growth would have been overachieved by 200% delivering 80% of target variable compensation for this criteria instead of the 69.3% which was delivered after taking into consideration the targets adjustment resolved by the Board.\n\nThe final 2022 results for revenue growth (12.2%) having exceeded the targets disclosed to the market in July 2022, total achievement rate of the annual variable compensation of the Corporate Officer was set by the Board at 114.9% of the targeted variable compensation, reflecting strong performance of Schneider Electric in 2022.",

Therefore, this good performance resulted in an achievement rate of this criterion of 69.3% on the range between 0% to 80%.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITA margin improvement: In 2022, Adjusted EBITA margin rate improved by +0.4 bps organically to reach 17.6%, as a consequence of strong pricing, good cost control and improving SFC/Sales ratio. As a result, the achievement rate on this criterion was set at 10% on a scale from 0% to 60%.\n- \u00b7 Cash conversion: Free cash-flow was \u20ac3.33 billion. Therefore, cash conversion was 95.8% in 2022 which represented an achievement rate of 7.2% on this criterion, on a scale from 0% to 20%.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Sustainability Impact: the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI), is the translation of our six long-term commitments into a selection of 11 highly transformative and innovative sustainability programs. It's the Group's five-year (2021-2025) plan with progress tracked and published quarterly, as well as audited annually. In 2022 the SSI achieved a score of 4.91/10 exceeding its target for the year, representing an achievement rate of 28.4% on a scale from 0% to 40%.\n\nAs a result, the 2022 annual variable compensation pay-out for the Corporate Officer was calculated on the base of his fixed compensation as follows:\n\n| At Target pay-out   | At Target pay-out   | Achievement rate   | 2022 Actual pay-out   | 2022 Actual pay-out   |\n|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| as a % of salary    | Amount (\u20ac)          | as a % of target   | as a % of base salary | Amount (\u20ac)            |\n| 130%                | \u20ac1,300,000          | 114.9%             | 149.4%                | \u20ac1,493,700            |\n\nIn compliance with Article L.22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code, the payment of this annual variable compensation is subject to approval by the shareholders of the compensation granted to the Corporate Officer for the fiscal year 2022 (see 6 th resolution to be submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 4, 2023).\n\nAs a reminder, an amount of \u20ac1,990,300 was paid in 2022 to Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire for the annual variable compensation due for the fiscal year 2021 after the approval of the 8 th resolution by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 5, 2022 (see page 316 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document).\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

He undertook to redirect these complementary payments, net of taxes, to investment vehicles devoted to financing his additional pension. To determine this authorized complementary compensation, the Board of Directors sought the recommendation of an independent expert, namely the firm WTW, and ensured that the mechanism implemented therefore, was in line with shareholders' interests.\n\nAccordingly, Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire is entitled to receive annually a complementary component, split into a fixed and variable portion as follows:\n\n|                                   | Variable portion   | Variable portion   | Variable portion   | Variable portion   | Variable portion   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Fixed portion Target (% of Fixed) |                    | Minimum            | At target          | Maximum            | Total at Target    |\n| \u20ac191,600                          | 130%               | \u20ac0                 | \u20ac249,080           | \u20ac498,160           | \u20ac440,680           |\n\nThe variable part is dependent on performance criteria aligned with the variable annual compensation (see above).\n\n## Application of the 2022 compensation policy\n\nAt the meeting held on February 15, 2023, the annual complementary variable portion for pension for 2022 to be paid after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting if the latter approves it, was set by the Board of Directors at 149.4% of the annual complementary fixed portion, i.e. an achievement rate of 114.9%.\n\nFor 2022, Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire is entitled to receive:\n\n| Fixed amount  due for 2022   | Variable amount  due for 2022 (1)   | Total due   for 2022   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| \u20ac191,600                     | \u20ac286,193                            | \u20ac477,793               |\n\nIn compliance with applicable law, the payment of the variable amount will be subject to shareholders' approval (see 6 th resolution submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 4, 2023).\n\nReminder: an amount of \u20ac381,341 was paid in 2022 to Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire for the variable portion of his pension due for the fiscal year 2021 after its approval by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 5, 2022 (see page 319 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document).\n\n## \u20ac477,793\n\n(amount due for 2022 (fixed portion of \u20ac191,600 paid in 2022 and variable portion of \u20ac286,193 to be paid in 2023))\n\nReminder: \u20ac572,941 (amount due for 2021 (fixed portion of \u20ac191,600 paid in 2021 and variable portion of \u20ac381,341 paid in 2022))\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The different rating achieved by Schneider in 2020, 2021 and 2022 in those indexes resulted in an achievement rate of the SSERI of 23.96% (out of 25%).\n\n|                           |                                                                                     | Actual achievement                  | Actual achievement   | Actual achievement      | Actual achievement   | Actual achievement     |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n|                           |                                                                                     | 2020                                | 2021                 | 2022                    | Pay-out  rate        | Weighted  pay-out rate |\n| 6.25% DJSIW               | \u00b7 0%: not in World                                                                  |                                     |                      |                         |                      |                        |\n|                           | \u00b7 50%: included in World                                                            |                                     |                      | sector                  |                      |                        |\n|                           | \u00b7 100%: sector leader                                                               | sector leader                       |                      | leader                  |                      |                        |\n| 6.25% Euronext   Vigeo    | \u00b7 0%: out \u00b7 50%: included in World 120  or Europe 120 \u00b7 100%: included in World 120 |                                     | World World 120 &    |                         | 83.33%               | 5.21%                  |\n| 6.25% Ecovadis (1)        | & Europe 120 \u00b7 0%: Silver Medal or less \u00b7 50%: Gold Medal (top 5%)                  | World 120 &  Europe 120 Developed & | Europe 120           | World 120 &  Europe 120 | 100%                 |                        |\n| 6.25% CDP  Climate Change | \u00b7  100%: Platinum Medal (top  1%)                                                   | Env.

In 2020, Schneider Electric was included in Developed & Environmental Leaders EU 40 indexes which triggered the maximum vesting for this year. From 2021 the FTSE4GOOD index has been replaced by Ecovadis index, due to the decommissioning of one of the two FTSE4GOOD indices.\n\nThe fact that the compensation mechanism has materialized this year does not create any disconnection between pay and performance considering that the impact is limited ( i.e. 11%) and the payout rate actually reflects the good performance of the Company over the last three years and the strong 2022 results. In addition, this result is aligned with the shareholders' experience, the TSR being 55.3% over this period.\n\n## Historical vesting of the Corporate Officers' Performance Share plans:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLTIP 2019 96.86%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Besides the fixed base amount, Directors' compensation mostly depends upon the said Directors' attendance at Board and committee meetings.\n\nUpon the recommendation from the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board of Directors is responsible for setting the allocation of the Directors' fees among Board members accordingly with the maximum annual amount of Directors' fees that can be paid to the Board members set at \u20ac2,500,000 by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting held on April 25, 2019. The 2022 compensation policy approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting held on May 5, 2022 provides the allocation rules of the fees to the non-executive Directors which are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-executive Directors will be paid:\n- - a fixed basic amount of \u20ac25,000 for membership of the Board;\n- - an amount of \u20ac7,000 per Board meeting attended;\n- - an amount of \u20ac4,000 per committee meeting attended;\n- - an amount of \u20ac25,000 for the yearly strategy week (half in case of digital assistance);\n- \u00b7 Additional annual payments are made to non-executive Directors who chair a committee to reflect the additional responsibilities and workload:\n- - Audit & Risks Committee: \u20ac20,000;\n- - Human Resources & CSR Committee, Digital Committee, and Investment Committee: \u20ac15,000; and\n- - Lead Independent Director, who is also the Chairman of the Governance & Remunerations Committee: \u20ac250,000.\n- \u00b7 For an observer, an annual fixed payment of \u20ac20,000 is paid, unless they become a non-executive Director at the next General Meeting. In this case, they will receive the same fees for attending the Board and committee meetings as non-executive Directors.\n- \u00b7 All payments are prorated for time served during the year and are paid in cash.\n\nDirectors' compensation earned in 2021 and 2022 was as follows, noting that Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman of the Board, and Xiaoyun Ma who represents the employee shareholders, waived the payments of the compensation they were entitled to as members of the Board.\n\n- - an amount of \u20ac5,000 (for intercontinental travel) or \u20ac3,000 (for intra-continental travel) per Board session physically attended.\n\n|                      | Directors' compensation   (in euros)   | Directors' compensation   (in euros)   | Other compensation & benefits   (in euros)   | Other compensation & benefits   (in euros)   | Total (in euros)   | Total (in euros)   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                      | 2022 (1)                               | 2021 (2)                               | 2022 (1)                                     | 2021 (2)                                     | 2022 (1)           | 2021 (2)           |\n| L\u00e9o Apotheker        | 178,000                                | 155,000                                | -

        "page_content": "## 4.2 Compensation Report\n\n## 4.2.2.4  Pay Equity ratio\n\n## Employees experience at Schneider Electric\n\nDelivery of the strategy, both short term and long term, depends upon Schneider Electric's success in attracting and engaging a highly talented workforce, and on equipping people with the skills for the future. The Group is committed to fair pay, which is at the forefront of the Group's and executives' agenda, ensuring that all Schneider Electric employees are appropriately and fairly rewarded for their contribution. The progress is monitored via the Schneider Sustainability Impact indicators. More information can be found in the Sustainable Development Chapter (Chapter 2) of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Pay Equity\n\n## Living wage\n\n## Recognition\n\n## Well-being\n\n## Engagement\n\nFair and equitable pay is a core component of the Group's compensation philosophy. Since 2015, the Company has adopted a Global Pay Equity Framework. With the help of this Framework, Schneider Electric has committed to reaching <1% pay gap for both females and males by 2025. Furthermore, the pay equity adjustment is fully integrated into the annual global salary review and its principles leveraged during the promotion and hiring processes.\n\nSchneider Electric believes earning a decent wage is a basic human right and a key element to decent work. The Group is committed to paying employees in the lower salary ranges at or above the living wage to meet their family's basic needs. By basic needs, the Group considers food, housing, sanitation, education, and healthcare, plus discretionary income for a given local standard of living.\n\nSchneider Electric is committed to creating a culture where employees receive regular feedback and coaching from their managers and colleagues, celebrating people who constantly demonstrate the Company's Core Values and go above and beyond - using global recognition portal 'Step Up' and encouraging the recognition of small and big achievements by simply saying 'Thank you'.\n\n## Pay Equity Ratio\n\nPay Equity Ratio measures the ratio between the level of compensation of the Chairman & CEO and the average and median compensation of the employees, as required by Article L.22-10-9 I 6\u00b0 and 7\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## Calculation methodology\n\nThe compensation comparisons and pay ratios set out below were calculated based on the AFEP-MEDEF guidelines. The calculation includes employees who were continuously employed during the financial years concerned. For part-time employees, compensation was established on a full-time equivalent basis.\n\nCompensation elements taken into account:\n\n## For the Chairman & CEO:\n\n- \u00b7 2022 fixed compensation;\n- \u00b7 Variable compensation paid in 2022 (for the performance year 2021);\n- \u00b7 Relevant benefits (cost of the company car, profit-sharing and employer matching contributions to employee saving plan) for 2022;\n- \u00b7 Value of the Performance shares granted in 2022 at their fair value (IFRS) on the grant date.\n\nHealth and wellbeing are embedded in the Schneider Electric strategic people priorities and contribute to its core sustainability mission. The Company has a commitment to a comprehensive well-being at work program translated into dual standards of access to healthcare and well-being training programs.\n\n## For the employees:\n\n- \u00b7 2022 fixed compensation;\n- \u00b7 Variable compensation paid in 2022 (for the performance year 2021);\n- \u00b7 Relevant bonuses and benefits (in cash and kind) for 2022;\n- \u00b7 Profit sharing and employer matching contributions to employee saving plan for 2022;\n- \u00b7 Value of the Performance shares granted in 2022 at their fair value (IFRS) on the grant date.\n\nThe Group listens to employees through a number of different channels, both formally and informally. Three of the Board Directors are employees of the Company, appointed through a formal designation process. The Group runs OneVoice internal survey designed to measure employee satisfaction and engagement; the Group also recognizes the importance of dialogue and engages with the local work councils on compensation matters on a regular basis.",

It is based on the French holding entity Schneider Electric Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (SESE) (the issuer) as well as all employees in France of the operational company Schneider Electric Industries (SAS). This group of employees is employed on comparable terms to the Corporate Officer and represents more than 4,000 employees in France on a full-time equivalent basis.\n\n## Global perimeter:\n\nIn addition, from 2022 the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee and of the Human Resources & CSR Committee, decided to voluntarily report the evolution of the pay ratio between the Chairman & CEO and the average and median compensation of the employees on a broader scope which includes approximately 126,000 Schneider Electric employees across the top 30 countries ('Global Scope'). This represents circa 87.5% of all Schneider Electric employees globally.

        "page_content": "## 4.2 Compensation Report\n\n## 4.2.3  Compensation policy for the 2023 fiscal year (say on pay ex-ante )\n\nThe compensation policy intention is to provide a clear link between delivery of Schneider Electric's strategy and the Corporate Officers' compensation, while reflecting outcomes for shareholders. Set out below is the Corporate Officers and non-executive Directors' compensation policy for 2023. It will be submitted to the shareholders at the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting (7 th to 9 th and 11 th resolutions) and, subject to shareholders approval, will remain in force until the next policy is approved by the shareholders.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2023, as a consequence of the change of governance, four different compensation policies will be applicable:\n\n- - to the Chairman & CEO (Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire) for the period running from January 1, 2023 to May 3, 2023 (subject of the 7 th resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting);\n- - to the Chief Executive Officer (Mr. Peter Herweck) for the\n- period running from May 4, 2023 to December 31, 2023 (subject of the 8 th resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting);\n- - to the Chairman of the Board of Directors (Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire) for the period running from May 4, 2023 to December 31, 2023 (subject of the 9 th resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting);\n- - to the Board members for the full year 2023 (subject of the 11 th resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting).\n\n## 4.2.3.1  Executive compensation policy\n\nSchneider Electric follows a rigorous process for determining executive compensation, under the leadership of committed and independent Directors.\n\n## Role of the Governance & Remunerations Committee\n\nThe general principles and criteria forming part of the compensation policy for Corporate Officers, and their individual compensation packages are prepared and reviewed by the Governance & Remunerations Committee which makes recommendations to the Board of Directors for decision. The Board receives inputs and recommendations from the Human Resources & CSR Committee on the incentive structure and performance criteria (annual variable compensation and Long-term incentive plan) applied to the members of the Executive Committee (see section 4.2.4 of the Universal Registration Document), as well as the Group's other employees.\n\nTo help the Board in the decision process, the Governance & Remunerations Committee and the Human Resources & CSR Committee are authorized to call upon external experts for specific topics, benchmarking data and analyses. The Committees hold at least one joint meeting every year to discuss the compensation structure applicable to Corporate Officers and other employees of the Group.\n\nThese joint committee meetings are attended by one of the two employee Directors and the Director representing the employee shareholders who are members of the Human Resources & CSR Committee.\n\nAs part of its preparatory work for its proposals to the Board, the Committee:\n\n## Defines performance criteria\n\nDefines performance criteria based on Schneider Electric's executive compensation pillars and business strategy. Targets are determined at the beginning of the performance period in accordance with the goals of the Strategic Plan.\n\nBased on circumstances and priorities, the targets also encompass risks raised by the Audit & Risks Committee as well as the recommendations of the Human Resources & CSR Committee.\n\n## Benchmarks Corporate Officers' pay\n\nBenchmarks Corporate Officers' pay against the median of a peer group consisting of 24 French and international companies that are comparable to Schneider Electric in terms of market capitalization, revenue, and industry, or that represent a potential source of recruitment or attrition.\n\nThis benchmarking is used as an indicator, not as a target, and is done ex-post only for reference.\n\n## Engages with shareholders\n\nRelies on the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director to directly engage with shareholders to ensure their perspectives and feedback on Schneider Electric's compensation policy are heard and considered in decision-making.\n\nThe topic of Corporate Officers' compensation is usually discussed at four Board meetings every year. Corporate Officers do not take part in the debates of the Board concerning their own compensation.\n\nThis process ensures consistency and alignment between the compensation policy applied to the other executives and employees and the compensation policy applied to Corporate Officers. They share the same objectives and priorities and their rewards are aligned with the Group's performance and shareholder value creation.",

        "page_content": "## Use of discretion\n\nIn determining executive compensation, the Board could use its discretionary power to ensure the execution of the compensation policy and related payouts remain in line with the performance of the Company.\n\nAs such, and only in exceptional circumstances external to Schneider such as unexpected changes in the industry environment and in compensation practice generally, not taken into account when determining the current remuneration policy, the Board could exercise discretion, upwards or downwards, to adjust the formulaic outcome for annual or long-term incentive awards resulting from the strict application of the approved policy, where a qualitative assessment of performance is required to ensure that the awarded compensation is fair in light of the Corporate Officers' actual contribution to the Company's overall performance, its positioning vs. competition, and the outcomes for shareholders and employees.\n\nIf necessary, the Board could also adjust one or several parameters of the remuneration schemes, such as weights, targets or criteria, being specified that in any event, these adjustments or modifications will not result in exceeding the maximum of annual\n\nvariable compensation and LTIP award as set in the current remuneration policy.\n\nAny use of discretion will be explained and an appropriate disclosure would be provided, so that shareholders understand the basis for the Board's decisions.\n\n## Changes in the 2023 compensation policy\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the existing policy and reassessed the pillars and principles formulated in 2018, the compensation elements and criteria considering the feedback of shareholders received during the shareholder engagement process described above. Upon recommendations of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board wishes to overall maintain the stability of the compensation policy which appears balanced and provides market competitive pay, ensuring a strong link between pay and performance, strong alignment with both employees and shareholders, and long-term focus, while at the same time taking into account the shareholders' feedbacks.\n\nTherefore, based on the Committee's analyses and recommendations, the Board proposes to implement the following changes for the 2023 compensation policy:\n\n## Key adjustments proposed in the 2023 Chief Executive Officer's compensation policy (Mr. Peter Herweck) applicable as of May 4, 2023\n\n| Review of the targeted  amounts for the fixed  compensation, the annual  variable compensation,  the Long-term incentive  plan and the pension   | To determine the different components of the remuneration policy, the Board used notably an in-depth study of  industry practices in term of compensation and took into account Mr. Peter Herweck's experience and his  compensation package as Chief Executive Officer of AVEVA, the size of the Group and its evolution over the past  years, the compensation practices within the Company and in the Executive Committee. Based on those considerations, the Board proposes:  \u00b7  an increase in fixed compensation by 20% compared to the 2022 compensation policy applicable to  Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire; \u00b7  an annual variable remuneration of 100% of fixed remuneration on-target and 200% of fixed remuneration at  maximum (compared to 130% and 260% respectively for Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire); \u00b7  a targeted LTIP grant of around 85% of the combined fixed and target short-term variable compensation (or   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                  | The on-target pay mix would thus be 27% of fixed compensation, 27% of annual variable and 46% of LTIP,  providing for 73% of performance-based compensation.

At the start of each year, the Board reviews the measures, targets, and weightings to ensure they remain consistent with the annual priorities and Group strategy. For the annual variable compensation and the Performance Shares, the approach to performance measurement is intended to provide a balance of measures to assess performance focusing on execution of the Group's strategic priorities.\n\n## Considerations of wider workforce compensation and shareholders' views\n\nThe Board monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the compensation policy for Corporate Officer and senior management\n\nand has regard to its impact and consistency with compensation policies in the wider workforce. During the year, the Board is provided with information and context on pay in the wider workforce and various HR initiatives to enable its decision-making. This includes the approach to gender pay gap and living wage programs rolled out globally, the annual variable compensation results, and the total cost of LTIP awards.\n\nThe Board is committed to an open and transparent dialogue with Schneider Electric's shareholders through the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director. Where appropriate, Schneider Electric actively engages with shareholders and shareholder representative bodies, taking their views into account when making any decisions about the Corporate Officers' compensation.

The Board ensures that the Chairman & CEO's salary is set reasonably compared to similar roles in the market.\n\nConsidering the fact that Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire will end his function of Chief Executive Officer in 2023, the Board decided not to increase his salary for 2023 and to maintain his fixed compensation at \u20ac1,000,000 on a full year basis.\n\nThe amount will be prorated for the period from January 1, 2023 to May 3, 2023, to the effect that the amount paid will be equal to \u20ac341,398.\n\n## Salary increase over the last 5 years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Corporate Officer                      | Amount prorated  for the period  from January 1 to  May 3, 2023   | Full year amount   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and CEO | \u20ac341,398                                                          | \u20ac1,000,000         |\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nAnnual variable compensation provides variable cash compensation which rewards achievement of the short-term financial and sustainability targets of the Group.\n\nAt the start of the fiscal year, financial and sustainability performance criteria, weightings, and annual targets are reviewed in detail by the Committee and recommended to the Board for approval.

The cash payments are a combination of fixed and variable payments that are considered 'other benefits' to ensure consistency and comparability with other French or international companies. The maximum annual Complementary Pension Cash Benefit for 2023 remains unchanged, it will be prorated for the period from January 1, 2023 to May 3, 2023 and is detailed in the table below.

Having said that, it should be underlined that, at the request of the Board, Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire voluntarily undertook that, in the event of termination of his duties as Chairman for whatever reasons, he will be required, for a period of twelve months following termination, not to work, in whatever manner it may be, for the benefit of any entity carrying on operations which are in direct competition with Schneider Electric in any country. This commitment will not be indemnified by the Company.\n\nRegarding the unvested LTIP granted in 2021 and 2022, the compensation policies for 2021 and 2022 that were supported respectively by more than 81% and 89% of the shareholders, provide that in case of retirement or change of assignment within the Group, the Chairman & CEO will retain his rights in full. The delivery of the Performance shares granted will nonetheless remain subject to the fulfillment of (i) the performance conditions stipulated in the plans and (ii) the continuous presence condition within the Group as Corporate Officer.\n\nAt its meeting of February 15, 2023, the Board, upon the proposal of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, confirmed this rule. It is indeed applied to the more than 3,500 beneficiaries within the Group who also keep their LTIP if they retire or change assignment within the Group. The Board determined that since Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire is going to change assignment becoming Chairman of the Board of Directors, and not leaving the Company; as any other employee, he should keep his rights.\n\nUnder the leadership of Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire from 2003 to 2022, Schneider has multiplied its revenue by 3.9 (from \u20ac8.8 billion to \u20ac34.2 billion), its net Income by 8.8 (from \u20ac0.4 billion to \u20ac3.5 billion) and its market capitalization by 7 (from \u20ac12 billion to \u20ac88 billion). The Board is pleased for the Group to still benefit from Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire's experience and considers it is in the best interest of the Company that he keeps his rights while he will be dedicated to ensure a smooth and productive leadership transition, with enlarged duties.\n\n| Corporate Officer                       | Employment contract   | Top-Hat pension benefits   | Payments or benefits that may  be due in the event of  termination of assignment   | Payments in relation to a  non-compete agreement   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Jean-Pascal Tricoire,  Chairman and CEO | NO                    | NO (1)                     | NO                                                                                 | NO                                                 |\n\n- (1)  The Board of Directors of February 18, 2015, decided to put an end to the benefits of the top-hat pension plan for Corporate Officers.",

        "page_content": "## 4.2.3.1.3 Compensation policy of Mr. Peter Herweck as Chief Executive Officer from May 4, 2023\n\nPursuant to the principles of the remuneration policy of Executive Officers described above, the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023, on the recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, decided to set as follows the components of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation policy to be granted as from his appointment to this position by the Board in connection with the implementation of a separated governance, i.e. , as from May 4, 2023.\n\nTo determine this remuneration policy, the Governance & Remunerations Committee used an in-depth study of industry practices, including a benchmark of remuneration practices in CAC 40 and STOXX Europe 50 indices, and a selected group of peer companies (the composition of which is described in section 4.2.2.1 of the Universal Registration Document), with the assistance of an outside firm (WTW) based on publicly available data. With regard to this panel, it exhibits the necessary characteristics of competitiveness and comparability.\n\nThe remuneration policy is designed to be attractive and motivating. It notably takes into account:\n\n- \u00b7 Mr Peter Herweck's experience and skills, his successful career in particular within the Group which he joined in 2016 and his compensation package as Chief Executive Officer of AVEVA (fixed compensation of \u00a3785,000 with a maximum annual variable compensation opportunity of 200% of his fixed compensation);\n- \u00b7 the size of the Group and its evolution over the past years, notably since the Board last adjusted the fixed salary of its top executive in 2018;\n- \u00b7 the positioning of the compensation components compared with executive corporate officers with a comparable profile;\n- \u00b7 the consistency of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation with that of Executive Committee members and compensation practices within the Company;\n- \u00b7 Mr. Peter Herweck's intention to unilaterally end his current employment contract with the Group by means of resignation as from the start of his corporate office, in compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and best governance practices.\n\nBased on those considerations, the Board has decided to set the amount of the key compensation elements of Mr. Peter Herweck as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 a fixed compensation of \u20ac1,200,000: this amount will be just under the median of the CAC 40 Companies, considerably below the 25 th centile of the STOXX Europe 50 companies and considerably below the median of the peer group;\n- \u00b7 a targeted annual variable compensation representing 100% of the fixed compensation: this amount will be at the median of the CAC 40 Companies and below the 25 th centile of the STOXX Europe 50 companies and peer group;\n- \u00b7 a long-term incentive representing 170% of the fixed compensation (valued in accordance with the IFRS standard): this amount will be between the median and the 75 th centile of the CAC 40 companies and between the 25 th centile and the median of the STOXX Europe 50 Companies and peer group.\n\nThe Board thus proposes to position the total target compensation package of the Chief Executive Officer between the median and the 75 th centile of the CAC 40 companies and considerably below the 25 th centile of the STOXX Europe 50 companies and peer group. Compared to the former Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, despite an increase of the fixed compensation, this proposal represents a decrease of more than 23% of the total target compensation package. This proposal is also in line with the enlarged scope and responsibilities related to his change of role, when comparing to his previous pay package.\n\n## Positioning of Mr. Peter Herweck's compensation package compared to the market benchmarks\n\n|                    | Fixed compensation   |   Targeted Annual  variable  compensation (as %  of fixed  compensation) | Fixed Compensation +  Targeted annual  variable  compensation   |   LTI granted (as % of  fixed compensation | Fixed compensation +  Targeted annual  variable  compensation + LTI  Granted   |\n|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Peter Herweck, CEO | \u20ac 1,200,000          |                                                                      100 | \u20ac 2,400,000                                                     |                                        170 | \u20ac 4,440,000                                                                    |\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Outcomes will be determined based on performance against each of those targets. The Board has the flexibility to review targets during the year to ensure continuous alignment with shareholders' interests. The pay-out opportunity at threshold performance is 0%, with 50% of maximum annual variable compensation payable for achieving target. The maximum annual variable compensation will only be earned where a strong performance is delivered on each performance metric. Pay-outs between threshold and target, and between target and maximum, are determined on a straight-line basis.\n\nFor 2023, the Board proposes that the measurable financial performance criteria determine 70% and sustainability and customer satisfaction criteria, 30% of the variable cash compensation of Mr. Peter Herweck.\n\nTargeted annual variable compensation (as % of /fixed compensation)\n\nFixed compensation + Targeted annual variable compensation",

More than 240,000 answers of customers are provided to the survey each year. The grades given by customers range from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied). The NSS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are dissatisfied (grade 0 to 6) from the percentage who are very satisfied (grade 9 and 10). It generates a score between -100% and 100%:\n\n- \u00b7 At one end of the spectrum, if all of the customers gave a grade lower or equal to 6, this would lead to an NSS of -100%;\n- \u00b7 On the other end of the spectrum, if all of the customers gave a grade of 9 or 10, then the NSS would be 100%.\n\nThe NSS targets would be set as a percentage point improvement versus previous year.

Vesting will normally operate on a straight-line basis between these points.\n\n## LTIP time horizon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe 2023 LTIP criteria will remain the same as in 2022, in line with Company's objectives and the proposals approved by shareholders under the LTIP resolution at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 5, 2022 (15 th resolution). The two changes introduced last year will be continued: the vesting scale of the criterion of TSR compared to a bespoke industry panel of 11 companies which would be made more stringent (no vesting under the median of the group would be allowed) and the disclosure of the targets set for the improvement of the adjusted EPS criterion which will be disclosed ex-post allowing shareholders to ensure the stringency of the targets set by the Board.\n\nIn order to align the interests of the Group's executives to those of the shareholders, in 2023, the Board will allocate Performance Shares to more than 3,500 Group executives and senior management, leaders, and key talents. For the Group senior management, 100% of shares allocated will be subject to performance conditions measured over three years.\n\nThe maximum annual award to the Corporate Officer, valued in accordance with IFRS standards, will be capped at 150% of the combined fixed and target short-term variable compensation at the date of grant to ensure that it does not represent a disproportionate percentage of his overall compensation. This new cap represents a decrease of 25% compared to the previous cap provided in the 2022 remuneration policy (200% of the combined fixed and target short-term variable compensation).\n\nFor 2023, the Board intends to grant Mr. Peter Herweck an amount of LTIP, which value in accordance with IFRS standards will be around (1) 85% of the combined fixed and target short-term variable compensation ( i.e. 170% of the fixed compensation), well below the maximum grant authorized under the remuneration policy. This amount is set for the full year 2023 including the months where Mr. Peter Herweck was Chief Executive Officer of AVEVA and transitioning to his new role. Mr. Peter Herweck will not be granted any other instruments for 2023.\n\nThe volume of the annual award will be set in consideration of:\n\n- \u00b7 The market practice and competitive positioning of the CEO's compensation package;\n- \u00b7 The Group's performance, acknowledged by the market;\n- \u00b7 The performance criteria applicable to the final acquisition of LTIP awards;\n- \u00b7 The culture of ownership deeply rooted in Schneider Electric's DNA.\n\nIn the context described above, the Board decided that the number of shares granted to the CEO continues to be reasonable in terms of quantum and market practice for comparable roles; it rewards the Company's good performance in a challenging year and supports the culture of ownership strongly promoted by Schneider Electric.\n\n- (1)  At the date of the grant, the IFRS value cannot be known with certainty as it is computed only at the end of the year. For the 2023 grant, the value of the grant to the Chief Executive Officer will be based on the assumption that the discount rate applied according to the IFRS rules will be 26% as it was for the 2022 grant.",

CAC 40 companies;\n- \u00b7 25%, based on Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI).\n\n## \u00b7 Adjusted EPS (40%)\n\nAdjusted EPS is a key long-term performance metric which promotes the execution of Schneider Electric's strategy to deliver profitable growth, thus reinforcing alignment with shareholders. Performance Shares could vest subject to the achievement of the following targets as set by the Board of Directors at the beginning of each year:\n\n- \u00b7 a minimum Adjusted EPS improvement threshold under which there will be no vesting;\n- \u00b7 an intermediary targeted Adjusted EPS improvement objective that the Company will have to achieve in order to vest 75% of the shares under this condition;\n- \u00b7 a targeted Adjusted EPS improvement objective that the Company will have to achieve in order to vest all shares under this condition;\n- \u00b7 the Performance Shares will vest progressively, on a linear basis, if the Adjusted EPS improvement is between these objectives.\n\nAs explained above, the Board commits to disclose ex-post , at the end of each Long-term incentive plan, the minimum Adjusted EPS improvement thresholds and the targeted Adjusted EPS improvement objectives.\n\nAdjusted EPS performance is published in the external financial communications and its annual variance will be calculated using adjusted EBITA at constant FX from year N-1 to year N. Foreign exchange impacts below adjusted EBITA will be taken in full. Significant unforeseen scope impact could be restated from this calculation upon decision of the Board.\n\n## \u00b7 Relative TSR (35%)\n\nThis criterion strengthens the alignment between the shareholders' interests and compensation of the Corporate Officer.\n\n- \u00b7 For 17.5% of the shares, Schneider Electric TSR will be compared to a bespoke industry panel consisting of 11 companies (ABB, Legrand, Siemens, Eaton, Emerson, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell Automation, Fuji Electric, Mitsubishi Electric and Yokogawa) with a vesting scale as follows: 0% at rank 7 or below, 50% at median (rank 6), 100% at rank 4, 150% for ranks 3 to 1, and linear between these points. As explained above, the Board proposes to strengthen the vesting scale for a better alignment with performance.\n- \u00b7 For the remaining 17.5%, Schneider Electric TSR will be compared with the TSR of the companies in the CAC 40 index to reflect the macro-economic and stock-market specific trends which influence the performance of the share and in turn, the return to shareholders with a vesting scale as follows: 0% below median, 50% at median (rank 20), 100% at rank 10, 120% in ranks 1 to 4, and linear between these points.\n\nIn case of over-performance, if Schneider Electric's TSR ranks first to third of the bespoke industry panel or within top 9 of the CAC 40 companies, this criterion may compensate the under-performance under the Adjusted EPS criterion up to the same number of shares. If the Schneider Electric TSR is closely clustered with that of other companies in the panel, then the Board of Directors will apply its judgement to decide whether Schneider Electric's TSR shall be deemed to be ranked in the same position as those companies.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Using external indices would also ensure that the sustainability priorities governing the assessment of the long-term sustainability performance of the Group are at all times those which matter the most to the stakeholders. As their content is dynamic and includes new and more relevant topics as they emerge, it forces participants to constantly anticipate the most demanding trends in global sustainability. The Board has selected some of the most challenging external indices which are objective, recognized, and independent, covering main geographies in line with the Group's global footprint and which complement each other as they cover different sustainability dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 DJSI World which covers three dimensions: economic, environmental, and social;\n- \u00b7 Euronext Vigeo which covers environment, community involvement, business behavior, human rights, corporate governance, and human resources;\n- \u00b7 Ecovadis which covers four dimensions: environment, labor and human rights, sustainable procurement and ethics; and\n- \u00b7 CDP Climate Change which covers climate change, water, and forests and represents a major reference for climate change leadership globally.\n\nAccording to the scale of the vesting of the Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index, only four companies in the world would have achieved 100% of the SSERI in 2021

In the event of an accident, the Group insurance covering the executive's accident risk, stipulating the payment of a benefit the sum of which may be up to four times the annual compensation based on the type and circumstances of the accident.\n\nEligibility for benefits (iii) through (vi) above is conditional on the fulfillment of one of the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 the average of the net income of the last five fiscal years preceding the event is positive;\n- \u00b7 the average of the free cash flow of the last five fiscal years preceding the event is positive.\n\n## Director's fee\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer will not receive any attendance fees.\n\n## Extraordinary awards\n\nThe Compensation policy does not include any provisions for extraordinary payments. The Board decided to maintain the prohibition of one-off payments that are not provided for in the compensation policy approved by the shareholders.\n\n## Clawback provision\n\nListening carefully to some concerns raised by shareholders, the Board proposes to introduce a clawback provision that would allow the Board the right to reduce or cancel some elements of compensation in the event of gross misconduct or fraud.\n\nIn the event of gross misconduct or fraud causing a material adverse impact to the Group, in particular, resulting in a financial restatement, the Board reserves the right to reduce or cancel unvested LTIP or annual variabIe compensation amounts (malus), seek reimbursement of paid annual variabIe compensation or vested LTIP and/or obtain damages.\n\n## Post-mandate benefits\n\nListening carefully to some concerns raised by shareholders, the Board proposes to amend the post-mandate benefits granted to the Chief Executive Officer compared to the previous compensation policy by strengthening the performance targets upon which an involuntary severance indemnity may be due: no indemnity if the average rate of achievement of the Group's performance criteria used in the annual variable compensation for the last three fiscal years preceding the date of the Board's decision is below 80% ( vs. 66% previously).\n\nThe table below presents a summary of the benefits that could be granted to the Chief Executive Officer on leaving office depending on the terms of the departure. The information provided in this summary is without prejudice to any decisions that may be made by the Board. In determining overall termination arrangements, the Board will ensure that termination benefits shall be granted only in case of forced departure and regardless of the form of the departure.\n\n|                                     | Voluntary resignation/Removal from  office for wrongful or gross misconduct                                    | Forced departure                                                                                                                                                | Retirement or change of assignment  within the Group   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Involuntary Severance Pay           | Not applicable                                                                                                 | Payment of an indemnity (twice  the average of the annual fixed  and variable cash compensation  paid over the last 3 years subject  to performance conditions) | Not applicable                                         |\n| Non-compete indemnity               | If not waived by the Board, 60% of annual fixed and target variable  compensation (excluding pension payments) | If not waived by the Board, 60% of annual fixed and target variable  compensation (excluding pension payments)                                                  | Not applicable                                         |\n| Retention of unvested share  awards | Forfeited in full                                                                                              | Rights retained on  prorata  basis  to presence within Schneider  Electric                                                                                      | Rights retained in full                                |",

The one-year agreement calls for compensation to be paid at 60% of annual fixed and target variable compensation (excluding complementary payments). In line with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, the Board will determine whether to apply the non-compete clause at the time of departure of the Corporate Officer.\n- \u00b7 Retention of unvested share awards : If the Chief Executive Officer leaves the Group in circumstances of a forced departure, he will be entitled to retain unvested Performance Shares, which would typically vest at the end of the relevant vesting period, subject to the applicable performance conditions, and which will be pro-rated for the time the Corporate Officer remained with the Group in any capacity during the vesting period. In case of retirement or change of assignment within the Group, the Chief Executive Officer will keep his right to the unvested Performance Shares granted to him previously, subject to the applicable performance conditions and without any prorata .\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

However, it is recognized that all circumstances in which Corporate Officer may be appointed cannot be anticipated. The Board will aim to set compensation that is appropriate to attract, motivate, retain, and reward an individual of the quality required to run the Group successfully, while avoiding paying more than is necessary. If the Board determines that it is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders to secure the services of a particular individual not promoted within the Group, it may require considering the terms of that individual's existing employment and/ or their personal circumstances.\n\nThe table below summarizes the policy on appointment of a new Corporate Officer.\n\n| Fixed compensation            | Salaries are set by the Board, taking into consideration a number of factors including the current pay for other  Corporate Officers, the experience, skill and current pay level of the individual, and external market forces. The  Board may choose to set the salary below that of the market or the other Corporate Officers with the intention of  applying staged increases as the individual gains experience in the role.                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Annual variable  compensation | Annual variable compensation will be awarded within the parameters of the policy in force.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Pension                       | The Board would set the pension cash supplementary payments at the appropriate level based on an  individual's circumstances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Other benefits                | The Board would expect any new Corporate Officer to participate in the benefit schemes that are open to other  senior employees (where appropriate, referencing the candidate's home country) but would take into account                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Buy-out awards                | The Board may offer compensatory payments or buy-out awards where an individual forfeits outstanding  variable pay opportunities or contractual rights as a result of their appointment. The specifics of any buy-out  awards would be dependent on the individual circumstances of recruitment and would be determined on a  case-by-case basis. On assessing such awards, the Board will seek to make awards on a like-for-like basis to  ensure that the value awarded would be no greater than the value forfeited by the individual. The Board may  choose to apply performance conditions to these awards. |\n| Relocation                    | Where an individual is relocating in order to take up the role, the Board may approve certain one-off benefits  such as reasonable relocation expenses, accommodation for a defined period following appointment,  assistance with visa applications or other immigration issues, and ongoing arrangements such as tax  equalization, annual flights home, and a housing allowance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Internal promotion            | Where an existing employee is appointed to the Board, he/she will be required to resign from his/her  employment contract and the Board will consider all existing contractual commitments including any  outstanding share awards or pension entitlements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\nIn making any decision on the compensation of a new Corporate Officer, the Board would balance shareholder expectations, current best practice and the circumstances of any new Corporate Officer.

The Board ensures that the Chairman's salary is set reasonably compared to similar roles at companies of similar size or complexity.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board of Directors' meeting of February 15, 2023 set the gross annual fixed compensation of the Chairman of the Board at \u20ac930,000 from 2023. This amount will be prorated at \u20ac612,500 for the period from May 4, 2023 to December 31, 2023.\n\nTo determine this remuneration, the Governance & Remunerations Committee used an in-depth study of industry and market practices, including a benchmark of remuneration practice for non-executive chairmen in CAC 40, STOXX Europe 50 and peer group companies (the composition of which is described in section 4.2.2.1 of the Universal Registration Document), with the assistance of an outside firm (WTW) based on publicly available data.\n\nThis study clearly identified three levels of compensation corresponding to the different types of duties performed by non-executive chairmen:\n\n- \u00b7 duties focusing solely on the chairing/leading the Board of Directors as well as being involved in the shareholder relations (25 th centile );\n- \u00b7 participation in a strategic committee to seek out and validate major investments (median);\n- \u00b7 support for the new CEO to ensure the success of the transition or external recruitment (75 th centile ).\n\n## Fixed compensation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn the recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board of Directors adopted a position just above the 75 th centile of the CAC 40 companies, just above the 75 th centile of the STOXX Europe 50 companies and above of the 75 th centile of the peer group. This level of compensation is also explained by the enlarged mission given by the Board to its Chairman (which is described in section 4.1.1.2.1 of the Universal Registration Document) in order to ensure a smooth and efficient transition.\n\n| Corporate Officer              | Full year amount   | Amount prorated for the  period from May 4 to  December 31, 2023   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman | \u20ac930,000           | \u20ac612,500                                                           |\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## Note 1: Summary of accounting policies\n\n## 1.1 - Accounting standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the international accounting standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union as of December 31, 2022. The same accounting methods were used as for the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe IFRS standards and interpretations as adopted by the European Union are available at the following website: https://finance.ec.europa.eu/ capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/financial-reporting\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments endorsed by the European Union whose application is mandatory as of January 1, 2022\n\nThe following standards and interpretations that were applicable during the period did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations: Reference to the Conceptual Framework;\n- \u00b7 amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use;\n- \u00b7 amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract;\n- \u00b7 Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020.\n\n## IAS 38 Configuration or Customization Costs in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\n\nThe Group has considered the impact of the IFRIC agenda decision issued in April 2021 when accounting for costs of configuring or customizing a supplier's application software in a Software as a Service (SaaS) arrangement. This decision clarifies if those costs should be expensed, either immediately or over the contract duration, or capitalized. The group performed an inventory of those costs and amounts previously capitalized in 2022. This review has no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, and, given the limited impact, no restatement was made to the opening balance sheet.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract\n\nOn May 14th, 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets to specify which costs an entity needs to include when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making. The amendments apply a directly related cost approach. The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services include both incremental costs and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities. These amendments had no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments unendorsed by the European Union as of December 31, 2022 or whose application is not mandatory as of January 1, 2022\n\n- \u00b7 standards adopted by the European Union:\n- - amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts: Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 - Comparative Information;\n- - amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction;\n- - amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting policies;\n- - amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates; - IFRS 17 and amendments - Insurance Contracts;\n- \u00b7 standards not yet adopted by the European Union:\n- - amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current; Deferral of Effective Date; Non-current Liabilities with Covenants;\n- - amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback;\n\nThe Group is currently assessing the potential effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements of the standards not yet applicable as of December 31, 2022. At this stage of analysis, the Group does not expect any material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 5.5  Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Climate-related matters\n\nThe potential impacts on the Group's assets and liabilities measurement as well as on significant judgements and estimates, from the climate-related matters, have been analysed through both climate transition risk and opportunities perspective and carbon neutral external commitments perspective. The Group is committed to net-zero CO 2 emissions in its operation by 2030, will be carbon neutral along the whole of its value chain by 2040 and net zero along the whole value chain by 2050.\n\nTo achieve its emission reduction objectives and meet net zero commitments taken, the Group has defined a roadmap and key actions to enable both its own operations and supply chain's decarbonization, leading to direct consequences on processes, site transition, R&D and investment priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Redesign of the investment monitoring and approval tool in December 2022 to support internal and external reporting, monitor investments on Zero-CO 2 sites and prioritize low-carbon investments;\n- \u00b7 Significant investments on both industrial processes and real estate portfolio planned to decarbonize operations by 2030 (Scopes 1 & 2) in line with company-wide energy climate targets (150 Zero-CO 2 sites by 2025, double energy productivity by 2030, 100% of electricity from renewables by 2030, shift 100% of corporate vehicle fleet to electric vehicles by 2030). Specifically on manufacturing and distribution centers, the Group has defined a priority list and planned to invest progressively on more electrification, sustainable and efficient systems (heat pumps, micro grids, solar panels, thermal insulation...) between 2023 and 2030 to achieve net-zero ready operations by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Implementation of a process to follow carbon footprint evolution at an early stage of new product development to reduce the footprint of future generations of products. The Group committed on a step up in R&D in coming years, from an existing circa 5% of Group revenues dedicated to strategic R&D investment with a strong focus on sustainability. More than 6 billion of euros (absolute amount) have been invested in R&D between 2017 and 2021.\n\nThe actual and potential financial links and effects of the Group's external commitments or the specific climate risks identified are detailed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 No material impact to disclose, notably on evaluation and useful life of tangible assets or in the impairment tests performed at Group Level. The Group is not a capital-intensive company, majority of its sites are leased and not owned, and the individual residual value of its tangible assets in the most at-risk locations is not material. Additionally, the multi hub position of the Group with agile capacity to relocate its production in case of climate disaster is a way to significantly mitigate risks and potential effects. Also, the Group has a low dependence on water in its production processes, and its sites are slightly located in flood zones or coastal zones. Finally, the Group is on an opportunistic position regarding world's desire for electrification & other company's net zero commitments. The Group is currently working to improve the quantification of investments and additional costs needed as well as opportunities to achieve long-term net zero carbon commitments, taking into consideration several scenarios. The Group however identify no impairment risk as of December 2022.\n- \u00b7 The Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI), which includes a climate target, is used as a criterion in the annual variable compensation of the Corporate Officer and that of the 64,000 employees benefiting from such compensation (20% weight). In the same way, the Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI) is used for the long-term incentive plan granted to 3,000+ employees including the Corporate Officer (25% weight).\n- \u00b7 To further tie climate-related issues to financial planning, Schneider successfully launched the first-ever sustainability-linked convertible bonds in 2020. This bond has been linked to three SSI targets by including the objective to save and avoid 800 million tonnes of CO 2 on the customers' end by 2025. In 2022, the Group has also linked its bank fundings with the SSI performance with the signature of a KPIs linked facility.\n\n## 1.2 - Basis of presentation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following:\n\n- \u00b7 derivative instruments and certain financial assets, measured at fair value;\n- \u00b7 assets held for sale - measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell;\n- \u00b7 defined benefit pension plans - plan assets measured at fair value.\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured using the amortized cost model. The book value of hedged assets and liabilities, under fair-value hedge, corresponds to their fair value, for the part corresponding to the hedged risk.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3 - Use of estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the Group management and subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that are reflected in the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet, the revenues and expenses in the statement of income and the commitments created during the reporting period. Actual results may differ.\n\nThese assumptions and estimates mainly concern:\n\n- \u00b7 the measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (Note 1.8 and 1.9) and the measurement of impairment losses (Note 1.11);\n- \u00b7 the measurement of the recoverable amount of non-current financial assets (Note 1.12 and 13);\n- \u00b7 the realizable value of inventories and work in progress (Note 1.13);\n- \u00b7 the recoverable amount of trade and other operating receivables (Note 1.14);\n- \u00b7 the valuation of share-based payments (Note 1.20);\n- \u00b7 the calculation of provisions or risk contingencies (Note 1.21);\n- \u00b7 the measurement of pension and other post-employment benefit obligations (Note 1.19 and Note 20);\n- \u00b7 the recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note 14);\n- \u00b7 the measurement of provisions covering uncertainties over income tax treatment (Note 1.21);\n- \u00b7 the estimation of the margin at completion for Construction contracts (Note 1.24);\n- \u00b7 the assumptions retained to evaluate the lease liability (IFRS 16): lease term and discount rate (Note 1.10).\n\n## 1.4 - Consolidation principles\n\nSubsidiaries, over which the Group exercises exclusive control, either directly or indirectly, are fully consolidated.\n\nThe Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.\n\nAccounting policies of subsidiaries, joint-venture and associates have been changed when necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\n\nGroup investments in entities controlled jointly with a limited number of partners, such as joint ventures and companies over which the Group has significant influence ('associates') are accounted for by the equity method. Significant influence is presumed to exist when more than 20% of voting rights are held by the Group.\n\nUnder equity method, the net assets and net result of a company are recognized pro rata to the interest held by the Group in the share capital.\n\nOn acquisition of an investment in a joint venture or an associate, goodwill relating to the joint venture or the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceed its interest in the entity, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity.\n\nCompanies acquired or sold during the year are included in or removed from the consolidated financial statements as of the date when effective control is acquired or relinquished.\n\nAny acquisition or disposal of an interest in a subsidiary that doesn't change the control is considered as a shareholder transaction and must be recognized directly in equity.\n\nA change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received is recognized in a separate reserve within equity attributable to owners.\n\nIntra-group transactions and balances are eliminated.\n\nThe list of consolidated main subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates can be found in Note 29.\n\nThe reporting date for all companies included in the scope of consolidation is December 31, with the exception of certain immaterial associates accounted for by the equity method. For the latter however, financial statements up to September 30 of the financial year have been used (maximum difference of three months in line with the standards).\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 5.5  Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 1.5 - Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, in accordance with IFRS 3 - Business Combinations. Acquisition costs are presented under 'Other operating income and expenses' in the statement of income.\n\nAll acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date, the fair value can be adjusted during a measurement period that can last for up to 12 months from the date of acquisition.\n\nThe differential between the cost of acquisition excluding acquisition expenses and the Group's share in the fair value of assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition is recognized in goodwill. When the cost of acquisition is lower than the fair value of the identified assets and liabilities acquired, the badwill is immediately recognized in the statement of income.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to Cash-Generating Units (CGUs) or groups of cash-generating units that benefit from business combination synergies.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired (see Note 1.11 below). Any impairment losses are recognized under 'Amortization and impairment of purchase accounting intangible'.\n\nThe full goodwill method is applied at Group level, therefore, non-controlling interests are valued at fair value.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 32, put options granted to minority shareholders are recorded as financial liabilities at the option's estimated strike price.\n\nThe share in the net assets of subsidiaries is reclassified from 'Non-controlling interests' to 'Purchase commitments over non-controlling interests' and the differential between the value of the non-controlling interests and the liability, corresponding to the commitment, is recorded in equity.\n\n## 1.6 - Translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries that use another functional currency are translated into euros as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 assets and liabilities are translated at the official closing rates;\n- \u00b7 income statement, backlog and cash flow items are translated at average annual exchange rates.\n\nThe functional currency of an entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it carries out its operations. In most cases, the functional currency corresponds to the local currency. However, a functional currency other than the local currency can be retained for certain entities, if it represents the currency of the main transactions carried out by the entity and that it ensures faithful representation of its economic environment.\n\nTranslation adjustments are recorded in consolidated equity under 'Translation reserve'.\n\nUpon exit from the scope of consolidation, the cumulative translation reserve of a company whose functional currency is not the euro are recycled in the income statement and are part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies to the Group's subsidiaries in countries with hyperinflationary economies (Argentina and Turkey). IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies requires the non-monetary assets and liabilities and income statements of countries with hyperinflationary economies to be restated to reflect the changes in the general purchasing power of their functional currency, thereby generating a profit or loss on the net monetary position which is recognized in net income within 'Other financial income and expenses'. In addition, the financial statements of the subsidiaries in these countries are translated at the closing exchange rate of the reporting period concerned, in accordance with IAS 21. In 2022, all the necessary conditions were met to consider Turkey as a hyperinflationary country within the meaning of IFRS. The Group has applied IAS 29 to Argentina in its financial statements from January 1, 2018 and to Turkey in its financial statements from January 1, 2022. The Group used the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for both Argentina and Turkey to remeasure its income statement items, cash flows and non-monetary assets and liabilities. This index was up 91% for Argentina and up 64% for Turkey compared with 2021.",

        "page_content": "## 1.7 - Foreign currency transactions\n\nForeign currency transactions are recorded using the exchange rate in effect at the transaction date or at the hedging rate. At the balance sheet date, monetary items in foreign currency (e.g. payables, receivables, etc.) are translated into the functional currency of the entity at the closing rate or at the hedging rate. Gains or losses on translation of foreign currency transactions are recorded under 'Net financial income/ (loss)'. Foreign currency hedging is described below, in Note 1.23.\n\nHowever, certain long-term receivables and loans to subsidiaries are considered to be part of a net investment in a foreign operation, as defined by IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates . As such, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations is recorded in equity and recognized in the statement of income when the investment is sold or when the long-term receivable or loan is reimbursed.\n\n## 1.8 - Intangible assets\n\n## Intangible assets acquired separately or as part of a business combination\n\nIntangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized in the balance sheet at historical cost. They are subsequently measured using the amortized cost model.\n\nIntangible assets (mainly trademarks, technologies and customer relationships) acquired as part of business combinations are recognized in the balance sheet at fair value at the combination date, appraised externally for the most significant assets and internally for the rest, and that represents its historical cost in consolidation. The valuations are performed using generally accepted methods, based on future inflows.\n\nIntangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life or, alternatively, over the period of legal protection. Amortized intangible assets are tested for impairment when there is any indication that their recoverable amount may be less than their carrying amount.\n\nAmortization expenses and impairment losses on intangible assets acquired in a business combination are presented on a separate statement of income line item, 'Amortization and impairment of purchase accounting intangible' assets.\n\n## Trademarks\n\nThe trademarks are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. The trademarks fair value is determined using the relief from royalty method.\n\nTrademarks acquired as part of a business combination are not amortized when they are considered to have an indefinite life.\n\nThe criteria used to determine whether or not such trademarks have indefinite lives and, as the case may be, their lifespan, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 brand awareness;\n- \u00b7 outlook for the brand in light of the Group's strategy for integrating the trademark into its existing portfolio.\n\nIndefinite-lived trademarks are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication they may be impaired. When necessary, an impairment loss is recorded.\n\n## Internally-generated intangible assets\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch costs are expensed in the statement of income when incurred. Development costs for new projects are capitalized if, and only if:\n\n- \u00b7 the project is clearly identified and the related costs are separately identified and reliably monitored;\n- \u00b7 the project's technical feasibility has been demonstrated and the Group has the intention and financial resources to complete the project and to use or sell the resulting products;\n- \u00b7 the Group has allocated the necessary technical, financial and other resources to complete the development;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the project will flow to the Group.\n\nDevelopment costs that do not meet these criteria are expensed in the financial year in which they are incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs previously recognized as an expense are not recognized as an asset in a subsequent period.\n\nBefore the commercial launch, capitalized development projects are tested for impairment at least annually. From the date of the commercial launch, capitalized development projects are amortized over the lifespan of the underlying technology, which generally ranges from three to ten years. The amortization expenses of such capitalized projects are included in the cost of the related products and classified into 'Cost of sales' when the products are sold.\n\nAs for development-related assets which are in the amortization period, they are tested for impairment in case an impairment risk has been identified.\n\n## Software implementation\n\nExternal and internal costs relating to the implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications are capitalized when they relate to the programming, coding and testing phase. They are amortized over the applications' useful lives.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The main useful lives are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 buildings: 20 to 40 years;\n- \u00b7 machinery and equipment: 3 to 10 years;\n- \u00b7 other: 3 to 12 years.\n\nThe useful life of property, plant and equipment used in operating activities, such as production lines, reflects the related products' estimated life cycles.\n\nUseful lives of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed periodically and may be adjusted prospectively if appropriate. The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value, when the residual value is material.\n\nDepreciation is expensed in the period and included in the production cost of inventory or the cost of internally-generated intangible assets. It is recognized in the statement of income under 'Cost of sales', 'Research and development costs' or 'Selling, general and administrative expenses', as the case may be.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication they may be impaired. Impairment losses are charged to the statement of income under 'Other operating income and expenses'.\n\nSince 2019, property, plant and equipment also includes right-of-use assets, in accordance with the recommended treatment in IFRS 16 Leases, and as described in the following note.\n\n## 1.10 - Leases\n\n## Scope of the Group's contracts\n\nThe lease contracts identified within all the Group entities fall under the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 real estate: office buildings, factories, and warehouses;\n- \u00b7 vehicles: cars and trucks;\n- \u00b7 forklifts used mainly in factories or storage warehouses.\n\nThe Group has retained the exemption for low-value assets (i.e. assets with a cost lower than USD 5,000). Thus, the defined scope does not include small office or IT equipment, mobile phones or other small equipment, which all correspond to low-value equipment.\n\nShort-term contracts (i.e. less than 12 months without purchase option) are also exempted under the standard. In this case, for example, for occasional vehicle or accommodation rentals.\n\n## Rental obligation\n\nAt the inception date of the lease, the Group recognizes the lease liabilities, measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease. The present value of payments is calculated mainly using the marginal borrowing rate of the contracting entity's country, at the contract starting date.\n\nRental payments include fixed payments (net of rental incentives receivable), variable payments based on an index or rate initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date and amounts that should be paid under residual value guarantees. Besides, the simplification allowing not to split services components has not been elected by the Group. Therefore, only the rents are taken into account in the lease payments.\n\nLease payments also include, when applicable, the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and the payment of penalties for the termination of a lease, if the term of the lease takes into account the fact that the Group has exercised the termination option.\n\nVariable lease payments that are not dependent on an index or rate are recognized as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nAfter the start date of the contract, the amount of rental obligations is increased to reflect the increase in interest and reduced for lease payments made.\n\nIn addition, the carrying amount of the lease liabilities is revalued in the event of a reassessment or modification in the lease (e.g. change in the term of the lease, change in lease payments, application of annual indexation, etc.).\n\nThe obligation is recorded under other current and other non-current liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group accounts for the assets related to the right-of-use on the lease starting date (i.e. the date on which the underlying asset is available).\n\nAssets are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for the revaluation of lease liabilities.\n\nThe cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities, initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made on or before the effective date, minus lease inducements received. They are recognized as tangible assets, in the Balance Sheet.\n\nUnless the Group is reasonably certain that it will become the owner of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recorded right-ofuse assets are depreciated using the linear method over the shortest period of time between estimated life of the underlying asset and the duration of the lease. The assets related to the right-of-use are subject to depreciation.\n\n## Determining the duration of contracts\n\nThe duration of the Group's contracts varies according to geographies.\n\nThe real estate contracts have variable durations depending on the countries and local regulations. Vehicles and forklifts are generally contracted between 3 and 6 years.\n\nIn certain geographies, the Group's real estate contracts offer unilateral options for termination of contracts (particularly in France with contracts 3-6-9).\n\nAccording to the recommendation of IFRIC, on a case-by-case analysis and based on Real Estate teams' expertise, experience strategy and projects, the Group is determining the most probable duration to perform our calculations.\n\nIn most of cases, the duration chosen is the enforceable duration of the real estate contracts, in particular on the most strategic buildings and factories.\n\n## 1.11 - Impairment of assets\n\nThe Group assesses the recoverable amount of its long-lived assets as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 for all property, plant and equipment subject to depreciation and intangible assets subject to amortization, the Group carries out a review at each balance sheet date to assess whether there is any indication that they may be impaired. Indications of impairment are identified based on external or internal information. If such an indication exists, the Group tests the asset for impairment by comparing its carrying amount to the higher of fair value minus costs to sell and value in use;\n- \u00b7 non-amortizable intangible assets and goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired.\n\nValue in use is determined by discounting future cash flows that will be generated by the tested assets. These future cash flows are based on Group management's economic assumptions and operating forecasts presented in business plans over a period generally not exceeding five years, and then extrapolated based on a perpetuity growth rate. The discount rate corresponds to the Group's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) at the measurement date. The WACC stood at 7.8% at December 31, 2022 (6.8% at December 31, 2021). This rate is based on (i) a long-term interest rate of 1.1%, corresponding to the average interest rate for 10-year OAT treasury bonds over the past year, (ii) the average premium applied to financing obtained by the Group in 2022, and is completed by, for Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) WACC only, (iii) the weighted country risk premium for the Group's businesses in the countries in question.\n\nThe perpetuity growth rate is 2.0%, unchanged from the previous financial year.\n\nImpairment tests are performed at the level of the CGU to which the asset belongs. A cash-generating unit is the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. The cash-generating units are Low Voltage, Medium Voltage, Industrial Automation and Secure Powe r. CGUs net assets were allocated to the CGUs at the lowest possible level on the basis of the CGU activities to which they belong; the assets belonging to several activities were allocated to each CGU ( Low Voltage, Medium Voltage and Industrial Automation mainly).\n\nThe WACC used to determine the value in use of each CGU was 8.6% for Low Voltage, 8.9% for Medium Voltage, 8.7% for Secure Power, and 8.7% for Industrial Automation .\n\nGoodwill is allocated when initially recognized. The CGU allocation is done on the same basis as used by Group management to monitor operations and assess synergies deriving from acquisitions.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is lower than its book value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the book value over the recoverable value. The recoverable value is defined as the highest value between the value in use and the selling price less costs to sell. When the tested CGU comprises goodwill, any impairment losses are firstly deducted from goodwill.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The fair value of investments listed in an active market may be determined reliably and corresponds to the listed price at balance sheet date (Level 1 from the fair value hierarchy as per IFRS 7).\n\nIFRS 9 standard allows two accounting treatments for equity instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 change in fair value is recognized through 'Other Comprehensive Income' in the comprehensive income statement, and in equity under 'Other reserves' in the balance sheet, with no subsequent recycling in the income statement even upon sale.\n- \u00b7 change in fair value, as well as gain or loss in case of sale, are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe election between those two methods is to be made from inception for each equity investment and is irrevocable. For significant investments not listed in an active market, the valuation is performed by external experts at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired.\n\nVenture capital (FCPR) / Mutual funds (SICAV) are recognized at fair value through income statement, in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\n## 1.13 - Inventories and work in progress\n\nInventories and work in progress are measured at the lower of their initial recognition cost (acquisition cost or production cost generally determined by the weighted average price method) or of their estimated net realizable value.\n\nNet realizable value corresponds to the estimated selling price net of remaining expenses to complete and/or sell the products. Inventory impairment losses are recognized in 'Cost of sales'.\n\nThe cost of work in progress, semi-finished and finished products, includes the cost of materials and direct labor, subcontracting costs, all production overheads based on normal manufacturing capacity and the portion of development costs that are directly related to the manufacturing process (corresponding to the amortization of capitalized projects in production and product and range of products maintenance costs).\n\n## 1.14 - Trade and other operating receivables\n\nTrade and other receivables are measured at their transaction price upon initial recognition and then at amortized cost less any impairment losses based on expected credit losses model.\n\nTrade and other operating receivables are depreciated according to the simplified IFRS 9 model. From inception, trade receivables are depreciated to the extent of the expected losses over their remaining maturity.\n\nThe credit risk of trade receivables is assessed on a collective basis country by country, as the geographical origin of receivables is considered representative of their risk profile. Countries are classified by risk profile using the assessment provided by an external agency. The provision for expected credit losses is evaluated using (i) the probabilities of default communicated by a credit agency, (ii) historical default rates, (iii) aging balance, (iv) as well as the Group's assessment of the credit risk considering actual guarantees and credit insurance.\n\nOnce it is known with certainty that a doubtful receivable will not be collected, the doubtful account and its related depreciation are written off through the income statement.\n\nAccounts receivable are discounted in cases where they are due in over one year and the discounting impact is significant.\n\n## Assignment of receivables\n\nWhen it can be demonstrated that the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and benefits related to assignment of receivables, particularly the credit risk, the items concerned are derecognized. Otherwise, the operation is considered as a financing operation, and the receivables remain in the balance sheet assets, with recognition of a corresponding financial liability.",

This classification occurs when the Group takes the decision to sell them and that the sale is considered highly probable.\n\nThe assets and liabilities held for sale are presented on different lines of the balance sheet. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated (amortized) as of the date they are classified as assets or disposal groups held for sale.\n\nWhen a sale involving the loss of control of the subsidiary is considered highly probable, all the assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are classified as being held for sale, independently of whether or not the Group retains a residual interest in the entity after its sale.\n\n## Discontinued operation\n\nA discontinued operation is a clearly identifiable component that the Group either has abandoned or that is classified as held for sale:\n\n- \u00b7 representing a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;\n- \u00b7 being part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or,\n- \u00b7 being a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nOnce the criteria are met, the profit and loss and the cash flow from discontinued operations are presented separately in the consolidated income statement and the consolidated cash flow statement for each period.\n\n## 1.16 - Taxes\n\n## Income tax expense\n\nThe tax rate is calculated on the basis of the fiscal regulations enacted or substantively enacted at the fiscal year closing date in each country where the Group's companies carry out their business. The Group's applicable tax rate corresponds to the average of the theoretical tax rates in force in each country, weighted according to profit obtained in each of these countries. The average effective tax rate is calculated as follows: (current and deferred income tax expense)/(net profit before tax less share of profit of associates, and net profit from discontinued operations).\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base (excluding if it arises from the initial recognition of goodwill), the tax loss carryforwards and the unused tax credits.\n\nDeferred taxes are based on tax rates and tax rules that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled. The effect of any change in the current and deferred taxes is recognized in P&L, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized on OCI or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in OCI or equity.\n\nWhen the Group decides not to distribute profits retained by the subsidiary within the foreseeable future, no deferred tax liability is recognized.\n\nFuture tax benefits arising from the utilization of tax loss carry forwards (including amounts available for carry forward without time limit) are recognized only when they can reasonably be expected to be realized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is tested for impairment at each balance sheet date and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax asset can be fully or partially offset.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are recorded in the balance sheet under non-current assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the same unit and which are expected to reverse in the same period are offset.\n\n## 1.17 - Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents presented in the balance sheet consist of cash, bank accounts, term deposits of three months or less and marketable securities traded on organized markets. Marketable securities are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash at maturity. They notably consist of bank deposits, commercial paper, mutual funds and equivalents. Considering their nature and maturities, these instruments represent insignificant risk of changes in value and are treated as cash equivalents.\n\n## 1.18 - Treasury shares\n\nSchneider Electric SE shares held by the parent company or by fully consolidated companies are measured at acquisition cost and deducted from equity.\n\nGains/(losses) on the sale of own shares are canceled from consolidated reserves, net of tax.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Benefits paid under these plans depend on factors such as seniority, compensation levels and payments into mandatory retirement programs.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nPayments made under defined contribution plans are recorded in the income statement, in the year of payment, and are in full settlement of the Group's liability. As the Group is not committed beyond these contributions, no provision related to these plans has been booked.\n\nIn most countries, the Group participates in mandatory general plans, which are accounted for as defined contribution plans.\n\n## IFRIC decision - Attribution of benefits to periods of service IAS 19 - Employee Benefits\n\nThe Group has taken into account the impact of the IFRIC agenda decision issued in April 2021 when measuring employee benefit obligations. This decision, without any material impact for the Group, clarifies the periods over which employee benefits should be attributed in allocating the IAS 19 expense.\n\n## Defined Benefit plans\n\nDefined Benefit plans are measured using the projected unit credit method.\n\nExpenses recognized in the statement of income are split between operating costs (for service costs rendered during the period) and net financial income/(loss) (for financial costs and expected return on plan assets).\n\nThe amount recognized in the balance sheet corresponds to the present value of the obligation, and net of plan assets. The valuation is performed by external actuaries.\n\nWhen this is an asset, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefit due in the form of plan refunds or reductions in future plan contributions.\n\nChanges resulting from periodic adjustments to actuarial assumptions regarding general financial and business conditions or demographics (i.e., changes in the discount rate, annual salary increases, return on plan assets, years of service, etc.) as well as experience adjustments are immediately recognized in the balance sheet as a separate component of equity in 'Other reserves' and in comprehensive income as 'Other comprehensive income/loss'.\n\nPast service cost is recorded in 'Other operating income and expenses'.\n\n## Other commitments\n\nProvisions are funded and expenses recognized to cover the cost of providing health-care benefits for certain Group retirees in Europe and the United States. The accounting policies applied to these plans are similar to those used to account for Defined Benefit pension plans.\n\nThe Group also funds provisions for all its subsidiaries to cover seniority-related benefits (primarily long service awards for its French subsidiaries). Actuarial gains and losses on these benefit obligations are fully recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 1.20 - Share-based payments\n\nThe Group grants performance shares to senior executives and certain employees.\n\nThese equity instruments are measured at fair value, on the date of grant, using the market price discounted from the expected dividend yield during the vesting period and adjusted for market conditions achievement.\n\nThe Group is using the Monte Carlo method to estimate the achievement of Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) vs. CAC 40 and a Panel of peer companies (market conditions).\n\nThe number of equity instruments granted can be adjusted during the vesting period to reflect the Group best estimate of non-market conditions achievement.\n\nMain non-market conditions are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS) improvement rate;\n- \u00b7 Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index ('SSERI');\n- \u00b7 Service conditions.\n\nAn employee benefits expense is recognized with a corresponding increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, in general three years.",

If the loss or liability is not likely and cannot be reliably estimated, but remains possible, the Group discloses it as a contingent liability. Provisions are calculated on a case-by-case or statistical basis and discounted when the impact from discounting is significant.\n\nProvisions are primarily set aside to cover:\n\n- \u00b7 economic risks: these provisions relate to probable tax risks, other than income tax related, arising on positions taken by the Group or its subsidiaries. Each position is assessed individually and not offset, and reflects the best estimate of the risk at the end of the reporting period. Where applicable, it includes any late-payment interest and fines. In accordance with IFRIC 23 - Uncertainty over income tax treatments, provisions covering uncertainties over income tax treatment are presented under 'Accrued taxes and payroll costs' since 1st of January 2019;\n- \u00b7 customer risks: provisions for customer risks mainly integrate the provisions for losses at completion for some of long-term contracts. Provisions for expected losses are fully recognized as soon as they are identified;\n\n\u00b7\n\nproduct risks:\n\nthese provisions comprise\n\n- - statistical provisions for warranties: the Group funds provisions on a statistical basis for the residual cost of Schneider Electric product warranties not covered by insurance. The provisions are estimated with consideration of historical claim statistics and the warranty period;\n- - provisions to cover disputes concerning defective products and recalls of clearly identified products.\n- \u00b7 environmental risks: these provisions are primarily funded to cover clean-up costs. The estimation of the expected future outflows is based on reports from independent experts;\n- \u00b7 restructuring costs, when the Group has prepared a detailed plan for the restructuring and has either announced or started to implement the plan before the end of the year. The estimation of the liability includes only direct expenditure arising from the restructuring.\n\n## 1.22 - Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities primarily comprise bonds, commercial paper and short and long-term bank borrowings. These liabilities are initially recorded at fair value, from which any direct transaction costs are deducted. Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost based on their effective interest rate.\n\n## 1.23 - Financial instruments and derivatives\n\nRisk hedging management is centralized. The Group's policy is to use derivative financial instruments exclusively to manage and hedge changes in exchange rates, interest rates or prices of certain raw materials. The Group uses instruments such as foreign exchange forwards, foreign exchange options, cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and commodities future, swaps or options, depending on the nature of the exposure to be hedged.\n\nAll derivatives are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of income, except when they are qualified in a hedging relationship.\n\nCash flows from financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated statement of cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions.\n\n## Foreign currency hedges\n\nThe Group periodically enters into foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the currency risk associated with foreign currency transactions.\n\nWhenever possible, monetary items (except specific financing items) denominated in foreign currency carried in the balance sheet of Group companies are hedged by rebalancing assets and liabilities per currency through foreign exchange spots realized with Corporate Treasury (natural hedge). The foreign exchange risk is thus aggregated at Group level and hedged with foreign exchange derivatives. When foreign exchange risk management cannot be centralized, the Group contracts foreign exchange forwards to hedge operating receivables and payables carried in the balance sheet of Group companies. In both cases, the Group does not apply hedge accounting because gains and losses generated on these foreign exchange derivatives naturally offset within 'Net financial income/(loss)' with gains or losses resulting from the translation at end-of-year rates of payables and receivables denominated in foreign currency.\n\nThe Group also hedges future cash flows, including recurring future transactions and planned acquisitions or disposals of investments. In accordance with IFRS 9, these are treated as cash flow hedges. These hedging instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheet. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is accumulated in equity, under 'Other reserves', and then recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects profit or loss.\n\nThe Group also hedges foreign exchange risk financing receivables or payables (including current accounts and loans with subsidiaries) using foreign exchange derivatives than can be documented either in Cash Flow Hedge or Fair Value Hedge depending on the nature of the derivative.\n\nThe Group may also designate foreign exchange derivatives or borrowings as hedging instruments of its investments in foreign operations (net investment hedge). Changes of value of those hedging instruments are accumulated in equity and recognized in the statement of income symmetrically to the hedged items.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 5.5  Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe Group qualifies foreign exchange derivative based on the spot rate. The Group adopted the cost of hedging option offered by IFRS 9 to limit volatility in the statement of income related to forward points:\n\n- \u00b7 For foreign exchange derivatives hedging an item on the balance sheet : forward points are amortized in statement of income on a straight-line basis. Forward points related to foreign exchange derivatives hedging financing transactions are included in 'Finance costs, net';\n- \u00b7 For foreign exchange derivatives hedging future transactions not yet recorded on the balance sheet: Forward points are recorded in the statement of income when the hedged transaction impacts the statement of income.\n\n## Interest rate hedges\n\nInterest rate swaps allow the Group to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The derivative instruments used are financially adjusted to the schedules, rates and currencies of the borrowings they cover. They involve the exchange of fixed and floating-rate interest payments. The differential to be paid (or received) is accrued as an adjustment to interest income or expense over the life of the agreement. The Group applies hedge accounting as described in IFRS 9 for interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on re-measurement of interest rate swaps at fair value on the balance sheet are recognized in equity (for Cash Flow Hedges) or in profit or loss (for Fair Value Hedges).\n\nBorrowings hedged by an interest rate derivative in a fair value hedge are reevaluated at fair value for the portion of risk being hedged, with offsetting entry in the statement of income.\n\nCross-currency swaps may be presented as foreign exchange hedges or as interest rate hedges depending on the characteristics of the derivative.\n\n## Commodity hedges\n\nThe Group also purchases commodity derivatives including forward purchase contracts, swaps and options to hedge price risks on all or part of its forecast future purchases. According to IFRS 9, these qualify as cash flow hedges. These instruments are recognized in the balance sheet at fair value at the period-end (mark to market). The effective portion of the hedge is recognized separately in equity (under 'Other reserves') and then recognized in income (gross margin) when the underlying hedge affects consolidated income. The effect of this hedging is then incorporated in the cost price of the products sold.\n\n## 1.24 - Revenue recognition\n\nThe Group's revenues primarily include transactional sales and revenues from services, system contracts (projects) and software.\n\nSome contracts may include the supply to the customer of distinct goods and services (for instance contracts combining build followed by operation and maintenance). In such situations, the contract is analyzed and segmented into several components ('performance obligations'), each component being accounted for separately, with its own revenue recognition method and margin rate. The selling price is allocated to each performance obligation in proportion to the specific selling price of the underlying goods and services. This allocation should reflect the share of the price to which Schneider Electric expects to be entitled in exchange for the supply of these goods or services.\n\nRevenue associated with each performance obligation identified within a contract is recognized when the obligation is satisfied, i.e. when the control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer.\n\nThe following revenue recognition methods can be applied:\n\n## Recognition of revenue at a point of time\n\nRevenue from sales is recognized at a point of time, when the control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. This method is applicable for all transactional sales and for specific services such as spare parts deliveries, or on-demand services.\n\n## Recognition of revenue over time\n\nTo demonstrate that the transfer of goods is progressive and recognize revenue over time, the following cumulative criteria are required:\n\n- \u00b7 the goods sold have no alternative use, and\n- \u00b7 enforceable right to payment (corresponding to costs incurred, plus a reasonable profit margin) for the work performed to date exists, in the event of early termination for convenience by the customer.\n\nWhen these criteria are fulfilled, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs of the performance obligation. The cost incurred includes direct and indirect costs relating to the contracts.\n\nExpected losses on contracts are fully recognized as soon as they are identified.\n\nPenalties for late delivery or for the improper execution of a contract are recognized as a deduction from revenue.\n\nThis method is applicable for systems contracts (projects) as the constructed assets are highly customized, and thus the Group would incur significant economic losses to redirect the built solutions to other customers.",

When costs incurred are stable over the contract's period, revenue is linearized over the contract's length.\n\nProvisions for the discounts offered to distributors are accrued when the products are sold to the distributor and recognized as a deduction from revenue. Certain Group' subsidiaries also offer cash discounts to distributors. These discounts and rebates are deducted from sales.\n\nConsolidated revenue is presented net of these discounts and rebates.\n\n## Recognition of software revenue\n\nThe group generates software-related revenue mainly through subscriptions, licenses, maintenance and services. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised software or service to the customers.\n\n- \u00b7 Subscriptions contracts are either:\n- - SaaS (Software as a Service: remote access to a cloud software solution, hosting and services) contracts, which are recognized linearly over the contract term\n- - On premise subscriptions: containing two separate performance obligations pertaining to on premise software license and maintenance, the revenue from such arrangements is recognized in line with revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations.\n- \u00b7 Software license revenue represents fees earned from granting customers licenses to use the Group's software.

Particularly, APC brand was tested using the royalty relief method. The future cash flows used are based on Group management's economic assumptions and operating forecasts presented in Secure Power's business plan, and then extrapolated based on a perpetuity growth rate of 2%.\n\nImpairment tests carried out on indefinite-lived brands in 2022 did not show any impairment risk.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis on the test hypothesis shows that no material impairment losses would be recognized in the following scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 a 0.5 point increase of the discount rate;\n- \u00b7 a 1.0 point decrease in the growth rate;\n- \u00b7 a 0.5 point decrease in the royalty rate.\n\nGiven the volatility environment of interest rates and its impact on discount rates, the Group increased the sensitivity analysis up to 1.0 point increase of the discount rate. It shows that no material impairment losses would be recognized for each brand in such a case.",

In countries that meet legal and fiscal requirements, the classic plan has been proposed to employees.\n\nUnder the classic plan, employees may purchase Schneider Electric shares at a 15% discount to the price quoted for the shares on the stock market. Employees must then hold their shares for five years, except in certain cases provided for by law. The share-based payment expense recorded in accordance with IFRS 2 is measured by reference to the fair value of the discount on the locked-up shares.\n\nOn May 10, 2022 the Group gave its employees the opportunity to purchase shares at a price of EUR 117.51 per share, as part of its commitment to employee share ownership. This represented a 15% discount to the reference price of EUR 138.26 calculated as the average opening price quoted for the share during the 20 days preceding the Chief Executive Officer's decision to launch the employee share issue.\n\nAltogether, 1.8 million shares were subscribed, increasing the capital by EUR 209 million as of July 6, 2022. The value of the lock-up cost is higher than the discount cost. Therefore, the Group did not recognize any cost related to the transaction.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The recognition of this liability triggered an immediate reduction in non-controlling interests for EUR 2,865 million (Note 2).\n\n## Note 20: Pensions and other post-employment benefit obligations\n\nThe Group has set up various post-employment benefit plans for employees covering pensions, termination benefits, healthcare, life insurance and other benefits, as well as long-term benefit plans for active employees.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans\n\nThe Group's main Defined Benefit pension plans are located in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). They respectively represent 57% (2021: 62%) and 24% (2021: 22%) of the Group's total Defined Benefit Obligations (DBO) on pensions. The majority of benefit obligations under these plans, which represent 92% of the Group's total commitment at December 31, 2022, are partially or fully funded through payments to external funds. These funds are never invested in Group assets.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nThe Group companies operate several Defined Benefit pension plans in the UK. The main one is related to the Invensys Pension Scheme. Pensions payable to employees depend on average final salary and length of service within the Group. These plans are registered schemes under UK tax law and managed by independent Boards of Trustees. They are closed to new entrants, and for most of them, the vested rights were frozen as they have been replaced by Defined Contributions plans.\n\nThese plans are funded by employer contributions, which are negotiated every three years based on plan valuations carried out by independent actuaries, so that the long-term financing services are ensured.\n\nIn relation to risk management and asset allocation, the Board of Trustees' aims of each plan are to ensure that it can meet its obligations to the plan's beneficiaries both in the short and long-term. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the plan's long-term investment strategy and defines and manages long-term investment strategies to reduce risks, including interest rate risks and longevity risks. A certain proportion of assets hedges the liability valuation change resulting from the interest rates evolution. Those assets are primarily invested in fixed income investments, particularly intermediate and longer-term instruments.\n\nFollowing the agreement reached with the Trustee of the Invensys Pension Scheme on February 2014, Schneider Electric SE guaranteed all obligations of the Invensys subsidiaries which participate in the Scheme, up to a maximum amount of GBP 1.75 billion. At December 31, 2022, plan assets exceed the value of obligations subject to this guarantee and thus this guarantee cannot be called.\n\nSchneider UK pension plans contain provisions of pension called Guaranteed Minimum Pension ('GMP'). GMPs were accrued for individuals who subscribed to the State Second Pension prior to April 6, 1997. Historically, there was an inequality in the benefits between male and female members concerning GMP.\n\nA High Court case concluded on October 26, 2018, confirmed that all UK pension plans must equalize 'GMPs' between men and women. In the light of these events and new information, the Group updated the related assumptions, leading to a net experience adjustment in 'Other Comprehensive Income' of EUR 56 million. Following a further High Court ruling in November 2020, an additional net experience adjustment of EUR 7 million was recognized in other comprehensive income in 2020.",

        "page_content": "## United States\n\nThe United States' subsidiaries operate several Defined Benefit pension plans. These plans are closed to new entrants, frozen to future accruals and have been replaced by Defined Contributions plans. Pensions payable to employees depend on the average final salary and the length of service within the Group.\n\nEach year, the Group companies contribute a certain amount to the Defined Benefit pension plans. This amount is determined actuarially and is comprised of service costs, administrative expenses and payments toward any existing deficits. Since the plans are closed and frozen, there is generally no service cost component.\n\nThe companies delegate various responsibilities to Pension Committees. These committees define and manage long-term investment strategies to reduce risks, including interest rate risks and longevity risks. A certain proportion of assets hedges the liability valuation change, resulting from the interest rates evolution. Those assets are primarily invested in fixed income investments, particularly intermediate and longer-term instruments.\n\nIn October 2022, a contract was purchased from an insurer for USD 518 million covering all current retirees and a portion of non-retirees of Invensys pension plan. The buy-in contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust and is accounted for at fair value as an investment of the trust. This transaction resulted in an additional net experience adjustment of USD 24 million recognized in other comprehensive income in 2022.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nActuarial valuations are generally performed each year.

If the Group is not able to hedge these risks, fluctuations in exchange rates between the functional currency and other currencies can have a significant impact on its results and distort year-on-year performance comparisons. As a result, the Group uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to exchange rates mainly through FX forwards and natural hedges. Furthermore, some long-term loans and borrowings granted to the affiliates are considered as net investment in foreign operations according to IAS 21.\n\nSchneider Electric's currency hedging policy is to protect its subsidiaries against risks on transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. Hedging approaches are detailed in Note 1.23.\n\nThe breakdown of the nominal of foreign change derivatives related to operating and financing activities is as follows:\n\n|                        | Dec. 31, 2022   | Dec. 31, 2022   | Dec. 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| (in millions of euros) | Sales           | Purchases       | Net             |\n| US Dollar              | 2,261           | (970)           | 1,291           |\n| Chinese Yuan           | 97              | (132)           | (35)            |\n| Danish Crown           | 1               | (30)            | (29)            |\n| Singapore Dollar       | 330             | (340)           | (10)            |\n| Swedish Crown          | 5               | (15)            | (10)            |\n| Japanese Yen           | 2               | (3)             | (1)             |\n| Swiss Franc            | 55              | (197)           | (142)           |\n| UAE Dirham             | 13              | (36)            | (23)            |\n| Brazilian real         | 104             | (59)            | 45              |\n| Canadian Dollar        | 27              | (9)             | 18              |\n| Australian Dollar      | 95              | (73)            | 22              |\n| Saudi Riyal            | -               | (11)            | (11)            |\n| Norwegian Krone        | 4               | (8)             | (4)             |\n| British Pound          | 638             | (5,555)         | (4,917)         |\n| South African Rand     | 2               | -               | 2               |\n| Hong Kong Dollar       | 41              | (46)            | (5)             |\n| Others                 | 222             | (220)           | 2               |\n| TOTAL                  | 3,897           | (7,704)         | (3,807)         |",

If the Group is not able to hedge, compensate for or pass on to customers any such increased costs, this could have an adverse impact on its results. The Group has, however, implemented certain procedures to limit exposure to rising non-ferrous and precious raw material prices.

Banking counterparties are chosen according to the customary criteria, including the credit rating issued by an independent rating agency.\n\nGroup policy consists of diversifying counterparty risks and periodic controls are performed to check compliance with the related rules. In addition, the Group takes out substantial credit insurance and uses other types of guarantees to limit the risk of losses on trade accounts receivable.\n\n## 23.8 - Liquidity risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group had confirmed credit lines of EUR 2.950 million, all unused with EUR 2.850 million maturing after December 2023. Among them, EUR 2.700 million are sustainable-linked credit line with margin indexed on the annual performance of the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI).\n\nWith EUR 2.9 billion available committed facility and EUR 4.0 billion cash & cash equivalent, the liquidity of the Group amounts to EUR 6.9 billion end of the year. In the next 12 months, the total short term and bond maturity amounts to EUR 3.1 billion.\n\nIn addition, to secure the funding of the minority interest of Aveva and to meet certain funds requirement under UK regulation, the Group held undrawn bridge facility and term loan for a total amount of approximately EUR 3.9 billion.\n\nLoan Agreement and committed credit lines do not include any financial covenants or credit rating triggers in case of rating downgrade.\n\n## 23.9 - Financial risk management\n\nForeign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations. These exposures arise from sales in currencies other than the Group's presentational currency of Euro.\n\nThe main exposure of the Group in terms of currency exchange risk is related to the US dollar, Chinese Yuan and currencies linked to the US dollar. In 2022, revenue in foreign currencies amounted to EUR 27.3 billion (EUR 23.0 billion in 2021), including around EUR 9.9 billion in US dollars and EUR 4.8 billion in Chinese yuan (respectively EUR 7.4 and EUR 4.4 billion in 2021).\n\nThe Group manages its exposure to currency risk to reduce the sensitivity of earnings to changes in exchange rates. The financial instruments used to hedge the Group's exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates are described above.\n\nThe table below shows the impact of a 10% change in the US dollar and the Chinese Yuan against the Euro on Revenue and Adjusted EBITA. It includes the impact from the translation of financial statements into the Group's presentation currency and assumes no scope impact.\n\n|                        | Dec. 31, 2022                         | Dec. 31, 2022   | Dec. 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| (in millions of euros) | Increase/ (decrease) in  average rate | Revenue         | Adj.

The risk linked to the commitment is assessed and a provision for contingencies is recorded when the risk is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Market counter guarantees also include the guaranteed obligations towards pension schemes.\n- ** Some loans are secured by property, plant and equipment and securities lodged as collateral.\n\n## 26.2 - Contingent liabilities\n\nAs previously disclosed, investigations were conducted in September 2018 by the French judicial authority and French Competition Authority ('Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence') at Schneider Electric's head office and other premises concerning the sale of electrical products through commercial distribution activities in France.\n\nOn July 4, 2022, Schneider Electric received a statement of objections (notification de griefs) from the French Competition Authority alleging that the pricing autonomy of some distributors in the French market would have been limited, in breach of competition rules.\n\nSchneider Electric strongly disagrees with the allegations of the statement of objections and has submitted its response to the French Competition Authority on October 4, 2022.\n\nConcurrently on October 7, 2022 Schneider Electric was indicted by an investigating judge who required Schneider Electric to provide a bank guarantee of \u20ac20 million and a cash guarantee of \u20ac80 million which was paid mid-January 2023. As at December 31, 2022, this cash guarantee was recognized as 'Other current liabilities' against 'Non-current financial assets'. Those actions do not mean that Schneider Electric will ultimately be found guilty of any wrongdoing. Schneider Electric firmly disagrees with all the allegations made by the French investigating judge and the French Competition Authority and intends to vigorously and fully defend itself. Should the French Competition Authority deny Schneider Electric's arguments and conclude, after examining the substance of the matter, that anti-competitive practices have been involved, it has broad discretion to determine on a case-by-case basis the financial fines it may impose in accordance with the principles of proportionality and individuality. In light of the difficulty in assessing the extent to which the French Competition Authority takes into account the arguments of Schneider Electric in its defense as well as the multiple factors contributing to the determination of a fine, it is not possible to reliably estimate the amount of any potential fine that might be incurred in the event of an adverse decision, even though it might have a significant impact on the Group. In this context, no provision has been made at this stage of the investigation.\n\nSchneider Electric has other contingent liabilities relating to legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of its business. Known or ongoing claims and litigation involving the Group or its subsidiaries were reviewed at the date on which the consolidated financial statements were approved for issue. Based on the advice of legal counsel, all provisions deemed necessary have been made to cover the related risks.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company's management.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgment throughout the audit.\n\n## They also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 assess the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Organic growth was driven by a continuation of strong and dynamic market demand in the majority of end-markets and segments served by the Group, supported by accelerating energy transition trends and recovery in late-cycle segments. Consumer-linked segments saw softness in some geographies in the second half of the year. The Group saw good volume expansion year-on-year, with price actions also contributing strongly to growth. Supply chain pressures were evident throughout the year, with progressive easing through the second half, though some tightness related to the supply of electronic components remains. Growth was impacted by the Group's withdrawal from Russia and the effects of COVID-19 infections and related lockdowns in China. Forex impact were +5.7% primarily due to the strengthening of the USD against the EUR, while there was a net negative impact of (0.2)% from acquisitions and disposals.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

North America grew +18% organic with strong demand across all end-markets, including residential buildings. Western Europe was up +13% organic with double-digit growth in each of the five main economies of the region with continued good traction in Data Center & non-residential Buildings, though residential markets were impacted by pressures on consumer-spending. Asia-Pacific grew +9% organic impacted by the resurgence of COVID-19 and softer residential markets in China, but with strong growth across the rest of the region, notably in India. Rest of the World was up +10% organic with strong project execution in resource driven economies and despite headwinds from Russia prior to the Group's exit.\n\nIndustrial Automation generated revenues of EUR 7,734 million, equivalent to 23% of the Group's revenues and was up +9.5% organically. Growth was led by Discrete automation markets while sales into Process & Hybrid markets grew strongly, benefiting from recovery in resource driven economies. North America grew +10% organic led by performance in Discrete automation markets, while strong growth in Process & Hybrid markets was supported by execution on a project in Mexico. Western Europe was up +14% organic, with strong growth in Discrete automation markets, particularly in Italy, Spain and France. Asia-Pacific was up +7% organic, impacted by the resurgence of COVID-19 in China, but with strong growth across the rest of the region, including in India and Japan. Rest of the World was up +8% organic despite headwinds from Russia prior to the Group's exit.\n\n## Gross profit\n\nGross profit was up +10.8% organic with Gross margin down -50bps organic, reaching 40.6% in 2022. The decline in margin was mainly driven by lower productivity due to inflationary pressures in the supply chain.\n\n## Support Function costs: Research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses, net of capitalized development costs and excluding research and development costs booked in costs of sales, increased by 21.6% from EUR 855 million for 2021 to EUR 1,040 million for 2022. As a percentage of revenues, the net cost of research and development remain stable, at 3.0%.\n\nTotal research and development expense, including capitalized development costs and development costs reported as cost of sales (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) increased by 19.9% from EUR 1,539 million for 2021 to EUR 1,845 million for 2022. As a percentage of revenues, total research and development expenses increased slightly to 5.4% for 2022 (5.3% for 2021).\n\nIn 2022, the net effect of capitalized development costs and amortization of capitalized development costs amounts to EUR 115 million on operating income (EUR 68 million in 2021).\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by 13.6% to EUR 6,819 million for 2022 (EUR 6,001 million for 2021). As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to 20.0% for 2022 (20.8% for 2021).\n\nCombined, total support function costs, that is, research and development expenses together with selling, general and administrative costs, totaled EUR 7,859 million for 2022 compared to EUR 6,856 million for 2021, an increase of 14.6%. Support functions costs to sales ratio decreases from 23.7% in 2021, to 23.0% in 2022.\n\n## Other operating income and expenses\n\nFor 2022, other operating income and expenses amounted to a net expense of EUR 433 million. The gains and losses on disposal of business for EUR (108) million are mainly due to the termination of activities and disposal of the main subsidiaries in Russia and Belarus, partially compensated by the gains from the disposal of Eurotherm, Asco Load Banks as well as Eberle activities. The impairment of assets mainly relates to the impairment of assets held for Sale in relation with the disposal of Transformers plants in Poland and Turkey. The costs of acquisition and integration slightly increase versus 2021, reaching EUR 180 million, mainly due to the EUR 28 million share-based payments, corresponding to the acceleration of multiple AVEVA plans, in line with the terms of the transaction.\n\n## Restructuring costs\n\nFor 2022, restructuring costs remain stable at EUR 227 million, and are linked to the Group's initiatives to decrease support function costs.",

EBITA comprises operating profit before amortization and impairment of purchase accounting intangible assets and before goodwill impairment. Adjusted EBITA is adjusted as EBITA before restructuring costs and before other operating income and expenses, which includes acquisition, integration and separation costs.\n\nAdjusted EBITA amounted to EUR 6,017 million for 2022, compared to EUR 4,987 million for 2021, an organic increase of 14.4%.

Investment in the Group's strategic priorities continued, while the Corporate cost element continued to be an area of focus and remained under tight control, remaining at around 0.7% of Group revenues in 2022.\n\n## Amortization and impairment of purchase accounting intangibles\n\nThe amortization and impairment of purchase accounting intangibles amounted to EUR 424 million compared with EUR 410 million last year. The increase is mostly driven by additional amortization linked with acquisitions completed in the second semester 2021 (ETAP) and the second semester 2022 (EV Connect and Autogrid).\n\n## Operating income (EBIT)\n\nOperating income or EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes), increased from EUR 4,331 million for 2021 to 4,933 million for 2022, an increase of 13.9%, as EBITA.\n\n## Net financial income/loss\n\nNet financial loss amounted to EUR 215 million for 2022, compared to EUR 176 million for 2021, mainly due to the slight increase in cost of debt (from EUR 95 million in 2021 to EUR 106 million in 2022), following the increase in interest rates observed in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as an increased negative impact from foreign exchange fluctuations (from EUR 8 million in 2021 to EUR 27 million in 2022).\n\n## Income tax expense\n\nThe effective tax rate was 25.7% for 2022, and 23.2% for 2021. Restating the EUR 195 million Russia and Belarus deconsolidation impact from the profit before tax (no tax impact attached), the effective tax rate would be of 24.6%.

It represented 15.8% of revenues for 2022 (15.5% of revenues from 2021).\n\nChange in working capital requirement consumed EUR 1,039 million in cash in 2022, compared to a consumption of EUR 853 million in 2021.\n\nIn all, net cash from operating activities increased from EUR 3,616 million in 2021 to EUR 4,354 million in 2022.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nNet capital expenditure, which includes capitalized development projects, increased, at EUR 1,024 million for 2022, compared to EUR 817 million for 2021, and representing 3.0% of sales in 2022 compared to 2.8% in 2021.\n\nFree cash-flow (cash from operating activities net of net capital expenditure) amounted to EUR 3,330 million in 2022 versus EUR 2,799 million in 2021.\n\nCash conversion rate (free cash-flow over net income attributable to the equity holders of the parent company on continuing operations) was 96% in 2022 versus 87% in 2021.\n\nThe acquisitions net of disposals represented a cash out of EUR 297 million (net of acquired cash) for 2022, compared with EUR 4,231 million for 2021. Those amounts correspond mainly to the acquisitions and disposals described in Notes 2.1 and 2.2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (Chapter 5).\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet cash outflow from financing activities amounted to EUR 1,453 million during the year 2022, compared to cash outflow of EUR 3,093 million during the year 2021. The variance is mainly due to the bond issuances in 2022 for EUR 1.1 billion (no bonds issuance in 2021), as well as a year-on-year net increase in commercial papers and short-term debt of EUR 0.5 billion.\n\nThe dividend paid by Schneider Electric was EUR 1,618 million in 2022, compared with EUR 1,447 million in 2021.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

        "page_content": "## 6.3  Notes to the financial statements\n\n(All amounts are in thousands of euros unless otherwise indicated)\n\n## 6.3.1  Significant events of the financial year\n\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric announced by press release dated November 29, 2021, its planned merger by absorption of the company IGE+XAO (subsidiary of the group since February 2018). This merger, dated May 5, 2022, took place in several stages and impacted the accounts of Schneider Electric SE:\n- 1)  Schneider Electric Industries S.A.S. (SEISAS) sold its shares in IGE+XAO to Schneider Electric S.E. (SESE) before the implementation of the Merger Plan, for 293 million euros.\n- 2)  At the same time, the company IGE+XAO merged within the entity Schneider Electric S.E (retroactive effect from January 1, 2022)\n- 3)  SESE subsequently sold its SEEMSF shares to SEI SAS, for 311 million euros.\n- \u00b7 Investigations were conducted in September 2018 by the French judicial authority and French Competition Authority (Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence) at Schneider Electric's head office and other premises concerning the sale of electrical products through commercial distribution activities in France. On July 4, 2022, Schneider Electric received a statement of objections (notification de griefs) from the French Competition Authority alleging that the pricing autonomy of some distributors in the French market would have been limited, in breach of competition rules. Schneider Electric strongly disagrees with the allegations of the statement of objections and has submitted its response to the French Competition Authority on October 4, 2022. Concurrently on October 7, 2022 Schneider Electric was indicted by an investigating judge who required Schneider Electric to provide a bank guarantee of 20 million euros and a cash guarantee of 80 million euros which was paid mid-January 2023. As at December 31, 2022, this cash guarantee was recognized as 'Other liabilities' against 'Financial assets'. These actions do not mean that Schneider Electric will ultimately be found guilty of any wrongdoing. Schneider Electric firmly disagrees with all the allegations made by the French investigating judge and the French Competition Authority and intends to defend itself fully and vigorously. Should the French Competition Authority deny Schneider Electric's arguments and conclude, after examining the substance of the matter, that anti-competitive practices have been involved, it has broad discretion to determine on a case-by-case basis the financial fines it may impose in accordance with the principles of proportionality and individuality. In light of the difficulty in assessing the extent to which the French Competition Authority takes into account the arguments of Schneider Electric in its defense as well as the multiple factors contributing to the determination of a fine, it is not possible to reliably estimate the amount of any potential fine that might be incurred in the event of an adverse decision, even though it might have a significant impact on the Group. In this context, no provision has been made at this stage of the investigation.\n- \u00b7 In September 2022, as part of the operation to acquire minority interests in AVEVA by its indirect subsidiary Ascot Acquisition Holdings Limited and to comply with UK regulations on public offers, Schneider Electric SE implemented placed a 4.1 billion british pounds bridging line of credit for 12 months with the possibility of requesting two successive 6-month extensions. This line of credit was then partially refinanced by a 3-year loan line of 1.5 billion British Pounds and cash deposited in a segregated account. At closing, the amount of the bridging line of credit was 2.4 billion British Pounds and was supplemented by the loan line for 1.5 billion British Pounds and a cash deposit of 423 million Euros invested in Money market SICAVs meeting the criteria for registration as cash.\n- \u00b7 On November 9, 2022, SESE carried out a bond issue in two tranches of respectively 500 million euros at a rate of 3.25% and maturing in November 2027 and 600 million euros at a rate of 3.5% and maturing in November 2032. These two transactions implemented as part of the financing of the acquisition of AVEVA's minority interests included a reimbursement clause allowing the company to reimburse them in the event that the acquisition did not take place.\n- \u00b7 Since January 1, 2022, Schneider Electric SE has held full ownership of the Schneider Electric brand and has managed it. As such, it collects the royalties invoiced to all the companies in the Group and bears the related costs. In May 2022, the 2021 dividend was paid in the amount of 1,619 million euros. The company bought back 1.6 million of its own shares for 219 million euros.\n- \u00b7 As of December 31, 2022, the company decided to fund some of its current action plans on existing shares and to re-invoice the related expense to the various Group companies. As a result of these movements, the provision for charges was adjusted to 312 million euros.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

The analysis and investigations carried out by the company and the Schneider Electric Group have allowed to ensure the current split of non-current asset met this principle: components with distinct useful life are indeed accounted for separately, according their own amortization plan.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible rights are amortized over a maximum of 5 years.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nAmortizable items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight- line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 10 years. Lands are not depreciated.\n\n## Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates\n\nShares in subsidiaries and affiliates are recorded at acquisition cost, plus directly attributable costs (including acquisition costs related to these transactions).\n\nProvisions for depreciation may be made if the book value is higher than the value in use estimated at the end of the financial year. This estimate is determined mainly by reference to the net book value of the investment.\n\nEquity investments are valued at their value in use each year.\n\n## Own shares\n\nTreasury stocks are assessed by category (shares in subsidiaries and affiliates, marketable securities), according to the FIFO method 'first-in, first-out'.\n\nThe accounting classification of treasury stocks depends on the purpose for which they are held:\n\n- \u00b7 own shares are classified in marketable securities if they are the object of an explicit or implicit allocation to cover performance share distribution plans or if they are bought to regulate the share price of the Group.\n- \u00b7 own shares are classified in long-term investments if they are not the object of an explicit allocation to cover a performance share or if they are bought with the aim of their use within the context of a liquidity contract by an investment services provider, or of their later cancellation within the framework of a capital reduction.\n\nThe accounting of an impairment of own shares depends on the purpose for which they are held:\n\n- \u00b7 when own shares are allocated to cover of performance share distribution plans, there is no reason to record a provision for impairment.\n- \u00b7 in other cases, it is necessary to book an impairment if the average stock market price of the month before the closing is lower than the weighted average cost.\n\nA provision for risks and charges is recognized when the treasury shares are subject to an explicit or implicit allocation to cover performance share plans.\n\n## Receivables and debts\n\nReceivables and debts are valued at their face value (historical cost). Receivables are, where applicable, depreciated by means of a provision to take account of the risk of non-recovery.\n\nAt the end of the period, receivables and debts in foreign currencies are revalued at the rate at the end of the period.",

        "page_content": "The foreign exchange risk borne by the company is managed centrally at the level of Boissi\u00e8re Finance SNC.\n\nThe Schneider Electric group organizes a foreign exchange risk hedging policy ('Fair Value Natural Hedge', hereinafter 'FVNH') aimed at comprehensively managing the monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies recorded on the balance sheets of the subsidiaries.\n\nThe monetary assets and liabilities included in the company's FVNH position (customer invoices, supplier invoices, banks, current accounts) are consolidated and balanced on a daily basis through spot foreign exchange transactions carried out in current accounts with Boissi\u00e8re Finance SNC. Foreign exchange gains and losses related to the revaluation at the closing ECB fixing rate of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies offset each other within the foreign exchange position.\n\nProvisions for depreciation of bad debts are recorded when it becomes probable that the debt will not be collected, and it is possible to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. The identification of doubtful debts as well as the amount of the corresponding provisions are based on the historical experience of definitive losses on debts, the analysis by age of the specific accounts as well as the related credit risks. When the certainty is acquired that a doubtful debt will not be recovered, it is, as well as its constituted provision, canceled by the income statement.\n\n## Other exploitation products\n\nRoyalties from the Schneider brand have been recognized in this item of the income statement\n\n## Non-recurring income\n\nIncome and expenses for the financial year are classified in the income statement in such a way as to show by difference the items of current profit and the items of extraordinary profit, including: the achievement is not related to the day-to-day operation of the business which are not likely to be recurring over which the company has only limited control\n\n## Pension obligations\n\nThe present value of termination benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method. Provisions are funded for the supplementary pension benefits provided by the company on the basis of the contractual terms of top-hat agreements, granting a level of benefits exceeding the general regimes. The company applies the corridor method to actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in estimates. Under this method, the portion of net cumulative actuarial gains and losses exceeding 10% of the projected benefit obligation is amortized over 10 years.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used to determine the company's commitment are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Valuation date: December 31, 2022.\n- \u00b7 Data date: September 30, 2022.\n- \u00b7 Inflation rate: 2.20%.\n- \u00b7 Discount rate: 3.75%.\n- \u00b7 Rate of return on assets: 2.75%.\n- \u00b7 Retirement age: Full rate age.\n- \u00b7 Age of beginning of salaried activity: 23 years old.\n- \u00b7 Turnover rate: 0.00%.\n- \u00b7 Mortality rate: TGH, TGF 05.\n- \u00b7 Annuity growth rate: 1.50%.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nWhen necessary, a contingency provision is put in place for unrealized exchange losses. However, when there are unrealized exchange gains and losses on back-to-back transactions in the same currency and with the same maturity, the amount of the provision is then limited to the net loss.\n\n## Bonds\n\nIssue costs are amortized over the life of the bonds and are booked under 'deferred expenses'. Issuance premiums are booked under 'Call premiums' & amortized over the duration of the bonds.\n\nIn the case of convertible bond (OCEANE), at conversion, the bond will be reclassified as equity for its nominal conversion amount.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

Tax loss carry forwards available to the company in this capacity totaled EUR 1,811 million at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Note 20 Pension benefit commitment\n\nThe company had taken commitments towards its executives, active managers and retirees. In 2015, the company closed the top-hat executive pension plans. Since the end of 2015, there is no more active beneficiary. The company has outsourced to AXA France VIE the commitments towards the retires beneficiaries the top-hat executive pension plans.\n\n## Note 21 Off-balance sheet commitments\n\n## 21.1 - Partnership obligations\n\nThe share of liabilities of 'SC' non-trading companies attributable to Schneider Electric SE as partner is not material.\n\nThe share of liabilities of 'SNC' flow-through entities attributable to Schneider Electric SE as partner is not material.\n\n## 21.2 - Guarantees given and received\n\n## Commitments given\n\nCounter-guarantees of bank guarantees: None\n\nOther guarantees given: EUR 2,072 million, mainly to Group companies\n\nBank guarantees: EUR 20 million\n\n## Commitments received\n\nBank counter-guarantees: None\n\nCredit lines: EUR 2,950 million\n\n## 21.3 - Financial instruments\n\nSchneider Electric Group hedging transactions, exchange guarantees, and the establishment of financial instruments are carried out by the manager of the Group cash pool, Boissi\u00e8re Finance, a wholly- owned subsidiary of Schneider Electric Industries SAS, which in turn is wholly owned by Schneider Electric SE.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, Schneider Electric SE set up a \u20ac250 million interest rate swap as a derivative instrument to partially hedge its exposure to interest rates.\n\n## Note 22 Contingencies\n\nInvestigations were conducted in September 2018 by the French judicial authority and French Competition Authority (Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence) at Schneider Electric's head office and other premises concerning the sale of electrical products through commercial distribution activities in France.\n\nOn July 4, 2022, Schneider Electric received a statement of objections (notification de griefs) from the French Competition Authority alleging that the pricing autonomy of some distributors in the French market would have been limited, in breach of competition rules.\n\nSchneider Electric strongly disagrees with the allegations of the statement of objections and has submitted its response to the French Competition Authority on October 4, 2022.\n\nConcurrently on October 7, 2022 Schneider Electric was indicted by an investigating judge who required Schneider Electric to provide a bank guarantee of EUR 20 million and a cash guarantee of EUR 80 million which was paid mid-January 2023. At December 31, 2022, this cash guarantee was recognized as 'Other liabilities' against 'financial assets'.",

        "page_content": "Those actions do not mean that Schneider Electric will ultimately be found guilty of any wrongdoing. Schneider Electric firmly disagrees with all the allegations made by the French investigating judge and the French Competition Authority and intends to defend itself fully and vigorously. Should the French Competition Authority deny Schneider Electric's arguments and conclude, after examining the substance of the matter, that anti-competitive practices have been involved, it has broad discretion to determine on a case-by-case basis the financial fines it may impose in accordance with the principles of proportionality and individuality. In light of the difficulty in assessing the extent to which the French Competition Authority takes into account the arguments of Schneider Electric in its defense as well as the multiple factors contributing to the determination of a fine, it is not possible to reliably estimate the amount of any potential fine that might be incurred in the event of an adverse decision, even though it might have a significant impact on the Group. In this context, no provision has been made at this stage of the investigation.\n\n## Note 23 Other Information\n\n## 23.1 - Workforce\n\nThe average number of employees is 2.5 over 2022.\n\n## 23.2 - Consolidated financial statements\n\nSchneider Electric SE is the parent company of the Group and accordingly publishes the consolidated financial statements of the Schneider Electric Group.\n\n## 23.3 - Subsequent events\n\nOn January 30, 2023 as part of the closing of the transaction, SESE used the bridging loan for an amount of EUR 1 billion and the loan line for an amount of EUR 1.7 billion and made the corresponding cash available to Ascot Acquisition Holdings Limited.\n\nOn January 13, 2023 SESE carried out a bond issue in two tranches: EUR 600 milllion at a rate of 3.125% and maturing in October 2029 and \u20ac600m at a rate of 3.375% and maturing in April 2034.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under these standards are further described in the 'Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the financial statements' section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules provided for in the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for Statutory Auditors for the period from January 1, 2022 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of assessments - Key audit matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were the most significant in our audit of the financial statements, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed as part of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and advances\n\n'Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates' paragraph of the 'Accounting principles' section and Note 2 'Investments' to the financial statements\n\n## Description of risk\n\nAt December 31, 2022, shares in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and advances recorded in the Company's balance sheet amounted to \u20ac5,358 million and \u20ac2,513 million respectively.\n\nAs described in the 'Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates' paragraph in the 'Accounting policies' section of the notes to the financial statements, shares in subsidiaries and affiliates are recorded at their acquisition cost and written down when their estimated value in use at the reporting date is less than their carrying amount. The estimated value in use of shares in subsidiaries and affiliates is determined primarily by reference to the accounting net assets of the investments and by taking into account the profitability of the investments and the outlook for the economic environment. For listed securities, the average share price for the last month of the financial year is taken into account.\n\nDue to the judgment required from management in making these estimates, particularly when they are based on forward-looking information, we considered that the valuation of shares in subsidiaries and affiliates, and by extension the related loans and advances, is a key audit matter.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company's management.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgment throughout the audit. They also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 assess the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Risks Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Risks Committee which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control that we have identified regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Risks Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were the most significant for the audit of the financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Risks Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as defined in particular in Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss any risks to our independence and the related safeguard measures with the Audit and Risks Committee.\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\n## Mazars\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, March 6, 2023\n\nJuliette Decoux Guillemot Partner\n\nMathieu Mougard Partner\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine, March 6, 2023\n\nJean-Christophe Georghiou Partner\n\nS\u00e9verine Scheer Partner",

        "page_content": "## 7.2 Capital\n\n## 7.2.5 Share buybacks\n\n## 7.2.5.1  Current share buyback program\n\nWe remind you that on February 14, 2019, Schneider Electric initiated a new \u20ac1.5 billion to \u20ac2.0 billion share buyback program. The program has been launched under the 15 th resolution approved at the 2018 Annual Shareholders' Meeting and pursued under the 14 th , 17 th , 15 th , and 14 th resolutions approved respectively at the 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Annual Shareholders' Meetings. These buybacks are part of a policy to neutralize the dilution resulting from capital increases reserved for employees or from Long Term Incentive Plans. All the shares acquired by the Company as part of the share buyback program are held to cover Long Term Incentive Plans.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, due to the economic uncertainty, and considering the ongoing acquisitions, the share buyback program remained on-hold after its suspension due to the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. The share buyback program restarted at the end of July 2021. On May 5, 2022, the proposal to raise the cap on purchase price to \u20ac250 per share (from the previous \u20ac150 per share) was approved at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Schneider Electric did not further progress the buyback in the second half-year primarily due to restrictions on account of the proposed transaction with the AVEVA minority shareholders that was in progress during the period. Schneider Electric remains committed to the completion of the existing share buyback program.\n\nSince the beginning of the program in 2019, a total \u20ac796,969,443 of share buyback corresponding to 7,601,716 shares bought back by the Company had been completed including \u20ac219,470,200 of share buyback in 2022 corresponding to 1,659,933 shares bought back by the Company pursuant to the last authorizations.\n\n## 7.2.5.2  Share buyback program to be submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 4, 2023\n\nDetails of this share buyback program are as follows:\n\n| Number of shares and percentage of share capital held   directly and indirectly by Schneider Electric SE*                                       | \u00b7  Own shares: 11,976,390 shares,  i.e.  2.10% of share capital. \u00b7  Treasury shares: 1,058 shares. \u00b7  Total: 11,977,448 shares,  i.e.  2.10% of share capital.                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overview of purposes for which shares have been held*                                                                                           | \u00b7  For all own shares* held: allocation of Performance Shares                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Share buyback program objectives                                                                                                                | \u00b7  Allotment to employees or Corporate Officers as a long-term  compensation tool. \u00b7  Delivery as a result of the exercise of rights attached to securities                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Maximum number of shares that may be acquired                                                                                                   | \u00b7  Disposal in the course of a share management agreement \u00b7  10% of the issued share capital at any moment: -  On the basis of the issued share capital*: 57,109,292 Schneider  Electric SE shares with a nominal value of \u20ac4,  -  Taking into account treasury stock and own shares*:   45,131,844 shares or 7.90% |\n| Maximum purchase price and maximum aggregate amount   of share purchases                                                                        | \u00b7  the maximum purchase price is set at \u20ac250 per share,   i.e.  \u20ac14,277,323,000                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Duration of the buyback program                                                                                                                 | \u00b7  18 months maximum, expiring on November 3, 2024                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Transactions carried out pursuant to the program authorized by  the Annual Shareholders' Meeting 2022 between May 6, 2022 and February 15, 2023 | \u00b7  Number of shares acquired: 792,829. \u00b7  Average purchase price: \u20ac126.12. \u00b7  Number of shares transferred: 93,022. \u00b7  Average transfer price: \u20ac59.48.                                                                                                                                                              |\n\n- * As of January 31, 2023.\n\n## 7.2.6 Pledge\n\n## Pledges on Schneider Electric SE shares\n\n419,323 shares are pledged.\n\n## Pledges on subsidiaries' shares\n\nSchneider Electric SE has not pledged any shares in significant subsidiaries.",

The Board may decide, when each meeting is called, to organize the public transmission of all or part of the meeting by video conference and/or using teletransmission techniques.\n\nAll shareholders may attend meetings, in person or by proxy, after providing proof of identity and share ownership in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nWhen the decision is made to call an Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors may also decide to allow shareholders to participate or vote at Annual Shareholders' Meetings using video conferencing facilities and/or any other telecommunication medium allowed under applicable legislation.\n\nRemote voting procedures are governed by the applicable laws and regulations. In particular, shareholders may send proxy and mail ballot forms before Annual Shareholders' Meetings either in paper form or, if approved by the Board of Directors and stated in the meeting announcement and/or notice, electronically.\n\nWhen the decision is made to call an Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors may authorize shareholders to fill out and sign these forms electronically through a secure site set up by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting organizer using a process that complies with applicable laws and regulations (Paragraph 2 of Article 1367 of the French Civil Code) and consisting of a username and password.\n\nProxies or votes so submitted electronically before the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, as well as the related acknowledgments of receipt, will be considered irrevocable and binding documents. However, in the event that shares are sold before the applicable record date (midnight Paris time two business days before the meeting date), the Company will cancel or amend, as appropriate, any related proxy or electronic votes submitted before the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nMeetings shall be chaired by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or in his absence by the Vice-Chairman, or in his absence by a member of the Board of Directors specially appointed for that purpose by the Board of Directors. In the event that no chairman has been selected, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting elects its chairman.\n\nThe two shareholders present who hold the largest number of votes and who accept shall act as scrutineers. The Board appoints a secretary, who is not required to be a shareholder.\n\nAs required by law, a register of attendance is kept.\n\nCopies or extracts of the meeting's minutes are certified either by the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the Annual Shareholders' Meeting's secretary.\n\n## 7.4.2 Voting rights\n\nThis section is part of the Board of Directors' Corporate Governance Report.\n\n## 7.4.2.1  Double voting rights (Article 20 of the Articles of Association)\n\nVoting rights attached to shares are proportionate to the equity in the capital they represent, assuming that they all have the same nominal value. Each capital share or dividend share confers the right to one vote except where compulsory legal provisions limit the number of votes a shareholder may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, double voting rights are attributed to fully paid-up shares registered in the name of the same holder for at least two years prior to the end of the calendar year preceding that in which the Annual Shareholders' Meeting takes place, subject to compliance with the provisions of the law. In the case of a bonus share issue paid up by capitalizing reserves, earnings, or additional issue premiums, each bonus share allotted in respect of shares carrying double voting rights will also have double voting rights.\n\nThe shares are stripped of their double voting rights if they are converted into bearer shares or transferred, except in the case of the transfer from one registered holder to another as part of an inheritance or family gift.\n\nDouble voting rights may also be stripped by a decision of the Extraordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting after ratification by a Special Shareholders' Meeting of beneficiaries benefiting from double voting rights.\n\nThe minimum holding period to qualify for double voting rights was reduced from four to two years by decision of the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of June 27, 1995.",

        "page_content": "## 7.4.2.2  Ceiling on voting rights (Article 20 of the Articles of Association)\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, no shareholder may exercise, either in person or through a proxy, by virtue of single voting rights conferred by the shares they hold directly and indirectly and by virtue of the proxy votes entrusted to them, more than 10% of the total number of the voting rights conferred by shares in the Company. However, if a shareholder also holds double voting rights directly or indirectly and/or as proxy, the limit set may be exceeded taking into consideration only the resulting additional voting rights, without the total voting rights thereby held exceeding 15% of the total number of the voting rights conferred by the shares in the Company.\n\nTo apply these provisions:\n\n- \u00b7 The total number of voting rights allowed are calculated as of the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and announced to the shareholders at the beginning of such Annual Shareholders' Meeting;\n- \u00b7 The number of voting rights held directly and indirectly are understood to include those conferred by shares held personally by a shareholder, those conferred by shares held by a legal entity controlled by a shareholder as defined by Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, and those shares that are assimilated to the shares owned, as defined by the provisions of Articles L. 233-7 et seq. of the Code; and\n- \u00b7 Shareholders' proxies returned to the Company that do not appoint a representative are subject to the above ceilings. However, these ceilings do not apply to the meeting chairman voting on behalf of such proxies.\n\nThe above ceilings will no longer apply, without it being necessary to put the matter to the vote again by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, if any individual or legal entity, acting alone or jointly with one or other individuals or legal entities, acquires or increases its stake to at least two-thirds of the Company's capital through a public tender offer for all the Company's shares. The Board of Directors takes note of this nullity and undertakes the formalities necessary to amend the Articles of Association. The ceiling on voting rights was approved by the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings of June 27, 1995.\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 225-96, Paragraph 1 of the French Commercial Code, any amendment to the Articles of Association must be approved by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, by a majority of at least two-thirds of the voting rights represented by shareholders in attendance or participating by proxy.\n\n## 7.4.3  Allocation of income (Article 22 of the Articles of Association)\n\nNet income for the year less any losses brought forward from prior years is appropriated in the following order:\n\n- \u00b7 5% to the legal reserve (this appropriation is no longer required once the legal reserve represents one-tenth of the capital, provided that further appropriations are made in the case of a capital increase);\n- \u00b7 To discretionary reserves, if appropriate, and to retained earnings; and\n- \u00b7 To the payment of the balance in the form of a dividend.\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting may decide to offer shareholders the opportunity to receive the dividend in cash or in the form of new shares. Dividends not claimed within five years from the date of payment are forfeited and paid to the government, in accordance with the law.\n\n## 7.4.4  Holding of shares (Article 7 Paragraph 1 of the Articles of Association)\n\nShareholders may elect to hold their shares in registered or bearer form. To establish proof of ownership, the shares must be recorded in the shareholder's account in accordance with the procedures and conditions defined by current legislation and regulations.\n\n## 7.4.5  Disclosure thresholds (Article 7 Paragraph 2 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThe Articles of Association stipulate that any individual or legal entity that owns or controls (as these terms are defined in Article L. 233-9 of the French Commercial Code) directly or indirectly, shares or voting rights representing at least 1% of the total number of shares or voting rights outstanding, or a multiple thereof, is required to disclose the total number of shares, voting rights and share equivalents held directly, indirectly or in concert to the Company by registered letter with return receipt requested, within five trading days of the disclosure threshold being crossed. In addition, effective November 1, 2009, the shareholder must notify the Company, in the disclosure letter, the number of existing shares it is entitled to acquire by virtue of agreements or financial instruments referred to in point b) of the third paragraph of Article L. 233-7 of the French Commercial Code and of the number of existing shares covered by any agreement or financial instrument referred to in point c) of said paragraph. Shareholders are also required to notify the Company if the number of shares or voting rights held falls below one of the thresholds defined above. In the case of failure to comply with these disclosure obligations, the shares in excess of the disclosure threshold will be stripped of voting rights at the request of one or several shareholders owning at least 2.5% of the share capital, subject to compliance with the relevant provisions of the law. These provisions are from the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings of June 27, 1995, May 5, 2000, and April 23, 2009.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n8\n\nC\n\nH\n\n9",

This provision was adopted by the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings of June 30, 1988 and May 5, 2000.\n\n## 7.4.7  Disposal of shares (Article 8 of the Articles of Association)\n\nShares in the Company are freely negotiable and transferable.\n\n## 7.4.8  Publication of information of Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code\n\nThis section is part of the Board of Directors' Corporate Governance Report.\n\nItems that could have an impact in the event of a public tender offer include:\n\n- \u00b7 Agreements calling for payments to the Corporate Officers (see section 4.2.3.1 of this Universal Registration Document) or to employees if they resign or are terminated without real cause or if their employment ends due to a public tender offer;\n- \u00b7 Certain financing arrangements with conditional provisions of anticipated reimbursement or cancellation in the event of change of control. Under these provisions, the debt holders may request for repayment or cancellation if a shareholder or shareholders acting together hold more than 50% of the Company's shares.

It also  applied to the Bridge Facility and Term Loan set up  for a total amount of approximately \u20ac3.9 billion to secure the funding of the minority interest of AVEVA. Bonds include such a change of control event if the change of control triggers a down grading of the Company's rating. As of December 31, 2022, \u20ac8.6 billion of bonds were subject to this type of conditions; and\n- \u00b7 Statutory restrictions in the Articles of Association on the exercise of voting rights (see section 7.4.2 of this Universal Registration Document) relating to the non-application of the ceiling on voting rights when a public tender offer is successfully completed.",

No dividend will be paid on treasury shares held by the Company on the payment date. This distribution will be paid out of the distributable earnings amounting to \u20ac2,069,815,278.53. The proposed dividend is an integral part of Schneider Electric's policy to reward shareholders over the long term. It represents an increase of 9% versus last year.\n\nThe distribution will be paid according to the following schedule:\n\n- \u2022 Dividend ex-date: May 9, 2023\n- \u2022 Record date:\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\n- \u2022\n- Dividend payment date: May 11, 2023\n\nFor individual beneficiaries who are tax residents in France, the dividend is subject upon payment to a social security tax of 17.2% and, in principle, to a mandatory non-definitive levy of 12.8%. This tax is levied at source and is computed on the gross amount of the dividend.\n\nFor its taxation in 2024, this dividend will fully be eligible for the 40% tax rebate referred to in Article 158.3.2\u00b0 of the French Tax Code where an express, global, and irrevocable election is made for taxation under the progressive scale of personal income tax. Where this option is not made, the dividend will be taxed at a final flat-rate income 12.8% and will not be eligible for this 40% rebate. In both cases, the levy of 12.8% borne at the time of the payment of the dividend is deducted from the individual income tax due.\n\n## Text of the first resolution\n\n## (Approval of statutory financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the Board of Directors' report and the statutory auditors' report, approves the statutory financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year as presented, as well as the transactions reflected in these statements or summarized in these reports showing a net profit of \u20ac1,744,408,093.62.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to Article 223 quater of the French Tax Code (Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts), the Shareholders' Meeting approves the value of expenses and charges non-deductible from taxable result liable to corporate income tax and amounting to \u20ac7,042 as well as the theoretical tax borne as a result of these charges amounting to \u20ac1,819.\n\n## Text of the second resolution\n\n## (Approval of statutory financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the Board of Directors' report and the statutory auditors' report, approves the statutory financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year as presented, as well as the transactions reflected in these statements or summarized in these reports.\n\n## Text of the third resolution\n\n## (Appropriation of profit for the financial year and setting the dividend)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having noted that the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 closed with a net profit of \u20ac1,744,408,093.62 and, considering the retained earnings amounted to \u20ac325,407,184.91, the distributable earnings amounted to \u20ac2,069,815,278.53, upon proposal of the Board of Directors, decides:\n\n- \u00b7 the distribution to the shareholders of a dividend of \u20ac3.15 per share, i.e., \u20ac1,761,214,530.60 (1) on the basis of the number of shares ranking for dividends at December 31, 2022 paid from the distributable earnings; and\n- \u00b7 the allocation of the balance of the distributable earnings after distribution to the retained earnings.\n\nThe ex-dividend date will be May 9, 2023 and the dividend will be payable from May 11, 2023. If, at the time of payment of the dividend, the number of treasury shares held by the Company has changed compared to that held on December 31, 2022, the fraction of the dividend relating to this variation will either increase or reduce retained earnings.\n\n- (1)  This amount is calculated based on the number of shares ranking for dividends at December 31, 2022 and could therefore change if this number varies between January 1, 2023 and the ex-dividend date.",

In particular, the Board seeks to ensure gender balance and broad diversity in terms of skills, experience, nationality, and age, as described in its diversity policy (see section 4.1.2.4 of Chapter 4 of the Universal Registration Document). The Board investigates and evaluates not only potential candidates, but also whether existing Directors should seek reappointment based on their individual performance assessment and contribution. The Board seeks above all to ensure that its composition is consistent with the strategic needs of the Company and reflects the values that are essential to its proper functioning: independence of mind, richness of perspective, competence, commitment, and complementarity of experience and people.\n\nAs part of the Board's continuous review of its composition, the Board of Directors asked the Governance & Remunerations Committee to make a recommendation on the renewal of Mr. L\u00e9o Apotheker, Mr. Gregory Spierkel and Mr. Lip-Bu Tan, as well as search for complementary profiles in line with the skillset highlighted by its Board skills matrix and the challenges of the Company (see section 4.1.2.4 of Chapter 4 of the Universal Registration Document describing the director recruitment process).\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## 8.1  Explanatory comments & draft resolutions submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting\n\nIn that respect, the Committee has analyzed Mr. L\u00e9o Apotheker's, Mr. Gregory Spierkel's and Mr. Lip-Bu Tan's situation with regards to their relevance and performance, as well as their time commitment and availability to fulfill their duties as well as the value added by each of them to the work of the Board.\n\n- \u00b7 Mr. L\u00e9o Apotheker holds only one other position in a listed company (Director of NICE-Systems Ltd), and his attendance rate at Board meetings in 2022 is 100%, while his attendance rate at meetings of the Committees in which he participates is 90%. The Committee recommended to the Board that Mr. L\u00e9o Apotheker continues to participate in the work of the Board, particularly in the areas of software and M&A, where his expertise as former Chief Executive Officer of SAP and Hewlett-Packard is essential, as well as his excellent knowledge of the Group and the balance of the composition of the Board of Directors in terms of seniority. However, in view of his age and his non-independence under the AFEP-MEDEF Code, considering he has been a member of the Board since 2008, the Committee has proposed limiting his term of office to two years.\n- \u00b7 Mr. Gregory Spierkel holds two other mandates in listed companies (Director of MGM Resorts International and PACCAR Inc.), his attendance rate at the meetings of the Board and the committees in which he participates in 2022 is 100%. Mr. Gregory Spierkel brings to the Board the benefit of his experience as former Chief Executive Officer of Ingram Micro, Inc. and a solid profile in digital and technology matters, which leads the Board to propose to you the renewal of his mandate for a four-year term.\n- \u00b7 Mr. Lip-Bu Tan holds three offices in listed companies in addition to his office at Schneider Electric: Chairman of Cadence Design Systems, Inc., from which he retired as Chief Executive Officer in 2021 and will retire as Chairman in 2023 as he announced he will not seek re-election to the Board at the 2023 Annual Meeting (https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000813672/cd2ef8b8abb5-4620-a08d-c5c49565fc6c.pdf), Chairman of the Board of Directors of Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd. and Director of Intel Corporation. After the 2023 Cadence's Annual Meeting planned on May 4, Mr. Lip-Bu Tan will therefore hold two offices in listed companies in addition to his office at Schneider Electric. In view of his commitments, the Governance & Remunerations Committee has carefully examined his situation. In particular, it has ascertained from him his willingness and commitment to devote sufficient and necessary time to the Board of Schneider Electric, as Mr. Lip-Bu Tan has always done in the past, as evidenced by his level of attendance at Board meetings in 2022 (100%) and at the meetings of the committees in which he participates (90%), as well as his physical participation in several meetings, including the Strategy Session in August 2022. His average attendance rate at Board and committee meetings over his term of office (2019 - 2022) was 94% and 97.5% respectively, reflecting his commitment and availability. The Committee also took into consideration the assessment of Mr. Lip-Bu Tan's effective contribution to the work of the Board that was conducted among the Directors in October 2022 during the Board's self-assessment, which concluded that Mr. Lip-Bu Tan brings to the Board unique expertise in the areas of software and technology, particularly in the energy sector, venture capital, and in-depth knowledge of the Asian and US markets. For all of these reasons, the Board has determined that his continued service as a Director is in the best interests of the Company, its shareholders, and is consistent with the composition objectives identified by the Board, and therefore invites you to reappoint Mr. Lip Bu-Tan for a four-year term.\n\nThe Governance & Remunerations Committee also identified the skills that would be useful to diversify and strengthen the Board composition and hired an external recruitment firm (Heidrick & Struggles) to search for suitable candidates. Among these candidates, the Governance & Remunerations Committee preselected a short list and the members of the Committee interviewed them. Following these interviews, the Committee recommended two candidates to the Board of Directors, Mr. Abhay Parasnis and Mrs. Giulia Chierchia, who were appointed as Observers respectively on July 27, 2022 and February 15, 2023 with the aim to propose their appointment to the 2023 Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nMr. Abhay Parasnis, a US citizen based in San Francisco and an entrepreneur, is Adobe's former Chief Technology Officer and Chief Product Officer and serves on the Board of Directors at Dropbox. He will bring to the Board his remarkable technology and digital skills, especially his experience in shifting to the cloud and in SaaS transformation as well as his spirit of innovation and reinvention. He will qualify as an independent Director with regard to all the criteria set by Article 10.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code and, if appointed, will join the Digital Committee.\n\nMrs. Giulia Chierchia, an Italian and Belgian dual citizen based in the United Kingdom, is currently Executive Vice-President Strategy, Sustainability and Ventures of BP. She will bring to the Board her expertise in ESG and energy sector, in particular, her experience in energy transition strategy in large companies with a global approach including strategy, sustainability, capital allocation and ventures. She will qualify as an independent Director with regard to all the criteria set by Article 10.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code and, if appointed, will join the Investment Committee.\n\nActing upon recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board of Directors proposes to shareholders:\n\n- \u00b7 in the 12 th resolution , to renew the term of office of Mr. L\u00e9o Apotheker for a two-year (2) term;\n- \u00b7 in the 13 th resolution , to renew the term of office of Mr. Gregory Spierkel for a four-year (4) term;\n- \u00b7 in the 14 th resolution , to renew the term of office of Mr. Lip-Bu Tan for a four-year (4) term;\n- \u00b7 in the 15 th resolution , to appoint Mr. Abhay Parasnis as a Director for a four-year (4) term; and\n- \u00b7 in the 16 th resolution , to appoint Mrs. Giulia Chierchia as a Director for a four-year (4) term.\n\nShould these resolutions be approved, the Board of Directors would consist of 16 members (including one Director representing the employee shareholders and two Directors representing the employees), with an independence rate of 85% and 46% of women (excluding the three Directors who are also employees) and 81% being of non-French origin or nationalities.\n\nMr. L\u00e9o Apotheker's, Mr. Gregory Spierkel's, Mr. Lip-Bu Tan's, Mrs. Giulia Chierchia's, and Mr. Abhay Parasnis' biographies are provided in section 2.2.3 of the Notice of meeting and section 4.1.2.2 of Chapter 4 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.",

Schneider Electric was one of the first companies to address this topic at the Board level with the creation of the Human Resources & CSR Committee in 2014. Schneider Electric further addressed the topic by deciding that the annual variable compensation of both the Chief Executive Officer and of the more than 64,000 employees (who benefit from a variable compensation), includes ESG criteria, part of which relates to Climate. The long-term incentive plan is also correlated with ESG criteria (for more detail on compensation, please refer to section 4.2 of Chapter 4 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document).\n\nSeveral other governance bodies are involved in this matter: the Executive Committee and its Function Committee, the Stakeholder Committee and the Sustainability department. At Group level, the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, who is part of the Executive Committee, helps determine and enforce the Group's environmental goals and underlying transformations. Three Committees involving Group Executive Vice-Presidents and Senior Vice-Presidents are dedicated to oversee the implementation of the Group's decarbonation roadmap, respectively focusing on the supply chain, low-carbon product design and the decarbonization of Schneider Electric's operational emissions.\n\nUpon a joint recommendation from the Human Resources & CSR Committee and the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board decided to offer its shareholders an opportunity to express their views on Schneider Electric's Climate strategy.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6\n\nC\n\nH\n\n7",

Schneider Electric considers itself part of an end-to-end ecosystem and reviews its progress along three dimensions: first aligning the Group and its supply chain with a 1.5\u00b0C Climate trajectory; second helping customers to do the same through Schneider Electric's offers; and third helping Schneider Electric communities accelerate Climate action. As a result, the Group's Climate strategy addresses all of its stakeholders and shows there are ways for companies to 'do good while doing well'. In line with the ambition to contribute to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C, Schneider Electric is committed to reach the targets described below as validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.\n\nCarbon neutral in our operations\n\n2025\n\n2030*\n\n2040\n\n## 2021 - 2025 initiatives to act for climate & preserve resources\n\n## Suppliers\n\n## Operations\n\n## Customers/Society\n\nReduce CO 2 from suppliers operations\n\nImprove CO 2 efficiency in transportation\n\nTransition to Zero-CO 2 sites\n\nSSI #1\n\nGrow our impact revenues\n\nSSI #2\n\nSave and avoid CO 2 emissions for customers\n\nSSE #2\n\nSubstitute products using SF 6\n\nSSE #6\n\nProduct revenues covered by Green Premium \u2122 eco-label\n\n25% absolute reduction across our entire value chain and 'net-zero ready' in our operations\n\nCarbon neutral across our entire value chain\n\nNet-zero CO 2 emissions across our entire value chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSI #3\n\nSSE #4\n\nSSI #4\n\nUse green materials in our product\n\nSSI #5\n\nSwitch to sustainable packaging\n\nSSE #10\n\nAvoid primary resource use\n\nSSE #1\n\nSSE #3\n\nSource renewable electricity\n\nSSE #5\n\nImprove energy efficiency\n\nSSE #7\n\nSwitch to electrical vehicles\n\nSSE #8\n\nDeploy local biodiversity programs\n\nSSE #9\n\nMake waste a resource\n\nSSE #11\n\nDeploy water conservation action plans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConcrete actions and investment plans to reach those targets are described in section 2.3 of Chapter 2 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## \u00b7 Consultation process\n\nInvestors' consultation on Schneider Electric's Climate strategy is part of the continuous and strong shareholder engagement conducted each year. The goal is that shareholders express their views on our Climate transition plan to be able to take into consideration their feedback.\n\nHowever, shareholders are not asked to take responsibility for Schneider Electric's Climate strategy, which remains the exclusive responsibility of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. Therefore, in order to comply with the respective specific powers of each of the corporate bodies, the nature of this resolution is purely consultative, and this vote will not be binding.\n\nThe Board invites shareholders to support this strategy, which will influence every aspect of the Group's actions over the long-term. A widespread approval of Schneider Electric's Climate strategy will comfort the Company in its leading and ambitious Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) roadmap and is essential to bolster the Company's efforts to further accelerate its decarbonization journey in a transparent way.\n\nThe Board will take into account the level of support received on this resolution and continue engaging with its shareholders. Should the level of dissent reach 50% or more, the Board will seek information on the reasons for which some investors may not have supported the proposed resolution to be able to propose a revised Climate strategy.",

In addition, the key indicators are part of the Schneider Sustainability Impact, from which results are shared transparently quarterly in the financial and non-financial communication of the Company. The Company also details the risks and opportunities linked to Climate change as well as the associated governance, in accordance with all the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n## \u00b7 Next vote on the Climate strategy\n\nThe Board intends to repeat this consultation at the 2026 Annual Shareholders' Meeting in order to allow shareholders to express their views on the progress made on the implementation of the strategy and the strategy itself. It will correspond to the launch of the new cycle of the Schneider Sustainability Impact, the current plan ending in 2025.\n\n## Text of the seventeenth resolution\n\n## (Opinion on the Company Climate strategy)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the Company's Climate strategy as described in section 2.3 of Chapter 2 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document, issues a favorable opinion on this Climate strategy.\n\n## 18 th resolution: Share buybacks\n\n## Explanatory statement\n\nAs the pre-existing authorization comes to its term in November 2023, it is hereby proposed, in the 18 th resolution submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, to reconduct, for a new eighteen-month period starting after the present Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the authorization given to the Board of Directors to purchase the Company's shares as part of a share buyback program pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 22-10-62 of the French Commercial Code and European Regulation (EU) no. 596/2014 of April 16, 2014 on market abuse.\n\nWe remind you that on February 14, 2019 Schneider Electric initiated a new \u20ac1.5 billion to \u20ac2.0 billion share buyback program. These buybacks are part of a policy to neutralize the dilution resulting from capital increases reserved for employees or from Long- term Incentive Plans.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, due to the economic uncertainty, and considering the on-going acquisitions, the share buyback program remained on-hold after its suspension due to the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. The share buyback program restarted at the end of July 2021. On May 5, 2022, the proposal to raise the cap on purchase price to \u20ac250 per share (from the previous \u20ac150 per share) was approved at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Schneider Electric did not further progress the buyback in the second half-year primarily due to restrictions on account of the proposed transaction with the AVEVA minority shareholders that was in progress during the period. Schneider Electric remains committed to the completion of the existing share buyback program.\n\nSince the beginning of the program in 2019, a total \u20ac796,969,443 of share buyback corresponding to 7,601,716 shares bought back by the Company had been completed including \u20ac219,470,200 of share buyback in 2022 corresponding to 1,659,933 shares bought back by the Company pursuant to the last authorizations.\n\nAll the 11,977,197 treasury shares held on December 31, 2022 (representing 2.10% of the share capital) are allocated to employees and Corporate Officers as a long-term compensation tool.\n\nThe authorization that you would give to the Board would allow to proceed to purchase shares for the purposes, amongst others, of:\n\n- \u00b7 their allotment to employees or Corporate Officers as a long-term compensation tool;\n- \u00b7 their delivery as a result of the exercise of rights attached to securities giving access to the Company's capital;\n- \u00b7 their cancellation;\n- \u00b7 their delivery in connection with external growth operations; and\n- \u00b7 their disposal in the course of a share management agreement.\n\nShares bought back may be canceled under the authorization adopted by this Annual Shareholders' Meeting (27 th resolution).\n\nThe number of shares thus purchased, and the number of shares held may not exceed 10% of the share capital at any time (for reference purposes, based on the issued capital on December 31, 2022: 57,109,292 shares). The maximum purchase price of the shares would be set at \u20ac250 and the total amount allocated to the share repurchase program would not exceed \u20ac14.3 billion. As for previous years, the resolution prevents that the authorization be used during a public offering on the Company's shares.\n\nFurther information on the Company's share buyback programs can be found in section 7.2.5 of Chapter 7 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6",

In such a case, the Company would inform its shareholders through a public release.\n\nShares acquired may also be canceled, subject to compliance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-204 and L. 225-205 of the French Commercial Code and in accordance with the 27 th resolution of this Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe number of shares that may be purchased shall be subject to following limits:\n\n- (i) the number of shares that the Company may purchase during the term of the buyback program should not exceed 10% of the Company's share capital at any time (i.e. for information purposes, 57,109,292 shares, on the basis of the share capital as of December 31, 2022), it being specified that the number of shares acquired in view of their retention and their future delivery for the purpose of an external growth operation cannot exceed 5% of the Company's share capital; and\n- (ii) the number of shares that the Company can hold at any time may not exceed 10% of the Company's share capital.\n\nThe maximum share purchase price is set at \u20ac250 per share (excluding acquisition costs) without exceeding the maximum price set by applicable laws and regulations. The total amount allocated to the share repurchase program will not exceed \u20ac14.3 billion (excluding acquisition costs).\n\nThe purchase, exchange, disposal or transfer of shares can be decided by the Board of Directors on one or more occasions, at any time except during takeover bid involving the Company's shares, and by any means, provided that laws and regulations in force are complied with, on or off the stock market, over the counter, in whole or in part in blocks of shares, by takeover bid in cash or in shares, by using options or derivatives, either directly or indirectly through the intermediation of an investment services provider, or in any other way.\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting grants authority to the Board of Directors, which may further delegate as permitted by law, to adjust the price set forth above in the event of transactions on the Company's share capital, and in particular an increase in capital through the capitalization of reserves, the allocation of free shares, a stock split or reverse stock split, the distribution of reserves or any other assets, impairment of share capital or any other transaction involving share capital or shareholders' equity, to take into account the impact of these transactions on the stock value.\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting gives full powers to the Board of Directors with powers to subdelegate under the conditions set out by law, to use this authorization, in particular to give any and all orders, enter into any and all agreements, allocate or reallocate the shares acquired to the objectives pursued under the applicable legal and regulatory conditions, set the terms and conditions under which the rights of holders of securities giving access to the share capital or other rights giving access to the share capital will be preserved, if applicable, in accordance with legal and regulatory provisions and, if applicable, contractual provisions providing for other cases of adjustment, prepare all documents and press releases, carry out any and all formalities and make all appropriate declarations to the authorities, and in general take all necessary measures.\n\nThis authorization supersedes, for the unused portion, the authorization given to the Board of Directors by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 5, 2022 in its 14 th resolution and is granted for an eighteen (18)-month period as from this Annual Shareholders' Meeting.",

The maximum nominal amount of the capital increases that may be carried under this resolution shall not exceed \u20ac800 million in aggregate, i.e. 200 million shares representing 35.02% of the capital as of December 31, 2022. The capital increases that may be realized in accordance with the 20 th , 21 st , 22 nd , 23 rd and 24 th resolutions shall be counted against this aggregate ceiling.\n\nFor the 20 th and 21 st resolutions , you are requested to cancel the preferential subscription rights to shares. Indeed, depending on market conditions, the types of investors involved and the type of securities issued, it may be preferable, or even necessary, to cancel the preferential subscription rights in order to carry out a securities placement under optimal conditions, particularly when the speed of transactions is a prerequisite to success, or when the issuances are carried out on overseas financial markets. The cancellation of the preferential subscription rights can facilitate the Company's access to capital due to more favorable issuance conditions. Capital increases without preferential subscription rights may take the form of a public offering (other than those referred to in Article L. 411-2-1\u00b0 of the French Monetary Code in which case a priority period for shareholders can be established ( 20 th resolution ) or of an offering in accordance with Article L. 411-2-1\u00b0 of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( 21 st resolution ). In compliance with the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), the issue price of shares issued without preferential subscription rights will be at least equal to the lowest price provided for according to the regulatory provisions applicable on the date of issue (currently, the average market price of the shares in the three (3) trading days on the regulated market Euronext Paris preceding the setting of the price, reduced by a discount of 10%). Regarding the issuance of securities giving access, immediately or in the future, to the Company's share capital, the issuance price of these securities will be so that the amount received by the Company, immediately or in the future, for each share to which such securities give the right, is at least equal to the minimum issuance price of the shares as defined above. The maximum nominal amount of the capital increases that may be carried under these resolutions shall not exceed \u20ac224 million, i.e. 56 million shares representing 9.81% of the capital as of December 31, 2022.\n\nIn the 22 nd resolution , we are asking you to authorize the Board of Directors to increase the number of securities to be issued under the 19 th , 20 th and 21 st resolutions in the event of an over-subscription (greenshoe). An additional capital increase could thus be carried out within the timeframe and limits provided for by the legislation applicable as of the date of issue (currently, within 30 days of the closing of the subscription period and up to 15% of the initial issuance).\n\nThe 23 rd resolution concerns the issuance of share and/or securities giving immediate or deferred access to the Company's capital with a view to remunerate contributions in kind granted to the Company. This resolution allows the Board of Directors to carry out external growth operations with a consideration in shares within a limit of \u20ac224 million, i.e. 56 million shares representing 9.81% of the capital as of December 31, 2022.\n\nIf granted, these delegations would be valid for 26 months. The Board of Directors may not use this delegation from the date of filing of a takeover bid for the shares of the Company by a third party and for the duration of the bid period.\n\nUnder the 24 th resolution , we are asking you to authorize the Board of Directors to increase the share capital by incorporating premiums, reserves or profits. The rights of shareholders would not be affected by this transaction, which results in free shares allotment, increase in the nominal value of the existing shares, or a combination of both. This transaction does not change the Company's shareholders' equity.\n\nC\n\nH\n\n1\n\nC\n\nH\n\n2\n\nC\n\nH\n\n3\n\nC\n\nH\n\n4\n\nC\n\nH\n\n5\n\nC\n\nH\n\n6",
