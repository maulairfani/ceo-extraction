In this report we describe how we live up to this purpose and create value. When assessing ING's ability to create value in the short, medium and long term, stakeholders look at our financial and nonfinancial performance.\n\n## Approach to integrated reporting\n\nWe disclose our results, strategy and management approach in the context of external developments, as well as emerging and existing risks and opportunities. Our ambition is to continue to improve the integration of financial and non-financial disclosures year by year. And to continue to create a compliant, balanced, simple and accessible integrated report for stakeholders that supports ING's strategy. This continuation builds upon the award we received for last year's report, the FD Henri Sijthoff award. The jury report noted the completeness of ING's reporting while remaining easily navigable.\n\nIn this annual report, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, references to 'ING Groep' and 'ING Group' refer to ING Groep N.V. and references to 'ING', the 'Company', the 'Group', 'we' and 'us' refer to ING Groep N.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries. ING Groep N.V.'s primary banking subsidiary is ING Bank N.V. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, 'ING Bank'). References to 'Executive Board' or 'EB', and 'Supervisory Board' or 'SB', refer to the Executive Board or Supervisory Board of ING Groep N.V., respectively. References to 'Management Board Banking' or 'MBB' refer to the management board of ING Bank N.V.\n\nThe last time we published an annual report was on 10 March 2022, covering the year 2021. This report, on the year 2022, was published on 9 March 2023.\n\nIn this report, 'ING at a glance', and the sections 'Strategy and performance', 'Risk management' and 'Corporate governance', together form the Report of the Executive Board. This report also contains consolidated and parent company financial statements, and other information.\n\n## Governance and responsibility\n\nING's integrated annual report is compiled with input from business experts, vetted by senior managers, and discussed and approved by members of the MBB and EB. Final approval is given by the SB.\n\n## Report content and materiality\n\nIn compiling this report, we take into account the topics that can have a material impact on our business. As a large financial institution, ING has a direct economic, social and environmental impact, as well as a significant indirect impact through its lending and investment activities. We report on these, and other relevant matters, in our value creation model in the 'ING at a glance' section of this report.\n\nWe continuously listen to stakeholders and adapt the execution of our strategy and reporting to meet evolving expectations. For materiality analyses, we consult stakeholder groups in a qualitative and quantitative manner. Please refer to 'Stakeholder engagement' in the 'The world around us'. The results of these materiality analyses, including materiality disclosures, were used to define content for this report, which has been reviewed and approved by the EB.\n\n## Who this report is for\n\nThis report is intended to inform stakeholder groups that have an impact on, or are affected by, our business. This includes customers, communities, investors and shareholders, regulators and supervisors, employees, suppliers, government authorities and non-governmental organisations. It aims to give stakeholders a balanced overview of our activities and ability to create and sustain value. We welcome reactions and views, which can be emailed to communication@ing.com. Additional disclosures are available on ing.com.\n\n## Reporting guidelines\n\nThis report is prepared in accordance with the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and the Dutch Accounting Standard 400. The content and quality criteria specified by the standards, including sustainability context, stakeholder inclusiveness, materiality, completeness, balance, comparability, clarity, timeliness, accuracy and reliability, are integral to our reporting process.\n\nThe GRI's Universal Standards, revised in 2021, represent the most significant update since the GRI transitioned from providing guidance to setting standards in 2016. These standards provide requirements for reporting on each material topic. The GRI Content Index, including additional explanation on some material topics, is not included in the annual report itself, but can be found in a separate annex on ING.com.",

Data and content in this report aims to provide an accurate and balanced account of ING's economic, social and environmental performance. The scope and boundaries for each material topic and metrics are detailed either in text where the topic is introduced, or by references to ing.com.\n\n## Assurance\n\nAssurance for the non-financial information in the Report of the Executive Board, is provided by KPMG Accountants N.V. (KPMG). For the year ended 31 December 2022, KPMG has reviewed and provided a limited level of assurance on the non-financial information in the Report of the Executive Board. KPMG has also audited and provided a reasonable level of assurance, on 'Understanding what matters most' in 'The world around us', data for the Net Promoter Score for Retail Banking and channel availability.\n\n## Creating value\n\nThere are many ways we can create value for stakeholders: we can grow financial capital, develop human capital, produce intellectual capital and affect natural capital (the environment). Customers entrust us with their money, meeting their needs and growing their capital in turn yields dividends to shareholders. We aim to grow human capital by caring for our employees and equipping them for the future workplace. At the same time, we are aware of potential negative value our actions may create. For instance, financing carbon-intensive sectors puts natural capital at risk.\n\nOur value creation model (see 'ING at a glance') is a visual representation of how value flows through our business and how we use different types of input to create long-term value for stakeholders. This eventually also leads to the impact that we generate for society and our planet, which we link to the four UN Sustainable Development Goals.",

Our approach is inclusive and collaborative: working with others to make a bigger impact. We believe that no single sector, much less one bank, can solve global issues like climate change, or financial crime. When it comes to tackling challenges like these, we're more dependent on united and collective action for real, positive change than ever before. By working together with governments and other businesses, banks can help develop sustainable ways to deal with the economic challenges posed by the pandemic, tackle climate change and protect customers, the bank and the financial system against financial economic crime.\n\nOur value creation model demonstrates ING's biggest contribution to society through our business, by fulfilling our function as a bank to process payments, provide loans and other financial services, and keep customers' money and their data safe.\n\nThere are many ways we can create value for stakeholders: we can grow financial capital, develop human capital, produce intellectual capital and affect natural capital (the environment).

At the same time, ING aims to offer a sustainable and attractive return to shareholders.\n\nING's distribution policy is a pay-out ratio of 50% of resilient net profit. Resilient net profit is defined as net profit adjusted for significant items not linked to the normal course of business. The 50% pay-out may be in the form of cash, or a combination of cash and share repurchases, with the majority in cash. Additional distributions to be considered periodically, taking into account alternative opportunities, macro-economic circumstances and the outcome of our capital planning\n\nFor 2022, the resilient net profit amounts to \u20ac4,038 million, of which \u20ac2,019 million was reserved for distribution outside of CET1 capital. In line with the definition of resilient net profit, the impact of applying IAS 29 hyperinflation accounting to the consolidation of ING's subsidiary in Turkey has been excluded, as well as the impairment on the goodwill allocated to Turkey. Therefore, resilient net profit is \u20ac363 million higher than net profit.\n\nAt the end of 2022, ING has \u20ac1,411 million reserved for distribution outside of CET1 capital mainly related to reserved profits in 2022 (full-year 2022: \u20ac2,019 million, of which \u20ac634 million was paid out as interim dividend in August 2022).",

This is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting in April 2023.\n\n## CET1 ratio target and additional distributions\n\nING Groep N.V. has a CET1 ratio target of around 12.5%. This target level is comfortably above the current Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) level of 10.58% and implies a management buffer of around 190 basis points. ING plans to converge its CET1 ratio towards its target of around 12.5% by 2025, as announced during the Investor Update in June 2022. In line with this plan and ING's distribution policy to take into account alternative opportunities as well as macroeconomic circumstances and the outcome of capital planning, the following additional distributions have been conducted in 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 On 25 February 2022, ING completed a \u20ac1.7 billion share buyback programme that started on 5 October 2021, under which 139,711,040 ordinary shares were repurchased. In line with the proposal as adopted at the 2022 AGM, all ordinary shares that were acquired in this share buyback programme have been cancelled, with effect from 1 July 2022.\n- \u00b7 On 14 July 2022, ING completed a \u20ac1.25 billion programme to distribute capital to shareholders, which consisted of an \u20ac874 million cash dividend payment on 18 May 2022 and a \u20ac380 million share buyback programme that started on 12 May 2022. The total number of shares repurchased under the programme was 40,749,792 ordinary shares. In line with the resolution as adopted at the 2022 AGM, all ordinary shares that were acquired in this share buyback programme have been cancelled, with effect from 16 November 2022.\n- \u00b7 On 28 December 2022, ING completed a share buyback programme as part of a \u20ac1.5 billion programme to distribute capital to shareholders. The share buyback programme started on 3 November 2022, under which 107,032,745 ordinary shares were repurchased for a total consideration of \u20ac1.2 billion. The remainder of the total amount of \u20ac1.5 billion, amounting to \u20ac297 million or \u20ac0.082 per share, has been paid to shareholders in cash on 16 January 2023. In line with the resolution as adopted at the 2022 AGM, all ordinary shares that were acquired in this share buyback programme will be cancelled.\n\nTo conduct the buyback programmes, ING entered into non-discretionary arrangements with a financial intermediary.\n\nRead more on the cancellation of shares in the Corporate Governance chapter.\n\n## Important dates in 2023\n\nFor the most up-to-date list of upcoming events, including the 2023 Annual General Meeting and the publication of our quarterly results, please see the Investor Relations section of our corporate website ing.com.",

Add to that, the existential threat of climate change\u2026 and no wonder 'permacrisis' was the word of the year in 2022! How did ING fare in this challenging environment? CEO Steven van Rijswijk looks back on 2022.\n\n## What sort of year was it for ING?\n\nThe past year will certainly go into the history books as extraordinary. Just as we all were getting used to living with the coronavirus, war broke out in Ukraine with a devastating impact on people's lives and societies. First and foremost, it is an immense human tragedy. But it also had economic consequences, causing energy and price shocks, as well as driving up inflation and interest rates. Despite the adversity, ING performed well. We remained committed to executing our strategy, supporting customers, while continuing to intensify our efforts in the fight against climate change. I'm proud that even more customers chose ING as their main bank. In Retail Banking, our primary customer base grew by 585,000, bringing the total number to 14.6 million, four percent higher than at the end of 2021. In Business Banking, we strengthened our offering and now serve 1.7 million customers across seven markets. In Wholesale Banking, we continued to partner with core clients, offering relevant financial services across their value chains.\n\nOur efforts resulted in doing more business with our customers. Core deposits increased by \u20ac25 billion while the core lending portfolio grew by over \u20ac18 billion. This growing lending base and the normalisation of interest rates, led to strongly recovering interest income. Our fee income was higher than ever with efforts to diversify revenue streams paying off even as stock market developments led to pressure on income from customer investments. This contributed to a record total income of \u20ac18.6 billion. Despite the impact of higher salary costs and intensified marketing expenses to invest in the growth of our customer base, operating expenses remained under control and were flat. Regulatory costs declined slightly. One of our strengths is the quality of our loan book, supported by strong risk management. Additions to loan loss provisions were sharply higher than last year on the back of the war in Ukraine, while 2021 included significant Covid-19 releases. All of this resulted in a profit, after tax, of \u20ac3.7 billion.\n\nStrong financial results, a growing number of primary customers, good Net Promoter Scores as well as our progress in other areas such as sustainability, makes me confident that we are on a solid footing and are able to withstand any likely business uncertainty in the coming years. If anything, the past year has again shown the importance of adapting to circumstances. The ever-changing geopolitical and economic context forces us to keep adapting but to also to retain our focus on truly making the difference for people and the planet. At our Investor Update in June, we explained our updated global strategy, that builds on our purpose",

        "page_content": "Contents\n\nRisk management\n\n- > In conversation with our CEO\n\nof empowering people to stay a step ahead in life and business. This new direction helped us to prioritise what is important.\n\n## Why was a strategy update necessary?\n\nI became CEO in the first year of the pandemic. The main priority for me and colleagues in the Board and across ING, was supporting customers and steering our company through that turbulent period. When we moved into what we then perceived to be calmer waters, we felt it was time to take a longer-term view of what we wanted ING to be now, and in the future. We aimed to reinforce our position as a universal banking leader in Europe, building on our strength as a customer-centric, forward-looking bank and learning from past experience. This resulted in a strategy we summarised as 'making the difference'. This two-pronged strategy is all about people and the planet. People, in that we want to return to our main strength, the thing that has set us apart for many years which is having the customer front and centre. We invest in a superior customer experience and concentrate on where we can create the most value.\n\nFor the planet, it's about putting sustainability at the heart of what we do. Climate scientists have been ringing the alarm bells louder than ever. This makes us more determined to find new ways of doing business in a way that aligns economic growth with positive social and environmental impact. We want to be a banking leader in building a sustainable future for customers, society and the planet. It's about doing the right thing and also about future-proofing our own business. But our approach isn't just about climate. Many people around the world struggle with inequality, poor financial health and a lack of basic human rights. So, we're working to advance financial health and inclusion for customers and communities.\n\n## What impact is ING making with this new approach?\n\nWe know the importance of continuing to provide a superior customer experience, especially as financial services are mostly commoditised. Our emphasis is on being relevant, easy, personal and instant, which looks different for each customer segment. For Retail customers this is about the ease and accessibility of mobile banking, while Business Banking and corporate customers appreciate relevant products and advice tailored to their particular needs, supported by seamless digital delivery and servicing. We also emphasise building deep relationships with these clients and putting our sector expertise, international network, and sustainability insights to work for them.\n\nOur digital-first business model has proven its strength. Customers have embraced our digital solutions with 58 percent only doing business with us on their mobile device. This is a significant increase from 19 percent in 2017 and from 40 percent in 2020. We also saw positive developments in our Net Promoter Scores in 2022 in both Retail and Wholesale Banking. This recognition is evidence that our approach is the right one, I'd like to thank customers all over the world for their trust and faith.\n\n## And in sustainability?\n\nFighting climate change begins with our own operations and employees. This means bringing buildings, data centres, and business travel closer to the net-zero economy of the future. We have solid and ambitious plans in place for that, but we make the biggest impact with our financing. We're increasingly using our financing, knowledge and influence to support the low-carbon transition and clients on their own sustainability journeys. For example, we aim to grow new financing of renewable energy by 50 percent by the end of 2025 and will no longer provide dedicated finance to new oil and gas fields. We have also set ambitious sustainable financing targets. By 2025, we aim to mobilise \u20ac125 billion annually in sustainable finance, via loans, capital markets, derivatives and advisory. We saw this number grow by 15 percent to \u20ac101 billion over the past year.\n\nWhen it comes to our aim of aligning the most carbon-intensive parts of our portfolio with global climate goals, we're using updated climate pathways that reach net zero by 2050 rather than 2070. We've updated this for eight of the nine most carbon-intensive sectors that we finance. We will update the last sector, shipping, when a net zero pathway is adopted under the Poseidon Principles, a sector-specific climate alignment initiative for financial institutions of which we are a signatory.\n\nTaking action on climate is a priority for me and something I'm personally passionate about. It is the right thing to do for the planet and also to future-proof our business. I know we're not perfect, but rather than be stagnant and wait for perfection, I believe it is best to start making progress and keep learning and improving together with our customers. We need to focus on intermediate goals by 2030, as 2050 is a long way away. Reaching net zero by 2050 requires a massive joint effort. None of us can do it alone.\n\n## So, what is most important to you for the future?\n\nThe geopolitical and economic environment is likely to remain uncertain in 2023, which affects both customers and our company. I'm confident in our ability to perform well in these circumstances, continuing to help customers. Within our company and society, no one can achieve success in isolation. Earlier, I mentioned the support of customers. I also want to highlight the value of our interactions with all of our other stakeholders, including shareholders and thank them for their interest in ING. But I'd especially like to thank our employees. They are the most important factor in realising the strategic targets we have set ourselves. Their well-being, skills and capabilities are crucial for our success.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine and the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria in 2023 directly, and indirectly, impacted many colleagues and their families. In Turkey, the epicentre of the second earthquake was close to Kahramanmara\u015f, where we have about 600 people working in an operations centre and in branches. Sadly, five of our colleagues lost their lives and many colleagues have lost families or friends. In the past year I was touched with the collective efforts to help out others in their time of need. It makes me proud to be a part of our orange family.",

        "page_content": "- > The world around us\n\n## The world around us\n\nOur business is largely shaped by what's happening in the world around us, from economic and political developments to the changing regulatory environment, global trends and societal issues. In 2022, the Covid-19 pandemic continued to have an impact on people, businesses and the economy. All these factors provide both challenges and opportunities for ING as we navigate the ever-changing world around us to deliver on our purpose and create long-term value for stakeholders. Read more about value creation and our value creation model in 'ING at a glance'.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nING's stakeholders are people or organisations that may be directly or indirectly affected by our activities, or who may have an impact on our activities or our ability to provide products and services. Banks operate in a heavily regulated environment. It is therefore crucial that we anticipate and understand the impact of legislative and regulatory developments and assess their impact on our customers and business.  New laws and regulations should contribute to financial stability, sustain a competitive environment and enable us to deliver excellent quality services to our customers and to society as a whole. That's why we actively participate in the debate on the direction of public policy and regulatory developments in the European Union and the countries where ING is active. We analyse proposed legislation to assess its potential impact.\n\nWe regularly engage with customers, investors, policymakers - banking regulators, supervisors, officials and politicians - as well as NGOs, industry associations, think tanks, academics and other members of society. When determining ING's position we weigh the interests of ING and all the stakeholders involved and seek to strike the right balance between possibly conflicting viewpoints.\n\nRather than having one-off consultations on specific topics, we have an ongoing dialogue about our role in society, our products and services, our business performance and other topics. This is done at both expert level within our business units and at senior management and Board level.\n\nEngaging with stakeholders also clarifies our approach to sustainability. Under the section 'How we engage' on ing.com, we explain how we do it, including collaborating, listening and by being transparent.\n\nWe contribute to various international initiatives such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. ING is a member of platforms such as the Equator Principles Association and we seek validation of our sustainability priorities by applying international frameworks such as the UN Global Compact and applying standards such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. An overview of partnerships, memberships and endorsements is available at ing.com.\n\nAn ongoing dialogue with stakeholders can help to drive internal change at ING, including by enhancing our environmental and social risk management policy and improving awareness of the wider impact of our business conduct. Equally, ING can drive change by sharing subject-matter expertise with external working groups and think tanks such as the RMI Center for Climate-Aligned Finance.\n\nOur engagement approach complies with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\n\n## Understanding what matters most\n\nTo help us understand the topics that are most important to our internal and external stakeholders, we continually carry out qualitative and quantitative research among stakeholder groups. This gives us an insight into current and future trends, business risks and opportunities, all of which influence our ability to create value and help us to prioritise topics.\n\nEvery three years we carry out a more extensive materiality analysis to address new trends and changing stakeholder concerns and interests. This analysis was last conducted in 2021. It included a stakeholder dialogue event and interviews with senior management, as well as internal and external surveys. In both the interview sessions and the surveys, our stakeholders were asked to identify actual and potential, negative and positive impacts that ING has on the economy, environment and people. Among the internal and external stakeholder groups we consulted were Retail Banking customers, WB clients, investors, NGOs, regulators and employees (including senior managers). The outcomes of these materiality surveys were complemented by global peer, trend and regulatory analyses resulting in the material topics we intend to report on for the next period, in line with our three-year materiality cycle. These topics are reviewed and approved by the MBB.\n\nThe results of the 2022 materiality analysis, which built on our extensive analysis of last year, are reflected in our strategic business decisions and highlighted throughout this report.",

Definitions of the material topics are included in the technical appendix on ing.com.\n\nThe full list of material topics is shown in the matrix on the next page.

        "page_content": "- > The world around us\n\n## Our operating environment\n\nDespite the initial threat posed by the omicron variant of Covid-19, the world economy started 2022 with a strong economic recovery to the point where many advanced economies returned to levels of output seen prior to the pandemic. This was mainly driven by catch-up demand for consumer services as households spent more on leisure in the first quarters of reopening. In some cases, like the Netherlands, the pre-pandemic level of GDP was quickly surpassed.\n\nWith economies reopening, a surge in economic activity in the first half of the year was met by high inflation rates, mainly related to the energy crisis. The war in Ukraine and related energy crisis was the most dominant factor in the global economy in 2022. It pushed up inflation dramatically in Europe, to levels not seen for decades. It has also added to shortages that were already plaguing the European economy.\n\nThis caused pain among businesses and consumers alike and rapidly  slowed the eurozone to stagnation, bordering on recession. The US also battled a surge in prices and China continued to struggle economically due to the continued impact of Covid-related lockdowns and a struggling real estate sector. The UK battled financial instability after the Truss Government's mini-budget and the budget cuts announced afterwards.\n\nHigh inflation also prompted a strong response from central banks worldwide. The Fed led the global interest rate hike cycle, but the ECB also made quick moves towards normalisation of interest rate policy. Ending net purchases in the ECB's Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme and Asset Purchase Programme was followed by rapid rate hikes over the course of the second half of 2022, which turned into the most aggressive hike cycle ever by the ECB. This had a marked impact on the financing environment globally with investment appetite slowing for both households and corporates.\n\n## Climate change risk\n\nING is aware of the risks associated with climate change and how these can impact customers and their financial health. This includes physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk can be acute, such as flood and wildfires, or chronic, such as increased temperature and rising sea levels. Transition risk can be driven by policy, technological or market changes as we shift towards a low-carbon global economy and potentially lead to stranded assets.\n\n## Financial crime risk\n\nWe're committed to fulfilling our role as a gatekeeper to the financial system, to protect customers, society and our bank from the corrosive effects of financial crimes such as money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, sanctions evasion and tax offences. It's our intention to not just comply with applicable laws and regulations in relation to financial crime, but also to continue to strengthen our financial crime control framework in a robust and sustainable way to prevent, detect and respond to illicit activity.\n\nWe continue to seek to harness new and innovative technological capabilities to create a safer environment for customers, our bank and society. In 2022, we further adjusted our financial crime risk appetite and framework of policies and procedures to reflect changes in the risk environment and responded to external developments.\n\nWe also sought to further empower our people with the skills and knowledge to fight financial crime, sharing insights with them about emerging and evolving threats (including in relation to financial crime risks linked to or heightened by the Covid-19 pandemic) and enhancing our training framework.\n\nFighting financial crime and protecting the integrity of the financial system is a challenge for all banks, given the constantly changing environment and pace at which criminals evolve their methods. We believe we can be more effective in our efforts if we collectively join forces and share intelligence with other banks and with national, European and international authorities and law enforcement to combat financial crime. We therefore continue to proactively participate in public-private partnerships, such as Transaction Monitoring Netherlands and Germany's Anti-Financial Crime Alliance, and to collaborate with other banks. Read more in 'How we are making the difference' and 'Compliance risk'.\n\n## Cybercrime\n\nCybercrime remains a continuous threat to companies in general and to financial institutions in particular. Both the frequency and the intensity of attacks are increasing on a global scale. The sophistication and implications of ransomware attacks are growing concerns.",

Additional controls continue to be embedded in the organisation as part of the overall internal control framework and are continuously re-assessed against existing and new threats. In addition, ING continues to strengthen its global cybercrime and fraud resilience through extensive collaboration across the globe with financial industry peers, law enforcement authorities, government (e.g. National Cybersecurity Centre) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). See also 'How we are making the difference' and 'Non-financial risk'.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nInflation rates accelerated across the globe at the beginning of 2022, fuelled by the war in Ukraine. Inflationary pressure prompted an adjustment in monetary policy by major central banks and lead to rising interest rates and tighter global financial conditions.\n\nThe mix of high inflation and rising interest rates further deteriorated macro-financial conditions, aggravating pre-existing vulnerabilities for both businesses and households, which were recovering from the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, and ultimately increasing banks' credit risk. Against this background while ING took additional provisions throughout 2022, it also benefited from the significantly higher interest rates.\n\nEU member-state governments introduced several supporting measures to cushion the rise in energy prices and inflation. These measures, in conjunction with the reduced fiscal space resulting from pandemic-related support measures and the normalisation of the monetary policy stance, increased sovereign vulnerabilities in financially weaker countries.",

Our updated strategy, introduced in 2022, is built around this purpose and making the difference for people and the planet. In a world that's constantly changing, we're digital and sustainability pioneers, adept at adapting to the trends impacting our business.\n\nOur two overarching priorities are giving customers a superior customer experience (CX) and putting sustainability at the heart of what we do.\n\n## We also have four enabling priorities:\n\n- 1. Providing seamless, digital services.\n- 2. Using our scalable technology and operations.\n- 3. Staying safe and secure.\n- 4. Unlocking our people's full potential.\n\n## Giving customers a superior experience\n\nWe want to put customers at the centre, providing them with the superior experience that is our true source of differentiation. We believe that banking is a secondary need, and that financial products and services, for the most part, are commoditised. A superior customer experience is how we can stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe rapid digitalisation of society has huge impact on what customers expect from us. They don't just expect an experience that is digital and seamless, they expect a specific level and quality of experience. A digitally-enabled personal, easy, relevant and instant experience is now the base expectation of all customers, but we also realise that different types of customers have different needs and different ways of interacting with us.\n\n## Putting sustainability at the heart of what we do\n\nWe have a responsibility to society to define new ways of doing business that align with economic growth and social impact. Climate change is one of the world's biggest challenges, threatening both our planet and its people, many of whom also struggle with inequality, poor financial health and even a lack of basic human rights. We're determined to be a banking leader in building a sustainable future for customers, society and the environment. We want to lead by example by striving for net zero in our own operations. We also want to play our part in the low-carbon transformation that's necessary to achieve a sustainable future, aiming to steer our financing towards meeting global climate goals and working with clients to achieve their own sustainability goals.  For more information go to our 'Sustainability at the heart' chapter.\n\n## Our enablers\n\n## Providing seamless, digital services\n\nWe know that we can make customers happy with robust, 'always-on' channels, data-enabled personalised experiences and digitalisation of processes with limited human intervention there where needed.\n\n## Using scalable technology and operations\n\nA technology and operations foundation that is modular and scalable brings many benefits, including superior customer experience and safety, speeding up time-to-volume, shortening time-to-market, and lowering cost-to-serve.\n\n## Staying safe and secure\n\nTrust is the starting point, the most basic requirement, for all stakeholders. That's especially true for a digital-first bank like ING. People trust us with their money and with their data. Keeping it safe, and maintaining this trust are crucial.\n\n## Unlocking our people's full potential\n\nWe want all employees to have skills and capabilities that equip them for the future. We also want to provide them with an excellent employee experience and promote a diverse, inclusive and vital culture where everyone feels they belong.",

What this looks like depends, of course, on the type of customer. For individual customers and small businesses our emphasis is predominantly on mobile banking, while for mid-corporate and Wholesale Banking clients it's all about personal relationships and superior sector and network expertise supported by seamless digital delivery.\n\nAs an organisation we need to be customer focused - after all, customers are who we're here for, our reason for being. And if we want customers to choose us for more of their banking needs, to become primary customers, we need to nurture relationships with them so that they choose ING before any other. At every step of their ING journey, customers should feel an emotional connection with us: that's how we win customers' hearts and their business. Banking is a relationship just like any other, and the best relationships are those in which people feel valued, confident, empowered and in control. In response to customers' changing expectations in today's always-on digital society, we've updated our customer experience principles. We want to provide customers with an experience that is personal, easy, relevant and instant.\n\nPersonal is about recognising customers as individuals and getting to know their needs, goals and challenges so they feel valued. For example, we should not ask for information twice when we interact with them, and we tailor messaging to their specific situation.\n\nEasy is about taking the complexity out of banking, making it intuitive, transparent and understandable so customers feel confident. For example, we aim to clearly price products and services, we avoid complicated jargon and we're always accessible.\n\nRelevant is about bringing value to customers, anticipating their needs and proactively providing the right insights, advice and solutions at the right time, making them feel empowered. For example, guiding them on difficult financial decisions, like re-financing a mortgage in an environment of rapidly increasing interest rates.\n\nInstant is about having solutions at their fingertips that put the customer in the driver's seat of their finances and making them feel in control by allowing them, for instance, to switch seamlessly between selfservice banking on the app and personal advice in a branch. Different groups of customers have different requirements. For Retail Banking and some Business Banking customers (i.e. consumers, the self-employed and small and medium-sized enterprises), the emphasis is on mobile, for both products and services. For Wholesale Banking (corporate clients) and Business Banking mid-corporates, the emphasis remains on deepening client relationships, with superior sector knowledge and networking expertise, relevant advice and tailored products, all supported by seamless digital delivery and services.\n\n## CX Day\n\nOn 15 November, ING held a global CX Day, with over 5,500 colleagues from across the bank joining together to come up with ways to make customer experiences personal, easy, relevant and instant. The event attracted employees from Retail Banking, Business Banking, Wholesale Banking and the support functions in 11 countries. Together, they identified over 1,000 improvements to delight our customers. Some of those improvements were implemented live on the day.\n\n## Retail Banking\n\nFor customers using Retail Banking products and services, ING wants to provide a seamless digital, mobilefirst experience that's personal, easy, instant and relevant. We want to engage with our customers on mobile at every stage of their journey and provide more personalised products and services based on datadriven, relevant insights. Seamless end-to-end digital delivery of customer services is a an enabler for a superior customer experience to earn, and keep, the primary relationship.\n\nEarning 'primary relationships' with customers is an important driver for profitable growth. It leads to deeper relationships, greater customer satisfaction and ultimately customers choosing us for more of their banking needs. We want to be our customers' first partner for their financial business. In Retail Banking, primary customers have at least two active ING products. One of these should be a current account into which they deposit regular income.",

In 2022, over 58 percent of customers used mobile banking only (mobile device log in through the app or mobile device log in through the website) compared to 51 percent in 2021. High adoption of mobile banking is especially visible in Turkey (88 percent), Romania (74 percent), Spain (63 percent) and in the Netherlands (61 percent).\n\nIn the Netherlands, we increased our reach for iOS and Android users to 70 percent with a new method to fully onboard new customers via their mobile phone. The process takes about 10 minutes and customers can immediately start using the account afterwards. Our reach extends to all customers that can use mobile onboarding, i.e. customers with a Dutch passport, ID card or residence permit, those from other European Economic Area countries and refugees from Ukraine.\n\nVisa Mobile is a new online payment method available for retail customers in Poland. Visa contactless and prepaid virtual card users may activate Visa Mobile in their ING mobile app. Customers can pay with their card without using the card's data, by entering the recipient's phone number and confirming payment in their ING mobile app. Payment is fast and secure. In Romania, ING became the first bank to digitalise the mortgage journey, launching 100 percent online financial pre-approval, directly from Romania's internet banking platform. Customers interested in a mortgage loan are able to find out the exact amount they can borrow without having to go to the bank.\n\nAt Interhyp, our online mortgage broker in Germany, the HOME platform digitalises the mortgage process for home buyers, advisors, brokers and bank partners. Interhyp customers can connect directly to realestate portals, create financing scenarios and upload documents from their smartphones, speeding up the mortgage decision process. In Spain, we launched instant lending for customers that are new to the bank. This new service uses instant and automatic processes that provide a differentiated, quick and convenient lending solution.\n\n## Daily banking and savings\n\nEveryday Roundup is a digital product that aims to make saving simpler at a time when customers may be financially vulnerable (due to the cost-of-living crisis). It is used by over 1.1 million customers in six countries (Poland, Australia, Germany, Romania, Turkey and, since 2022, Spain). It works by rounding up every transaction on a customer's current account and automatically transferring the difference to their savings account. ING in Australia, Germany and Turkey also have a round-up option for donations to charities. Similarly, Australia has a round-up option for mortgages, while Spain has a round-up option for investments.\n\nDealwise, a smart shopping platform (accessible in the banking app), is another initiative that encourages customers to save on their daily spending. It gives users access to discounts and cashback offers from participating merchants. Dealwise is available to customers in Romania, Germany and Belgium. Additionally,\n\nin Spain, we updated our daily banking proposition, including the launch of a new, commitment-free account, that aims to increase new-to-bank customers, has a fully online and instant onboarding process, and has new services like e-commerce insurance and a subscriptions manager.\n\n## Remote advice\n\nMore customers are using remote video advice and digital self-service channels. We can connect with customers across multiple channels through ING's cloud-based customer interaction platform for phone, chat and video contacts. Our global customer interaction platform is used in seven countries to harmonise the experience and ensure customers receive the same services everywhere. Compared to last year, we doubled the number of remote advice video meetings and witnessed a rise in customers using the chat function on our websites and mobile apps while realising a reduction in branch traffic. As we continue to optimise our assisted channels, we are also reducing the number of ING branches, with 94 branches closed in 2022.\n\n## Investment products\n\nING customers have access to smart digital investment tools like My Money Coach in Italy, Naranja+ in Spain, Easy Invest in the Netherlands, Komfort-Anlage (Comfort Investing) in Germany and ING Self Invest in Belgium.\n\n## Insurance\n\nING has teamed up with insurance partners in various Retail Banking markets to offer customers insurance products via the ING app or website, based on the local needs within those markets. We offer insurance linked to loans as well as a range of standalone non-life insurance policies. In the Netherlands, we set-up a new distribution partnership with Dutch health insurer CZ. In Romania, we launched salary protection insurance offering customers financial support in case of job loss, prolonged medical leave or permanent invalidity. In Turkey, we introduced digital assistance for insurance and pension products, which led to one of the very first digital remote offers for pensions in the Turkish market. During 2022, we also set up new offers linked to our daily banking activities, including group travel insurance in Romania and online purchase and cash withdrawal protection in Poland.",

The score is calculated as the difference between the percentage of promoters (who rate ING as 9 or 10 out of 10) and detractors (those scoring ING below 6). Our peers have been selected based on qualitative and quantitative criteria like size, brand strength, types of clients served and types of products and services. The yearly NPS score is an average of reported four quarter figures, based on a six months' rolling average. In 2022, ING enhanced its methodology from an average of two quarters to a six months' rolling average. The updated methodology concerns a refinement and does not significantly impact the NPS score and ING's ranking for 2021 and 2022. Our aim is to achieve a number one NPS ranking in all our Retail markets, with a 10-point lead over our main competitors. In 2022, ING ranked number one in five of 10 Retail markets. In these five markets, we have a 10-point lead on the nearest competitor. In Germany and Spain, ING's scoring improved on last year while Australia, Poland and Romania maintained their strong scores. ING ranks in the top-three in another four markets: the Netherlands and Luxembourg (ranked second) and Italy and Turkey (ranked third).\n\n## Closing of Retail businesses\n\nIn 2022, ING took the decision to close its Retail Banking operations in the Philippines. We concluded that the time to achieve the desired scale was too long and we decided to concentrate on our core markets. ING started its Retail Banking operations in late 2018 and retains a Shared Service Hub and Wholesale Banking presence in the country. In 2021, ING announced it would leave the Retail Banking market in France following a strategic review. In 2022, ING and Boursorama (a subsidiary of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale) signed an agreement to offer services to ING customers in France. The contract allowed ING customers to join Boursorama and benefit from a simplified account opening process and exclusive offers. The agreement also includes the transfer to Boursorama of 'assurance-vie' (investment products) contracts, for which ING acts as a broker with Generali Vie. Home loans and consumer loans were not included in the agreement.\n\n## Business Banking\n\nBusiness Banking is set up as a third pillar within ING Group and is a part of Retail Banking. While definitions can differ slightly per country, we've defined three customer segments using the following global framework:\n\nSelf-employed and micro companies: Independent professionals or small companies that employ up to 10 people and have a turnover up to one million euros.\n\nSMEs: Small to medium-sized companies that employ between 10 and 250 people and have a turnover between one and 10 million euros.\n\nMid-corporates: Sophisticated larger companies employing more than 250 employees with a turnover of between 10 million and 250 million euros.\n\nBusiness Banking serves 1.7 million customers and generates \u20ac3 billion in revenue across seven markets: the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Turkey and Germany. Customers want to manage and grow their businesses in a constantly changing and increasingly complex world. Our aim is to empower them by providing all their financial solutions in one place and offering the right insights, products and services at the right time, to create an personal, easy, relevant and instant experience.\n\nWe apply a needs-based customer segmentation approach that differentiates between basic and more complex (specific) needs. This enables customers to 'self-serve' using our strong digital foundation, but also access remote and face-to-face advice, when needed. With digitalisation at the core of our strategy and to meet increased demand for digital solutions and self-service, our ambition is to serve over 80 percent of SMEs digitally. We focus our efforts on the most important interactions: KYC outreach for customer due diligence, onboarding, account opening and loan or card requests.\n\nFor example, in Germany, we launched our second lending product, Flexkredit, where Amazon sellers can easily make their loan application from the Amazon Marketplace seller portal (Seller Central). The disbursement and management of the product is via their online banking, Business Banking Home. If eligible, an offer is available within 48 hours. In Belgium, we offer customers, based on their financial situation, instant business credit within minutes, which is available the next working day. We inform them about this offer in our mobile banking app and on internet banking, including personalised eligibility and maximum credit availability details. For Polish customers, we have created a product offer page within their online banking listing products and services tailored to individual customer needs. Product recommendations for each customer can be directly acquired online.\n\nAs well as providing improved customer experiences through digitalisation and personalisation, we are putting sustainability at the heart of what we do with our efforts on climate action and financial health. We help customers to future-proof their businesses by offering sustainable financing alternatives. For example, we offer sustainable finance alternatives (loans and/or lease) for SMEs and mid-corporates in most Business Banking countries where we operate (the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Romania, Turkey and Luxembourg).\n\n## Wholesale Banking\n\nIn Wholesale Banking, we aim to empower clients by partnering with them to offer relevant financial solutions to their business needs across their value chains, and to support them through the 'ING difference', three major characteristics that offer particular value to clients:",

        "page_content": "- > Superior customer experience\n- 1. Our global reach, with local experts: no matter where clients are, our network of experts offer them a seamless local experience with a global view.\n- 2. We're sector experts: clients trust us to provide tailored solutions to meet their needs.\n- 3. We're sustainability pioneers: we're not just leaders in sustainable finance, we work hand-in-hand with clients to address some of the most pressing issues in the world today.\n\nWe're driving growth by making the most of our strengths and broadening our value proposition to clients, while optimising our use of capital and enhancing financial performance. This is highlighted in deals such as that with GlobalConnect, a Nordic technology media and telecom (TMT) company. After ING co-advised on a sustainability-linked loan structure in 2021, GlobalConnect enhanced its sustainability strategy on ING's recommendations and ING ultimately supported them by securing the sole sustainability coordinator role on both their \u20ac2.7 billion existing and \u20ac1 billion incremental financing rounds. The ING difference is reflected in partnership initiatives such as leveraging ING's sector knowledge to lead a working group to design a climate-aligned finance agreement for steel. In 2022, we were proud to be one of six banks to sign up to the Sustainable STEEL Principles, which aims to help banks measure and report emissions associated with their steel loan portfolios compared to net-zero emissions pathways. Read more in the 'Sustainability at the heart' chapter.\n\nIn 2022, at the Global Finance magazine Sustainable Finance Awards ING won the global award for Outstanding Leadership in Sustainable Bonds for the second year running and the Sustainable Project Finance award for Western Europe. Our client segmentation model aligns our strengths with client needs and is an important element for deepening relationships. ING's way of working allows us to respond rapidly to our clients' changing needs and to close the gap between local and global specialists, making an impact in our markets.\n\nDuring the year, we continued to combine our sector knowledge and financial expertise to support companies with tailored advisory and daily banking, in line with the client segmentation model. We aim to provide relevant advice, data-driven insights and customised, integrated solutions that make our clients day-to-day banking more efficient and support their business ambitions. Corporate clients also benefit from gains in speed, transparency, security and efficiency created by technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence.\n\n## Measuring Wholesale Banking NPS\n\nA relationship NPS programme ran in 32 WB markets throughout 2022, it concerns a qualitative measure of the client experience and the quality of the relationship and how likely clients are to recommend ING. The score is calculated as the difference between the percentage of promoters (who rate ING as 9 or 10 out of 10) and detractors (those scoring ING below 6). In 2022, ING's relationship NPS score rose to an all-time high of 67 (on a scale of -100 to +100), from +59 in 2021, an increase of 13.5%. Increases were prevalent in most of the sectors and regions. The response rate increased to 71% from 62%.\n\n## Finding new ways to help customers stay a step ahead\n\nING has always prided itself on its innovative culture and considers this an important contributor to a superior customer experience. To keep surprising customers in a fast-moving competitive environment, we need to keep finding fresh ways to translate emerging trends and technologies into new business opportunities.  In 2022, we announced a move to bring innovation closer to our Retail, Business Banking and Wholesale Banking business lines to create more impact for our innovation efforts. For incremental-type innovations that support our strategic priorities of CX and sustainability, such as digitalising processes, we believe this is better done within individual business lines where we are closer to the customer. Innovation projects like CoorpID and Blacksmith, for instance, continue under Wholesale Banking's leadership.\n\nIn 2022, ING invested and partnered financial technology (fintech) companies via its venture capital arm, ING Ventures. One such investment was in SeMI Technologies, offering AI-powered search engine software to companies who want to make better use of their data. Other investments include Vault (cloud-based core banking technology), OpenFin (unified workspace solution for financial institutions) and Sardine (safer, faster payments). ING in Belgium also collaborated with Flowcast, an early warning system to predict when retail customers might go into financial distress.\n\nING announced in 2022 that it would phase out Yolt's business-to-business open banking operations following an evaluation that it was not feasible to achieve the preferred scale in their market within a reasonable time frame. The announcement followed the closure in 2021 of Yolt's personal finance management app. The phase-out process is expected to be completed in 2023.",

        "page_content": "- > Sustainability at the heart\n\n## Sustainability at the heart\n\nSustainability is at the heart of what we do because we believe we have a role in defining new ways of doing business that aligns economic growth with positive social and environmental impact. This includes aiming to bring our own operations in line with a low-carbon future and respecting and advancing human rights. As a global bank we can also have a positive impact, not just by mitigating harm, but by bringing aspects of climate change, biodiversity and human rights into our financing decisions and client dialogues.\n\nING takes a holistic approach to sustainability, with climate change mitigation, climate adaptation, climate and environmental risk, biodiversity, human rights, financial health, business ethics and other ESG issues all in scope.\n\nAs well as aiming to be a pioneer in defining new ways of doing business, ING wants to be a leader in building a sustainable future for customers, the environment and our company. How? By focusing on:\n\nClimate action: We lead by example by striving for net zero in our own operations. Collaboration: We work with clients to achieve their own sustainability goals, increasing our impact through partnerships and coalition-building.\n\nManaging climate-related, environmental and social risk: We manage the most relevant environmental and social risks while fostering the protection of biodiversity and human rights across all of our relationships. Financial health and inclusion: We're working to advance financial health and inclusion for customers and communities.\n\nEmpowering colleagues: We empower colleagues to contribute to it all.\n\nING's sustainability efforts were recognised externally. In 2022, Sustainalytics assessed our management of environmental, social and governance (ESG) material risk again as 'strong' while investment research firm MSCI awarded ING an AA ESG rating for the third consecutive year. S&P rated our ESG practices for the second year in a row as 'strong'.\n\nWhile we are committed to doing our part, we know that the world's problems cannot be solved by one sector, much less by one bank. We look to governments, for example, to direct and guide the change needed to reach net zero by 2050. We believe that an inclusive approach is the only way we can make any meaningful positive impact. From climate to human rights and financial health, we seek to increase our impact through partnerships and coalition-building.\n\n## Climate action\n\nWe have defined four climate action objectives: to reach net zero in our own operations, to steer the most carbon-intensive parts of our portfolio towards net zero by 2050 or sooner, to finance and advise specific clients in line with a net-zero economy and to manage climate and environmental risks. In 2022, we published our second integrated climate report, which can be found on ing.com. We have now published four overall climate reports.\n\n## Aiming for net zero in our own operations\n\nWe aim to bring our business in line with the net-zero economy of the future and use our Environmental Programme to steer our progress towards this. Adjusting to the post-pandemic 'new normal', we have set a new mid-term target for 2025 to reduce our CO2e emissions by 75 percent compared to our 2014 baseline, for  emissions  from  scope  1,  scope  2,  and  business  travel  scope  3.  In  2022,  we  reduced  emissions  by  72 percent  from  2014,  to  29  kilotonnes  -  28  percent  of  where  we  were  in  2014.  In  2021  the  figure  was  26 kilotonnes where our operations were heavily impacted by Covid-19-related restrictions.\n\nFollowing migration to a new data platform, we conducted a historical review of our carbon-related data. In doing  so,  we  made  corrections  to  previously  reported  datapoints,  corrected  our  coverage  statistics  for extrapolation  where  those  were  incorrectly  applied,  and  improved  our  methodology  by  applying  more granular emission factors for our use of district heating. Comparative figures and baseline year data were updated to reflect these improvements. Read more in the technical appendix to this report.\n\nWe previously shared a scope 1 and scope 2 mid-term target of a 90 percent reduction by 2030. We plan to review this and publish a combined 2030 target for scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 for business travel. Scope 1 covers our direct, controlled emissions from natural gas and heating oils, scope 2 covers our indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy i.e. electricity and district heating, and scope 3 currently covers emissions in our value chain from business travel (air and car). We intend to review our scope 3 reporting to include new emission categories. As we conduct the review, we will likely set a new baseline year for our reporting.",

        "page_content": "Introduction\n\nRisk management\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n- > Sustainability at the heart\n\n## ING buildings\n\nFor building emissions, we are committed to improving energy efficiency and reducing our emissions from heating systems. In 2022, we completed a net-zero assessment on major buildings, which will form the basis of our approach going forward.\n\nSince 2014, ING has increased the percentage of renewable electricity sourced for our operations. In 2022, we further aligned with the reporting guidance of the RE100, a technical group that sets industry standards around corporate use of renewable electricity. We assessed that our renewable electricity sourcing in 2022 was 99.2 percent aligned with RE100's market boundary criteria. The remaining 0.8 percent was not in alignment due to difficulties in purchasing renewable electricity in Russia, Ukraine, South Korea and Kazakhstan. For these markets, in addition to reporting CO2 emissions for electricity used, we sourced renewable Energy Attribute Certificates in neighbouring markets to support an in-sector reduction in line with the amount of electricity used. In 2020, 99.7 percent was aligned with the RE100 market boundary criteria; in 2021 that was 99.2 percent. We acknowledge that over time we should move towards more onsite renewables and direct purchasing agreements from local renewable projects. Read more about our renewable electricity sourcing types in the technical appendix to this report.\n\nThe Environmental Programme also covers targets to reduce our water consumption and residual waste. In 2022, we decreased our residual waste by 48 percent compared to 2014. In 2022, we decreased our water consumption by 49 percent compared to 2014.\n\n## Business travel\n\nIn 2022 we launched a Green Travel Budget Programme to make employees aware of the CO2e impact of their travel choices and encourage them to find greener options. We also updated global travel procedures to restrict most air travel on short-haul distances where high-speed rail options exist as alternatives. This includes travel between Amsterdam, Brussels, London and Frankfurt.\n\nNext to efforts to reduce air travel, in 2022 we also started procuring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and SAF certificates from our partners at Air France-KLM, Lufthansa Group, Neste and SkyNRG. Although we still report the emissions resulting from our flights the SAF and SAF certificates we purchased supported an insector reduction of approximately 3.2 kilotonnes of CO2e emissions. In addition, we entered into a partnership with Singapore Airlines as part of our sourcing approach for 2023.\n\nTo limit the impact of car travel, we continued to electrify our fleet of leased cars. In 2022, ING in Belgium and the Netherlands announced that only fully electric vehicles (EVs) would be available in its range of new lease cars. Together, Belgium and the Netherlands represent 72 percent of our lease cars. Globally, we have an ambition to reach at least 90 percent EVs in our fleet by 2030. This ambition requires countries like the\n\nNetherlands and Belgium to reach 100 percent earlier, while accounting for EV infrastructure challenges in other countries.\n\n## Empowering clients on their road to net zero\n\nIn line with our objective to steer the most carbon-intensive parts of our portfolio towards net zero by 2050 or sooner, through our Terra approach, in 2021 we joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. This allows us to use our experience and knowledge to help standardise the way banks measure their alignment with climate goals and to base our approach on the most recent developments in each sector. We are convinced that all banks benefit from having an industry-wide standard for measuring the effectiveness and impact of their efforts as well as increasing transparency. We continue to collaborate with others to develop roadmaps and methodologies, including for hard-to-abate sectors.\n\n## Supporting the energy transition\n\nWhile we engage with different stakeholders in our ambition to help create a low-carbon society, we believe that financial support for the energy transition could play the largest part in realising this ambition. Today, around 80 percent 1 of the global energy mix is fossil-fuel based. Reducing that figure is vital in reaching society's net-zero emissions targets. Our approach to financing the energy sector balances three main societal interests: the need to decarbonise to fight climate change, the need for energy to remain accessible and affordable for people and companies, and the need for security of the energy supply.\n\nUltimately, building enough new renewable and low-carbon sources of energy will remove the need for fossil fuels and ING strongly supports the objective of this transition. However, fossil fuels currently play an important role in the global energy mix, considering the current availability of renewable and low-carbon sources, and the need to fulfil other, social, sustainable development goals. The global economy's reliance on fossil fuels, in particular a phase-out of coal for power generation, must reduce to significantly lower levels over the next 10 to 15 years, according to the energy transition pathway set out in the International Energy Agency's Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE 2050) Scenario.\n\nIn recent years, ING has stepped up its support for the energy transition to a low-carbon economy. In 2017, ING set a goal to restrict our financing of coal-fired power generation to close to zero by 2025. So far, we have decreased lending to individual coal-fired power plants by over 80 percent to \u20ac83 million.\n\nWith our commitment to develop the Terra approach in 2018, ING set out to develop methodologies and science-based targets to enable steering of the most emissions-intensive parts of our loan book in line with the emissions levels required to meet the Paris Agreement goals. Methodologies and targets for power generation and upstream oil and gas portfolio alignment were set out in the 2019 and 2020 Terra progress reports respectively. ING's 2022 Climate Report shows how interim and long-term targets for these activities",

Our announcement included the aim of growing new commitments in this area by 50 percent by the end of 2025 for Wholesale Banking clients, compared to the baseline year of 2021. We also committed to end the provision of dedicated upstream finance to new oil and gas fields approved for development after 31 December 2021.\n\nOur power generation portfolio follows the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which links power generation to the categories shown below. All relevant NAICS codes have been selected to derive the O/S (outstandings) per category.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhasing out coal, reducing oil and gas combustion and increasing renewable and low-carbon energy sources will not on their own solve the challenge of achieving a net-zero emissions world by 2050. Recognising that technology and new market developments are essential drivers of the energy transition, ING has established cross-sector and multi-disciplinary centres of expertise to support client investment in new energy systems. One important area is batteries, which address the inherent intermittency of renewable energy resources like wind and solar, as well as providing grid stabilisation services. We are also looking at other energy storage mediums like hydrogen, which have additional applications such as alternative fuel for transport and for energy-intensive industry. Finally, we are closely following the evolution of large-scale carbon-capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) which will be essential where fossil fuels are required in industrial processes that are needed for the global economy and for which there is currently no alternative.",

These are power generation, upstream oil and gas, automotive, shipping, aviation, steel, cement, residential mortgages and commercial real estate. Within Terra, we apply what we consider to be  the bestfit methodology per sector, (our 'toolbox approach'), to measure and steer our loan book.\n\nIn 2022, to promote immediate action towards decarbonisation and to adhere to our Net-Zero Banking Alliance commitment, we set intermediate 2030 targets for all Terra sectors. Of the nine intermediate targets, eight are aligned with net-zero scenarios. A net-zero target for shipping will be set as soon as one is adopted under the Poseidon Principles, a financial industry framework for assessing climate alignment for the shipping sector. At the end of 2021, five of the nine sectors were on track with their respective climatealignment pathways: power generation, upstream oil and gas, commercial real estate, automotive, and shipping. Two sectors, cement and residential real estate, were within five percent of their pathway, while steel was just above five percent of its pathway. Aviation came out well above the pathway due to the extraordinary impact that Covid-19 had on the sector, although it is beginning to trend back to its decarbonisation pathway as the sector recovers. Our 2023 Climate Report will include updated performance figures.\n\nIn 2022, building on other sector-specific working groups like the Poseidon Principles, ING launched the Sustainable STEEL Principles, a solution for measuring and disclosing the 1.5 degree alignment of steel lending portfolios. This was developed with other banks and facilitated by the Rocky Mountain Institute's Center for Climate-Aligned Finance. The sector emits roughly seven percent of global CO2 emissions and is heavily dependent on coal. Chaired by ING, the principles provide a pathway to net-zero steelmaking by 2050 and have been incorporated into our Terra approach. ING started a similar initiative in the aluminium sector.\n\nDetailed information on ING's transition plans are available in our integrated climate report on ing.com.\n\nThe process for reporting on Terra consists of several steps, most of them carried out by ING's Global Sustainability department in collaboration with colleagues in the front office. Internal data relating to our portfolio composition is made available soon after ING's year-end close in February. External data relating to climate performances is collected in or around April. External data is checked for consistency and matched with internal data. A year-on-year portfolio comparison is made to analyse fluctuations at company or asset level for each sector. This helps us to understand the drivers behind any changes, which can usually be attributed to the climate performance of clients, the composition of sector portfolios and improvements in methodologies. When necessary, scenarios and targets are updated in line with scientific updates to the decarbonisation pathways aimed at keeping global temperature rises within the necessary limits for a sustainable future.\n\nOnce the process is complete, we draft a progress report, which is incorporated into our integrated climate report. The report, approved at Board level, was published in September 2022. All progress reported in 2022 relates to 2021. Reporting on progress in the shipping sector is linked to, and aligned with, the Poseidon Principles timelines. A Poseidon Principles report containing 2021 data was published in December 2022.\n\n## Sustainable finance for Wholesale Banking clients\n\nAdvancing financing opportunities in line with a net-zero economy for Wholesale Banking clients is a strategic ambition, and by 2025 we aim to channel \u20ac125 billion annually to sustainable finance solutions. The Sustainable Finance team advises clients on translating their sustainability ambitions into their financing through sustainability-linked structures, green and social financing solutions, ESG rating advice, and other ESG advice.\n\nIn 2022, the Sustainable Finance team mobilised \u20ac101 billion, supported by a broad range of financial products linked to sustainability elements. Most of these were related to sustainability-linked loans (\u20ac39 billion), green bonds (\u20ac23 billion) and green loans (\u20ac17 billion). However, we believe that alongside volume, it is also the impact that measures the success of sustainable transactions. This, we believe, is shown in the additional products and services we develop for customers such as social loans and bonds, sustainable structured finance, sustainability-linked Schuldscheine and sustainable transaction services such as guarantees and supply chain finance.\n\nThe commitment to mobilise \u20ac125 billion annually makes a distinction between transactions where we are ESG lead, such as ESG coordinator or an ESG structuring role, and transactions where we do not fulfil such a position, like where we are part of a consortium of banks. Where we are one of several ESG leads or one of several participants, we record the pro-rata share of the total transaction amount, however, when we are the sole ESG lead on a transaction, we count the full transaction amount. For bonds, we make a distinction between active and passive bookrunner role. The reason for selecting this methodology is that if we are ESG lead in a transaction, we can pro-actively engage with our clients on their sustainability strategy, so our impact is more significant than if we only participate. See ing.com for more information about the methodology.\n\nMoreover, we closed 491 sustainability deals (including sustainability loans and bonds, green loans and bonds, sustainable structured finance, social loans and bonds, and sustainable investments) at year end, up from 411 in 2021.\n\n## Green and social financing structures\n\nWe aim to accelerate the green economy by growing our green asset portfolio. Green financing solutions such as green bonds and loans form an integral part of that. For instance, we acted as sole green loan structurer in the construction of a transmission line for Champlain Hudson Power Express, ultimately owned by Blackstone; overall project costs were around USD 6 billion. The 545 km, fully buried transmission line",

The project is expected to be finalised in the first half of 2026. This is the largest volume mobilised for a green loan closed by ING to date.\n\nOur sustainability efforts are also directed towards addressing social challenges. For example, ING acted as joint lead manager, joint bookrunner and joint social structuring adviser for Singapore-based healthcare real estate investment trust First REIT's SGD100 million social bond. This issuance, guaranteed by a trust fund of the Asian Development Bank, became Singapore's first-ever healthcare social bond and was awarded Best Social Bond in The Asset Triple A Country Awards for Sustainable Finance. We also acted as lead arranger, sustainability adviser and majority investor for Woori Card's Social Asset Backed Securities, valued at around \u20ac195 million. The transaction won the Best Sustainability Securitisation in The Asset Triple A Country (South Korea) Award for Sustainable Finance 2022.\n\n## Sustainability-linked structures\n\nWe incentivise clients who are shifting to more sustainable business models. Sustainability-linked loans (SLLs) link interest margins to a company's sustainability performance through mutually agreed KPIs. They are a way for ING to support, motivate and reward clients in their aim to become more sustainable. In 2017, ING coordinated the first syndicated sustainability-linked loan in the market for Philips. This loan was linked to the improvement of Philips' Sustainalytics ESG rating. In 2022, ING was the sustainability coordinator for turning this loan into a sustainability KPI-linked loan, with KPIs aligned to Philips' sustainability goals.\n\nSince then, the popularity of SLLs has grown, as sustainability has played an increasingly significant role in corporate agendas. To date, syndicated SLLs valued at more than \u20ac1,000 billion 2 have entered the market. ING closed 202 sustainability-linked loan transactions in 2022, compared to 147 in 2021. For US-based Compass Datacenters for example, ING structured a USD1.25 billion SLL with KPIs linked to environmental and social targets such as the reduction of energy and water consumption, female representation in the construction workforce and the use of low-carbon concrete. ING also structured an SLL for Compass Datacenters in Europe.\n\nTo enable all market participants to clearly understand the characteristics of these loans, ING was part of a financial institutions working party that established a set of sustainability-linked loan principles (SLLPs). These are based around five components: the selection of KPIs, the calibration of sustainability performance targets (SPTs), loan characteristics, reporting and verification. SLL spin-offs include sustainability swaps, derivatives and sustainability-linked bonds that are related to the total sustainability profile of a company, not just for individual projects.\n\nWe also look for other ways to support clients taking steps to achieve their sustainability ambitions and anticipate the future economy. Many of these ambitions are based on innovative technologies, business\n\nmodels or client propositions that have a higher risk profile and are not yet suitable for standard financing solutions. ING Sustainable Investments helps clients with their sustainability goals by providing risk-bearing capital, offering a wide range of tailor-made financial solutions, including equity (investments) and subordinated debt.\n\nIn 2022, we invested in UK-based Econic Technologies, which develops and licenses proprietary catalyst technology that uses CO2 as a building block in manufacturing, reducing the carbon footprint of widely used day-to-day products. In addition, a consortium-led investment supported Singapore-based insect protein producer Nutrition Technologies to expand production, launch new products and create strategic partnerships. Transforming agricultural waste streams into insect-based feed products and fertiliser enables a more circular economy, while at the same time also helping reach emissions-reduction targets and improve food security.\n\nIn April 2022, the Dutch National Growth Fund provided a subsidy of \u20ac50 million to Zero Emissions Services (ZES), of which ING is a founding partner, to accelerate the introduction of docking stations, ship modifications and battery containers (ZESpacks), all of which will contribute to the electrification of inland vessels and a transition to net zero. ING has also become a shareholder in EIT InnoEnergy, the European innovation engine for sustainable energy that supports start-ups and commercially attractive technologies, and provides education. EIT InnoEnergy is supported by the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union.\n\nThe Sustainable Structured Finance team supports clients by functioning as a laboratory for new sustainable technologies and business models in need of financing within the EMEA region. The team is involved in the origination, structuring and execution of structured finance transactions, with an emphasis on the circular economy, bio-chemicals, waste and water or any other project supporting sustainable development. The team also provides financing solutions to smaller-scale renewable energy projects in the Netherlands, such as 'ZonnepanelenDelen', a solar financing platform that offers non-recourse project finance of between \u20ac200,000 and \u20ac5 million to solar power projects undertaken by SMEs and project developers.\n\nWe also led a consortium of Dutch financial institutions in the construction of technology company Avantium's FDCA factory in Delfzijl, the Netherlands. This will be the first commercial FDCA factory in the world. FDCA is the key building block for the 100 percent plant-based, recyclable polymer PEF, a non-fossilfuel-based alternative for PET.\n\n## ESG Advisory\n\nBesides financial support, we help clients navigate the rapidly changing regulatory landscape and advise on their net-zero strategy. Clients benefit from our deep and broad experience built up over the years helping",

Some clients are ahead of the curve and for them we frequently act as a sounding board, alongside our financing-related role. Other clients are at the early stages of their sustainability journey. For them, we provide guidance based on our market experience and suggest areas where they can make impact to become aligned with climate pathways and their peers. Through teaming up with the relevant capital structuring and advisory departments, we also advise corporates on financing ESG-related corporates' CAPEX and M&A transactions (selling non-sustainable assets or buying sustainable assets).\n\n## Green bond framework\n\nTo support the strong growth of our sustainable finance portfolio, and to meet green funding needs, ING issues green bonds, supported by our green bond framework. The framework aligns with the International Capital Market Association's (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (GBP). We intend to allocate the proceeds of our green bonds to an Eligible Green Loan Portfolio of new and existing loans including renewable energy projects and green buildings. Other categories are clean transportation, pollution prevention and control, and sustainable water management.\n\nUnder this framework, ING Group and its subsidiaries can issue any debt security (such as senior bonds, subordinated bonds, covered bonds, commercial papers and medium-term notes) to finance and refinance assets and projects which contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and our own sustainability. ING established its sustainable debt strategy via the publication of the framework. Since then, we have continued to take steps to enhance our sustainable debt strategy and see it as an important tool in supporting the growth of our own sustainable finance portfolio.\n\nIn alignment with the ICMA's 2021 GBPs, the framework is presented through four pillars: use of proceeds, process for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. The framework also follows the recommendations of the Green Bond Principles regarding external review.\n\n## Product offerings for Retail and Business Banking customers\n\nAs a retail bank, we aim to help customers transition to a low-carbon environment. While we have provided sustainability products and services in Retail Banking since 2017, we have since introduced many more sustainable banking products across our markets, following a sustainable alternative products roadmap, to facilitate this transition. It is our aim to have sustainable alternatives for our main retail products in all markets by 2025.\n\nIn 2022, we adopted a net-zero scenario for the residential real-estate sector, replacing the beyond twodegree Celsius scenario previously used. The new scenario is guided by the EU's Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) 1.5-degree Celsius scenario, a tool that enables the alignment of real estate portfolios against decarbonisation pathways. We use this tool for the six markets in scope. Our scenario is also directed by data for residential real estate derived from the International Energy Agency's global net-zero\n\nscenarios. In the new scenario, houses in our portfolio across these markets need to reach an average energy efficiency of 0.6 kg CO2/m2 by 2050, which is more ambitious than the previous 2.6 kg CO2/m2. By 2030, they need to reach an average energy efficiency of 19.7 kg CO2/m2. The scenario currently applies to five of the six markets in scope: the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Spain and Australia. Belgium is excluded from the target until the issue of data comparability with other markets can be solved.\n\nIn support of this ambition, in 2022 we further rolled out sustainable mortgage products, which stimulate more energy-efficient homes. Sustainable mortgages are part of our sustainable lending approach that we consider EU Taxonomy-eligible. After being introduced in Poland in 2021, sustainable mortgages are now also available in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Romania. We also offer sustainable consumer loans, with discounts related to the purpose of the loan, in Belgium, Romania, Poland, Turkey and Luxembourg. These loans can be used for housing, to improve the energy efficiency of homes, and for other activities such as purchasing sustainable mobility options.\n\nIn addition to lending products, we continue to provide customers with a range of tools and platforms that can support them in their renovation efforts. These include the homeQgo platform in the Netherlands, as well as a renovation calculator tool that ING makes available to customers in Germany in partnership with KfW bank. For more information on our sustainable housing approach, see our 2022 Climate Report on ing.com.\n\nIn 2022, we also launched a carbon footprint calculator in our Dutch app that enables customers to view spending-related CO2 emissions in their bank statements. The calculator is live for 500,000 customers. In the Netherlands, Romania and Turkey, we also provide customers with renewable, recyclable or virtual bank cards, which help lower the impact of our banking products on plastic waste.\n\nWe are also helping Business Banking customers make their businesses future-proof by offering sustainable financing alternatives. We now offer sustainable finance alternatives (loans and/or lease) for SMEs and midsized corporates in most of the countries where we operate. We aim to reach \u20ac1 billion new production of sustainable financing annually in the Netherlands in 2025.\n\nIn 2022, we brought four new loans to market, bringing our total offering of loans supporting customers with sustainable activities to nine. In Poland, a sustainability improvement loan was launched after a pilot in the Netherlands. Similar to its Wholesale Banking counterpart, this type of loan incentivises business customers to reduce their environmental impact by improving their sustainability scores and ratings and reducing their CO2 emissions.\n\nSustainability loans were launched in both Romania and Turkey. In Romania, we implemented a framework to identify and customise sustainable transactions for customers. As a result, ING in Romania granted its first sustainable credit for entrepreneurs, financing renewable energy and circular economy projects. One of the most notable examples is a sustainable loan granted to Promateris, manufacturers of sustainable",

The new facilities will produce biodegradable and compostable raw materials with applications in the packaging, food service and waste management sectors.\n\nNext to our financing alternatives, we also supported Business Banking customers with a range of tools to support their sustainability journeys. In our real-estate financing business in Netherlands, we continued to offer access to an ESG improvement platform.\n\n## Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the investment funds at ING following the disclosures according to Article 8 or 9 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) accounted for 51 percent of total client assets (assets under management and/or custody) in funds distributed in EU markets. These funds were purchased by our customers in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Spain, Romania, Poland and Italy.\n\nING is undertaking many efforts to create transparency and facilitate the transition of products using the SFDR framework. For example, during 2022, ING Netherlands adapted a Discretionary Portfolio Management (DPM) strategy to be in line with Article 8 disclosure requirements. With this adaption, all four standard DPM strategies available in the Netherlands are in line with Article 8, representing DPM products promoting, among other characteristics, environmental or social characteristics, or a combination of those. In addition, in Belgium, we brought three of our ING flagship funds in line with Article 8.\n\nWe disclose the ratio of client assets in SFDR Article 8 and 9 funds of total client assets in funds, to provide insights and transparency into our clients' portfolios. According to SFDR, Article 8 refers to a fund promoting, among other characteristics, environmental or social characteristics, or a combination of those. Article 9, according to SFDR, refers to funds with sustainable investment, or a reduction in carbon emissions, as its objective. For funds managed by third party asset managers, we rely on information provided by them, with no further review of the classification by ING.\n\nEssentially, SFDR is a disclosure regulation and does not yet reflect a level of sustainability of funds. Leveraging on extensive data points provided through SFDR as well as complementary analyses, ING continues to develop methodologies to present customers with an even more insightful and transparent view on their investments, while monitoring the regulatory developments including the supervisory authorities' guidance. Eventually, it is through collaboration with asset managers, distributors, regulators, and investee companies that we can achieve a transparent market standard for our retail customers.\n\n## Sustainable investing services\n\nING is a signatory to the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment and as a provider of investor services to our Retail Banking customers we are committed to incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into investment decisions, policies and processes that underpin these services.\n\nWe have been reporting on sustainable investing services (SIS) for a decade. Over the past two years, new regulations and definitions of sustainable investing have been introduced, such as the EU Taxonomy and the Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). For this year, the reported numbers continue to be derived from our own internal ING methodology. Our SIS are provided based on a methodology that has been developed by ING to assess different kinds of investment instruments, from company-level equity to funds and portfolios, using a diverse set of ESG criteria.\n\nDuring 2022, ING's SIS applied to our biggest sustainable investment markets: the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany, with total sustainable investments valued at \u20ac14.6 billion, down from \u20ac15.7 billion in 2021. The drop was influenced by the overall market performance of equities and bonds, which decreased by 12 percent on average. Sustainable portfolios averaged a 15 percent decrease due to the absence of high-performing sectors such as oil and defence. However, \u20ac1.6 billion was added to the value of sustainable investments in 2022 as one of the four main investment strategies in the Netherlands took a more sustainable approach.\n\nBelgium narrowed its scope on sustainable investment services, excluding the exposure on sustainable funds that are invested via funds of funds unless those assets represented over 85 percent of the funds of funds portfolio. As a result, numbers for 2021 and 2020 were updated for 2021 from \u20ac19.2 billion to \u20ac15.7 billion, and for 2020 from \u20ac13.2 billion to \u20ac11.2 billion. Our services cover all asset classes including dedicated portfolios, investment funds and structured products, available in brokerage, advisory and discretionary management propositions. Read more about our sustainable investment services on ing.com.\n\nFor investment funds, we apply quantitative and qualitative screening. The quantitative screen is conducted to understand the ESG profile of the asset and the fund manager. It covers nine ESG categories across policies, selection methodology and governance. The qualitative screen consists of an interview with the fund manager focused on their assessment and ESG approach. In a final step, we validate the fund's investments against our sustainable investing criteria. This approach applies to funds from active managers, but also to structured products or index funds. We understand that the policies of external investment funds will not fully align with the ING policy, preference is given to investment funds whose sustainability policy is most in line with that of ING.\n\nWithin discretionary management propositions, we also perform a company-level analysis, which integrates both positive and negative ESG screening. Positive screening is based on a company score that incorporates the company's ESG risk management, the evolution of that risk and the management of adverse impacts on society and the environment by the company. We invest only in companies that belong to the top 70 percent in their sector, when it comes to ESG performance. Applying negative screening means that we exclude companies with severe negative corporate conduct. We also exclude companies whose revenues from products or services that have a negative environmental or societal impact are higher than five percent (for production) or 10 percent (for distribution). Excluded companies operate in the following sectors: alcohol, coal, controversial weapons, fur, gambling, non-conventional gas, oil, tobacco,",

We aim to follow this same screening process for international financial institutions and semisovereigns.\n\nOur sovereign-level analysis integrates several sustainability factors such as social issues, environmental performance, corruption, endorsement of international treaties and the adverse impacts of these sovereigns on environment and society. By combining best-in-class scores with minimum requirements, we define the eligibility of a sovereign for our sustainable investment portfolios. More detailed information on the screening process can be found on ing.com.\n\nAs regulations and market standards constantly evolve, ING is investigating various ways of categorising and reporting on SIS and we are monitoring regulatory developments. We believe that transparency, uniformity and collaboration are needed from all market participants, to create a meaningful reporting standard for customers, which can easily be benchmarked against other investments.\n\n## Integration of the EU Taxonomy regulation\n\nThe European Commission introduced the EU Taxonomy in 2021 as part of the Green Deal strategy and the Commission's action plan on financing sustainable growth. With six environmental objectives, the Taxonomy aims to channel capital flows to support the transition, help generate sustainable and inclusive growth and prevent greenwashing. In 2022, we started reporting within the EU Taxonomy framework over the financial year of 2021. An update on the 2022 financial can be found under 'Environmental, social and governance risk' in the 'Risk management' section of this report.\n\nING sees the EU Taxonomy as an opportunity to re-evaluate balance sheet assets and increase transparency on environmentally sustainable products with the aim of reaching the Paris agreement's target of net zero by 2050. The strategic priority, 'Putting sustainability at the heart of what we do' further emphasises our own sustainability ambitions and we strive to continuously integrate regulatory measures with these ambitions. It is important to recognise that our own efforts such as the Terra approach and our sustainable finance products and services differ in scope from the EU Taxonomy. We believe that both approaches need to be harmonised in the future.\n\nIn 2022, we categorised our lending efforts to corporate clients in different product categories. Before financing clients, we assess them on environmental and social risk criteria as defined by our own risk appetite statement. Our work with specific clients is based on the opportunity to develop tailored sustainable products with them, such as sustainability-linked loans with company-specific KPIs.\n\nWe continuously explore new ways to support clients in a sustainable way and align with the principles of the Loan Market Association, the ICMA for green, social and sustainability-linked financial products and the EU Taxonomy. We also proactively inform clients about aligning their business activities with the Taxonomy and have started to incorporate published technical screening criteria into our loan assessment processes.\n\n## Collaboration\n\nNo one sector, much less one bank, has the ability to solve the world's problems. We believe that an inclusive approach is the only way we can make any meaningful positive impact. From climate to human rights and financial health, we seek to increase our sustainability impact through partnerships and coalitionbuilding.\n\nIn 2022, alongside ongoing involvements with, for example, the 2 degree Investing Initiative, the UN-led Collective Commitment to Climate Action and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, we collaborated with peer banks under the UNEP-FI Principles of Responsible Banking alliance, co-leading a working group that developed a set of standard indicators for financial health and financial inclusion for banks.\n\nFollowing this, we started piloting the application of some of these indicators in the Netherlands, Spain and Romania. In the Netherlands, this included starting a context assessment and a baseline analysis on several of the indicators. Through these pilots, we aim to improve our customer segmentation and targeting of financial health actions. More information about our progress towards the PRB Commitment to Financial Health and Inclusion can be found on ing.com.\n\nDutch collaborations in the area of financial health also continued with Queen M\u00e1xima's work as UN ambassador for Inclusive Finance for Development, the debt prevention organisation Schuldhulproute, the Financial Health Index and the National Coalition for Financial Health, launched in 2022.\n\nThis report is also aligned with requirements from UNEP's FI Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB). A self assessment disclosure on PRB can be found in the technical appendix of this report. Selected sections of our 2022 PRB reporting and self-assessment have been assured by ERM CVS, an assurance provider, to a limited level of assurance. Full details of the scope, activities, limitations and conclusions of ERM CVS' assurance are included in the Assurance Statement, at the end of the technical appendix.\n\n## Managing climate-related, environmental and social risk\n\nAssessing and managing the risks associated with a transition to net zero is critical. As climate risk becomes increasingly relevant, many banks are evaluating the potential negative impacts it could have on their business. Both transition risk, which can arise from changes in policy, law, technology and the market, and event-driven or longer-term physical risk, caused by events such as drought, flooding and extreme weather, could impact the economy, clients and therefore our business. Even after implementing measures to help mitigate the effects of climate change, physical risks could continue to occur since climate change is actual. Therefore, these risks need to be well understood and managed. The way we do this, as well as an explanation of the different risks involved, our performance and results, can be found in the  'Risk management' section.",

In 2022, the ESR framework was updated to reflect several minor amendments following the last comprehensive review cycle that took place in June 2021. The new release includes, among amendments to restrictions in the tobacco value chain, additional clarity on some of the requirements for the ESR client assessment process concerning specific group of companies. It also includes the required ESR due diligence for public authority entities. As well as restrictions, the ESR policy also sets guiding principles for biodiversity and human rights.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the rate of species extinction is accelerating with grave impacts on people around the world. IPBES estimates that around one million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many within decades. If the rapid decline of biodiversity continues, the livelihood of many businesses is at stake. The agricultural sector, for example, depends on healthy ecosystems, and the construction and pharmaceutical sectors both need access to natural resources to prosper. This can have an impact for banks.\n\nThrough our ESR policy framework, ING identifies and manages risks related to biodiversity loss. Our processes focus on avoiding a negative impact on biodiversity, where possible, and minimising impact that cannot be avoided. We also engage with clients to find and finance opportunities to do business in a way that respects nature.\n\nAlso through the framework, we apply strict ethical and environmental criteria to financing decisions. We don't finance projects that directly impact high-value ecosystems, such as UNESCO heritage sites, Ramsar wetland sites or areas designated for protection by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN I and II areas). In addition, our screening criteria include enhanced due diligence for transactions that can impact rich biodiversity areas and ecosystems. In 2022, we expanded our due diligence to include 'key biodiversity areas', which are host to critical populations of the world's most threatened species.\n\nTo ensure employees understand the impact of biodiversity loss on business, we introduced two learning modules in 2022. The first, an internal video explaining biodiversity loss, why it is relevant to customers and to ING, what we are doing to protect biodiversity and how employees can help. It is part of a sustainability learning offering, available to the entire company. The second module was co-developed with the Biodiversity Working Group of the Dutch Sustainable Finance Platform, which is hosted by De Nederlandsche Bank. The e-learning is available on the platform's website.\n\nReducing deforestation is a priority for protecting biodiversity and can make major contributions to climate mitigation. We engage with clients around the world, active in cattle, palm oil, soy, wood, cocoa and coffee,\n\ncalling on them to put in place no-deforestation and no-ecosystem conversion policies and commitments and to work towards full traceability in their supply chains.\n\nTo restore biodiversity globally, all stakeholders need to work together. That's why ING is an active member of external partnerships and initiatives. We work with peers and expert organisations to further develop the TNFD framework, which we intend to use as guidance in future reporting. ING is also a member of the finance workstream of the EU Business@Biodiversity platform, an EU-led initiative that aims to support financial institutions in integrating biodiversity risks and opportunities.\n\nING is a signatory of the Equator Principles, a financial industry benchmark for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in projects. Projects financed under the Equator Principles framework that have an impact on natural ecosystems, are expected to carefully manage that impact. We have strict criteria in place to apply this framework, ensuring that biodiversity impact is not only avoided and minimised where possible in these projects, but also restored.\n\n## Human rights\n\nWe believe every person, everywhere, has the right to be treated with dignity and have their interests considered equally. ING and our clients have the potential to impact human rights through our operations and business relationships. Our impact is on different levels: how we do business, and with who we do business, not only as an employer but also through our supply chains.\n\nWe work to influence and support business partners to respect human rights in multiple ways. Our ESR policy framework includes an overarching policy on human rights to guide us when assessing clients and the transactions we finance. We also act on a variety of environmental, climate and social topics as well as highlighting their interconnectivity. For example, our approach acknowledges that biodiversity loss negatively impacts people's human rights, affecting their access to food, water, sanitation, culture, property, a healthy environment and more.\n\nIn 2022, we published a Human Rights Review 2021/2022 where we disclosed our most severe human rights issues in Retail Banking with an emphasis on individual customers (discrimination, financial distress and privacy abuses). We also provided updates on the management of our most severe human rights issues in our own operations (work-related stress and discrimination). We also developed a tool for analysing the human rights impact within our portfolio. We are currently piloting this tool and looking into ways to implement it as part of ING's existing processes.\n\nWe continue our human rights efforts in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) as well as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We do this by understanding regional and portfolio risks, engaging with clients, using financial leverage when needed, and being cognisant of",

We consulted with human rights and civil society organisations in drawing up our ESR policy review.\n\nVia platforms that set standards on this topic, ING aims to be transparent about our progress in the hope that others will join us and strive to be a step ahead of broader expectations. Read more in 'Environmental, social and governance risk' in 'Risk management'. To understand the link between human rights and climate change, a section of our climate report is dedicated to human rights. The transition to a green economy may impact people. Transitioning out of fossil fuels may result in stranded assets and consequently affect surrounding communities. It could also increase energy poverty for vulnerable people reliant on fossil fuels. We recognise that as the world transitions from a carbon-intensive economy into a green economy, we must collectively acknowledge the needs of people, especially the most vulnerable.\n\n## Financial health and inclusion\n\nPart of ING's purpose to empower people to stay a step ahead in life and in business means helping customers and society stay a step ahead of the challenges they're facing. One of the ways we can make a difference here is by aiming to advance financial health and inclusion for customers and communities.\n\nFinancially healthy people can contribute to a healthy economy and help drive social progress. At the same time, money is a leading cause of stress for people with half of European households struggling to make ends meet. According to the group European Pensions, one-third are unable to face unexpected financial expenses and close to 40 percent are not saving for retirement.\n\nING is committed to empowering customers and the community towards improved financial health, a state in which an individual, household, micro, small or medium-sized enterprise can manage their current financial obligations and have confidence in their financial future. This includes managing day-to-day finances to meet short-term needs, the capacity to absorb financial shocks (resilience), the capacity to reach future goals, and feeling secure and in control of finances (confidence).\n\nAccording to a financial health working group convened by the UN Secretary-General's Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development, having financial health as a business purpose contributes to happier, more engaged customers with greater financial resilience, better management of day-to-day finances, an enhanced ability to set future goals, and improved confidence, security and control of finances. ING is part of this working group: the Special Advocate has showcased our approach as best practice.\n\nFinancial health can also be seen from a human rights perspective. Everyone has a basic right to be a full member of the economy and live life in a financially dignified way. ING strives to make sure it does not discriminate by giving customers different levels of essential information. We aim for our information to be comprehensible and accessible for all .\n\n## Advancing customers' financial health and inclusion\n\nING has built a financial health framework consisting of three pillars. For each pillar, best practices are shared between business units with the goal of learning from each other. Similar projects are running in several countries but tailored to local circumstances. Examples include a project in Spain on the avoidance of overdraft, which is now also running in Germany.\n\nOther examples are campaigns in Germany, the Netherlands and Romania which aim to stimulate those with hardly any savings to adopt a savings habit and, if possible, to build a savings buffer. Tracking each project to measure effectiveness, we introduced 15 new financial health projects in Spain, Germany, Romania, Turkey, Australia and the Netherlands in 2022, reaching two million customers.\n\nFinancial inclusion, the first pillar, is about everyone who meets the bank's criteria having access to banking products and digital adoption, including those with seeing or hearing difficulties - what we refer to as 'leaving no one behind'. It also means that people have effective access to all types of financial products, not just basic ones. To achieve this, we want to create equal opportunities and make sure products, services and facilities are accessible to everyone and we want to engage people to effectively use them. Examples of this include voice-activated ATMs in Poland, the Netherlands and Turkey, and a bank card with a notch so the visually impaired can insert them correctly, in the Netherlands and Belgium. The card is also designed to support customers with limited hand functionality. In Australia, we provide phone banking for customers with speech or hearing impairments via the government's National Relay Service. Sign language services are available in some bank branches in Poland.\n\nING also started a programme to align digital channels in all EU Retail Banking countries with the EU's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines standard (WCAG 2.1). For example, in the Netherlands, the 'MijnING' app is accessible with a voice-over to transfer money or to get current account insights. Examples of improving digital inclusion include ING in Belgium partnering with Beego to help customers become digital by providing 'digibuddies' (computer science students) to assist them. And in Australia, more than 100,000 customers over 55 have received information to improve their digital awareness and skills. Financial inclusion will be included in the ING Compliance framework under the Client Protection Framework we are developing, as we want to uphold the same standards across the globe.\n\nThe second pillar of our financial health framework is about making sure that people's monthly expenses don't exceed their income, and having healthy levels of debt and financial resilience. Everyday Round Up for example encourages customers in Poland, Australia, Turkey, Germany, Spain and Romania to build savings. We continue to partner with apps like Minna, which displays customer subscriptions in one place, and Dealwise, a shopping platform that gathers cashback deals and discounts in one place .",

The cost-of-living crisis meant that many people struggled to pay their bills. ING assisted impacted Dutch customers (and non-customers), via a campaign directing them to www.geldfit.nl/energie to help manage their situation. In September 2022, more people were referred to Geldfit than in the whole of 2020 and 2021 combined.\n\nThe third pillar of our financial health framework is helping customers with their financial planning. In Germany, a personal budget tool is available for customers to plan and control expenses as well as discover potential savings. In Belgium, Easy self-invest gives customers access to information from ING investment experts and allows them to start investing with only small amounts of money.\n\n## Supporting financial health in the community\n\nIn 2022, the war in Ukraine resulted in months of escalating devastation and displacement for children and their families. Not only were children among the many killed, wounded or deeply traumatised, but their access to school, healthcare and other basic services was severely interrupted. In response to the crisis, ING, together with colleagues and clients, donated more than \u20ac6.5 million to UNICEF's emergency response and more than \u20ac7.5 million to local charities supporting people impacted by the war in Ukraine and in countries receiving refugees.\n\nBoth the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine exposed and deepened existing inequalities. As a result of the war and soaring food and energy prices, the UN Development Programme noted that a staggering 71 million more people around the world experienced poverty in 2022. According to Ipsos research carried out in December 2022, people not just in the EU, but globally, listed cost-of-living as their biggest concern.\n\nOur approach to community investment adapts to these changing needs. Through a combination of global and local funding, we support programmes that contribute to an inclusive economy, one where everyone can participate. In 2022, ING, together with colleagues and clients, donated an additional \u20ac13 million to a range of social programmes, \u20ac9 million of which was specifically focused on building financial health in communities, covering the areas of future-proof employment, financial capabilities and social enterprises.\n\nAs examples of supporting employment, in 2022 the ING Netherlands Foundation partnered with Hack your Future to train former refugees to become IT professionals and help them find jobs. It worked with Jong Ondernemen to increase opportunities for students to enter employment, and Springplank, which was set up to guide homeless people towards employment, housing, and financial capability. In Italy, we continued to partner with Fondazione Mondo Digitale to provide training for around 6,000 people, especially women, in\n\ndigital and job-orientation skills. In Germany we partnered with MentorMe, a mentoring programme that supports vulnerable women in the job market. Mentees are matched with ING mentors for one year. In Belgium, we worked with the King Baudouin Foundation to fund projects that strengthen digital inclusion, helping people develop digital skills and ensuring that digital products and services are accessible to all. ING customers get involved by helping to choose which projects receive additional funding.\n\nING also initiated projects that assist with financial capabilities. In the Netherlands for example, the ING Netherlands Foundation supported Money Start to provide education on debt prevention while the Youth Perspective Fund helps young people to become debt-free. In Spain, together with Nantik Lum, we supported the CREA Salud Financiera programme to improve the financial health of women that are, or are at potential risk of, socio-economic exclusion. In Luxembourg, we worked with Jonk Entrepreneuren to inspire and prepare young people aged nine to 25 for entrepreneurship and employment. Twelve programmes provided hands-on learning in entrepreneurship, work readiness and financial literacy.\n\nAs examples of projects focused on social enterprise, in Romania, together with Impact Hub, we empower charitable associations with entrepreneurial education and guidance to help them improve interventions, generate alternative sources of funding and develop scalable solutions that increase their social impact.\n\nNext to these examples, we also provided funding to projects in Australia, the Czech Republic, France, Poland and the United States.\n\n## Empowering employees on sustainability\n\nPutting sustainability at the heart of what we do means making sure employees are fully engaged on this topic. We aim to give them the relevant knowledge, skills, and mindset to put sustainability into practice both inside and outside the workplace.\n\nIn 2022, to further develop awareness around sustainability, we hosted global and national webinars and townhalls addressing sustainability topics such as climate action, climate risk, human rights and biodiversity. In the Netherlands, we held 'Let's talk sustainability' events, where ING experts, partners and employees came together to discuss relevant sustainability topics. In addition, a global sustainability e-learning was made available to empower employees with sustainability-related knowledge and skills. It included foundational and advanced learning modules. Some of these were developed specifically for ING, while others were provided by partners. Additional learnings on climate risk and biodiversity were included, in cooperation with the Dutch Banking Association (NVB). On an expert level, where employees required further skills, we provided online and offline training on sustainable finance, as well as environmental and social risk.",

        "page_content": "- > Sustainability at the heart\n\n## ESG governance\n\nIn March 2022, we updated our ESG governance approach, integrating and aligning ESG governance with existing business-as-usual governance of the bank. This allows us to steer holistically across ESG on themes like climate, biodiversity, human rights and financial health. As a result, ESG is now a regular topic on the MBB agenda. Our global head of Sustainability reports directly to ING's CEO. Sustainability/ESG leads in major countries have a functional line to the global head of Sustainability to create a stronger connection between global and local actions.\n\nThe ESG Committee, set up in 2022, assists the SB with matters relating to ESG, including, but not limited to, the development and integration of ESG across the company and its strategy. The ESG Committee also assists the SB by monitoring and advising on relevant ESG developments. In addition, we have created an ESG Sounding Board comprised of senior leaders from across the organisation and including representatives from Legal, Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy. The Sounding Board helps guide the development and implementation of our strategy for ESG topics as well as monitoring and reporting on our progress. We follow the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosure in our governance and reporting. We believe this new approach increases our effectiveness, efficiency and accountability as we strive to be a banking leader in building a sustainable future for customers, our company, society, and the environment.\n\n## Taxation\n\nOur taxation policies and performance are key elements under the governance pillar of our ESG framework. We are mindful that every aspect of our business, including our approach to tax, has an impact on society. We have therefore chosen to formalise our approach to clarify our views on responsible tax behaviour and tax governance.\n\nOur tax principles, which are applicable worldwide, mirror ING's values of integrity, honesty, prudence and responsibility. These values are the main drivers for our relationship with tax authorities and for the adoption of tax transparency as standard practice.\n\nAs a global bank, we play a crucial role in fighting financial crime and protecting the financial system from harmful behaviour. This includes criminal activities such as tax evasion, but also aggressive tax avoidance,",

We also believe in the principle that tax should follow business, so profits are allocated to the countries where business value is created. It is our policy to comply with domestic and international laws and regulations, taking account of both the letter and the spirit of the law, as well as standards such as the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises, and we apply the arm's length principle.\n\nWherever we operate, we seek to establish and maintain an open and constructive dialogue with local tax authorities and other government bodies, based on the disclosure of all relevant facts and circumstances. In this dialogue we seek to provide clarity and establish certainty on all relevant local tax components in advance. We are transparent about our approach to tax and our tax position. In formulating this approach, we have taken account of the interests of our stakeholders, including (tax) authorities, non-governmental organisations, customers, shareholders and society in general.\n\nDisclosures are made in accordance with relevant domestic regulations, as well as applicable reporting requirements and standards such as the International Financial Reporting Standards. Since 2015, each ING annual report has contained a country-by-country overview of the result (before tax) and the total corporate income tax charge per tax jurisdiction. ING also submits, annually, a similar type of overview to tax authorities which enhances their insight into our tax position. In 2022, ING was ranked third in the Association of Investors for Sustainable Development (VBDO's) yearly Tax Transparency Benchmark.\n\nIt is our policy not to advise clients on taxation matters. Clients remain responsible for their own tax position.\n\nING joined the Dutch Tax Governance Code developed by the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (known as VNO-NCW). ING embraces the principles of the code and will work consciously to comply with the targets set, as laid out in our Tax Governance Code. This is available on ing.com in the Compliance section under About Us. The financial information in the Tax Governance Code is recorded under notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report (see note 35, Information on geographical areas and note 37).\n\nTax policies, procedures and a tax control framework have been implemented to support management in mitigating potential tax risks in a prudent manner. Internal monitoring, control and reporting of tax-related risks takes place on a continuous basis with annual reporting to the board and various other stakeholders. For SOx 404 purposes (section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), an 'effectiveness of internal control statement' with respect to tax controls has been provided. Tax risk management is subject to Corporate Audit testing and evaluation. As part of the tax risk assessment, if applicable, the potential use of (tax) incentives and/or subsidies is considered acceptable to the extent explicitly intended by the authorities.\n\nIn all countries in which ING is present, it is ING's position to be cooperatively tax compliant. This implies being transparent about, and disclosing, relevant tax risks towards tax authorities. Tax risks not only refer to ING's own tax position, but also our role as gatekeeper for the financial system as well risks in relation to our customers. In this respect, we have integrated a tax integrity assessment in our overall customer risk assessment process.",

To put these into practice, and to make that difference for all customers, we have defined four enablers: providing seamless digital services, using scalable technology and operations, staying safe and secure, and unlocking our people's full potential.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 Subject to reasonable assurance by KPMG. For details regarding the measurement of this KPI, we refer to paragraph \"Digital access\" on page 39\n\n2 Weighted average availability during prime time (6:30 - 01:00); based on number of primary customers per country for channels: Internet banking Private Individual, Internet Business Banking and Mobile Banking App.\n\n3 and 4 Average availability 24x7, measured frequently per hour, excluding planned changes.\n\n## Providing seamless digital services\n\nIn a world where accelerating digitalisation is one of the main global trends impacting banking, customers are spending more and more time online. That's why we want to make their lives easier by giving them a seamless digital service. Putting the customer at the centre remains our core strategy.\n\nCustomers deserve a personal, easy, relevant and instant experience at every touchpoint, from the way we communicate and onboard them to how we provide products and handle customer requests. ING facilitates this by developing, maintaining and enhancing personalised, reliable digital services that are available 24/7. Developing, maintaining and enhancing these basics provides the foundation for providing a superior customer experience, and in turn this will help us achieve our ambition of becoming the number-one bank for NPS in all ING countries.\n\nOur emphasis continues to be on mobile and we are further improving our mobile capabilities. In 2022, 71 percent of our communication was personalised. As well as helping customers to make more informed financial decisions, personalising customer interactions helps boost mobile sales. In 2022, 58 percent of customers only engaged with us via mobile apps, up from 51 percent in 2021.\n\nWe use data analytics and machine learning to personalise digital services for customers. Given the importance of data for offering personal and relevant services, data security and privacy protection are crucial.\n\nBy digitalising key customer journeys we are enabling a superior customer experience at a reduced cost-toserve, while measuring impact through NPS and cost efficiency. In 2022, our Digi Index Score was 64 percent, a figure that reflects the average of straight through processing (STP) rates of key customer journeys i.e. those that are handled without manual intervention. By 2025, we aim to reach a Digi Index Score of over 75 percent.\n\n## Data analytics\n\nWe use advanced analytics and machine learning to extract insights from data to personalise customer experiences, making the difference for both customers and colleagues. Our ambition as part of our strategy of seamless, digital/scalable operations is to increase our STP rate to facilitate a smoother customer experience. Call reduction and further digitalisation of our processes are a part of this. We have further invested in our chatbot, callbot and virtual assistant capabilities and now have active chatbots in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Turkey, deflecting up to 40 percent of incoming chat volume automatically. Guided by chat and callbots, customers can now learn how to resolve issues themselves using the ING mobile app. Other benefits for customers include less waiting time if they want to speak to an agent because more chats and calls are handled through digital solutions, and it is easier for them to find quick answers to simple questions, even outside regular business hours.

Analytics has contributed to a bank-wide anti-fraud programme, supporting the reduction of fraud damage for both customers and ING. This was realised through machine learning models for certain fraud 'modus operandi'. We also use our AI insights and expertise to fight financial and economic crime. Our advanced AI model allows us to detect financial and economic crime better and earlier.\n\nIn addition, ING is a partner of the Kickstart AI initiative in the Netherlands, which aims to solve real business problems with the use of AI. This year, we joined other member companies in tackling the food waste challenge and improving the demand forecasting model at Delhaize Belgium that helps balance product availability and waste.\n\n## Scalable technology and operations\n\nReflecting our role as a digital first bank and to enable a superior customer experience, ING believes that scalable technology and operations are the foundation for becoming a successful digital bank and therefore have made this an integral part of our strategy. Standardisation and automation give us a shorter time to market, quicker time to volume, consistently high quality and improved productivity. Scalable technology and operations also help us attract and retain talent by offering employees the opportunity to not only work with technology but also collaborate across countries and make an impact globally. By creating foundational and scalable capabilities and services, we allow the business to grow at marginal costs.\n\n## Scalable technology\n\nOur scalable technology strategy provides a foundation for the modular components we use to build and operate propositions. It allows ING countries to introduce propositions more quickly and easily, while providing the opportunity to add local flavour.\n\nThe technology is divided into three parts: ING's private cloud infrastructure (IPC), our engineering pipeline (OnePipeline) and our banking technology platform, with its extendable and reusable services and components. Given its flexibility and scalability, ING has chosen for a hybrid cloud strategy, i.e. using public cloud providers in addition to IPC. Cloud computing is an important component for scaling our digital capabilities. IPC is where we store and manage applications and data such as channel applications, core bank systems and other banking applications. We measure IPC adoption by the percentage of physical cores in IPC compared to the total number of physical cores in data centres globally. By the end of 2022, we ran 52 percent of our workloads on (private) cloud. By 2025, we expect that figure to have risen to at least 70 percent.\n\nOnePipeline, our continuous integration and delivery pipeline, provides engineers with a consistent and secure global capability to develop, test and deploy software. We invest heavily in infrastructure, test and risk automation. Today, about 48 percent of applications are maintained through the pipeline. We measure the pipeline's adoption by the numbers of applications onboarded to the pipeline (used to develop and deploy to production), compared to the total number of applications registered in our IT management platform across all ING entities. We exclude those applications where a pipeline is not applicable, such as nocode or SaaS applications. Our ambition is to have 90 percent of applications on OnePipeline by 2025.\n\nTouchpoint is part of our banking technology platform. In 2022, approximately 60 percent of customer logins used Touchpoint. By 2025, we expect that figure to be over 90 percent. By using common architecture and shared services, engineers can create propositions without the 'heavy lifting'. Touchpoint provides modularity and a set of reusable shared services, freeing up capacity for engineers to create more value for customers and employees. We measure customer online traffic on the platform through the consumption of Touchpoint authentication services, represented by the number of Touchpoint-enabled unique customer authentications against the total number of unique customer authentications (Retail countries/Wholesale Bank).\n\n## Payment & Settlement Services\n\nIn 2022, as part of our strategy, we have bundled our strategic payments and settlement services (PSS) into a new unit under CTO (Chief Technology Office). This unit covers the full scope of payment and settlement services for Retail and Wholesale Banking and benefit from our scalable tech and ops. It provides high quality and efficient payment, settlement, and open banking services, leveraging our scalable payment and settlement solutions.\n\nThrough an increased focus on these payment and settlement services, we allow our business to provide a superior customer experience. We aim to further consolidate most of our payment services on this platform, improving quality and reducing price per transaction. As of 2022, PSS processed well over three billion transaction (65 percent of total volume) through our central payment engines.\n\n## Scalable operations\n\nOur scalable operations are driven by digitalisation and capability hubs. These focus on becoming fully STP, leveraging expertise and using scale and sharing productive, quality services across the ING network.\n\nCapability hubs provide shared solutions to ING Bank worldwide. The hubs are mainly located in the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the Philippines. In 2022, 32 percent of operations were carried out with the support of these hubs, compared to 23 percent in 2021. Our aim for 2025, is to have at least 50 percent of operational work carried out by the hubs.",

        "page_content": "Contents\n\nRisk management\n\n- > How we are making the difference\n\nBy digitalising client contacts, accelerating remote advice and increasing the use of chatbots, inbound calls to contact centres were reduced by 12 percent in 2022. We aim for 30 percent in 2025, which we expect will represent an annual gross cost saving of around \u20ac50 million. Similarly, by automating and centralising our KYC activities this year, we reached 49 percent of know your customer ( KYC) in our hubs and expect to increase that to 60 percent by 2025 through more consolidation, automation and straight-through processing.\n\n## Staying safe and secure\n\nTrust is the starting point, the most basic requirement, for all stakeholders. That's especially true for a digital-first bank like ING. People trust us with their money and with their data. Keeping it safe, and maintaining this trust is crucial (see also 'Risk management').\n\n## Digital access\n\nIn a digital society, customers expect to have round-the-clock access to digital channels including their banking services. To live up to their expectations, we strive to provide uninterrupted access to our banking services. In Retail Banking in 2022, our digital channel availability for the Netherlands and Belgium was 99.38%. For Wholesale Banking clients worldwide, the availability for our Inside Business payments channel was 99.97%, and for our Inside Business Connect channel (file transfer) the availability was 99.99%. These figures are based on outputs of availability monitoring processes, which are run with a high frequency per hour. The 2022 results are in line with the 2021 channel availability results.\n\n## Anti-money laundering and KYC\n\nKnowing who we do business with helps to protect our clients, ING and the financial system against financial economic crimes. As part of our continuing anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, we carry out customer due-diligence checks and monitoring transactions for unusual or suspicious activities. We also assess the projects and companies we finance for environmental and social risks and aim to steer clear of activities in certain sectors or industries that could be harmful to people or the environment. In 2022, we strengthened our KYC with, for example, increased staff, upscaled skills and additional local requirements where needed. Read more about KYC and AML in 'Compliance risk' in 'Risk management'.\n\n## Cyberthreat landscape\n\nAs a gatekeeper to the financial system, we have an important role in protecting society against crime. Cybercrime remains a continuous threat to companies in general and to financial institutions in particular. Ransomware is still one of the prime threats, with phishing the most common way that attackers gain access to a company's system or network. Other high-ranking threats are attacks against availability, or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. However, the geopolitical situation resulted in increased\n\nawareness of cybersecurity threats, resulting in more attention for the global cybersecurity domain. While we still observe an increase in the number of threats, we also see a wider range of ways that attackers infiltrate company systems, such as exploiting unresolved vulnerabilities, notably 'zero-day exploits', i.e. vulnerabilities that are exploited before a patch is available.\n\n## Cybersecurity incidents\n\nDuring 2022, one attack impacted our availability of digital services in Germany. Channels were unavailable for less than two hours. No other cybersecurity incidents were identified in 2022 that resulted in significant operational downtime, data theft or financial loss.\n\nDifferent types of cyberthreats are not only relevant for the financial industry, but are increasingly hitting their supply chains. ING continues to invest in cybersecurity capabilities in all domains (prevention, detection, response and recovery).\n\n## Preventative measures\n\nBeing cybercrime resilient is a high priority. We continuously test our IT and organisational resilience, and perform crisis management and red-team exercises to improve our response to DDoS and targeted attacks. Cybersecurity risks from supplier's monitored and mitigation is initiated where needed. ING maintains a strong global cybercrime alliance within the financial industry and government institutions to monitor trends.\n\nING recognises the value of an effective regulatory framework and is in favour of cybersecurity being led more by actual cyberthreats and principles and less by prescriptive rule-based compliance. The adoption of threat-led penetration testing in the EU's new Digital Operational Resilience Act, which also ensures continuity of business, is a good example. Testing critical systems on real-life threats helps entities to gain insights. Our staff awareness and training programme is regularly updated with the latest cybercrime trends and prevention measures.\n\nWe have a responsible disclosure procedure for security researchers that may find issues in our business applications or infrastructure.\n\n## Identity and access management (IAM)\n\nIdentity and access management (IAM) is an important element in our control framework to prevent and mitigate the risk of unauthorised access to IT systems and the data processed and stored therein. ING has IAM global processes and controls in place which are periodically reviewed and tested. For more information go to 'Non-financial risk section' in 'Risk management'.",

        "page_content": "Risk management\n\n- > How we are making the difference\n\n## Fraud landscape\n\nTypes of fraud are also evolving. As the digital world continuously changes, fraudsters have become more international and their modus operandi more complex. Customers are being deceived in increasingly sophisticated ways. Online fraud has become a societal problem and in several countries banks have collaborated with governments, law enforcement entities and other sectors to find innovative ways to prevent and detect fraud. ING has an important role to play in preventing and detecting fraud in the digital world and wants to minimise the impact of fraud losses and the number of fraud victims.\n\nWe recognise this transformation in the fraud landscape with developments high on our agenda. We changed our fraud programme to improve its ability to monitor and react to fraud incidents and to adapt quickly to new fraud methods in a cost-efficient organisation. The global head of Fraud now reports directly to the global COO, and we have implemented a global delivery organisation (tribe) that brings detection and response services to all countries. This tribe uses several sources of information, and is able to assess whether a payment is done by a customer or by a fraudster. Also, we appointed a global head of fraud investigations and introduced innovative ways to share best practices across domains and countries.\n\nOver 2022, we experienced an increase in the number of fraud incidents, but were able to respond quickly and adequately, resulting in a reduction of fraud losses compared to last year. The main modus operandi continues to be the phishing of customer credentials and fraudulent credit card transactions. We also see that authorised push payment fraud (e.g. impersonation of a bank employee) has become an important category to focus on. We are increasingly collaborating with peers and other relevant sectors, such as telecoms companies. More information can be found in the Risk management chapter.\n\n## Data privacy, protection and ethics\n\nCustomers trust us with confidential information and their personal data. It's important that we maintain that trust and keep their data safe from loss or misuse. In an environment that's increasingly open and connected, we must be ever more vigilant. ING is bound by global and local data protection laws, which can differ from country to country. We are transparent about what we do with the personal data of customers, employees, suppliers and business partners.\n\nOur approach can be summarised as 'the right people use the right data for the right purpose'. In line with the EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR), we aim to only process personal data to support our business and in line with applicable legislation. Data controllers or processors who want to transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) must ensure that the data subject is granted a level of protection equivalent to that guaranteed by GDPR. More information can be found in the Privacy Statement on our website.\n\nIn 2021, following the Schrems II ruling by the EU's Court of Justice in 2020 on the lawfulness of Privacy Shield, the EU-US personal data transfer mechanism, ING launched its own transfer impact assessment with necessary updates made to standard contractual clauses: contracts in scope were completed by the end of 2022. Financial institutions need to walk the fine line between privacy protection and fostering data sharing. Again, countries differ in their approach. At EU level, there is a clear regulatory trend towards more data portability and more data sharing. Under the Digital Markets Act, Big Tech will be required to facilitate data portability and we expect a future proposal to establish PSD2-like data portability for finance.\n\nIn addition to complying with regulatory requirements around data use, ING assesses potential ethical questions, taking into account the rights and interests of our stakeholders, to verify whether we use data in a responsible way. Global and local data ethics councils guide our ethical decision-making and help to apply data ethics consistently.\n\nAs ethical standards can evolve over time, we closely monitor regulatory compliance, societal developments and potential new requirements to gain an 'outside-in' view on data ethics. We have assessed the impact of the EU's upcoming artificial intelligence legislation related to ethics and established an appropriate implementation plan. Everything we do is guided by ING's Orange Code, which describes the values and behaviours that underpin our way of working, and which puts integrity above all. Read more in 'Compliance risk', in the Risk management chapter. Building on the Orange Code is ING's Global Code of Conduct. We encourage employees to speak up when they are confronted with unethical or illegal behaviour and provide a variety of reporting channels, including via their manager, local compliance officer or an ING whistleblower reporting officer. ING also has external and anonymous whistleblower channels. We take great care to protect the identity of whistleblowers and the confidentiality of their reports to protect them against potential retaliation. We believe that trust, integrity and ethical behaviour are at the core of any reliable business. They go hand in hand with satisfied customers.",

        "page_content": "- > How we are making the difference\n\nUltimately, we are making the difference through the activities and actions of our people. We seek to attract, develop and retain the best people by creating an environment where they can unlock their full potential. ING's sustained success is founded on the continued commitment of our talented people. We unlock our people's full potential by ensuring all employees have skills and capabilities that equip them for the future, by promoting a diverse, inclusive and vitalised culture, where everyone feels they belong, and by providing an excellent employee experience.\n\nIn the past few years, our people have faced unprecedented challenges during the global pandemic. It has fundamentally changed the way people view their lives and has shifted employee expectations significantly. The hybrid way of working has worked well for ING. The pandemic allowed us to accelerate our digitalisation, we collectively pulled together and employees continued to deliver for our customers. We continue to support our people by offering hybrid working to make sure they have the autonomy to better balance their professional and personal lives. Eighty-five percent of our people strongly endorse hybrid working.\n\nWe care about giving our people this flexibility, especially since the changing dynamics following the pandemic has led to a change in employee expectations. It is important that our people feel supported and that, as well as a competitive total reward package, they receive good development opportunities and autonomy. This is reflected in our people offer, which is intended to create clarity on what we offer, and what we ask in return.\n\nIt matters to us that our people are engaged and that we have an open dialogue with them. We use a continuous listening approach, our Organisational Health Index (OHI), to get an ongoing sense of how our people are doing and how they feel and we make sure we act on that feedback. A full OHI was held in October, with a record number of participants: over 41,000 people, or 69% of our total workforce. On a global level, more colleagues indicated that they had clarity on our strategy, shared ING's vision and felt included in decision-making. Risk management remained one of our strongest practices and saw further improvement since 2021. We will use the outcomes of this survey to define action plans and priorities for 2023.\n\nAs well as making sure our people are engaged, we aim to unlock our people's full potential by focusing on three elements: 'skills and learning', 'diversity, inclusion and vitality', and 'employee experience'.\n\n## Skills and learning\n\nWe want to attract, develop and retain the skills we need to deliver great performance. In 2022, we provided new tools to upskill and reskill our people, built the capabilities of our leaders and developed the pipeline of leaders for the future.\n\n## Upskilling our workforce\n\nWe want to equip our people to grow, upskill and reskill themselves, so that both our people and our business have the capabilities that are needed now and in the future. Together with an external partner, we launched a programme to boost learning content to 30 ING countries and the four ING Hubs (Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovakia). It offers a wide range of learning courses in My Learning - ING's open, digital learning platform that gives employees access to our complete learning offering in one location.\n\nING wants to be an organisation where learning and development play a major role and where our people feel supported in developing themselves. This is part of our culture. Development increased by 13%, with 1,317,760 courses completed and 1,509,938 learning hours undertaken. Over 44% of all learning completed was not mandatory, with more people than ever electing to learn new skills and build capabilities relevant to their job roles and functions.\n\nAt ING, we care about everyone being able to unlock their full potential and want to make sure all our people can access learning and development. We made learning solutions more accessible by implementing new guidelines for all required learning. We seek to provide digital services and workplace tools that promote disability inclusion and meet accessibility requirements set out in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. The WCAG is now our reference standard for all mandatory learning. We continued to embed this further into all content created for ING.\n\n## Building leaders for the future\n\nTo have strong leaders and an equally strong pipeline, we completed our annual succession review of the top 400 roles in the bank. We launched a new programme to accelerate leaders' readiness for bigger, global roles. Fifty-four percent of the talented participants in this programme were women and 10 countries were represented. We continued to build our internal talent pipeline through our early careers approach. We hired 81 trainees under our International Talent Programme under eight tracks: WB, Retail Banking, IT, Finance, Risk, HR, Operations & Change and Analytics.\n\nWe continued to strengthen our leadership offering through our Leadership Experience, which aims to develop greater leaders and better managers who can engage and grow talent and enhance team performance, and the Leadership Fundamentals programme, which aims to develop the foundational skills managers need to help themselves and their teams to be successful. Some 840 managers joined the Leadership Experience and over 390 colleagues from 25 countries participated in the fully digital programme of our Leadership Fundamentals.\n\n## Diversity, inclusion and vitality\n\nING is committed to attracting, developing and retaining a workforce that reflects the customers and communities we serve. We believe that a diverse, inclusive and thriving culture makes people want to join",

In 2022, that figure was 29%. The variable pay of our MBB is linked to delivery of these internal targets on gender diversity. We also defined 'senior management' consistently, in line with our Global Job Architecture (GJA, ING's global job catalogue).\n\n## Gender pay gap analysis\n\nAt ING, we conducted a global analysis of gender pay to structurally address any gaps using data from 2021.\n\nThe gender pay gap compares the pay of men and women overall, across the bank, across all levels. Getting a complete picture of this gender pay gap is complex because the data is influenced by many different elements, for instance the level and type of jobs that men and women have. This is why the analysis is divided into two parts, the unadjusted gender pay gap and the adjusted gender pay gap. Furthermore, we analysed equal pay for equal work. Our methodology for this review was assessed by Deloitte, including analysing the code of the tools used.\n\n## Unadjusted gender pay gap\n\nThe European Banking Authority (EBA) will first collect benchmarking data on the gender pay gap from banks under its supervision (including ING) over the financial year 2023. For this purpose, the EBA published guidelines. Following these, the unadjusted gender pay gap represents the difference in the mean remuneration paid to men and women expressed as a percentage of the mean remuneration paid to men. Our calculations include annual fixed remuneration and actual variable pay. At the end of 2021 the global unadjusted gender pay gap of ING globally was 34%.\n\nAccording to our initial analysis, this gap is predominantly an indication of the fact that there are more male employees in senior, higher paying roles than female employees.\n\nTo address the unadjusted gap, a deeper analysis was needed to assess where and why these differences in pay between men and women occur. This is why we also calculated an adjusted gender pay gap to get better insights into the main drivers of the gender pay gap.\n\nAdjusted gender pay gap Our adjusted gender pay gap analysis accounts for several factors to make the comparisons meaningful, including two main drivers: country differences and job classification. ING is calculating its adjusted gender pay following the Blinder-Oaxaca method.\n\nThe adjusted gap analysis results show that the 34% global unadjusted gender pay gap:\n\n- 1. is driven by 14% country differences. There are structural base salary differences between countries. This way, the focus is on differences between country peers, which makes the comparison fairer;\n- 2. and 17% is explained predominantly by Global Job Architecture (GJA), as the most significant variable in the model. Certain job profiles in the global ING job catalogue are associated with higher pay than the reference group and there are proportionally more male than female employees in these job profiles.\n\nBy subtracting the effects of country differences and our GJA, the adjusted gender pay gap was 3% at yearend 2021. Therefore, we found that female employees are paid on average 97% of what male employees are paid.\n\nWhile we are encouraged by the fact that our adjusted gender pay gap is showing us that there are objective, explainable reasons for our unadjusted pay gap, we realise there is more to be done, especially about the under-representation of women in leadership positions and we remain fully committed to improve this.\n\n## Equal pay for equal work\n\nEqual pay for equal work assesses whether female and male employees in the same job receive equal pay for equal work. How do we calculate this? Our GJA allows us to compare like-for-like jobs. It categorises all 1,425 job profiles within ING in a standardised and simple way, using common language that makes it easier to compare and match accountabilities and capabilities across countries and business lines.\n\nING performed an initial 'equal pay for equal work' assessment. The results have been shared across the countries we operate in for further analysis. There are circumstances when it is appropriate to pay employees differently, even if they are doing similar jobs, for example because of differences in pay between markets, differences in skills or differences in performance. Where unexplained gaps are found, we intend to make the necessary adjustments.",

        "page_content": "- > How we are making the difference\n\nTo make sustainable improvements in gender diversity in senior management, we are changing how we hire, progress and retain talented women, with a bank-wide action plan introduced in 2022. For instance, by the end of 2022, we put a requirement in place with external recruitment firms to provide gender diverse candidate lists. We also use a structured and objective hiring process and aim to ensure our talent identification, succession, performance and reward processes are equitable and mitigate the risk of gender bias. We also created a more gender-inclusive and family-friendly workplace. We promote support for parental leave and flexible working to make sure all parents have the chance to be successful professionally while managing their family lives. The pandemic has showed us that our people continued to deliver for our customers and that flexible working enhances the lives of employees - especially those with care-giving responsibilities - and this matters to us. This is why we remain an advocate of hybrid working and give our people that flexibility.\n\nTo build a strong internal pipeline of talented women into leadership roles, we support and nurture top talent. We introduced a new leadership acceleration programme, with a 54 (female)/46 (male) percent gender split in the participant group and content that addresses gender-specific barriers to progression. We monitor the gender balance in our succession pipelines. We also extended targets to increase gender representation from our current top senior management roles to the leadership pipeline below. To understand women's experiences of ING, we launched a new, globally consistent exit survey, which will be analysed by gender, to identify the reasons for leaving and to make sure we take action to prevent regrettable loss of female talent.\n\nTo understand the experiences of all our employees, we use the OHI survey and psychological safety index. We identify different experiences based on gender and other organisational and personal demographics and then delve deeper to determine further actions. One of the ways we create a more equal and inclusive workplace is through external and independent review. ING is one of the 418 firms recognised in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index (GEI). The Index offers public companies the opportunity to disclose information on how they promote gender equality across five separate areas: female leadership and talent pipeline, equal pay and gender pay parity, inclusive culture, sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. In 2022, ING scored 70.35%, a small improvement on the 70.26% score from 2021. This is the seventh year we have been included in the listing with feedback guiding our future actions.\n\nIn addition to our action on gender diversity, 32 thriving employee networks help us advance our diversity and inclusion efforts. These networks raise awareness and create connection, focusing on gender, LGBTIQ+, race and ethnicity, cultural diversity, accessibility and age. To celebrate the diversity of our global workforce, we held our fourth consecutive Global D&I Day, with 26 countries participating in over 120 events.\n\nING is a founding partner of Workplace Pride, dedicated to improving the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and queer (LGBTIQ+) people in workplaces worldwide. Its activities include the Workplace Pride Global Benchmark. In 2022, ING scored 78.8% and was recognised as a Workplace Pride Ambassador.\n\n## Vitality\n\nWe care about our people. We seek to encourage and support healthy and effective working, so they can deliver on ING's strategic priorities and thrive in life. Our approach to this has developed since the pandemic as our way of working has evolved.\n\nWe seek to we embed vitality in our working culture and promote healthy working habits. We offer employee assistance programmes, toolkits for managers and employees, and various locally tailored programmes to support the physical and mental vitality of our people. We also promote learning content on vitality topics on our My Learning platform. To reinforce this priority, we have also created a new leadership position. Our global head of Vitality works across our bank-wide network to enhance the vitality and resilience of our people.\n\nMany vitality initiatives are locally driven and specifically tailored to local needs. For instance, the My vitality platform, launched in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg in 2020. It inspires and supports over 7,500 registered users with high-impact programmes on physical, mental, emotional energy and purpose. In total, My vitality users registered over 4.8 million km via smart devices in walking, running, cycling, swimming and any other way to move forward.\n\nIn Germany, Turkey, the UK and the US, local initiatives were introduced including workshops on physical and mental vitality, sport events and health check-ups.\n\nThe situation in Ukraine required support for many colleagues, especially those in Eastern European countries. Since the war started, ING has organised fundraising, arranged support for employees and offered assistance programmes to employees and their families. Additionally, employees in the countries neighbouring Ukraine voluntarily hosted colleagues and their family members.\n\n## Employee experience\n\nProviding a superior customer experience is a strategic priority. This matters just as much for employees and we are therefore focused on continuing to improve our employee experience. We aim to provide personal, easy, and efficient services that encourage our people to unlock their full potential and be the best they can be. In 2022, we continued to digitalise our people services with a new virtual assistant (available for employees 24/7 in the Netherlands, Poland hubs and Manila hubs) and the introduction of our HR system Workday to 60% of all employees. We also continued to review and improve critical moments in the employee journey such as onboarding and international assignments. We started to focus on high-volume services such as expense reimbursements, job changes and people recruitment, which are major contributors to a superior employee experience. Finally, we continued to safely manage our HR operations to protect employee data and keep people processes compliant.",

We saw these efforts positively reflected in our primary customer numbers, NPS and volumes mobilised in sustainable finance.\n\nIn our full-year net profit of \u20ac3,674 million we saw the benefits of the rising interest rate environment, and a healthy growth in both lending and deposits.

        "page_content": "- > Our performance\n\nIn 2022, Retail Banking showed a good commercial performance. However, net result declined 5.9% to \u20ac2,862 million due to the impact of exceptional items in income and higher risk costs in 2022. The result before tax decreased 6.3% to \u20ac3,983 million.\n\nIncome decreased by \u20ac171 million, or 1.4%, and this included the negative impact of unwinding our TLTROrelated derivative position in 4Q2022, as a result of ECB's decision to change the conditions for the TLTRO programme. The net TLTRO impact in 2022 was \u20ac-123 million compared to a \u20ac152 million benefit in 2021. Income in 2022 was also impacted by \u20ac-563 million of exceptional items, consisting of \u20ac-343 million impact from the introduction of the Polish mortgage moratorium, \u20ac-247 million to unwind a macro fair value hedge in Belgium and \u20ac-165 million for impairments on our stake in TTB, only partly offset by \u20ac125 million income from the transfer of our investment business in France and a \u20ac67 million gain from a legacy entity in Belgium. Excluding TLTRO and those exceptional items, income rose 5.5%. The increase was mainly in net interest income on liabilities following central bank rate increases while deposit tracking was still limited. Net interest income on lending products declined, reflecting delayed tracking of higher cost of funds in client rates as well as reduced levels of prepayments on mortgages. Net core lending growth, which excludes currency impacts, Treasury and the run-off in Westland Utrecht Bank and France (as from the second quarter of 2022), was \u20ac15.8 billion, of which \u20ac11.2 billion was in residential mortgages, largely in Germany. Net core deposits growth (also adjusted for the run-off in France) was \u20ac18.9 billion in 2022, primarily in the Netherlands. Net fee and commission income rose 2.5%, driven by a strong increase in daily banking products, reflecting higher package fees, recovery of international payments and the introduction of new fees. This compensated for lower fees from investment products due to a decline in stock markets and subdued trading activity.\n\nOperating expenses declined by \u20ac140 million, or 1.8%, compared with 2021. Expenses in 2022 included \u20ac233 million of incidental items, largely related to restructuring provisions (mainly in Belgium and France) and the addition of the interest-on-interest effect to the compensation for customers of certain Dutch consumer credit products. In 2021, incidental items had amounted to \u20ac455 million, primarily reflecting redundancy provisions and impairments related to the decision to exit the retail banking markets in France and the Czech Republic and provisions in the Netherlands for the closure of branches and the compensation for certain consumer credit products. Expenses excluding regulatory costs and incidental items were wellcontained, despite inflationary pressure, and increased 0.8%. The cost/income ratio was 62.0% in 2022 compared with 62.3% in 2021.\n\nNet additions to loan loss provisions for Retail Banking increased to \u20ac639 million, from \u20ac399 million in 2021, but with 14 basis points of average customer lending remained well below the through-the-cycle average. Risk costs in 2022 included \u20ac431 million of Stage 3 provisioning and \u20ac208 million of net additions in Stage 1 and 2, and were mainly recorded in Poland, Belgium and Germany.\n\n## Market Leaders\n\n## Retail Netherlands\n\nThe result before tax of Retail Netherlands increased 4.0% to \u20ac2,014 million from \u20ac1,936 million in 2021. This increase was attributable to lower expenses, mainly due to lower incidental cost items, partly offset by lower income and limited risk costs, after a net release in 2021.\n\nTotal income declined by \u20ac66 million to \u20ac4,196 million, fully due to a net TLTRO impact of \u20ac-78 million compared to a \u20ac53 million benefit in 2021. Excluding TLTRO, income rose 1.5%. Net interest income excluding TLTRO declined 8.4% due to lower margins on lending products, reflecting the lengthening of the duration of the book and lower prepayment penalties. This was partly offset by higher liabilities income as margins improved and volumes increased. Net core lending (which excludes Treasury products and a \u20ac0.8 billion decline in the Westland Utrecht Bank run-off portfolio) grew by \u20ac3.0 billion in 2022, of which \u20ac2.2 billion was in residential mortgages and \u20ac0.8 billion in other lending. Net core deposits growth (excluding Treasury) was \u20ac12.9 billion, mainly in savings accounts. Net fee and commission income strongly increased by \u20ac121 million, or 15.7%, mainly due to higher fee income from daily banking products, supported by increased fees for payment packages and new service fees for business banking. Investment and other income rose by \u20ac216 million, mainly attributable to higher results from Treasury-related products.\n\nOperating expenses declined to \u20ac2,115 million from \u20ac2,403 million in 2021, mainly due to a drop in incidental cost items. 2022 included a \u20ac75 million provision for adding the interest-on-interest effect to the compensation for customers on certain Dutch consumer credit products, while 2021 had contained \u20ac289 million of incidental costs. Excluding these incidental items, expenses declined by \u20ac73 million, or 3.5%, mainly driven by lower staff and office-space-related expenses, as well as lower regulatory costs.\n\nThe net addition to loan loss provisions was \u20ac67 million, or 4 basis points of average customer lending, compared to a net release of \u20ac76 million, or -5 basis points, in the previous year. The limited net additions in 2022 were mainly related to business lending and consumer lending, while risk costs for the mortgage portfolio were negligible.\n\n## Retail Belgium\n\nRetail Belgium includes ING's Retail activities in Luxembourg. The result before tax of Retail Belgium declined to \u20ac223 million compared with \u20ac583 million in 2021. The decline was almost fully due to an impact of \u20ac-247 million to unwind a macro fair value hedge and \u20ac97 million of incidental expenses in 2022.\n\nIncome fell by \u20ac328 million to \u20ac2,147 million from \u20ac2,475 million in 2021. Net interest income was 4.5% lower at \u20ac1,668 million, including a net TLTRO impact of \u20ac-29 million compared to a \u20ac76 million benefit in 2021. Excluding TLTRO, interest result rose 1.6%, driven by higher liabilities income as margins improved,",

Net core lending (excluding Treasury) increased by \u20ac3.6 billion in 2022, of which \u20ac1.4 billion was in mortgages and \u20ac2.2 billion in other lending. Net core deposits (excluding Treasury) were flat on 2021, as an increase in savings and deposits was offset by a decline in current accounts. Net fee and commission income decreased by \u20ac8 million, or 1.5%, as lower fees on investment products were only partly compensated by price increases for payment packages. Investment and other income dropped by \u20ac241 million, due to the \u20ac-247 million impact of the hedge unwinding in 2022 and a \u20ac25 million capital gain on the sale of an associate in the prior year, partly offset by a \u20ac67 million gain from a legacy entity in 2022.\n\nOperating expenses increased by \u20ac119 million and included \u20ac97 million of incidental costs which were mostly restructuring costs related to the optimisation of the branch network. Excluding these incidental items, cost growth was limited to 1.3% as the impact of automatic salary indexation could largely be compensated by FTE reductions and lower IT expenses.\n\nThe net addition to the provision for loan losses decreased to \u20ac139 million, or 15 basis points of average customer lending. In 2021, the net addition had been \u20ac225 million, equivalent to 25 basis points. The decline year-on-year was driven by lower risk costs in the mortgage and consumer lending portfolios.\n\n## Challengers & Growth Markets\n\n## Retail Germany\n\nRetail Germany included ING's retail activities in Austria until the sale in December 2021.\n\nThe result before tax increased 14.6% to \u20ac901 million compared with \u20ac786 million in 2021, driven by higher income and lower expenses, partly offset by increased risk costs.\n\nTotal income rose 8.1% to \u20ac2,172 million from \u20ac2,009 million in 2021. Net interest income increased 15.1%, supported by significantly higher margins on liabilities. The increase was only partly offset by lending margin pressure, a \u20ac35 million lower net TLTRO impact (\u20ac-19 million in 2022 compared to a \u20ac16 million benefit in 2021) and the impact of the discontinuation of ING's Retail Banking activities in Austria in the previous year. In 2022, net core lending growth (which excludes Treasury products and the Austrian run-off portfolio as from the second quarter of 2021) was \u20ac6.1 billion, almost entirely in residential mortgages. Net core deposits rose by \u20ac0.8 billion as a net outflow in the first half of the year was followed by a strong inflow in the second half of the year. Net fee income declined by \u20ac60 million, or 12.1%, mainly in investment products after a record-high level in 2021, partly compensated by higher fees from daily banking. Investment and other income increased by \u20ac4 million, as a \u20ac26 million one-off loss related to the transfer of our retail operations in Austria recorded in 2021 was partly offset by lower Treasury-related revenues in 2022.\n\nOperating expenses decreased by \u20ac34 million, or 2.9%, to \u20ac1,140 million in 2022, reflecting savings following the discontinuation of the Austrian retail banking activities as well as lower regulatory costs due to an adjustment of the deposit guarantee contributions in 2022. These decreases were partly offset by higher staff costs and an increase in marketing expenses to support customer growth, as well as \u20ac10 million of incidental items for staff allowances and restructuring costs.\n\nNet additions to loan loss provisions increased to \u20ac131 million (13 basis points of average customer lending) compared with only \u20ac49 million (5 basis points) in 2021. Risk costs in 2022 were primarily related to consumer lending.\n\n## Retail Other\n\nRetail Other consists of the Other Challengers & Growth Markets, including our bank stakes in Asia.\n\nRetail Other's result before tax declined to \u20ac845 million, from \u20ac949 million in 2021, mainly due to higher regulatory costs in Poland and higher risk costs.\n\nTotal income rose by \u20ac61 million to \u20ac3,663 million. Net interest income was up 0.5% to \u20ac2,726 million, despite a \u20ac-343 million impact from new mortgage moratorium regulation imposed by the Polish government. Excluding this impact, net interest income increased 13.2%. This increase mainly reflected higher margins on liabilities, notably in Poland, Australia and Spain, following increases in central bank interest rates. Interest income on lending products declined in most of the countries due to tighter lending margins. Net customer lending (adjusted for currency effects, Treasury and the run-off portfolio in France as from the second quarter of 2022) grew by \u20ac3.2 billion in 2022, with growth in all countries. Net core deposits growth (also adjusted for currency impacts and Treasury as well as the France run-off portfolio) was \u20ac5.2 billion, primarily driven by net inflows in Spain, Australia and Poland. Net fee and commission income rose by \u20ac5 million to \u20ac535 million, supported by higher daily banking and insurance fees. These increases were largely offset by lower fees from investment products, reflecting low stock markets and subdued trading activity and the impact of ING's exit from the French retail market. Investment and other income rose to \u20ac402 million and included \u20ac125 million income from the transfer of our investment business in France and \u20ac-165 million for impairments on ING's equity stake in TTB. Excluding these exceptional income items, investment and other income increased by \u20ac81 million, mainly due to higher Treasury-related income and the proceeds from the sale of a non-performing loan portfolio in Spain.\n\nOperating expenses rose by \u20ac64 million, or 2.6%, to \u20ac2,516 million. In 2022, expenses included \u20ac51 million of incidental items, mainly consisting of restructuring provisions related to the discontinuation of our retail banking activities in France and the Philippines and the refocusing of our partnership for insurance propositions. 2021 had included \u20ac166 million of incidental costs, mainly consisting of restructuring provisions and impairments related to ING's decision to exit the retail banking markets in France and the Czech Republic. Regulatory costs increased by \u20ac100 million as 2022 contained a \u20ac99 million contribution to",

Excluding incidental items and regulatory costs, expenses increased by \u20ac79 million, primarily attributable to inflationary pressure across all markets, investments in operational process improvements in Australia and \u20ac21 million for a litigation provision in Spain.\n\nThe net addition to loan loss provisions amounted to \u20ac302 million, or 28 basis points of average customer lending, in 2022. In the previous year this had been \u20ac202 million, or 20 basis points. Risk costs in 2022 were primarily attributable to net additions in Poland and Spain.\n\n## Wholesale Banking\n\n## Wholesale Banking\n\n| in EUR million                                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income                                        |        |        |\n| - Net interest income                         | 4,260  | 4,151  |\n| - Net fee and commission income               | 1,217  | 1,197  |\n| - Total investment and other income           | 849    | 568    |\n| Total income                                  | 6,325  | 5,916  |\n| of which:                                     |        |        |\n| Lending                                       | 3,157  | 3,129  |\n| Daily Banking & Trade Finance                 | 1,662  | 1,310  |\n| Financial Markets                             | 1,226  | 1,104  |\n| Treasury & Other                              | 280    | 374    |\n| Total income                                  | 6,325  | 5,916  |\n| Expenses excl. regulatory costs               | 2,821  | 2,671  |\n| Regulatory costs                              | 293    | 255    |\n| Operating expenses                            | 3,114  | 2,926  |\n| Gross result                                  | 3,211  | 2,990  |\n| - Addition to loan loss provisions            | 1,220  | 117    |\n| Result before taxation                        | 1,991  | 2,874  |\n| Taxation                                      | 581    | 703    |\n| Non-controlling interests                     | 52     | 26     |\n| Net result IFRS                               | 1,358  | 2,144  |\n| Key figures                                   |        |        |\n| Net core lending growth (in \u20ac billion)        | 2.4    | 13.1   |\n| Net core deposits growth (in \u20ac billion)       | 6.2    | -2.6   |\n| Risk costs in bps of average customer lending | 65     | 7      |\n\nIn 2022, Wholesale Banking turned in a strong commercial performance. This was fully offset, however, by a sharp increase in risk costs, partly due to the Russian invasion in the Ukraine and compared with an exceptionally low level in 2021. Therefore the net result was 36.7% lower at \u20ac1,358 million. The result before tax decreased 30.7% to \u20ac1,991 million from \u20ac2,874 million in 2021.\n\nTotal income rose 6.9% to \u20ac6,325 million in 2022 compared with \u20ac5,916 million in 2021, primarily reflecting income growth in Daily Banking & Trade Finance and Financial Markets. Net interest income increased by \u20ac109 million, or 2.6%, driven by Payments & Cash Management which benefited strongly from higher interest rates. The increase was largely offset by a \u20ac168 million lower net TLTRO impact (which was \u20ac20 million in 2022 compared with \u20ac188 million in the previous year) and lower interest income in Financial Markets. The net core lending book (adjusted for currency impacts and excluding Treasury and the Lease run-off portfolio) grew by \u20ac2.4 billion in 2022. Strong growth in Lending was largely offset by a net outflow in Daily Banking & Trade Finance and in Financial Markets. Net core deposits (excluding currency impacts and Treasury) increased by \u20ac6.2 billion, primarily in Payments & Cash Management. Net fee and commission income rose by \u20ac20 million, or 1.7%, supported by strong fee growth in Lending, which was largely offset by the impact of a lower deal flow in Global Capital Markets due to adverse market conditions. Investment and other income surged by \u20ac281 million, mainly driven by higher trading results in Financial Markets, only partly offset by Treasury & Other which included a \u20ac-41 million hedge accounting impact in Belgium.\n\nOperating expenses increased 6.4% to \u20ac3,114 million from \u20ac2,926 million in 2021. Expenses in 2022 included \u20ac38 million higher regulatory costs and \u20ac10 million of incidental items mainly related to restructuring costs, while 2021 had included a \u20ac44 million impairment on Payvision. Excluding these incidental items and regulatory costs, expenses increased 7.0%, of which 2.8% was FX impacts, reflecting the weakening of the euro relative to other currencies. The remaining increase was mainly attributable to higher staff costs (due to CLA increases and indexation), partly mitigated by continued cost-efficiency measures.\n\nThe addition to loan loss provisions was \u20ac1,220 million, or 65 basis points of average customer lending, while in 2021 risk costs had been exceptionally low at \u20ac117 million, or 7 basis points of average customer lending. Risk costs in 2022 were significantly impacted by the Russian invasion in Ukraine, which led to a net addition of \u20ac533 million on our Russia-related exposure. The remainder was mainly due to an increase in Stage 3 individual risk costs, partly as a result of a more negative macroeconomic outlook.\n\nLending income increased slightly to \u20ac3,157 million. Net interest income declined by \u20ac17 million fully due to a \u20ac57 million lower net TLTRO impact. Excluding TLTRO, interest result increased 1.6% as higher average volumes more than compensated for lower interest margins. Net fee and commission income increased by \u20ac88 million or 19.3%, reflecting significantly higher fee income from several sectors. Investment and other income declined by \u20ac42 million, mainly due to negative fair value adjustments and secondary sales discounts.",

Focusing on customer needs and managing risks, overseeing and continuously challenging management, as well as further integrating ESG into our strategy, kept us on our toes.\n\n## Adaptability is ING's strength\n\nThe year was initially marked by Covid-19 and then by the war in Ukraine, an immense human tragedy. The macroeconomic consequences, ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and pressures on the business environment required our full attention to manage the impact on ING and our stakeholders as well as possible.\n\nAs always, the Executive Board and the Management Board Banking worked in close cooperation with us and updated us regularly on the developments regarding Ukraine and Russia, on how ING ensures the safety and well-being of impacted employees, as well as business continuity. I was impressed by how ING employees rallied to support colleagues affected by the war.\n\nLooking back, I'm pleased with how ING kept its solid footing and performed well in such a challenging business environment. The adversity in the world brought out the best of ING and our people.\n\nEarly in February 2023, Turkey and Syria were hit by devastating earthquakes which caused many lives to be lost and irreparable damage. ING has about 600 people working in the Kahramanmara\u015f area. We are doing everything we can to help colleagues and their families in the region. Across ING, many fundraising initiatives for humanitarian aid took place. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this disaster, including our colleagues, customers, their families and friends.\n\n## Updated strategy\n\nAdvising and challenging management when updating the strategy and overseeing its execution was another top priority for the Supervisory Board. It's crucial for any company to adjust to new conditions and adapt to changes. I'm proud of how ING adapted throughout 2022, which is the 'orange' thread running throughout ING's history. Adaptability is fundamental for building resilience which in today's ever-changing world is essential to weather any storm.\n\nThe Supervisory Board supported the Executive Board in developing the updated strategy that our CEO presented in 2022. This focuses on customers and sustainability, ambitious targets for income and fee growth, a declining cost/income ratio towards 50-52%, a CET1 ratio that gradually moves to around 12.5% and an ROE of 12%. We are confident that the leadership of our bank has all the capabilities, focus and energy to deliver these targets in the years to come.",

I'm pleased with the interaction and collaboration throughout the year between the SB and the EB and MBB. We also had regular interaction with customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders such as external supervisors and regulators.\n\n## From ESG to diversity and inclusion\n\nOther topics on our agenda ranged from ESG and diversity and inclusion to regulatory themes like antimoney laundering, cybersecurity and compliance with sanctions.\n\nRegarding ESG, in March 2022, in line with our commitment to put sustainability at the heart of what we do, we updated our ESG governance approach. At the Supervisory Board level we've created a special ESG Committee responsible for supervising our ESG performance and advising the MBB on dilemmas.\n\nI'm proud how all at ING continued the fight against climate change and how we supported and advised customers in their transition to more sustainable business. It's not easy and there are many opposing views to take into account, but ING does not shy away from its responsibilities. ING has been at the forefront of the financial sector's response to climate change for several years now and we strive to play a leadership role now and in the future.\n\nAnother important topic in our meetings was the bank-wide approach to diversity, inclusion and belonging. We are very much motivated to advance and increase diversity and inclusion as we believe in the strength of diverse teams. More needs to be done, especially on the under-representation of women in leadership positions. We make the difference through the actions of our people and the workforce needs to reflect the customers and communities we serve.\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe ECB, in its capacity as supervisor, intensified the monitoring of the consequences of the stoppage of Russian gas supply to Europe and it led to an increased scrutiny of the financial projections of banks. In response to the war in Ukraine, the EU imposed unprecedented sanction packages against Russia, which also heavily affected the financial services industry. And the EU's focus on the climate transition and the need for green investments led to a prioritised ESG legislative agenda. This agenda will only be a success if it triggers large investments by the private sector. I sincerely hope that the EU and national regulators will be able to develop an effective set of incentives and avoid complexity with regulation and reporting standards.\n\n## Changes in the SB and MBB\n\nI want to thank all the members of the Supervisory Board for their hard work, dedication and commitment in this challenging year. And a special 'thank you' to Mariana Gheorghe, who, after eight years of valuable contribution, will step down from the board following the Annual General Meeting in 2023.\n\nWe recently announced my intention to hand over my duties as chairman and retire from the ING Group Supervisory Board in the second half of 2023. I made that decision, because it is a good moment for me to move on to pursue other activities. With the proposal to appoint Karl Guha to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting in 2023, I am very pleased that we have found a new chairman with a long and distinguished career in the financial sector, spanning multiple phases and covering various aspects. Our bank has the right strategy and the right leadership that is delivering sustainable value for our customers and society at large. I am confident that together with him, our Supervisory Board will continue on that path.\n\nThere will also be changes in the MBB in 2023. At the end of 2022, we announced that Ron van Kemenade, chief technology officer, and Aris Bogdaneris, head of Retail Banking and Challengers & Growth Markets, will leave ING. I want to thank them and the other members of the EB and MBB for their cooperation, trust and contribution to the success of ING in 2022. And a special 'thank you' to our employees worldwide who are the foundation of our success and the driving force behind our good NPS scores, growth in primary customers and our strong performance in 2022.\n\nThis, and ING's proven strength, gives me confidence that we are well-positioned for whatever 2023 has in store.",

The updated strategy is built around ING's purpose of 'empowering people to stay a step ahead in life and in business'. The war in Ukraine and the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and pressure on the global economy were closely monitored, managing and controlling risks, while assisting our employees and customers wherever possible. Emphasis continued to be placed on ING's risk culture and further strengthening our global anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) activities. Sustainability was also a priority for the SB. To assist with performing its ESG-related duties, the Supervisory Board appointed an ESG committee.\n\nIn 2022, the Supervisory Board maintained a regular dialogue with the Executive Board (EB) and the Management Board Banking (MBB) on ING's strategic priorities. Two overarching strategic priorities were defined: giving customers a superior experience and putting sustainability at the heart of what we do. For more information see the 'Our strategy' chapter. At the request of the Supervisory Board, deep dives were organised on various topics relating to strategy. This was the result of one of the priorities agreed by the Supervisory Board for 2022 to ensure time is spent in meetings on strategy and sustainability, business and financial performance, risk management and regulatory requirements. The Supervisory Board also monitored the execution of the strategy by discussing the challenges and opportunities of the strategic priorities, countries, business and projects on a quarterly basis with the EB and the MBB.\n\nThe year 2022 was marked by the war in Ukraine, which is having a devastating impact on people's lives and is threatening international stability and security. The Supervisory Board and its committees closely monitored the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and pressure on the global economy and its impact on ING and its stakeholders. Lower economic growth, exceptionally high inflation and high energy prices have severely impacted consumers and companies. The EB and the MBB provided the Supervisory Board and its committees with frequent updates on developments in Russia and Ukraine. This included how ING safeguards the safety and well-being of impacted employees, business continuity and operational\n\nresilience, how ING manages IT and cybersecurity risks, our exposure to Russia and Ukraine and complying with sanctions.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is committed to continue working with the EB and the MBB on further enhancing and embedding 'environmental, social & governance' (ESG) principles into ING's internal processes and business activities. In this respect, the Supervisory Board appointed an ad hoc ESG Committee from among its members to assist with overseeing ESG-related topics. See 'ESG Committee' for further details.\n\nThe Supervisory Board met 15 times in 2022 for its regular meetings. On average, 99% of the Supervisory Board members participated in the meetings. See the attendance matrix for the Supervisory Board meetings and committee meetings for more details. The continued high attendance demonstrates that Supervisory Board members are engaged with ING and are able to devote sufficient time and attention to overseeing its affairs.\n\n## SB attendance 2022 1\n\n|                                | SB    | RiCo 2   | AC   | NCGcom 3   | RemCo   | ESGcom 4   |\n|--------------------------------|-------|----------|------|------------|---------|------------|\n| Hans Wijers (chair)            | 15/15 | 10/10    | 7/7  | 12/12      | 7/7     | 3/3        |\n| Mike Rees (vice-chair)         | 14/15 | 10/10    | 7/7  |            |         |            |\n| Juan Colomb\u00e1s                  | 14/15 | 10/10    | 7/7  |            |         |            |\n| Mariana Gheorghe               | 15/15 | 10/10    |      | 12/12      | 7/7     | 3/3        |\n| Margarete Haase                | 15/15 | 10/10    | 7/7  |            |         |            |\n| Lodewijk Hijmans van den Bergh | 15/15 | 10/10    |      |            |         | 3/3        |\n| Herman Hulst                   | 15/15 | 10/10    | 7/7  |            |         | 3/3        |\n| Harold Naus                    | 15/15 | 10/10    |      | 1/1        | 6/7     |            |\n| Herna Verhagen 5               | 15/15 | 2/2      |      | 11/12      | 7/7     |            |\n| Total attendance 6             | 99%   | 100%     | 100% | 97%        | 96%     | 100%       |\n\nAbbreviations used: SB = Supervisory Board, RiCo = Risk Committee, AC = Audit Committee, NCGcom = Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee, RemCo = Remuneration Committee; ESGcom = ESG Committee",

It approves, among others, any intended outside positions as and when they occur to safeguard this level of engagement.\n\nIn addition to the information included in this Supervisory Board report, information on the Supervisory Board can be found in 'Our leadership', 'Corporate governance' and the 'Remuneration report', which information is deemed to be incorporated, by reference, herein.\n\n## Supervisory Board meetings\n\nThe Supervisory Board discussed a wide range of topics during the year. In its deliberations on the various topics the Supervisory Board considers the customers' and other stakeholders' interests in view of ING's function in society.\n\nIn addition to the topics mentioned in the introduction, the Supervisory Board discussed, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 The economic and political developments and their effects, such as the energy crisis, inflation, shortages in the economy and the rapidly slowing economy.\n- \u00b7 Progress of ING's performance in the various business lines on key financial and non-financial metrics.\n- \u00b7 Diversity and inclusion, including, e.g. the bank-wide diversity and inclusion approach and specifically gender diversity in senior management.\n- \u00b7 ESG-related matters in relation to strategy, including, among others, sustainability, climate risk and energy transition.\n- \u00b7 The continued impact of Covid-19 on ING's performance and its stakeholders (e.g. how to empower customers to remain in charge of their banking and their finances, how to equip employees for a hybrid way of working in which flexibility is central, and how to help communities to build back better).\n- \u00b7 Ongoing supervisory developments, such as the European Central Bank's Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) and related matters such as the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP), the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP) and (climate risk-related) stress testing.\n- \u00b7 ING's financial, non-financial and compliance risks, and in this respect, among other things, ING's gatekeeper role and ensuring the security and compliance of the bank through enhancing and maturing ING's KYC priorities, supported by structural solutions (see 'Strengthening ING's global AML/KYC capabilities' and 'Risk management' for further details on ING's AML/KYC measures); and strengthening ING's risk culture.\n- \u00b7 Several topical regulatory themes with a global ING scope such as data strategy and management, IT and cybersecurity, sourcing, developments in Russia and Ukraine, compliance with sanctions, the KYC enhancement programme and leveraged transactions.\n\n- \u00b7 The financing of the company in accordance with ING's capital and liquidity adequacy, ING's capital plan and ING's dividend and distribution policy, and additional distributions including cash dividend payments and share buyback programmes in line with such policy (see the 'Our shares' chapter).\n- \u00b7 The audit plans of the internal and external auditor.\n- \u00b7 Various nomination and succession planning-related matters for the EB, the MBB and the Supervisory Board.\n- \u00b7 Various remuneration-related matters, such as the annual review of the Reward and Appointment Framework and the ING Remuneration and Regulations Framework.\n- \u00b7 The functioning of the Supervisory Board and its committees, EB and MBB, supported by annual collective self-evaluations, and the functioning of their individual members.\n\nThe EB and MBB were present at each regular Supervisory Board meeting. For some parts of these meetings, depending on the nature of the topics discussed, only the chief executive officer (CEO) was present. The Supervisory Board also had sessions without the EB and the MBB prior to its regular meetings when this was justified by the nature of the topics on the agenda. The purpose of these so-called pre-meetings and Supervisory Board-only meetings is to allow the Supervisory Board to reflect independently on and consider important matters in the absence of the EB and MBB.\n\nOutside of the collective meetings, there was frequent interaction between the chairs of the relevant SB committees and the members of the EB to ensure that - at all times - everyone was up-to-date on the most recent developments. Furthermore, the chairs of the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee agreed that they will continue informal interaction with the chairs of local risk and audit committees of ING's five largest subsidiaries to enrich the Supervisory Board dialogue. Also, Supervisory Board members who do not chair committees were assigned specific focus areas that best fit their skills, knowledge and experience to further enhance well-informed Supervisory Board decision-making and challenge. The 2022 focus areas were risk culture, models and stress testing, operational resilience, SOx framework and controls, KYC, ESG (including sustainability and governance) and IT (including digital and cybersecurity).\n\n## Continuous dialogue with stakeholders\n\nING maintains continuous interaction with stakeholders, and aims to strike a balance between the interests of all stakeholders, including customers, shareholders, employees, regulators, supervisors and society at large. In 2022, the Supervisory Board had periodic conversations with various stakeholders. It exercised its oversight role, which aimed to ensure that, actions resulting from this, were embedded in the organisation and followed up, including actions related to strategy. The dialogue between ING and external supervisors and regulators was a standard agenda item for the Supervisory Board throughout the year. This included several discussions on the results of and follow-up to the annual SREP, through which the ECB aims to promote a resilient banking system as a prerequisite for a sustainable and sound financing of the economy.",

Since 2017, ING has been working to strengthen customer due diligence, transaction monitoring and screening in a sustainable way for the longer term and to better contribute to the fight against financial economic crime through the global KYC enhancement programme. Various initiatives have been implemented to further enhance AML/KYC activity throughout the bank. Among other things, this has led to standardised KYC policies, global KYC governance and harmonisation of processes, tooling and training. Further developments are captured in the Financial Economic Crime (FEC) Controls Maturity programme, which defines and further enhances ING's operational long-term FEC control framework to manage and mitigate financial and economic crime risks in a sustainable, risk-based way. Progress is monitored by and discussed between the SB, management and the relevant supervisors.\n\nIn 2022, the Supervisory Board was updated at least quarterly on developments regarding KYC and relevant specifics were discussed in more detail. This was facilitated through thematic sessions on various topics such as, among others, the KYC enhancement programme as agreed with DNB. These sessions also contributed to the Supervisory Board's continuous learning.\n\n## Permanent education including exchange with the business\n\nIt is important for the members of the Supervisory Board, as part of their continuous learning, to participate in the permanent education and exchange with ING's business on a regular basis. The latter is aimed at keeping the SB up to date on ING-relevant knowledge, skills and expertise and expanding these where necessary. It is meant to increase the Supervisory Board's understanding of and engagement with ING's business operations and stakeholders.\n\nThe annual knowledge days, which were held on 13 and 14 January 2022, were combined with regular Supervisory Board meetings and focused on ESG.\n\nAs part of the annual business visit, the entire Supervisory Board, together with the EB and MBB, visited ING in Germany in September 2022. This allowed the Supervisory Board to get a better understanding of local business challenges and the market opportunities of ING in Germany.\n\nThroughout the year, a number of other educational sessions on specific topics facilitated by relevant experts were organised for the Supervisory Board. For 2022, a balance was sought between sessions focused on compliance, ESG, operational resilience and sessions focused on strategic business topics. The\n\nlatter included in-depth sessions on (1) ING's Wholesale Banking business and Retail Banking business, including Business Banking, (2) technology and IT platforms, (3) digital services and assets and (4) several country updates. Additionally, thematic sessions were organised to focus specifically on certain themes that needed further attention and/or to look forward at emerging risks and developments. Furthermore, several deep-dive sessions were organised on selected key topics. Both these thematic and deep-dive sessions had a substantial risk management component and contributed to a more in-depth understanding of the matters discussed. For more information, see 'Risk Committee'.\n\nThe various educational sessions provided opportunities for Supervisory Board members to interact with senior management and subject-matter experts. They also interacted in speed-meet sessions. These meetings were held in person, virtually and in hybrid mode. Such interaction contributes to a better mutual understanding and alignment on what matters most to ING, its employees and the Supervisory Board. As in previous years, the Supervisory Board will continue this practice.\n\n## Strategy based on long-term value creation\n\nIn 2022, ING introduced its updated strategy. The Supervisory Board had an active and continuous dialogue with the EB and the MBB on the strategy update. To successfully serve its purpose and make the difference for people and the planet, ING will focus on two overarching strategic priorities: giving its customers a superior experience and putting sustainability at the heart of what it does. ING has also defined four enabling priorities. ING will focus on (1) providing seamless, digital experience, (2) using its scalable technology and operations, (3) staying safe and secure and (4) unlocking the full potential of everyone working for ING.\n\nBy updating its strategy, ING is constantly adapting to the trends shaping the world around us and impacting customers, ING and the industry, with the aim of ensuring it seizes the opportunities flowing from today's reality and big trends to create long-term value.\n\nThe Supervisory Board acknowledges the responsibility it has to consider and balance the interests of all stakeholders of ING and makes sure to take this into account while delivery on the strategic priorities is being executed.\n\n## Financial and risk reporting\n\nThe EB prepared the financial statements and discussed these with the Supervisory Board, including the SOx Act 404 Report in relation to the Annual Report on Form 20-F. The quarterly results, including the relevant auditor reports and press releases, were discussed and approved in February, May, August and November 2022. The full-year 2021 financial results were discussed and approved in March 2022. In addition, elements relevant to the draft agenda for the 2022 AGM were discussed and decided on.

The financial statements will be submitted for adoption at the 2023 Annual General Meeting as part of the 2022 Annual Report. KPMG, in its role as ING's external auditor, audited ING's 2022 financial statements. As part of the standard procedures, KPMG declared itself independent from ING, in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Read more in 'Audit Committee' below.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was also informed in detail throughout the year of potential financial, non-financial and compliance risks for ING, including: the crisis with regard to the war in Ukraine; subsequent political and economic developments in various countries and regions; climate- and ESG-related risks; the continued implications of Covid-19; and updates on (upcoming) regulatory changes. The Supervisory Board discussed how these and other risks could best be mitigated, which included reviewing stress-test results performed by ING. In addition to internal stress tests and programmes related to known and anticipated risks, ING released its second integrated climate report in September 2022. It details ING's progress and targets on climate alignment in the nine sectors in ING's loan book most responsible for climate change. This progress and progress on other ESG related matters were monitored by the newly appointed ESG Committee.\n\nRead more on risk management in 'Risk Committee' below.\n\n## Internal Supervisory Board meetings\n\nDuring the 2022 internal meetings of the Supervisory Board (with the CEO attending, except when matters concerning him were discussed), among others, the following recurring topics were addressed:\n\n- \u00b7 The annual targets and periodic performance assessments of the EB and the MBB and their individual members. The Supervisory Board evaluates and assesses the functioning of the EB and the MBB, including questions of succession and remuneration, at least annually, in an internal meeting. For more information on the EB's performance assessment and reward process in 2022, see the 'Remuneration Report', which information is considered to be incorporated, by reference, in this SB report.\n- \u00b7 The composition of the EB and MBB.\n- \u00b7 The composition of the Supervisory Board including its committee composition (this year including the appointment of the ESG Committee).\n- \u00b7 ING's broader talent and succession planning in view of bench strength, including the outcome of ING's annual talent review.\n- \u00b7 Remuneration-related matters, including, but not limited to (1) the remuneration report, (2) the appointment/compensation/severance proposals of high earners and senior management in control functions and (3) the Variable Remuneration Accrual Model (VRAM) process.\n- \u00b7 The annual collective self-evaluation of the EB, the MBB and the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Supervisory Board annual collective self-evaluation\n\nAs in previous years, the Supervisory Board conducted an annual collective self-evaluation of the reporting year. This was facilitated by an independent external party and with input from several executives and senior managers who regularly interact with the Supervisory Board and attend its meetings. The selfevaluation addressed the 'what' (roles and responsibilities) and the 'how' (culture and behaviour) of the Supervisory Board. In addition to the traditional themes, the self-evaluation over 2022 also reflected on ING's strategy, digital and data developments, ESG, and geopolitical events.\n\n## Approach\n\nDuring the November 2022 Supervisory Board meeting, the Supervisory Board discussed and approved the annual collective self-evaluation process and design for the year 2022. In December 2022, input was gathered from the Supervisory Board members and frequent attendees. This, together with the outcome of the 2022 mid-year review and of the bilateral interactions between the chairman and each individual Supervisory Board member in January 2023, formed the basis for the collective Supervisory Board selfevaluation dialogue in February 2023. During this dialogue the Supervisory Board determined its collective positive points to maintain and its 2023 priorities for further improvement. This forms part of the Supervisory Board's practice to regularly deliberate on its collective performance i.e. towards year-end (to determine the next year's approach and potential specific themes to address), halfway through the year (to reflect on status and progress) and at the start of the year (to discuss the outcome of the previous year and agree on positive points to keep and points for further improvement).\n\n## Results\n\nThe Supervisory Board's collective dialogue on 1 February 2023 centred around the following questions: (1) Positive points: are the positive points previously identified still valid? Where has the Supervisory Board further improved, taking into account the continued focus on ESG and ongoing macroeconomic & geopolitical events? and (2) Priorities for further improvement: Did the Supervisory Board sufficiently progress in 2022 on the improvement areas previously defined? What are the priority areas to further improve in 2023?\n\nThe Supervisory Board's agreed priorities for 2022 included:\n\n- 1. Regarding the 'what': (1) safeguarding balance in open, constructive dialogue with the Executive Board and the Management Board Banking on business/market developments, including emerging risks, and",

Regarding the 'how': (1) Covid-19 permitting, the importance of returning to physical meetings with the Executive Board, the Management Board Banking and other ING representatives, and (ii) continue investing in access to and leveraging on knowledge, skills and experiences relevant to the Supervisory Board in the context of ING.\n\nDuring 2022, the Supervisory Board addressed all of the above and, where applicable, embedded enhancements in its standard working practice: With regard to the 'what', items (1) and (2) form part of the regular meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees, with a view to the Supervisory Board's role and responsibilities, supported by its comprehensive annual cycle of work. With regard to the 'how', item (1) was completed by the implementation of the Hybrid Mode as the Supervisory Board's new way of working, and item (2) was addressed by broadening the focus areas of the non-chair Supervisory Board members including the interactions within the organisation on these.\n\nLooking back on 2022, and compared to previous years, the Supervisory Board concluded that several positive points continued to be valid and had also further improved during 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Regarding the 'what', the following Supervisory Board strengths were recognised: (1) its effectiveness at overseeing, supervising, challenging and advising the Executive Board and Management Board Banking, (2) its understanding of the organisation's strategic priorities and relevant digital & data developments, the effectiveness with which ESG considerations are integrated into discussions and the monitoring of macroeconomic & geopolitical events, (3) its composition and the interface / working balance between the Committees and the Supervisory Board, and (4) its meeting management, meeting materials and the support available.\n- \u00b7 Regarding the 'how', the following positives were recognised: (1) the relationships between the Supervisory Board members and with the Executive Board and Management Board Banking, and (2) the understanding of the views and requirements of key stakeholders.\n\nLooking ahead, the Supervisory Board concluded that several priorities are still relevant and the following areas require further attention during 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Regarding the 'what' it identified: (1) safeguarding balance in open, constructive dialogue with the Executive Board and the Management Board Banking on strategy/business/market developments, including emerging risks, and time spent on shareholders' and other stakeholders' views on performance of the company, and (2) continue to be provided with fit-for-purpose supporting materials for board meetings.\n\n- \u00b7 Regarding the 'how' these attention points were identified: (1) Managing the change in composition of the Supervisory Board, and (2) Enhancing insight into people and talent processes.\n\nThe Supervisory Board agreed to a number of specific actions for 2023 to contribute to its performance, such as to:\n\n- 1. Further establish the Supervisory Board's oversight and governance on ESG through its dedicated ad-hoc Supervisory Board committee with a focus on further maturing the Social and Governance components.\n- 2. On people related matters, ensure continued attention for diversity & inclusion and enhance the Supervisory Board's view of the broader talent pipeline.\n- 3. Ensure continued focus is given to key topics, in addition to the aforementioned, such as ING's strategic priorities, digital & data, (non-financial) risk and geopolitical & macroeconomic developments, including the accessing of outside-in views of stakeholders.\n- 4. Enhance the quality of board meeting materials by highlighting the topic's most significant challenges & dilemmas and by being mindful of the length of materials.\n- 5. Maintain the effectiveness of the Supervisory Board throughout the imminent changes in its composition through continued team building events and attention for the individual members' areas of expertise.\n- 6. Support the CEO throughout the imminent organisational and composition changes of the Management Board Banking.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is of the opinion that the above contributes to overseeing and constructively challenging ING in its ambition to keep transforming into a data-driven digital bank in line with the strategy.\n\n## Committee meetings\n\nTo manage each of the committees' annual cycle of work and potential committee interdependencies, each committee has drawn up an annual work plan that is being kept up to date throughout the year for prioritysetting and forward-looking purposes. These plans all feed into the Supervisory Board's annual meeting cycle.\n\nFor an overview of the composition of the committees on 31 December 2022, see the table under 'Overview of Supervisory Board committee members'.",

During another Risk Committee meeting there was a combined session with the ESG Committee on climate risk stress testing. Since 2020, almost all Supervisory Board members have been members of the Risk Committee, due to the continued importance of risk and how this is managed and supervised.\n\nThe committee assists and advises the Supervisory Board with the performance of its duties in relation to overseeing: (1) the setting and monitoring of ING's risk appetite and risk strategy for all types of risk, including but not limited to financial, non-financial and compliance risk; (2) the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems; and (3) other related risk management topics. The Risk Committee prepares the discussions within and decisions of the Supervisory Board on such matters.\n\nThe Risk Committee aims to ensure that integrity continues to come first for ING and that critical nonfinancial risk areas stay top of mind, as an integral part of ING's identity. Through risk management ING builds strong foundations, supported by structural solutions that continue to earn and maintain the trust of its stakeholders, including its customers and society at large.\n\nDuring 2022, in light of the situation with regard to Russia and Ukraine and Covid-19, additional updates on financial, non-financial and compliance risk were provided, both separately and as recurring reporting to help continue and further bolster ING's customer diligence and stakeholder integrity. These updates included the status of ING's accompanying metrics for risks in the areas of solvency, liquidity and funding, credit, country, market, IT, non-financial risk and compliance. The discussions were supported by different analyses conducted on the potential impact of such events on ING's credit portfolio, capital and liquidity position, and updates on credit developments in certain countries and portfolios. With respect to the situation in Russia and Ukraine, the committee also addressed risks related to non-financial risk (including cybercrime) and sanctions. With respect to Covid-19, the committee addressed risks related to business continuity, business resilience, the working from home control environment, HR, and IT and cybercrime. Additional broad risk topics in relation to these events included (1) updates of the bank-wide KYC enhancement and maturity efforts, (2) a variety of topical dashboards such as on IT (risk), cybersecurity, sourcing, data quality and data privacy (including GDPR) and (3) the status of implementation of related regulatory programmes.\n\nThe Risk Committee also regularly discussed the status of reported whistleblower concerns. As part of the annual recurring topics, the Risk Committee discussed the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The annual review of the Risk Appetite Framework and accompanying principles and risk appetite statements.\n- \u00b7 The annual update to the Recovery Plan.\n- \u00b7 The review of the scope of ING's key policies.\n- \u00b7 The impact of upcoming regulations, and credit developments in certain countries and portfolios.\n\nAs mentioned, in addition to current topical events throughout the year, deep dives and thematic sessions also took place on specific topics. Deep dives are technical discussions on selected key topics that have substantial risk management relevance and that contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the matters at hand. In 2022, there were deep dives on IT and cybersecurity, ING's Risk Appetite Framework, data strategy and data management, the bank-wide KYC enhancement programme and liquidity and funding. Thematic sessions focus specifically on certain themes that need further attention and/or are looking forward at emerging risks and developments. Thematic sessions in 2022 encompassed: cybersecurity, ICAAP (including Economic Capital and Stress Testing), internal controls and key control testing, compliance, climate risk stress testing and modelling. All Supervisory Board members had a standing invitation for these sessions and participated in several of these as deemed relevant to them.\n\nAll relevant items discussed by the committee were reported to the Supervisory Board, with the Supervisory Board approving those items as required from a governance perspective.\n\nRead more on how ING manages its risks in 'Risk management'.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee met seven times in 2022. During one of its meetings there was a combined session with the ESG Committee on ESG disclosures.\n\nThe committee assists and advises the Supervisory Board with the performance of its duties in relation to the integrity and quality of ING's financial reporting, and the effectiveness of ING's internal risk management and control systems in relation to financial reporting and prepares the discussions within and the decisions of the Supervisory Board on such matters.\n\nThe Audit Committee addressed, among other things, the following recurring topics:\n\n- \u00b7 The quarterly results, the interim accounts and the financial statements, the press releases related to the periodic results, the Annual Report, the 6-K and 20-F forms and the SOx Act 404 Report.\n- \u00b7 Judgemental accounting topics.\n- \u00b7 Key audit matters, as included in the auditors' reports.",

These included, among other things, the following recurring topics:\n\n- \u00b7 ING's long-term CET1 ratio target level.\n- \u00b7 SOx Act framework and controls.\n- \u00b7 ING's dividend and distribution policy.\n- \u00b7 Capital and liquidity management.\n\nIn addition, in 2022, the Audit Committee addressed, among others, the developments in Russia and Ukraine, ICAAP governance, external audit quality indicators, IFRS 9, ESG-disclosures, ING's additional distributions including cash dividend payments and share buyback programmes and matters in the context of Covid-19 uncertainty.\n\nAll relevant items discussed by the committee were reported to the SB, with the Supervisory Board approving those items as required from a governance perspective. Directly following the Audit Committee meetings, the members of the Audit Committee met in a closed meeting with the internal and external auditors to seek confirmation that all relevant topics were discussed in the Audit Committee meetings.\n\nTo properly prepare for the regular Audit Committee meetings, the chairperson of the Audit Committee held separate sessions with the external auditor, the general manager of the internal audit department, the chief financial officer (CFO) and the Group Controller. The chairperson also met with various senior managers.\n\n## Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee\n\nThe Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee met 12 times in 2022, of which one was combined with the Remuneration Committee to address topics that simultaneously covered nomination as well as remuneration.\n\nThe committee assists the SB with the performance of its duties in relation to selection and nomination of, among others, the members of the Supervisory Board, EB and MBB, talent management and the effectiveness of ING's governance arrangements. The committee prepares the discussions with and decisions of the Supervisory Board on such matters.\n\nWith regard to nomination-related matters, ING aims to ensure that all of its boards are - at all times adequately composed to perform their duties. As its standard practice, the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee therefore discusses (1) the performance of the individual members of the EB and the MBB (also serving as input to the Remuneration Committee) and (2) medium- to long-term succession planning for the EB, the MBB and the Supervisory Board. A continuing conversation on EB and MBB succession planning is facilitated by the chief human resources officer as part of the regular Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee meetings in the form of deep dives by function and business line.\n\nWhen selecting suitable board succession candidates, various aspects are to be taken into account in view of board composition, such as regulatory requirements, suitability considerations, banking and other industry knowledge, outside positions, independence, no conflicts of interest and availability. Also the minimum and optimal size of a board and diversity aspects such as how to arrive at an appropriate balance in its representation of regions, age, gender, knowledge and expertise are to be taken into account. The generic profiles of the EB and the Supervisory Board aim to capture these elements, which profiles can be found on ing.com. Read more on the boards' composition in the 'Composition of the Executive Board, Management Board Banking and Supervisory Board' section that also includes a diversity and competence matrix.\n\nThe Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee also focuses on ING's broader talent and succession planning in view of bench strength and diversity at higher management levels, with selected key roles receiving dedicated attention. This is done by taking into account ING's diversity policy and by accelerating refreshment where possible without jeopardising business continuity. The diversity policy is published on ing.com and explained in more detail in 'Unlocking our people's full potential'. The committee also holds periodic conversations outside of its regular meetings with internal talented individuals who are considered to have the potential to assume more senior and complex roles in the organisation over time. The results of these conversations are fed into the individuals' coaching and development plans.",

In doing so, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the adequacy of information provided to shareholders on remuneration policies and practices.\n\nAs an annual recurring topic, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration report by way of benchmarking with the purpose of further improving the remuneration report. For further information, see the 'Remuneration report' in this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, the Remuneration Committee discussed the progress and performance on the annual targets set for the EB and MBB. With regard to variable remuneration and the application of ING's accompanying VRAM (including last year's lessons learned), the committee received input and advice from the Risk Committee following strengthened risk management governance. This served as input for a review of the predefined thresholds above which the pool for variable remuneration may be unlocked for those eligible as well as the accompanying individual variable remuneration proposals, including potential cases for holdback or clawback of deferred compensation by way of malus.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee also reviewed the proposed updates to ING's Remuneration Regulations Framework as part of its annual review. Throughout the year it assessed Identified Staff and High Earner-\n\nrelated remuneration matters, based on ING's remuneration governance structure which is part of the above-mentioned framework. In addition, the Remuneration Committee monitored the development of the gender pay gap.\n\nAll relevant items discussed by the committee were reported to the Supervisory Board, with the Supervisory Board approving those items as required from a governance perspective.\n\n## ESG Committee\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, the Supervisory Board appointed an ESG Committee from among its members. The ESG Committee has been established for an initial duration of two years. After this period, the SB will determine whether the ESG Committee shall be made permanent.\n\nTo prevent an overlap between the ESG Committee and the other Supervisory Board committees and to safeguard an aligned and common view on ESG, the ESG Committee consists of at least one member of each of the other committees.\n\nThe ESG Committee assists the Supervisory Board with matters relating to the various areas of ESG ('environmental', 'social' and 'governance'), including but not limited to, the development of ESG and the integration of ESG in the company and its strategy. In addition, the ESG Committee assists the Supervisory Board by generally monitoring and advising on relevant ESG developments.\n\nThe ESG Committee met three times in 2022. During its first meeting, the ESG Committee discussed and supported a variety of topics with a focus on the role and scope of the ESG Committee and its Terms of Reference, which can be found on ING.com. During its subsequent meetings, the ESG Committee discussed progress and potential impediments as well as relevant trends on 'environmental', 'social' and 'governance' topics and how to connect them with ING's response and actions on the basis of ING's ESG dashboard. In addition, the ESG Committee discussed key updates and relevant ESG-related matters, such as greenwashing, sustainability targets and ESG dilemmas. The ESG Committee also discussed any updates of key ESG policies and ESG-related supervisory/regulatory letters and publications. In 2022, members of the ESG Committee participated in deep dives on: ING's approach on environment challenges and key initiatives, including how we reduce our own footprint, our Terra alignment strategy and our biodiversity approach and ING's approach on social challenges and key initiatives, with a focus on diversity and inclusion, financial health and human rights. There were thematic sessions on climate risk stress testing and ESG regulatory disclosures.\n\nAll relevant items discussed by the committee were reported to the Supervisory Board, with the Supervisory Board approving those items as required from a governance perspective.",

In 2022, no members were (re-)appointed to the boards.\n\nIn line with ING's strategic priorities and in order to further simplify the management structure of ING Bank, it was announced on 15 December 2022 that the roles of head of Retail Banking, Challengers & Growth Markets and Market Leaders will be combined in 2023. Pinar Abay, currently head of Market Leaders, will be appointed to the role effective 15 May 2023 (subject to regulatory approval). Aris Bogdaneris, currently head of Retail Banking and Challengers & Growth Markets will step down from the Management Board Banking as of 15 May 2023 and will leave ING per 1 August 2023 to pursue other opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, Ron van Kemenade, chief technology officer, announced to step down from his position as per 30 April 2023. Succession planning has been initiated for this role.\n\nAfter more than seven years of dedicated service, Mariana Gheorghe announced that she will not be available for reappointment to the Supervisory Board at the 2023 AGM. Therefore in 2022, the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee and the Supervisory Board initiated the process of selecting and nominating a candidate for appointment to the Supervisory Board at the 2023 AGM.\n\nOn 2 February 2023, it was announced that Hans Wijers has expressed the intention for personal reasons to hand over his duties as chairman and retire from the Supervisory Board in the second half of 2023. Hans Wijers was appointed to the Supervisory Board in 2017 and became its chairman in 2018. It was announced on 3 March 2023 that ING will propose to appoint Karl Guha to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 April 2023. Upon decision by the General Meeting, it is the intention of the Supervisory Board to elect Karl Guha as its chairman effective 1 July 2023.\n\nThe Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee and the Supervisory Board will continue to strive for an adequate and balanced composition of the Supervisory Board when selecting and nominating new members for appointment, taking into account ING's diversity policy and other factors.\n\nRead more in the Corporate governance chapter on the composition of the EB and the Supervisory Board.\n\nAll Supervisory Board members, with the exception of no more than one person, shall qualify as independent as defined in the best practice provision 2.1.8 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The members of the Supervisory Board are therefore requested to assess annually whether or not they are independent as set out in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and to confirm this in writing. On this basis, the Supervisory Board confirms that all members of the Supervisory Board are to be regarded as independent on 31 December 2022. On this date all members of the Supervisory Board were also to be regarded as independent within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards.\n\nFor the full list of Supervisory Board members and more details see 'Our leadership', which information is considered to be incorporated, by reference, in this Supervisory Board report.",

It was certainly another challenging year with macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty impacting our customers, business and society in general. We're grateful for their efforts in navigating through these challenges and continuing to create long-term value for our stakeholders. Despite the uncertainty, ING coped well, continuing to support customers and intensifying our efforts to fight climate change. Our results for 2022 reflect the strength of our diversified business model and show our resilience and adaptability.\n\nOf course, none of this would have been possible without our employees. We rely on them to implement ING's purpose and strategy. The SB appreciates their hard work and dedication in sometimes difficult circumstances. Our sincere thanks to all .\n\nAmsterdam, 6 March 2023",

It provides information on ING Group's Executive Board and Supervisory Board, as well as on its General Meeting and capital structure.\n\n## ING's legal and management structure\n\n## Legal structure\n\nING Groep N.V. (ING Group) is a publicly listed company based in the Netherlands. ING Group is the parent of one main legal entity: ING Bank N.V. (ING Bank). ING Bank is the parent company of various Dutch and foreign banks, other subsidiaries, branches and representative offices globally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Management structure\n\nING Group has a two-tier board structure consisting of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. ING Bank also has a two-tier board structure, consisting of the Management Board Banking and the Supervisory Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dutch Corporate Governance Code, Banking Code and Dutch Tax Governance Code\n\nAs ING Group is established and listed in the Netherlands, it must comply with Dutch laws and regulations and is subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (the DCGC).\n\nThe DCGC provides guidance for ING's corporate governance structure and practices. ING strongly supports the DCGC and its principles to ensure sound corporate governance. ING's application of the DCGC is described in the booklet 'Application of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code by ING Groep N.V. (FY2022)', 9 March 2023, available on ing.com. The DCGC can be downloaded from the website mccg.nl.\n\nThe Dutch Banking Code (the Banking Code) is only applicable to ING Bank, but ING Group voluntarily applies the principles of the Banking Code on remuneration for its Executive Board members and senior management. The Banking Code can be downloaded from the website nvb.nl.\n\nING Group also voluntarily applies the principles of the Dutch Tax Governance Code. ING's application of the Dutch Tax Governance Code is described in the booklet 'Application of the Dutch Tax Governance Code by",

The Dutch Tax Governance Code can be downloaded from the website vno-ncw.nl.\n\nThis section, including the parts of this Annual Report incorporated by reference, along with the abovementioned booklets, comprise the corporate governance statement referred to in section 2a of the Decree on information in the management board report.\n\n## Executive Board\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Executive Board is entrusted with the management of ING. This includes the day-to-day management of the business and strategy of ING, which responsibility is vested in the members of the Executive Board collectively. The organisation, main roles and responsibilities of the Executive Board are set out in the Management Board Charter, available on ing.com.\n\nThe Executive Board performs its activities under the supervision of the Supervisory Board. The Articles of Association, the Management Board Charter and the Supervisory Board Charter outline which resolutions of the Executive Board are subject to approval by the Supervisory Board.\n\nING Group indemnifies the members of the Executive Board against direct financial losses in connection with claims from third parties filed, or threatened to be filed, against them by virtue of their service as a member of the Executive Board, as far as permitted by law, on the conditions laid down in the Articles of Association and their commission contract. ING Group has taken out liability insurance for the members of the Executive Board.\n\n## Composition and diversity\n\nING Group aims to have an adequate and balanced composition of its Executive Board, with a diverse selection of persons with knowledge, skills and executive experience, preferably gained in the banking sector, experience in corporate governance of large stock-listed companies and experience in the political and social environment in which such companies operate. In addition, there should be a balance of experience and affinity with the nature and culture of the business of ING. Factors such as nationality, gender, age and education are also taken into account for the composition of the Executive Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for selecting and nominating candidates to the General Meeting for appointment or reappointment to the Executive Board, among others based on the Executive Board profile,\n\nwhich is available on ing.com. The Supervisory Board regularly assesses the composition of the Executive Board.\n\n## As part of this:\n\n- 1. Bench strength and succession planning for Executive Board positions are continuous attention points. Potential internal candidates for such a role may be complemented with potential talent from outside the bank.\n- 2. A long-term view is taken including steps to improve the development path of women within ING and the appointment of women in senior positions throughout the bank, in line with the adopted diversity and inclusion principle.\n\nThe Gender Diversity Act, which entered into force in the Netherlands on 1 January 2022, requires ING to set appropriate and ambitious targets for gender diversity in its Executive Board and senior management. ING's target for gender diversity in the Executive Board is set at 30 percent. Over the year 2022, the Executive Board met this target. See more information on diversity, including on gender diversity in senior management, in the paragraphs on Unlocking our people's full potential in 'How we are making the difference'.\n\nSee more information on the composition of the Executive Board in 'Our leadership'.\n\n## Appointment, suspension and dismissal\n\nMembers and proposed members of the Executive Board are appointed, suspended and dismissed by the General Meeting. Candidates for appointment to the Executive Board are assessed by the Dutch central bank (DNB) and the European Central Bank (ECB) for suitability and reliability and must continue to meet these criteria while in function.\n\nFor the appointment of Executive Board members, the Supervisory Board may draw up a binding list of candidates, which may be rendered non-binding by the General Meeting. A resolution of the General Meeting to render this list non-binding, or to suspend or dismiss Executive Board members without this being proposed by the Supervisory Board, requires an absolute majority of the votes cast. Additionally, this majority must represent more than half of the issued share capital. The quorum requirement cannot be waived in a second general meeting. This ensures that significant shareholder proposals cannot be adopted in a general meeting with a low attendance rate and can only be adopted with substantial support of ING Group's shareholders.",

        "page_content": "- > Corporate governance\n\n## Remuneration and share ownership\n\nDetails of the remuneration of members of the Executive Board, including shares granted to them, are set out in the 'Remuneration report'.\n\nMembers of the Executive Board are permitted to hold shares in the share capital of ING Group for long-term investment purposes. Transactions by members of the Executive Board in these shares need to comply with the ING regulations for insiders, which are available on ing.com.\n\n## Relevant positions pursuant to CRD IV\n\nMembers of the Executive Board may hold other positions. No member of the Executive Board had corporate directorships at listed companies outside ING throughout 2022.\n\n## Transactions involving actual or potential conflicts of interest\n\nThere were no transactions reported in 2022 in which there were conflicts of interest with Executive Board members that are of material significance to ING Group and/or to the relevant board members.\n\nIf a member of the Executive Board obtains financial products and services, other than loans, which are provided by ING Group subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business on terms that apply to employees, this is not considered a significant conflict of interest and is not reported. Banking and financial products in which the granting of credit is of a secondary nature, e.g. credit cards and overdrafts in current account, are not considered a loan for this purpose and therefore not reported.\n\nFor an overview of loans granted to members of the Executive Board, see the 'Remuneration report'.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises (i.e. assesses, oversees, monitors, constructively challenges, scrutinises and discusses) the policy of the Executive Board and the general course of affairs of ING and the business connected with it. The Supervisory Board provides the Executive Board with advice. The responsibility for supervising and advising the Executive Board is vested in the members of the Supervisory Board collectively. The organisation, powers and modus operandi of the Supervisory Board are set out in the Charter of the Supervisory Board, available on ing.com.\n\nIn performing their duties, members of the Supervisory Board are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 Be guided by the interests of ING and the business connected with it, thereby carefully balancing the interests of all stakeholders of ING and in this consideration give paramount importance to the customer's interest, as set out in the Dutch Banker's Oath.\n- \u00b7 Foster a culture focused on long-term value creation, financial and non-financial risk awareness, compliance with ING's risk appetite, responsible and ethical behaviour and stimulate openness and accountability within ING and its subsidiaries.\n- \u00b7 Act without mandate and independent of any interest in the business of ING.\n- \u00b7 Ensure that the Supervisory Board functions effectively.\n\nThe Articles of Association, the Management Board Charter and the Supervisory Board Charter outline which resolutions of the Executive Board are subject to approval by the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Association ING Group indemnifies the members of the Supervisory Board as far as legally permitted against direct financial losses in connection with claims from third parties filed or threatened to be filed against them by virtue of their service as a member of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Composition and diversity\n\nING Group aims to have an adequate and balanced composition of its Supervisory Board, with a mix of persons with knowledge, skills and executive experience, preferably gained in the banking sector, experience in corporate governance of large stock-listed companies and experience in the political and social environment in which such companies operate. In the selection of Supervisory Board members, ING strives for a balance in nationality, gender, age, and educational and work background. In addition, there should be a balance of experience and affinity with the nature and culture of the business of ING.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for selecting and nominating candidates for appointment or reappointment to the Supervisory Board, among others based on the Supervisory Board profile, which is available on ing.com. The Supervisory Board regularly assesses the composition of the Supervisory Board.\n\nING believes that former members of the Executive Board can make a valuable contribution to the Supervisory Board. Therefore, also taking into account the size of the Supervisory Board and ING's wide range of activities, they may become members of the Supervisory Board of ING Group, but not in the position of chairman or vice-chairman. Former Executive Board members must wait at least one year before becoming eligible for appointment to the Supervisory Board.\n\nAfter a former member of the Executive Board has been appointed to the Supervisory Board, this member may also be appointed to one of the Supervisory Board's committees.

We believe the Supervisory Board is also well-balanced in terms of other relevant diversity aspects. Overall, the preferred emphasis on members with a financial or banking background has been maintained. In terms of nationality, the ratio between Dutch and non-Dutch nationalities in 2022 was 56 - 44%.\n\nAccording to the Gender Diversity Act, which came into force in the Netherlands on 1 January 2022, ING is required to comply with a gender diversity quota of one third male and one third female for its Supervisory Board. Over the year 2022, the Supervisory Board was compliant.\n\nFor more information on the composition of the Supervisory Board see 'Our leadership' and the  'Supervisory Board report'.\n\n## Appointment, suspension and dismissal\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are appointed, suspended and dismissed by the General Meeting.\n\nFor the appointment of Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board may draw up a binding list of candidates, which may be rendered non-binding by the General Meeting. A resolution of the General Meeting to render this list non-binding, or to suspend or dismiss Supervisory Board members without this being proposed by the Supervisory Board, requires an absolute majority of the votes cast. Additionally, this majority must represent more than half of the issued share capital. The quorum requirement cannot be waived in a second general meeting. This ensures that significant proposals of shareholders cannot be adopted in a general meeting with a low attendance rate and can only be adopted with substantial support of ING Group's shareholders.\n\nCandidates for appointment to the Supervisory Board are assessed by DNB and the ECB for suitability and reliability and must continue to meet these criteria while in function.\n\n## Term of appointment of the Supervisory Board members\n\nAs a general rule, Supervisory Board members step down from the Supervisory Board after the fourth anniversary of their last appointment or reappointment. They are eligible for re-appointment in the fourth year after their initial appointment and, with explanation, also in the eighth and tenth years.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may deviate from this general rule under special circumstances and with explanation, for instance to maintain a balanced composition of the Supervisory Board and/or to preserve valuable expertise and experience. The retirement schedule is available on ing.com.\n\n## Relevant positions pursuant to CRD IV / conflicting interests\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board may hold other positions, including directorships, either paid or unpaid. The Capital Requirements Directive 4 (CRD IV) restricts the total number of supervisory board positions or non-executive directorships with commercial organisations that may be held by a Supervisory Board member to four, or to two, if the Supervisory Board member also has an executive board position. The ECB may, under special circumstances, permit a Supervisory Board member to fulfil an additional supervisory board position or non-executive directorship. Positions with, inter alia, subsidiaries or qualified holdings are not taken into account in the application of these restrictions. Such positions may not conflict with the interests of ING Group. It is the responsibility of the individual member of the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board collectively to ensure that the directorship duties are performed properly and are not affected by any other positions that the individual may hold outside ING Group.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are to report any conflict of interest (including potential conflicts of interest) to the chair of the Supervisory Board (or, in the case of the chair, to the vice-chair) and to provide all relevant information. The Supervisory Board - excluding the member concerned - decides whether a conflict of interest exists.\n\nIn case of a conflict of interest, the relevant member of the Supervisory Board abstains from discussions and decision-making on the topic or the transaction in relation to which he or she has a conflict of interest with ING Group.\n\n## Transactions involving actual or potential conflicts of interest\n\nThere were no transactions reported in 2022 in which there were conflicts of interest with Supervisory Board members that are of material significance to ING Group and/or to the relevant board members.\n\nIf a member of the Supervisory Board obtains financial products and services, other than loans, which are provided by ING Group subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business on terms that apply to employees, this is not considered to be a material conflicting interest. Banking and financial products in which the granting of credit is of a secondary nature, e.g. credit cards and overdrafts in current account are not considered a loan for this purpose and are therefore not disclosed.\n\nFor an overview of loans granted to members of the Supervisory Board, see the 'Remuneration report'.",

Members of the Supervisory Board are permitted to hold shares in the share capital of ING Group for long-term investment purposes. Details are given in the 'Remuneration report'. Transactions by members of the Supervisory Board in these shares need to comply with the ING insider regulations, which are available on ing.com.\n\n## General Meeting\n\nA general meeting is held at least once a year. ING's Annual General Meeting (AGM) is generally held in April or May.\n\nThe main topics on which the General Meeting decides are:\n\n- \u00b7 The appointment, suspension and dismissal of members of the Executive Board and members of the Supervisory Board, subject to a binding nomination or a proposal of the Supervisory Board.\n- \u00b7 The adoption of the financial statements (annual accounts).\n- \u00b7 The declaration of dividends, subject to the power of the Executive Board to allocate part or all of the profits to the reserves - with approval of the Supervisory Board - and the declaration of other distributions, subject to a proposal by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board.\n- \u00b7 The appointment/reappointment of the external auditor.\n- \u00b7 An amendment of the Articles of Association, a legal merger or division of ING Group, and winding-up of ING Group, all subject to a proposal made by the Executive Board with approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\n- \u00b7 The issuance of shares or rights to subscribe for shares, the restriction or exclusion of pre-emptive rights of shareholders, and delegation of these powers to the Executive Board, subject to a proposal by the Executive Board that has been approved by the Supervisory Board.\n- \u00b7 The authorisation of a repurchase of outstanding shares and/or a cancellation of shares.\n\n## Notice\n\nING Group convenes its general meetings by public notice via ing.com at least 42 days before the day of the general meeting. All information relevant for shareholders is then made available via ing.com. This information includes the notice of the general meeting, the place and time of the meeting, instructions on how to attend the meeting and exercise voting rights, the agenda, the explanatory notes to the agenda including the verbatim text of the proposals, as well as the Annual Report.\n\nThis period can be shortened to 10 days if i) ING Group meets the criteria for early intervention measures, ii) resolution can be avoided by means of a capital increase and iii) a general meeting would be required to enable ING Group to issue the required number of shares.\n\n## Proposals by shareholders\n\nShareholders who individually or jointly represent at least one percent of the issued capital may propose items for the agenda of a general meeting. Such proposals should be adequately substantiated under applicable Dutch law.\n\nShareholders have the opportunity to contact ING about the general meeting, via a dedicated webpage on ing.com.\n\n## Record date\n\nThe record date for attending a general meeting and voting on proposals at that general meeting is the 28th day before the day of the general meeting. Only those holding shares on the record date may attend the general meeting and may participate, vote and exercise any other rights attached to their shares in the general meeting, regardless of any subsequent sale or purchase of shares. The record date is published in the notice for the general meeting. If a shortened notice period of 10 days is applicable (see 'Notice' above), the record date is two days after the convocation date.\n\nIn accordance with US requirements, the depositary sets a record date for the American depositary receipts (ADRs). This record date can differ from the record date set by ING Group for shareholders.",

For logistical reasons, attending the general meeting is subject to the requirement that ING Group is notified by the shareholders in advance on how they will attend. Instructions for this are included in the notice for the general meeting.\n\nGeneral meetings are webcast on ing.com, so that shareholders who could not attend the general meeting meeting in person, can follow the meeting online.\n\n## Voting rights on shares\n\nEach share entitles the holder to cast one vote at the general meeting. The Articles of Association do not restrict the voting rights on any class of shares. ING Group is not aware of any agreement that restricts voting rights on any class of its shares.\n\n## Proxy voting facilities\n\nING Group provides proxy voting facilities to its investors via ing.com and solicits proxies from its ADR holders in line with common practice in the US.\n\nING Group uses the 'Evote by ING' platform, an online facility through which shareholders can register for a meeting or appoint a proxy.\n\nAlso, proxy voting forms are made available on ing.com. By returning the form, shareholders give a proxy to an independent proxy holder (a public notary registered in the Netherlands) to vote on their behalf, in accordance with instructions expressly given on the proxy form. Submitting these forms is subject to additional conditions as specified on such forms.\n\nING Group will send an electronic confirmation of receipt of the votes to the person that casts the vote. In addition, on request made within three months from the date of the general meeting, ING Group will confirm to the shareholder or a third person designated by the shareholder that the shareholder's votes have been validly recorded and counted by ING Group, if this information is not already available to the shareholder directly.\n\n## Reporting\n\nResolutions adopted at a general meeting are generally published on ing.com within one week following the meeting. In accordance with the DCGC, the draft minutes of the general meeting are made available to\n\nshareholders on ing.com no later than three months after the meeting. Shareholders then have three months to react to the draft minutes. After that, the minutes are adopted by the chairman of the meeting and by a shareholder appointed by that meeting and are made available on ing.com. As an alternative to minutes, a notarial record of the business transacted at the general meeting can be made.\n\n## 2022 AGM\n\nThe 2022 AGM was held on 25 April 2022 at ING's corporate head office in Amsterdam. In addition, the meeting was broadcast live on ing.com.\n\nThe notarial record of the business transacted at the 2022 AGM can be downloaded from ing.com.\n\n## Shares and shareholdings\n\n## Capital structure\n\nING Group's authorised share capital consists of ordinary shares and cumulative preference shares. ING Group's ordinary shares are listed on Euronext Amsterdam and Brussels. ADRs are listed on NYSE and administered by depositary JP Morgan Chase.\n\nCurrently, only ordinary shares are issued and a call option to acquire cumulative preference shares has been granted to Stichting Continu\u00efteit ING (ING Continuity Foundation).\n\nING Group's authorised capital is the maximum amount of capital allowed to be issued under the terms of the Articles of Association. New shares in excess of this amount can only be issued if the Articles of Association are amended.\n\n## Issuance of shares\n\nShares may be issued following a resolution by the General Meeting. The General Meeting may resolve to delegate this authority to another body for a period of time not exceeding five years. Each year, a proposal is made to the General Meeting to delegate authority to the Executive Board to issue new ordinary shares or to grant rights to subscribe to new ordinary shares, both with and without pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders. On 25 April 2022 the General Meeting authorised the Executive Board to issue new ordinary shares (including the granting of rights to subscribe for ordinary shares, such as warrants or in connection with convertible debt instruments) for a period of 18 months, ending on 25 October 2023, subject to the following conditions and limits:",

However, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board may exclude certain shareholders from such a share offering for practical or legal reasons.\n- \u00b7 No more than 10% of the issued share capital, with or without pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders.\n- * ING has benchmarked the level of 40% and this is in line with the practice of other large financial and globally active corporates.\n\nSpecific approval by the General Meeting is required for any share issuance exceeding these limits.\n\nThe purpose of this share issue authorisation is to delegate the power to issue new ordinary shares to the Executive Board, without first having to obtain the consent of the General Meeting. This authorisation gives ING Group flexibility in managing its capital resources, including regulatory capital, while taking into account shareholders' interests to prevent dilution of their shares. In particular, it enables ING Group to respond promptly to developments in the financial markets, should circumstances require that. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board consider it in the best interest of ING Group to have the flexibility this authorisation provides.\n\nThis authorisation may be used for any purpose, including but not limited to strengthening capital, financing, mergers or acquisitions. However, the authorisation to issue ordinary shares by way of rights issue cannot be used for mergers or acquisitions on a share-for-share basis as this is incompatible with the concept of pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders.\n\nIn line with market practice, ING Group currently intends to include the following categories of shareholders in such a rights issue:\n\n- 1. Qualified and retail investors in the Netherlands and the US (SEC registered offering).\n- 2. Qualified investors in EU member states (and potentially the UK).\n- 3. Retail investors in EU member states (and potentially the UK) where ING has a significant retail investor base, provided that it is feasible to meet local requirements (in ING's 2009 rights offering, shares were offered to existing shareholders in Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and the UK, where ING believed the vast majority of retail investors were located at that time).\n- 4. Qualified or institutional investors in Canada and Australia.\n\nRetail investors in Canada and Australia and investors in Japan will not be included in such a share offering.\n\nShareholders who are not allowed, do not elect, or are unable to subscribe to a rights offering, are entitled to sell their rights in the market or receive any net financial benefit upon completion of a rump offering after the exercise period has ended.\n\nThe share issue authorisation that will be proposed to the 2023 AGM will be similar to the currently applicable authorisation described above.\n\n## Transfer of shares and transfer restrictions\n\nShares not included in the Securities Giro Transfer system are transferred by means of a deed of transfer between the transferor and the transferee. To become effective, ING Group has to acknowledge the transfer, unless ING Group itself is a party to the transfer. The Articles of Association do not restrict the transfer of ordinary shares, whereas the transfer of cumulative preference shares is subject to prior approval of the Executive Board. ING Group is not aware of the existence of any agreement pursuant to which the transfer of ordinary shares or ADRs for such shares is restricted.\n\nShares that are included in the Securities Giro Transfer system are transferred in accordance with the Securities Giro Transfer Act (Wet Giraal Effectenverkeer). A shareholder, who wishes to transfer such shares, must instruct the securities intermediary where their shares are administered accordingly.\n\n## Acquisitions of shares\n\nING Group may acquire fully paid-up ordinary shares in its own share capital. Although the power to acquire shares is vested in the Executive Board and subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, prior authorisation from the General Meeting is required for these acquisitions. Each year, a proposal is made to the General Meeting to authorise the acquisition of shares by the Executive Board for a period of 18 months. On 25 April 2022, the General Meeting authorised the Executive Board to acquire ordinary shares in ING Group in the name of ING Group, upon approval of the Supervisory Board, for a period of 18 months, ending on 25 October 2023, subject to the following conditions and limits:\n\n- \u00b7 The nominal value of the ordinary shares in ING Group, which are acquired, held or pledged in favour of ING Group or are held by its subsidiaries for their own account, will not exceed 10% of the issued share capital of ING Group as at 25 April 2022.\n- \u00b7 The purchase price will not be lower than one euro cent per share and not higher than 110% of the opening price of ING Group's ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam on the day of the purchase or on the preceding day of stock market trading.",

        "page_content": "- > Corporate governance\n\n## Cancellation of shares\n\nAt the 2022 AGM, the General Meeting adopted the proposal to reduce the issued share capital of ING Group by cancelling ordinary shares acquired by ING Group in its own share capital up to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital of ING Group as at 25 April 2022. The number of shares to be cancelled under this resolution shall be determined by the Executive Board. The cancellation may be executed in one or more tranches. The capital reduction will take place with due observance of the applicable laws and regulations and ING Group's articles of association.\n\nFollowing this resolution, in July 2022, the Executive Board resolved to cancel the 40,749,792 ordinary shares that were acquired in the share buyback programme that was completed on 14 July 2022 and, in January 2023, the Executive Board resolved to cancel the 107,032,745 ordinary shares that were acquired in the share buyback programme that was completed on 28 December 2022.\n\n## Special rights of control\n\nNo special rights of control referred to in Article 10 of the directive of the European Parliament and the Council on takeover bids (2004/25/EC) are attached to any share.\n\n## Obligations to disclose shareholdings\n\nPursuant to the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, shareholders and holders of ADRs of ING Group are required to provide an update on their holdings to the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) once their capital interest or voting rights reaches, exceed or falls below the threshold levels of 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% or 95%.\n\nA notification requirement also applies if a person's capital interest or voting rights reaches, exceeds or falls below the above-mentioned thresholds as a result of a change in ING's total issued share capital or voting rights. Such notification must be made no later than the fourth trading day after the AFM has published ING's notification of the change in its issued share capital. The notification will be recorded in a public register that is held by the AFM and published on afm.nl/en/.\n\nING Group is not aware of any investors (or potential shareholders) with an interest of 3% or more other than those shown in the ING shares chapter as at year-end 2022.\n\nIn addition, any person who acquires or disposes of a net short position relating to the issued share capital of ING Group, whether by a transaction in shares or ADRs, or by a transaction creating or relating to any financial instrument where the effect or one of the effects of the transaction is to confer a financial advantage on the person entering into that transaction in the event of a change in the price of such shares or ADRs, is required to publicly notify the AFM if, as a result of such acquisition or disposal, the person's net\n\nshort position reaches, exceeds or falls below 0.2% of the issued share capital of ING Group and each 0.1% above that. Each reported net short position equal to 0.5% of the issued share capital of ING Group and any subsequent increase of that position by 0.1% will be made public via the short selling register on afm.nl/en/.\n\n## Investor relations and contacts with investors\n\nING strives to provide clear, accurate and timely financial information that is in strict compliance with applicable rules and regulations, in particular those concerning selective disclosure, inside information and equal treatment.\n\nING publishes a comprehensive quarterly disclosure package on its corporate website that includes detailed financial figures. This information is discussed thoroughly on the day of the earnings release during media, analyst and investor conference calls. The publication dates of quarterly earnings releases are announced in advance on ing.com.\n\nING aims to maintain an open and constructive dialogue with existing and potential investors, industry analysts and rating agencies. ING may participate in industry conferences. Bilateral communications with the investment community are actively managed by the Investor Relations department. Executive Board members, Management Board Banking members or divisional management members may also participate in investor meetings. These bilateral meetings are not announced in advance, nor can they be followed by webcast or any other means.\n\nIf communication between ING Group and investors is organised and/or facilitated through a broker, then an analyst or specialist salesperson representing the broker may be present in the meeting. Information provided during such occasions or in any contacts with the press is limited to what is already publicly available. In the event that any inside information is inadvertently disclosed during any bilateral contacts, it is ING's policy, in accordance with applicable regulations, to publish such information as soon as possible.\n\nING Group may decide not to accommodate or accept any requests or invitations to enter into a dialogue with potential investors, under specific conditions. It is ING's policy not to initiate bilateral contacts with investors or analysts or participate in conferences during the period immediately prior to publication of regular quarterly results.\n\nApproximately 25 analysts actively cover and generally issue reports on ING Group. A list of these analysts can be found under 'Analyst Coverage' in the Investor Relations section of ing.com. During 2022, ING Group did not provide any form of compensation to parties that are directly or indirectly involved in the production or publication of analysts' reports, with the exception of credit-rating agencies.",

In 2022, ING hosted an institutional Investor Update in Amsterdam, the Netherlands on 13 June. During the event, the Management Board Banking provided a strategy update and presented ING's digital approach, sustainability efforts and financial targets to analysts and institutional investors, followed by Q&As.\n\n## Differences between Dutch and US corporate governance practices\n\nING Group qualifies as a foreign private issuer under the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and for the purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards. Under NYSE listing standards, foreign private issuers are permitted to follow home-country practices in some circumstances, in lieu of the US corporate governance rules. In accordance with the requirements of the SEC and NYSE, ING Group discloses any significant differences between its corporate governance practices and those applicable to US companies under NYSE listing standards in its Annual Report on Form 20-F, which is available on ing.com.\n\n## ING Continuity Foundation\n\nING Continuity Foundation is a foundation organised under the laws of the Netherlands and was founded on 22 January 1991. According to its articles of association, the statutory goal of ING Continuity Foundation is to protect and to safeguard the independence, continuity and identity of ING. If the board of ING Continuity Foundation (the Board) believes the independence, continuity or the identity of ING is at risk, ING Continuity Foundation is entitled to acquire cumulative preference shares to be newly issued, provided that, following the issue, the number of cumulative preference shares issued may be no more than one third of the total number of shares issued. This entitlement is vested in the Articles of Association of ING Groep N.V.  On acquisition of cumulative preference shares, at least 25 percent of the nominal value must be paid on said shares.\n\nIn 2022, the Board held two meetings, on 5 April and 15 November. The composition of the Board is currently as follows: Sebastian Kortmann, chairman, Rob van den Bergh, Allard Metzelaar and Pieter Witteveen. All Board members stated that they meet the conditions regarding independence as referred to in the Articles of Association of ING Continuity Foundation.\n\n## Legal provisions\n\n## Declaration of no objection\n\nA declaration of no objection from the ECB must be obtained by anyone wishing to acquire or hold a participating interest of at least 10% in ING Group and to exercise control attached to such a participating interest. Similarly, on the basis of indirect change of control statutes in the various jurisdictions where subsidiaries of ING Group are operating, permission from, or notification to, local regulatory authorities may be required for the acquisition of a substantial interest in ING Group.\n\n## Change of control clauses in material agreements\n\nING Group is not a party to any material agreement that becomes effective or is required to be amended or terminated in the event of a change of control of ING Group following a public bid. ING Group subsidiaries may have customary change of control arrangements included in agreements related to various business activities. Following a change of control of ING Group (as a result of a public bid or otherwise) such agreements may be amended or terminated, leading, for example, to an obligatory transfer of the interest in the joint venture, early repayment of amounts due, loss of credit facilities or reinsurance cover, and liquidation of outstanding futures and option trading positions.\n\n## Severance payments to members of the Executive Board\n\nThe contracts entered with the members of the Executive Board provide for severance payments that become due upon termination of the applicable member's contract, including if termination occurs in connection with a public bid as defined in section 5:70 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act. Severance payments to the members of the Executive Board are limited to a maximum of one year's fixed salary.\n\n## Amendment of the Articles of Association\n\nThe General Meeting may resolve to amend the Articles of Association of ING Group, provided that the resolution is adopted based on a proposal of the Executive Board, which has been approved by the Supervisory Board. An amendment of the Articles of Association is required to be executed by notarial deed. At the 2022 AGM, the General Meeting resolved to amend the Articles of Association of ING Group to reduce the authorised share capital of ING Group.",

Please refer to the agenda of the 2023 AGM for details on the proposed re-appointment of KPMG as external auditor for the years after 2023.\n\nIn 2022, the external auditor attended the meetings of the Risk Committee and of the Audit Committee.

These regulations require ING Group to report and certify on an annual basis the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. The SOx 404 internal control activities are organised along the lines of the company's governance structure and involve the participation of senior management across ING.\n\nING's internal controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u00b7 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ING;\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorisations of our management and directors; and\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have material effect on the financial statements.\n\nING has a process in place where, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is evaluated, based on the criteria of the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Reporting (COSO) - Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).",

Early in the year we saw much of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic abating. But just as that was sinking in, the terrible war in Ukraine broke out, which became the dominant societal and economic factor of the year, affecting many of us.\n\nFor employees directly impacted by the war, it was a particularly tough time. Many were forced to flee their homes, leaving loved ones behind. I was proud of ING's response which included humanitarian assistance payments for colleagues in Ukraine and protecting their income against the devaluation of the Hryvnia by depositing variable remuneration awards in euros. The efforts of our orange family around the world, particularly employees in neighbouring countries such as Poland, Romania and Slovakia, in providing not only assistance to colleagues but also to other Ukrainians fleeing their homeland, was inspiring.\n\nThe war also had an effect on other, economic circumstances, which were felt throughout most of our company. Energy prices rose at an almost unprecedented pace. This in turn sparked inflation figures not seen in decades in most Western countries. Some emerging economies, including Turkey, had already been confronted with high inflation. In several countries we responded by extending an energy cost allowance to employees. In other countries, such as Belgium, the high inflation was compensated by automatic indexation of wages, as is customary locally. In the Netherlands, the high inflation put pressure on negotiations on a new collective labour agreement.\n\n## Our view on remuneration\n\nING's remuneration approach is aimed at enabling us to attract, motivate and retain leaders with the ability, experience, skills, values and behaviours to fulfil our role as a global bank, sustainably executing our strategy while considering our values and stakeholder interests. Following the Dutch Banking Code, total direct compensation of the Executive Board is below the market median of a peer group of comparable companies.\n\nIn line with the remuneration principles that apply to all ING staff, the remuneration policies for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are designed to ensure that ING offers well-balanced remuneration within ING's risk appetite. In this context, the Remuneration Committee in the course of 2022 discussed the system of applying risk adjustment measures to the variable remuneration awards, including the thresholds\n\n<!-- image -->",

Another discussion item was the approach for the setting of targets including for risk and control functions, also focusing on alignment and steering this from top to bottom in our company.\n\nTo ensure our approach to remuneration is aligned with the views of our stakeholders, we have an ongoing dialogue with customers, investors, regulators, works councils and other stakeholder groups about our remuneration approach, strengthening the link between performance and remuneration outcomes. We also consider the feedback received as part of our regular contacts with our stakeholders, for example around increased transparency on how performance impacts variable remuneration.\n\nThe current remuneration policies for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board were adopted by our shareholders at the 2020 General Meeting, effective until the end of the 2024 AGM. In order to be able to introduce new versions of the policies for adoption at the 2024 AGM, the Remuneration Committee will in 2023 review the current policies. An important part of this will again be the consultation of various stakeholder groups, which will commence in the latter part of the year.\n\n## This report\n\nThis Remuneration Report reflects the remuneration for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board members. In preparing this report, we took notice of the draft (non-binding) 'Guidelines on the standardised presentation of the remuneration report' from the European Commission as published in September 2022.\n\nWhen it comes to reporting on remuneration, our ambition is to continue to be a frontrunner, providing more information than is mandatorily required. We have further enhanced our reporting on performance measurement, partly through a new visual 'EB Remuneration at a glance', more transparency on performance substantiation of EB members and forward-looking targets and weightings for 2023.\n\nAnother good example of other voluntary enhancements can be found in the 'How we are making a difference' chapter of the Annual Report. Presenting our 'gender pay gap analysis' there is something that we have chosen to do rather than were asked to do, making us part of a small minority of companies doing this globally. I believe transparency on this important subject is a good step in helping ING advancing diversity, inclusion and belonging. We realise there is more to be done, especially on the underrepresentation of women in leadership positions. Some of the actions taken are that we have increased our target to at least 35% women in senior management by 2028 and we are introducing new targets to increase gender diversity in our leadership pipeline.\n\n## Performance year 2022\n\nDespite the various challenges, ING performed well in 2022. The strategy was sharpened and execution of it delivered strong results. Significant progress was made in the various target areas. The number of primary customers increased, with rising NPS scores. Financial and non-financial risks were well managed. In the area of sustainability, the volume mobilized increased by almost 15%, intermediate 2030 targets were set\n\nfor all nine Terra sectors and in several countries, products were launched to stimulate climate-supportive action by customers.\n\nFinancially, interest income recovered and fee income was resilient. Expenses saw the impact of higher salary costs and higher marketing expenses. Overall, ING's full-year 2022 result before tax came out at \u20ac5.5 bln, 18.9% below 2021, as additions to loan loss provisions were higher on the back of the war in Ukraine. This also led to a corresponding decline in Return on Equity to 7.2%.\n\nThe Supervisory Board agreed that the Executive Board performed satisfactory in 2022. Based on a thorough and balanced assessment of the performance of each Executive Board member against their objectives, ING's results, their behaviour and risk and compliance matters, the Supervisory Board decided to award variable remuneration at 15.6% of the maximum 20% to the chief executive officer, 15.7% of the maximum 20% for the chief financial officer and 16.4% of the maximum 20% for the chief risk officer. No increase is proposed to their base salary for 2023, this topic will be considered within the broader context of the Executive Board remuneration policy review which will take place in 2023.\n\nFor all other eligible staff, variable remuneration can be discretionary or collective and is awarded based on criteria for overall group performance, business line and individual performance. At least half of these targets must be non-financial. A considerable part of the variable remuneration is awarded based on collective agreements. In 2022, the total amount awarded was \u20ac426.6 million, reflecting a 1.4% decrease against the total target variable remuneration pool.\n\nI'd like to thank all our customers around the ING world for their trust and faith in us, our employees for their dedication to ING, and all other stakeholders who have helped make ING what it is in 2022. It hasn't necessarily been an easy year, but one we can be proud  of in terms of prioritising both people and the planet.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Herna Verhagen\n\nChair of the Supervisory Board Remuneration Committee",

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (AGM)\n\n## About this report\n\nThis Remuneration Report is based on the remuneration policies for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. This section of the report (p. 78 - p. 95) is the Remuneration Report as referred to in the Dutch act implementing the Shareholder Rights Directive II (SRD II). It will be presented to shareholders at the 2023 AGM for an advisory vote. An explanation of how the results of this vote are taken into account will be included in the 2023 Remuneration Report.\n\nThis Remuneration Report includes an \"at a glance\" overview of the performance and remuneration outcomes for each Executive Board Member for 2022. Furthermore, this Remuneration Report provides greater transparency and more detail compared to previous years on the assessment against performance targets, including Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) related targets. We refer in this report to the Gender Pay Gap information provided in the chapter 'How we are making the difference'. In this Remuneration Report, we also disclose our forward-looking performance target area weightings for Executive Board members for 2023.\n\n## 2022 AGM\n\nThe 2021 Remuneration Report was presented for an advisory vote at the AGM held on 25 April 2022 (hereafter called the 2022 AGM). The outcome was an advisory vote of 98.26% in favour. A number of shareholders made comments with regards to the transparency of performance. We have reflected the AGM's feedback in this year's report by providing more detailed substantiations of the Executive Board members' performance.\n\nWe recognise that remuneration is an important topic for many stakeholder groups and that viewpoints on the topic may vary. The Supervisory Board is fully committed to ensuring that our approach to remuneration achieves a balance of interests across different stakeholders. Stakeholder engagement is a key element in the formulation of our remuneration policies and in 2023 we will start a new round of dialogues as preparation for the 2024 AGM renewal of policies. We have regular dialogues with our stakeholders. The Supervisory Board will continue to foster a transparent dialogue on remuneration and future policy amendments.\n\n## Board changes and business events in 2022\n\nThere were no changes to either the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board in 2022.\n\n## Main decisions on the remuneration of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board for 2023\n\nThe following decisions were taken in relation to remuneration for 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 no changes to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policies will be proposed;\n- \u00b7 no changes to the base salaries for 2023 for the Executive Board.

In line with this policy, the remuneration of the Executive Board members is designed to attract, motivate and retain leaders. Retention is an important goal since this contributes to long-term performance.\n\nShould policy changes be proposed, we will first consult with our stakeholders about the proposed changes, after which a revised version of the Executive Board remuneration policy will be submitted to the General Meeting for adoption by the shareholders at the General Meeting before it becomes effective. For 2023, no changes are proposed. Please note that the following paragraphs, until page 81, present a brief summary of the current applicable Executive Board remuneration policy.\n\nIn 2024, ING's Executive Board remuneration policy and Supervisory Board remuneration policy will be presented for shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM. This is in line with SRD II, which requires listed companies to submit their remuneration policies to the AGM at least once every four years. During the course of 2023, ING will engage with its various stakeholders in an open dialogue on this topic.\n\n## Total direct compensation\n\nTotal direct compensation is the total of fixed and variable remuneration, excluding benefits such as pension and allowances.\n\nTotal direct compensation for the Executive Board members is determined and reviewed annually by the Supervisory Board. In line with the Executive Board remuneration policy, the Executive Board's total direct compensation for 2022 was compared to a peer group as formulated in the Executive Board remuneration policy. The peer group is based on five guiding principles, reflecting ING's current profile, and is explained in the Executive Board remuneration policy. In short, these principles are described in the next table.\n\n| Guiding principle    | Short description                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Geography            | ING is headquartered in the Netherlands and has an international profile                                                                  |\n| Talent market        | ING is increasingly experiencing a cross-pollination of talent across sectors/industries,  not limited to traditional banking competitors |\n| Size                 | ING acknowledges the importance of including companies that are broadly  comparable in terms of size and complexity                       |\n| Governance framework | ING is subject to the Dutch (financial services) regulatory framework and operates  within a Dutch stakeholder environment                |\n| Balancing            | ING acknowledges the importance of retaining sight of relevant peer companies that  do not match on the other criteria                    |\n\nIn line with the Dutch Banking Code, the peer group consists of both financial and non-financial companies, taking into account the relevant international context. In addition, the Supervisory Board decided to exclude the UK and Switzerland from our peer group, due to different pay structures in their financial sectors. Substantially smaller banks and companies were also excluded because these are less complex compared to large financial institutions like ING. Following an external and independent review in line with the Executive Board remuneration policy in 2022, the current peer group composition remains unchanged and comprises:\n\n| ABN AMRO   | Ahold Delhaize   | BBVA            | Deutsche Bank    |\n|------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Aegon      | ASML             | Banco Santander | Intesa Sanpaolo  |\n| NN Group   | Heineken         | BNP Paribas     | Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale |\n| Rabobank   | Philips          | Cr\u00e9dit Agricole | UniCredit        |\n\nIn line with the requirements laid down in the Dutch Banking Code the actual earned total direct compensation of members of the Executive Board under the Executive Board remuneration policy should be below the market median of the peer group. The calculation of pay positioning of the Executive Board members against the peer group is performed on that basis (i.e. actual fixed salary plus actual variable remuneration). The Executive Board members are all paid well below the median in 2022.",

        "page_content": "- > Remuneration report\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nThe individual base salaries are set according to the role, responsibilities and experience of each Executive Board member with reference to market practice. The Remuneration Committee reviews the individual base salaries of the Executive Board members annually and advises the Supervisory Board on this. The Supervisory Board has the discretion to increase the individual base salaries. The below factors are given consideration in determining their base salaries:\n\n- \u00b7 the individual's level of skill and performance;\n- \u00b7 remuneration level at the external peer group;\n- \u00b7 internal pay ratios and salary increases for other employees within ING;\n- \u00b7 public indexation reference points (e.g. consumer price index); and\n- \u00b7 stakeholder views.\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nVariable remuneration for Executive Board members is limited to a maximum of 20% of base salary in line with legislative requirements. The Executive Board remuneration policy provides for an at target variable remuneration of 16% of base salary. At least 50% of this is based on non-financial performance criteria. For the CRO the non-financial performance criteria is 75%. If performance criteria are exceeded, the Supervisory Board can increase the variable component to the maximum of 20% of base salary. If performance is below target, the variable component will be decreased, potentially down to zero.\n\nThe applicable performance criteria are based on ING's strategy and priorities for the financial year, aiming to drive sustainable outcomes for ING, including financial returns that correspond to shareholder returns in the short and longer term. The performance criteria contribute therefore to the long-term objectives of ING.\n\nAll variable remuneration is awarded fully in shares. There is a minimum holding period of five years from the award date plus an additional holding year as of the vesting date. This combination (i.e. all shares plus a long holding period) fosters alignment with shareholders and a focus on the long term.\n\nThe Supervisory Board pre-determines the performance criteria for the Executive Board each year to ensure alignment between ING's strategy, performance objectives and long-term interest. For further details on the pay-out of variable remuneration please see the Executive Board remuneration policy which is disclosed in full on ing.com under the section 'Remuneration'. On the right side the pay-out scheme of variable remuneration for Executive Board members is illustrated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Fully delivered in shares.",

This is the same as for all employees working in the Netherlands without a supplementary pension scheme. Executive Board members are compensated for the lack of pension accrual above this amount by means of an individual savings allowance (see 'Benefits'), to be determined annually, on the same terms that apply to other participants in the Collective Defined Contribution pension plan. The set-up of this compensation for the lack of pension accrual is in line with best practices in the Netherlands.\n\n## Benefits\n\nExecutive Board members are eligible for additional benefits, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 contributions individual savings plans;\n- \u00b7 travel and accident insurance; and\n- \u00b7 individual savings allowance (as explained under 'Pension' above);\n- \u00b7 other benefits:\n- - expatriate allowances (such as housing, school/tuition fees and international health insurances, if applicable);\n- - banking and insurance benefits from ING (on the same terms as for other employees of ING in the Netherlands);\n- - tax and financial planning services to ensure compliance with the relevant legislative requirements;\n- - the use of a company car or driver service.\n\n## Tenure\n\nMembers of the Executive Board are appointed by shareholders at the General Meeting for a maximum period of four years. They may be reappointed by shareholders at the General Meeting in line with ING's Articles of Association and applicable rules and regulation. Executive Board members have a commission contract for an indefinite period. ING has the option to terminate the contract if a member is not reappointed by shareholders at the General Meeting, or if their membership of the Executive Board is terminated. There is a three-month notice period for individual board members and a six-month notice period for ING. During this time the board member would continue to work and in principle remains eligible for all agreed remuneration components.\n\nIn the event of an involuntary exit, Executive Board members are eligible for an exit arrangement. If termination of the contract is based on mutual agreement, the Executive Board member is eligible for a severance payment. These arrangements are subject to specific requirements (e.g. limited to a maximum of one year of fixed base salary and under the condition that there should be no reward for failure). Should an\n\nExecutive Board member depart voluntarily or in circumstances involving fraud, gross negligence, wilful misconduct or any activity detrimental to ING, no severance payment or award of variable remuneration over the performance year will be made and outstanding deferrals will lapse.\n\n## Annual review of the Executive Board remuneration\n\nIn accordance with the Executive Board remuneration policy, the Supervisory Board annually determines the actual remuneration for members of the Executive Board, based on advice from the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's responsibilities include preparing the Supervisory Board for decisions regarding the individual remuneration of members of the Executive Board. In performing its tasks the Remuneration Committee takes note of the views of individual Executive Board members with regard to the amount and structure of their own remuneration. Remuneration proposals for individual Executive Board members are drawn up in accordance with the Executive Board remuneration policy and cover the following aspects: remuneration structure, external benchmark results based on peer group review, the amount of the fixed and variable remuneration components, the performance criteria used, scenario analyses that were carried out and, if and when considered appropriate, stakeholder engagement and the pay ratios within the company and its affiliated enterprises. In the performance of its tasks the Remuneration Committee works together with the Risk Committee.\n\n## Special employment conditions\n\nIn line with the Executive Board remuneration policy, the Supervisory Board may decide to temporarily apply special employment conditions, for example to secure the recruitment of new Executive Board members in exceptional circumstances when this is necessary to serve the long-term interests and sustainability of ING as a whole, or to assure its viability. In 2022, there were no such special employment conditions granted.",

        "page_content": "- > Remuneration report\n\n## 2022 Remuneration Executive Board\n\nThis section includes details of remuneration for Executive Board members relating to the period served on the Executive Board in 2022.\n\nIn line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, ING calculates the internal ratio of the remuneration for the chief executive officer (CEO) compared to the average remuneration of all ING staff. Using the CEO's total remuneration (i.e. the total of fixed and variable remuneration, including benefits such as pension and allowances) compared to the average remuneration for all ING staff, the ratio in 2022 was 1:25. Furthermore, we also calculated the average ratio of total remuneration for the chief financial officer (CFO) and chief risk officer (CRO) compared to all ING staff. On that basis the average ratio in 2022 for the CFO and CRO was 1:18. The lower ratios for 2022 compared to 2021, are mainly caused by the fact that the average remuneration for all ING staff has increased.\n\n## Remuneration versus company performance and average employee remuneration\n\nTable 1 shows the development of directors' remuneration (Executive Board and Supervisory Board members), company performance and the average remuneration of an ING employee. This is carried out by showing the development of the remuneration for Executive Board and Supervisory Board members over the last five years presented in percentages.\n\nWith respect to the remuneration of the Supervisory Board, it should be noted that there is no link to company performance in order to safeguard its independent role.\n\nThe relative performance of the company is presented on three different metrics over the last five years. The metrics consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail primary relationships.\n- \u00b7 Return on equity based on IFRS-EU equity.\n- \u00b7 Profit before tax for ING Group.\n\nFinally, we present the development of the remuneration on average (per employee). For this number we use the same data as for the internal ratio.",

The relative total compensation increase from 2018 to 2019 is fully attributable to the fact that no variable remuneration was awarded for performance year 2018.\n- 5 Fixed remuneration for Executive Board members is not linked to company performance but is predominantly based on a benchmark exercise. Total direct compensation of Executive Board members should stay below the median of the benchmark, in line with the Dutch Banking Code. This has a mitigating effect on the correlation with company performance.\n- 6 The relative total compensation increase from 2020 to 2021 is mainly caused by the fact that no variable remuneration was awarded for the performance year 2020.\n- 7 In 2021, the methodology to calculate the average employee remuneration has been updated. Comparative for 2020 has been updated accordingly.\n- 8 There is no correlation between Supervisory Board remuneration and company performance. Supervisory Board members do not receive any variable remuneration. Their remuneration is based on fixed fees related to their role and number of meetings. The high fluctuations are caused by role changes during the year and differences in the number of meetings.",

This process serves as the foundation to determine the variable remuneration for Executive Board members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the start of the performance year, the Supervisory Board approves the financial, non-financial and risk performance targets applicable to the Executive Board members for that year:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial performance target areas include profit-based and return-based targets.\n- \u00b7 Non-financial performance target areas include customer (except the CRO), risk and regulatory, strategy, sustainability and people.\n\nEach performance target area is weighted and combined all weightings total 100 percent. The Dutch Remuneration Policy for Financial Enterprises Act (Wet Beloningsbeleid Financi\u00eble Ondernemingen, Wbfo) specifies that at least 50 percent of variable remuneration metrics must be based on non-financial targets. The CEO is aligned fully to Group performance while for the CFO it is a mix of both Group and functional performance targets. The non-financial targets for the CRO are predominantly based on performance targets that are linked to the function and role.\n\nThe target areas, targets and weightings are included in the performance target cards for each Executive Board member. The performance target card consists of both quantitative and qualitative-based targets to achieve a balanced and holistic assessment. Quantitative-based targets are measured primarily on a formulaic basis where the expected target performance level must be achieved before the on-target payout can be earned. Qualitative targets are clearly defined with descriptors of levels of what is expected of the performance, for example, speed of delivery, quality of delivery and ways of working. These are assessed using a standard three-point rating scale which aligns with ING's Step Up Performance rating approach. The overall outcome of the performance target card assessment described above is the 'starting point' for determining the variable remuneration of the Executive Board members.\n\nThroughout the year, regular conversations take place between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board to review their performance. Progress against performance measures is formally tracked and discussed at least twice a year in the mid-year and year-end reviews. The Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee takes an active role in assessing the performance of individual Management Board members, and informs both the Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee.\n\nAt the end of the year, the Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee provide input and assess the performance of Executive Board members to determine the variable remuneration to be awarded. They jointly advise the Supervisory Board on the recommendations to get final approval of the awards. This follows a multi-step and integrated process that closely aligns with the way that variable remuneration is determined for the wider ING workforce. The process covers an assessment of their performance, based on individual performance target cards. It includes targets and ranges agreed to at the beginning of the performance year, along with risk assessments measured on an ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustment basis (see also 'The comprehensive process around variable remuneration', under point 5.).\n\nThe integrated performance assessment process for determining variable remuneration also takes into account financial and operational performance, risk and compliance, as well as behaviour and conduct of each Executive Board member. This is supported by a robust framework for considering risk and conduct, which is in line with regulations. It includes the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance hurdles - Executive Board members are only eligible for consideration of their variable remuneration if both of the performance hurdles are met. This is in line with all employees who are eligible for discretionary variable remuneration. See 'Performance hurdles' for further details.\n- \u00b7 Risk and regulatory adjustments - Performance against risk and regulatory targets within the core performance target cards are made including an assessment of financial risks and non-financial risks targets measured on an ex-ante basis. The targets and ranges are set at the beginning of the financial year, taking into account ING's risk appetite statement framework. Performance against these risk and regulatory targets may lead to a downward or upward modification in variable remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Additional risk adjustments - Further downward risk adjustments may also be made to variable remuneration based on broader risk management performance not within risk appetite, including additional ex-ante risk performance that needs to be considered and/or ex-post risk events that may lead to a financial or reputational impact on ING. Risk and Human Resources also assess potential risk adjustments, holdbacks or clawbacks impacting variable remuneration.\n\nThe CRO is responsible for recommending any risk-adjustments to variable remuneration awards for the CEO and CFO. The Risk Committee is responsible for recommending this for the CRO. The final decision is made by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board, based on the advice of the Remuneration Committee and Risk Committee, decides on any risk adjustments (potentially to zero) to variable remuneration for Executive Board members. As a final step in the process, in exceptional circumstances the Supervisory Board may apply its discretion to adjust upwards or downwards the variable remuneration of Executive Board members.\n\n## 2022 Executive Board base salary\n\nThe base salary for all roles of the Executive Board remained unchanged for 2022 as disclosed in our 2021 Remuneration Report.",

The strategy was sharpened and execution of it delivered strong results. Significant progress was made in the various target areas.\n\nThe number of primary customers increased by 585,000 over the course of the year to 14.6 million. Financial and non-financial risks were well managed. In the area of sustainability, the volume mobilized increased to \u20ac101 bln compared to \u20ac88 bln in 2021. Intermediate 2030 targets were set for all nine Terra sectors. In several countries products were launched to stimulate climate-supportive action by customers.\n\nFinancially, strongly recovered interest income and resilient fee income drove total income to a record of \u20ac18.6 bln. Expense growth was limited despite the impact of higher salary costs and higher marketing expenses to invest in the growth of our customer base. Profit before tax came out at \u20ac5.5 bln, 18.9% below 2021, as additions to loan loss provisions were higher on the back of the war in Ukraine while 2021 included significant releases from Covid-19 related overlays. This also led to a corresponding decline in Return on Equity to 7.2%, on a strong capital base.\n\nThe financial and capital results were well above the performance hurdles. Following this achievement, the Supervisory Board conducted a thorough and balanced performance assessment. Based on the outcomes of this and their overall achievements, the Supervisory Board concluded that the Executive Board members delivered satisfactory results in 2022.\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board considered whether any discretionary adjustment was required and determined that both the financial and non-financial results speak for themselves in the current environment. The Supervisory Board also considered the behaviour of the Executive Board members and saw no reason to apply any discretionary adjustments.\n\nIn the final step, the Supervisory Board took into consideration the feedback of the CRO and Risk Committee on risk and compliance matters. Here, there was no reason to apply any individual additional risk adjustments in accordance with ING's Remuneration Regulations Framework (IRRF). 3\n\nFollowing this performance assessment process the resulting variable remuneration award for Steven van Rijswijk is \u20ac276,796; for Tanate Phutrakul \u20ac191,398; and for Ljiljana \u010cortan \u20ac200,957. For the CEO, this\n\nequates to a variable remuneration award at 15.6% out of the maximum 20% cap. For the CFO it represents 15.7% out of the maximum 20% cap and for the CRO it represents 16.4% out of the maximum 20% cap (see table 2. '2022 variable remuneration outcomes').\n\nAs recognised in the profit or loss statement of 2022, the expenses for each Executive Board member (active on 31 December 2022), relating to their role on the Executive Board, amount to \u20ac2.4 million for the CEO, \u20ac1.7 million for the CFO and \u20ac1.8 million for the CRO. These amounts include deferred elements from previous years, paid out in 2022.\n\nThe following paragraphs (i.e. total direct compensation, pension costs and benefits) show the remuneration awarded to individual Executive Board members with respect to the performance years 2022 and 2021. 4 All Executive Board remuneration is paid directly by ING.\n\n## 3.

        "page_content": "- > Remuneration report\n\n## Performance management\n\nWe aim to reward for success and avoid rewarding for failure. That is why ING's remuneration approach is strongly linked to a robust and transparent performance management process. Outcomes of performance evaluations (including collective and individual risk assessments) provide input for remuneration. As not all employees are eligible for variable remuneration there is not necessarily a link to financial performance. In the Netherlands, for example the vast majority of the employees do not receive any individual variable remuneration.\n\nStep Up Performance Management is our global performance management approach applicable to almost all employees. It aims to improve people's individual performance and thereby team performance and ultimately ING's performance. Step Up Performance Management is one of our people practices that help to increase focus, alignment and transparency. We do this through continuous conversations between managers, employees and teams. To support these conversations, there are three formal moments to discuss performance during the year: target setting, mid-year review and year-end evaluation.\n\nThe Step Up Performance Management approach consists of three dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 Job: the impact employees have in their daily work on an individual and team level, based on factors such as qualitative job description, dynamic planning and specific selected quantitative priorities.\n- \u00b7 Orange Code behaviours: how employees do their work and how effective their behaviour is as a professional and colleague. We expect all employees to act in line with ING's Orange Code to deliver on ING's purpose in a sustainable way.\n- \u00b7 Stretch ambitions: at ING, we believe high performance requires stretch and investment (to achieve the stretch). Therefore we ask people to set ambitions, describing how to contribute beyond the day-to-day role, focusing on the main priorities and long-term success of ING.\n\nAll targets are agreed between the employee and their manager, as well as within management teams, to ensure consistency across the organisation. ING uses three ratings to evaluate performance: excellent, well done and improvement required.\n\nStep Up Performance Management does not prescribe the targets employees should set. However, the following regulatory requirements apply to specific groups:\n\n- \u00b7 For employees eligible for variable remuneration, a minimum of 50% non-financial priorities.\n- \u00b7 For all employees in control functions (Risk, Compliance and Audit), no individual (commercial) financial KPIs are allowed, unless required by local law.\n\n- \u00b7 For identified risk takers, risk mitigation measures may lead to a downwards adjustment of the performance outcome and negatively affect variable remuneration (a risk modifier can be applied).\n\n## Total direct compensation\n\nING aims to provide total direct compensation for expected business and individual performance which is, on average, at the median of the markets in which we operate. ING's main reference market against which we compare and benchmark our compensation levels consists of other European headquartered banks and Financial Services organisations that are comparable in terms of size, business mix and scope. This reference market is reviewed periodically so as to ensure our peer firms remain appropriate and our pay levels market competitive.\n\nThe approach taken in determining the reference market is to i.) ensure that the pay strategy of the firms in the peer group is comparable to ING's pay strategy, ii.) sound and defensible when explained to stakeholders, iii.) reflective of similar company attributes and core competencies for talent, iv.) consistent with business and financial scope characteristics, and v.) comprehensive enough to stand up over time to changes in the market (e.g. M&A, divestiture, etc.). In addition to the core peer group consisting of European headquartered banks and financial services organisations which applies to all countries in which ING operates, ING has not only identified additional local banks and financial services organisations in order to capture the local dynamics (including local talent pool), but also technology firms that serve as a secondary reference point for benchmarking certain tech roles.\n\nFixed remuneration represents a sufficiently high proportion, in line with the level of expertise and skills, and allows a fully flexible variable remuneration award. Furthermore, the level of fixed remuneration allows variable remuneration to be reduced to zero. Variable remuneration is performance driven, subject to regulatory caps and prevents excessive risk taking.\n\n## The comprehensive process around variable remuneration\n\nThe awarding of variable remuneration, where applicable, is based on group, business line and individual performance criteria unless local legislation prescribes otherwise. The criteria used to measure performance is aligned with the business strategy, objectives, corporate culture, values and long-term interests of ING. In all ING countries, we adhere to the applicable variable remuneration caps.\n\nFor Identified Staff (i.e. staff considered to have a material impact on ING's risk profile), at least 40% of variable remuneration is deferred over a period of four or five years (depending on the level of seniority) with a tiered vesting schedule. Furthermore, at least 50% of variable remuneration is awarded in equity (or equity-linked instruments unless local legislation prescribes otherwise). The deferral scheme and",

The VRAM construct follows a five-step process, as outlined below, leading to risk-adjusted variable remuneration pools determined at a Group and business line level. The 2022 VRAM set-up was approved by the Management Board and Supervisory Board.\n\n- 1. Target VR Pool baseline (\"starting point\") which is the aggregate of individual target variable remuneration amounts for all eligible employees across ING.\n- 2.  Performance hurdles, which must be met in order to unlock the discretionary variable remuneration pools. These are:\n- \u00b7 The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio must be at or above the threshold established by applicable regulations;\n- \u00b7 The return on equity (reported RoE) is equal to or higher than the percentage determined at the beginning of each performance year by the Management Board Banking and the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn addition, where capital (CET1) is below risk appetite a downward adjustment may be applied to reduce the variable remuneration down to zero.\n\n- 3. Financial and non-financial and risk performance which is an assessment against a balanced mix of performance targets. Financial measures (e.g. profit, return on equity) are used to drive long-term growth, financial strength and affordability. In addition, different types of non-financial performance measures (e.g. customer, strategy, risk and regulatory, sustainability and people) are also taken into consideration. Here, ING has a responsibility to society to take into account relevant Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) matters when determining our remuneration policies. ESG is a key area of focus in the VRAM scorecards where people, sustainability and regulatory commitments are used to provide a clear line of sight into ING's ESG strategy, ambitions and targets and encourage broader responsibility to support real change from the wider workforce.\n- 4. CEO discretion can be exercised to adjust the proposed variable remuneration pools. The CEO considers several performance factors when making this decision. This discretion is checked by the Supervisory Board and requires its approval.\n- 5. Risk adjustments are the final and independent step in the process where there is an assessment made by the CRO to risk adjust the variable remuneration pools. Here, the CRO may recommend risk adjustments to variable remuneration pools (and potentially down to zero) at a group, business line,\n\nentity and country level across additional ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustment measures. All relevant financial and non-financial risks will be considered within this step, both on a current and future risk basis (i.e. ex-ante risk adjustments), to ensure the VRAM outcome is appropriate in the context of overall risk performance. In addition, ex-post risk adjustments including collective or one-off risk events are a key element in the process of determining variable remuneration pools. The ex-ante and/or ex-post risk adjustments require Supervisory Board approval, taking into account the input of the Risk function and the advice of the Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe final risk adjustment measure lies in the individual performance assessment itself. An employee's performance is extensively assessed before variable remuneration is awarded. Every manager carefully assesses the performance delivered by their individual team members on the basis of pre-agreed performance objectives and in line with the Step Up Performance Management framework. In addition, managers have discretion to lower the proposed variable remuneration if risk-taking is perceived as inappropriate. In this way, variable remuneration is aligned with any additional risks identified on an individual basis during the performance year.\n\nAdditional risk requirements apply to Identified Staff who are considered risk takers in accordance with Capital Rights Directive (CRD). These risk requirements set the minimum standards to be met during the performance year. Deviation from these standards may lead to downward adjustment of the variable remuneration, a so-called risk modifier. This process is run independently by the Risk function for which the CRO is ultimately responsible.\n\nFinally, a post-award risk assessment can be applied. This assessment analyses whether any events or findings occurred that should lead to a downward adjustment of variable remuneration also of previous years by applying a holdback (i.e., in-year variable remuneration award reduction, forfeiture of up to 100% of the awarded, but unvested, variable remuneration) or clawback (surrender of up to 100% of the paid or vested variable remuneration).\n\n## Shareholders' mandate to exceed 100% variable remuneration cap\n\nING's remuneration policies comply with international and local legislation and regulations. Under the Dutch WBFO (which sets various requirements on remuneration), financial institutions are permitted to set a variable remuneration cap higher than 100% (but not higher than 200%) of fixed remuneration for employees outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), provided that the higher cap is approved by shareholders and does not conflict with ING's capital adequacy requirements.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, shareholders approved to apply an increased maximum percentage of up to 200% for employees outside the EEA for a period of five performance years until end-2026. For 2022, it was applied to eight employees worldwide. This mandate is used on an exceptional basis by ING and in 2019, 2020 and 2021 applied to a limited number of employees worldwide.",

The awarding of variable remuneration, where applicable, is based on group, business line and individual performance criteria, both financial, non-financial and risk-based, and comes in the form of both discretionary and collective variable remuneration.\n\nCollective variable remuneration is based on collective labour agreements and/or profit sharing schemes that are driven by regulation, law and/or workers council agreements in various countries. Over the past years the total amount of collective variable remuneration has been relatively stable and typically accounts for around 25% of the total spend on variable remuneration.\n\nIn 2022, our capital base and liquidity remained strong. From a performance perspective, the 'underlying' financial results were strong with rising interest rates supporting the revenue growth while the inflationary pressure was not yet fully reflected in cost growth. However, the 2022 results were impacted by a number of material events, such as the elevated risk costs stemming from the war in Ukraine and deteriorating economic outlook. Non-financial performance was good with effective risk management leading to positive adjustments for financial and non-financial risk across most business lines. Overall, this resulted in a riskadjusted discretionary Group VR pool at \u20ac324.7 million, equating to a 1.8% decrease against the target discretionary VR baseline (\"starting point\") and 3.8% increase versus the previous performance year.\n\nThe total actual amount of both discretionary and collective variable remuneration awarded to all eligible employees globally for 2022 was \u20ac426.6 million (\u20ac101.9 million in collective variable remuneration), compared to total staff expenses of \u20ac6,152 million. For 2021, the total amount was \u20ac417.8 million (\u20ac105.0 million in collective variable remuneration) on \u20ac5,941 million staff expenses.\n\nIn 2022, 14 employees - excluding members of the Management Board Banking - were awarded total annual remuneration (including employer pension contributions and excluding severance payments made) of \u20ac1 million or more.

        "page_content": "- > Executive Board statement\n\n## Executive Board statement\n\nIn accordance with best practice provision 1.4.3 of the 2016 Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Executive Board (EB) of ING Groep N.V. states that it is responsible for the design, implementation and functioning of ING's internal risk management and control systems.\n\nING's internal risk management and control is a process, effectuated by the EB, senior management, and other personnel. It is designed to mitigate risks and provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Effectiveness and efficiency of operations.\n- \u00b7 Compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies, and the ING Values as part of the Orange Code.\n- \u00b7 Reliability of financial and non-financial information.\n- \u00b7 Safeguarding of assets, identification and management of liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Strategic goals of ING Groep N.V.\n\nThe Risk management section as part of the Report of the EB elaborates on ING's identified financial and non-financial risks (including credit risk, solvency risk, market risk, operational risk, IT risk, model risk, compliance risk, funding and liquidity risk, environmental, social and governance risk and business risk) and how these risks are managed. Its chapters provide insight into the potential impact on the results of ING Groep N.V. that stem from these identified risks. The design and functioning of the internal risk management and control systems are based on the Risk Appetite Framework and the Non-Financial Risk Framework. Both frameworks, explained in detail in 'Risk management', combine various financial and nonfinancial risk disciplines into a single converged approach and provide the businesses with an overview on their risks and the way these are managed. This view allows the EB and senior management to form an opinion on the adequacy of internal risk management and control systems regarding the risks they face while pursuing ING's strategy.\n\nIn addition, ING has a process in place where, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, ING assesses the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, based on the criteria of the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Reporting Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). The design and the operation of the internal risk management and control systems are discussed annually with the Risk Committee and the full Supervisory Board, whereas the design and the operation of internal control over financial reporting are discussed annually with the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. As part of this process, improvement in the bank-wide\n\nknow your customer (KYC) enhancement operations was discussed with the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. We are continuing our global KYC enhancement operations, emphasising regulatory compliance as the key priority. The organisation continues to work hard on enhancing our customer duediligence files and on a number of structural solutions to bring our anti-money laundering activities to a sustainably better level. In discharging the responsibility for ING's internal risk management and control systems, the EB has made an assessment of the effectiveness of the ING Groep N.V.'s internal control and risk management systems. Based on this assessment, the EB states that during the year under review:\n\n- \u00b7 The report of the EB in the ING Group Annual Report 2022 provides sufficient insights into the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems.\n- \u00b7 Those systems provide reasonable assurance that the ING Group Annual Report 2022 does not contain material inaccuracies.\n- \u00b7 Based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the ING Group Annual Report 2022 is prepared on a going concern basis.\n- \u00b7 The report of the EB in the ING Group Annual Report 2022 states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation of ING Groep N.V.'s continuity for the period of 12 months after the preparation of this report.\n\nIt should be noted that the above does not imply that these systems and procedures provide absolute assurance to ING as to the realisation of financial and strategic business objectives, or that internal risk management and control systems can prevent or detect all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud and non-compliances with legislation, rules and regulations. There are a number of risks in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear, subject to multiple interpretations or under development, or where regulations may conflict with one another, or where regulators revise their previous guidance or courts overturn previous rulings. Despite our efforts to maintain effective compliance procedures and to comply with applicable laws and regulations we therefore cannot rule out the risk of non-compliance with applicable standards. We're committed to conducting our business with integrity, and regulatory compliance has remained the priority for 2023 and beyond.\n\nAmsterdam, 6 March 2023\n\nS.J.A.

        "page_content": "## Works councils\n\nING's works councils are elected by employees and represent the interests of both the employee and\n\nemployer. They contribute ideas on economic and social issues and in doing so contribute to the proper functioning of the company and alignment with ING's purpose and strategy. The Employee Council (the name given to the collective works councils in the Netherlands) consists of five works councils and the Central Works Council (CWC). The CWC consists of at least two delegates per works council and is the overarching body that engages with management on topics that impact all Dutch employees. Council members are elected every three years. ING also has a cross-border European Works Council (EWC), which is consulted when decisions are made that affect employees in multiple countries and cannot be negotiated locally.\n\n## Looking back on 2022\n\nA significant number of new members of the EWC were elected at the start of the year, which was pleasing given that employee involvement is a major part of a works council role. We also attracted many new participants. They provide knowledge in departments where the Employee Council lacks representation. Covid-19 continued to affect employees in 2022. With Hybrid Mode (a new way of working partly at home and partly in the office) still in operation, works councils were busy gaining the necessary insights and experience to provide advice. Returning to the 'new normal' has also resulted in numerous Requests for Advice (RfAs) that relate to the next phase of the Agile way of working. The maturity of the Agile organisation may lead to more organisational changes. There were several organisational changes issued in 2022. The Employee Council received 44 Requests for Advice, 10 Requests for Consent and 101 Information Memos. All reorganisations had a significant impact on the colleagues involved.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nIn 2023, the implementation of hybrid mode is expected to remain an important factor for the Employee Council. As the policies of both the government and ING change, so will the insights and advice of works councils. Furthermore, sustainability had become a serious topic and will dominate the agendas of different works councils as will developments in the labour market. Employment conditions, remuneration and organisational objectives will continue to be important in attracting and retaining employees.\n\n## Members of the Central Works Council (October 2022)\n\nMohammed Zemouri\n\n| Raoul van Eekelen                | Raoul van Eekelen   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Emmanuel Flick                   |                     |\n| Anthony Kaper                    |                     |\n| Michiel van Lagen (chair)        |                     |\n| Ludy Limburg                     |                     |\n| Sofiane Maktouf                  |                     |\n| Leo Mekenkamp (secretary)        |                     |\n| Nataliya Nikitina                |                     |\n| Viktoriya Petkova (deputy chair) |                     |\n| Danielle Sharma                  |                     |\n| Marinus Stoffers                 |                     |\n| Jeroen van der Veer              |                     |\n\n## Members of the European Works Council (December 2022)\n\n| Belgium        | Eric Caufriez, Erwin Veestraeten, Jean-Claude Van Den  Abeele                   |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bulgaria       | Biliana Petrova-Yaneva                                                          |\n| Czech Republic | Jan Gajdos                                                                      |\n| France         | Damien Fortin                                                                   |\n| Germany        | Karina Demarczyk, Maciej Mowinski, Ulrich Probst                                |\n| Hungary        | G\u00e9za Bodor (chair)                                                              |\n| Italy          | Claudio Casazza, Sami Zambon                                                    |\n| Luxembourg     | Fabrizio Parisi                                                                 |\n| Netherlands    | Arsheen Shaikh, Jeroen van der Veer (vice-chair), Jordy  Leber, Sofiane Maktouf |\n| Poland         | Artur Banasik, Mariusz Cieslik, Rafal Bednarski                                 |\n| Romania        | Andrea Dardala, Vlad Pop                                                        |\n| Slovakia       | Andrea Subjakova                                                                |\n| Spain          | Beatriz Garcia Trujillo, Monica de la Viuda Valverde                            |",

While businesses and households were still recovering from the economic consequences of Covid-19, developments in Ukraine further distorted supply chains, caused higher energy costs and aggravated an already high inflation rate environment. This, in combination with central bank rate hikes, worsened the macroeconomic outlook. This section explains ING's approach towards risk management.\n\nAs a global financial institution with a strong European base, offering banking services, ING is exposed to a variety of risks. We manage these risks through a comprehensive risk management framework that integrates risk management into strategic planning and daily business activities. This aims to safeguard ING's financial strength and reputation by promoting the identification, measurement and management of risks at all levels of the organisation. Taking measured risks aligned with its risk appetite is core to ING's business.\n\nThe risk management function supports the EB in formulating the risk appetite, strategies, policies and limits. It provides adequate steering, oversight, challenge and controls throughout ING on risk-related items.\n\nThis section sets out how ING manages its risks on a day-to-day basis. It explains how the risk management function is embedded within the organisation based on the 'three lines of defence' model. It describes the key risks that arise from ING's business model and how these are managed by dedicated risk management departments, with various specific areas of expertise. The section provides qualitative and quantitative disclosures on solvency, credit, market, funding and liquidity, ESG, operational, IT, compliance, business and model risks.\n\n## Risk categories\n\nING's main risks are described in the categories below. Chapters in the risk management section are based on how risks are managed internally. Operational and IT risks are part of the Non-financial risk (NFR) chapter.\n\n| Overview of risk categories   | Overview of risk categories    | Overview of risk categories                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                               | Risk categories Sub-categories | Defined as:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                               | Solvency risk                  | The risk of lacking sufficient capital to fulfil business objectives, regulatory  requirements or market expectations.

Examples of such differences include the exclusion of accrued interest and certain costs and fees from risk data, and timing differences in exposure values (IFRS 9 models report expected credit loss on underlying exposures). Disclosures in accordance with Part Eight of the CRR2 and CRD V, and as required by the supervisory authority, are published in our 'Additional Pillar III Report', which can be found on our corporate website ing.com.\n\n## Top and emerging risks\n\nThe risks listed below are defined as existing and emerging risks which could cause actual results to differ, in some instances materially, from those anticipated. They may have a material impact on the reputation of the company, introduce volatility in future operating results or impact ING's medium and long-term strategy including the ability to pay dividends, maintain appropriate levels of capital or meet liquidity and funding targets. An emerging risk is defined as a risk that has the potential to have a significant negative effect on our performance, but where the impact on the organisation is currently more difficult to assess than other risk factors. These risks are on top of other existing risks.\n\nThe topics have mainly emerged as part of the annual risk assessment that feeds into, among others, the annual review of the Stress Testing Framework and the Risk Appetite Framework. The sequence in which the risks are presented below is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their financial consequences.\n\nThe 2022 risk assessment confirmed our top and emerging risks. The top risks in 2022 are related to geopolitical risk, financial crime, cybercrime and inflation risk. Climate change risk remains an emerging risk, and reflects the impact that climate change may have on the financial position and/or reputation of ING.\n\n## Geopolitical risk\n\nThis risk has obviously increased since the early start of 2022, mainly following the war in Ukraine and subsequent threats by Russia to limit or cut gas exports. Besides Russia's war in Ukraine, tensions between the US and China relating to Taiwan and trade issues have persisted this year.\n\n## The war in Ukraine\n\nThe war in Ukraine and rapidly escalating events in 2022 were, and still are, a significant tragedy to the people, causing disruption to business and economic activity in the region and worldwide. Subsequently, the US, the UK and the EU initiated sanctions against Russia in 2022. In response, the Russian central bank enforced liquidity and currency controls. The uncertainty about the outcome of the war will remain in the longer term.\n\n## Sanctions\n\nThe international community leveraged their sanction tools in response to the war in Ukraine. Accordingly, as part of ING's KYC and compliance risk governance and procedures, ING is continuously monitoring the situation to stay abreast on all relevant updates to implement effective and appropriate additional control measures and to manage the increased risk and financial impacts of these developments. For sanctionsrelated developments, more information is in 'Compliance risk'.\n\n## Our exposures\n\nING has Wholesale Banking activities in both Russia and Ukraine, as well as investments in Russia, some of which are denominated in local currency. Investments in Russia are in government securities as required by a subsidiary under Russian law. As a result of the war in Ukraine and related international response measures, including sanctions and capital controls, we face an increased risk of default of counterparties located in Russia and Ukraine. These include counterparties the ultimate parent of which is located in Russia, which may be considered effectively controlled or influenced through Russian involvement, and other counterparties in sectors affected by the international response measures. Furthermore, we have counterparty exposure to Russian entities in connection with foreign exchange derivatives for future receipt of foreign currencies against the Russian rouble.\n\nRemaining at risk for ING at year-end 2022 is \u20ac0.3 billion local equity and \u20ac2.5 billion credit exposures booked outside of Russia. In Ukraine, our exposure was approximately \u20ac500 million, mainly with liquidity facilities and other lending. Early in March 2022, we intensified monitoring of counterparties, continued managing our exposure and announced a decision to not do new Russia-related business.\n\nThe Russian and Ukrainian exposures are under continuous monitoring. Uncertainties on the evolution of the conflict will remain for some time to come. Since the start of the war, business and risk departments have worked on several sensitivity analyses and stress tests to assess the potential downside impact of the",

Furthermore, we are working together with counterparties, both onshore and offshore, to limit risks associated with derivatives exposures.\n\n## Financial crime risk\n\nWe're committed to fulfilling our role as a gatekeeper to the financial system, to protect customers, society and our bank from the corrosive effects of financial crimes such as money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, sanctions evasion and tax offences. It's our intention to not just comply with applicable laws and regulations in relation to financial crime, but also to continue to strengthen our financial crime control framework in a robust and sustainable way to prevent, detect and respond to illicit activity.\n\nWe continue to seek to harness new and innovative technological capabilities to create a safer environment for customers, our bank and society. In 2022, we further adjusted our financial crime risk appetite and framework of policies and procedures to reflect changes in the risk environment and responded to external developments.\n\nWe also sought to further empower our people with the skills and knowledge to fight financial crime, sharing insights with them about emerging and evolving threats (including in relation to financial crime risks linked to or heightened by the Covid-19 pandemic) and enhancing our training framework.\n\nFighting financial crime and protecting the integrity of the financial system is a challenge for all banks, given the constantly changing environment and pace at which criminals evolve their methods. We believe we can be more effective in our efforts if we collectively join forces and share intelligence with other banks and with national, European and international authorities and law enforcement to combat financial crime. We therefore continue to proactively participate in public-private partnerships, such as Transaction Monitoring Netherlands and Germany's Anti-Financial Crime Alliance, and to collaborate with other banks. Read more in 'How we are making the difference' and 'Compliance risk'.\n\n## Cybercrime\n\nCybercrime remains a continuous threat to companies in general and to financial institutions in particular. Both the frequency and the intensity of attacks are increasing on a global scale. The sophistication and implications of ransomware attacks are a growing concern.\n\nContinuous enhancement of the control environment to protect from, and detect and respond to, e-banking fraud, DDoS, targeted attacks and more specific ransomware attacks remains one of the highest priorities. Additional controls continue to be embedded in the organisation as part of the overall internal control framework and are continuously re-assessed against existing and new threats. In addition, ING continues to strengthen its global cybercrime and fraud resilience through extensive collaboration across the globe with\n\nfinancial industry peers, law enforcement authorities, government (e.g. National Cybersecurity Centre) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). See also 'How we are making the difference' and 'Non-financial risk'.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nInflation rates accelerated across the globe at the beginning of 2022, fuelled by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Inflationary pressures prompted an adjustment of monetary policy stances by major central banks, leading to rising interest rates and tighter global financial conditions.\n\nThe mix of high inflation and rising interest rates further deteriorated macro-financial conditions, aggravating pre-existing vulnerabilities for both businesses and households, which were recovering from the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, and ultimately increasing banks' credit risk. Against this background, ING has taken additional provisions already in the course of 2022.\n\nEU member states' governments have introduced several supporting measures to cushion the rise in energy prices and inflation. These measures, in conjunction with the reduced fiscal space resulting from the pandemic-related support measures and the normalisation of the monetary policy stance, increased sovereign vulnerabilities in financially weaker countries.\n\n## Climate change risk\n\nING is aware of the risks associated with climate change and how these can impact customers and their financial health. This includes physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk can be acute, such as flood and wildfires, or chronic, such as increased temperature and rising sea levels. Transition risk can be driven by policy, technological or market changes as we shift towards a low-carbon global economy and potentially lead to stranded assets.\n\nAn internal programme was launched in 2020 to address impacts resulting from climate change. In March 2022, ING updated its governance approach to embrace ESG holistically in business strategy. An ESG Committee was created at Supervisory Board level, responsible for supervising the bank's overall ESG transformation and advising the MBB on relevant ESG developments. ING also established an ESG Sounding Board comprised of senior leaders to guide the development and implementation of our strategy for ESG topics, as well as monitoring and reporting on progress. All ESG-related key performance indicators are assigned to MBB members and cascaded down through business lines. Further, after a strategic review of ING's CRO function, an ESG Risk Centre of Expertise, part of the Integrated Risk department, has been established. Our 2022 Climate Report on ing.com details our approach and sector-specific insights. See the 'Sustainability' section of ing.com for more on climate change.",

        "page_content": "- > Risk Management\n\n## Risk governance (*)\n\nEffective risk management requires company-wide risk governance. ING's risk and control structure is based on the 'three lines of defence' governance model. Each line has a specific role and defined responsibilities, with the execution of tasks being distinct from the control of these same tasks. The three lines work closely together to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor risks.\n\nThis governance framework is designed in such a way that risk is managed in line with the risk appetite approved by the MBB, the EB and the SB, and this approach is cascaded throughout ING.\n\nThe heads of ING's banking business and support functions and the heads of the country units, or their delegates, are the first line of defence. They have primary ownership, and accountability and responsibility for assessing, controlling and mitigating all financial and non-financial risks affecting their businesses, as well as for the completeness and accuracy of the financial statements and risk reports with respect to their areas of responsibility. The CTO is responsible and accountable for proper security and controls of global applications and IT platforms servicing the bank and implementing proper processes. The COO domain builds bridges within ING linking to almost every part of the bank. Its purpose is to drive secure and efficient processes for customers and colleagues.\n\nThe second line of defence consists of oversight and specialised functions in risk management and compliance. They (1) have co-responsibility for risk management, through articulating and translating the risk appetite into methodologies and policies to support and monitor business management's control of risk, (2) objectively challenge risk management execution and control processes and coordinate the reporting of risks and controls by the first line of defence, (3) advise on risk management and compliance and have decision-making power in relation to business activities that are judged to present unacceptable risks to ING and (4) can set minimum requirements in terms of quality and quantity of global resourcing in the risk management and compliance functions.\n\nThe internal audit function forms the third line of defence. It provides independent assurance to the Audit Committee, the EB and the MBB on the quality and effectiveness of ING's internal control, risk management, governance and implemented systems and processes in both the first and second lines of defence. To protect its independent nature, decisions regarding the appointment, reappointment or dismissal from office as well as the remuneration package of the head of the internal audit function require SB approval.\n\n## Board-level risk oversight (*)\n\nBoth the EB (for ING Group) and the MBB (for ING Bank) play an important role in managing and monitoring our risk management framework.\n\n- \u00b7 The SB is, for risk management purposes, advised mainly by the Risk Committee, which assists and advises in monitoring the risk profile and approving the overarching risk appetite of the company as well as the structure and effective operation of the internal risk management and control systems.\n- \u00b7 The EB is responsible for managing risks associated with all activities of ING Group, whereas the MBB is responsible for managing risks associated with all activities of ING Bank. The EB and MBB responsibilities include ensuring that internal risk management and control systems are effective and that ING Group and ING Bank comply with relevant legislation and regulations. On a regular basis, the EB and MBB report on these issues and discuss the internal risk management and control systems with the SB. On a quarterly basis, the EB and MBB report on ING's risk profile versus its risk appetite to the Risk Committee, explaining changes in the risk profile.\n\nAs a member of the EB and the MBB, the CRO is primarily responsible for: (i) supporting the board in its engagement with and oversight of the development of the risk appetite and risk appetite statements and for translating the risk appetite into a risk limits structure, actively engaged in monitoring performance relative to risk-taking and risk limit adherence; (ii) setting up the risk management framework and overseeing the development and implementation of risk and compliance policies, processes, models, compatible methodologies including both forward-looking and backward-looking tools, ongoing strengthening of risk management/people capabilities and reports, as necessary to ensure the effectiveness of robust internal control and risk systems to fully support its strategic objectives and all of its risk-taking activities; (iii) regularly providing comprehensive information on risks to the Management Board, the Risk Committee and other relevant functions; and (iv) advising about the current risk profile, current state of the risk culture, utilisation against the established risk appetite, and limits, limit breaches and mitigation plans. For more on the SB and EB roles and responsibilities see 'Corporate Governance'.\n\n## Executive level (*)\n\nThe risk committees described below act within the overall risk policy and delegated authorities granted by the MBB:\n\n- \u00b7 Global Credit and Trading Policy Committee (GCTP) discusses and approves policies, methodologies, and procedures related to credit, trading, country, and reputation (i.e. environmental and social risk or ESR) risks. The GCTP meets monthly. After the MBB and the GCTP, the Credit and Trading Risk Committee (CTRC) is the highest-level body authorised to discuss and approve policies, methodologies, and procedures related to credit and trading risk.",

The GCC(TA) meets twice a week.\n- \u00b7 Non-Financial Risk Committee Bank (NFRC Bank) is accountable for the design and maintenance of the non-financial risk management framework including operational risk management, compliance and legal policies, minimum standards, procedures and guidelines, development of tools, methods, and key parameters (including major changes) for risk identification, measurement, mitigating and monitoring/ reporting. NFRC Bank meetings are held at least quarterly.\n- \u00b7 The Model Risk Management Committee (MoRMC) discusses and steers, on a monthly basis, the overall model strategy. MoRMC discusses and approves policies and methodologies related to model risk management.\n- \u00b7 Global Data Committee (GDC) oversees (identifies, measures, responds to change and monitors) the Global  Data function and its contribution to wider society. The GDC meets every two months.\n\nFurther, in the Asset and Liability Committee Bank (ALCO Bank) risk related topics are discussed as well.\n\n## Regional and business unit level (*)\n\nING's regional and/or business unit management have primary responsibility for the management of risks (credit, market, funding and liquidity, operational, IT, compliance and model) that arise in their daily operations. They are accountable for the implementation and execution of appropriate risk frameworks affecting their businesses in compliance with procedures and processes at the corporate level. Where necessary, the implementation is adapted to local requirements.\n\nThe regional and/or business unit (BU) head of risk are involved in these activities. The local (regional and BU) head of risk is responsible for the analysis, monitoring and management of risks across the whole value chain (from front to back office). The local risks are discussed in local risk committees that roll up to the key risk committees at executive level. Local Client Integrity Risk Committees (CIRCs) assess client integrity risk and they have a final decision on client acceptance or client off-boarding, from a risk-based perspective, in the areas of financial crime, Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and ESR.\n\n## Organisational structure (*)\n\nThe Risk CRO function is organised along the lines of a matrix structure integrating (1) the Global Risk functions, (2) the Regional/Country Risk functions at entity level, and (3) the Risk Segments, with a uniform methodology and terminology, so that a holistic view of all risks is ensured. Global Risk functions, organised by risk types into risk domains (departments), are ultimately responsible and accountable for the functional steering of the respective risk type globally, ensuring a uniform taxonomy and methodology is used for the\n\nsetting of the relevant risk appetite levels, further cascading risk appetite into detailed risk strategies and for the effective monitoring and reporting of risks, on an individual and consolidated basis.\n\nThe following organisation chart illustrates the reporting lines in 2022 for the risk management organisation. The fixed lines reflect hierarchical reporting lines, whereas the dotted lines are for the functional reporting lines:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk policies, procedures and standards (*)\n\nING has a framework of risk management policies, procedures, and minimum standards in place to create consistency throughout the organisation, and to define requirements that are binding for all business units. The goal of the governance framework of the local business units is to align with ING's framework and to meet local (regulatory) requirements.

Policies, procedures and standards are regularly reviewed and updated via the relevant risk committees to reflect changes in requirements, markets, products and practices.\n\n## Internal control framework\n\nIn its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework, ING explains its approach to mitigating risk outside ING's risk appetite. The internal control framework (ICF) translates regulations and internal requirements into policies articulating specific risks and control objectives. These policies form the basis for translation into process control standards, which are used by the business to support and promote an effective risk and control environment. The ICF includes binding principles, definitions, process steps, and roles and responsibilities to create consistent bank-wide policies and control standards.\n\nGlobal policies and control standards are developed and maintained or updated within the ICF. These global documents are designed by head-office functions and are to be adhered to by all ING entities and support functions. In line with the ERM approach, ownership for policies will be with the second line of defence (2nd LoD), while control standards are to be owned by the first line of defence (1st LoD). Global policy and control standard documents are approved by relevant approval bodies (e.g. SB, EB, MBB and NFRC Bank).\n\nThe policies are based on the risk taxonomy, which is designed to prevent overlaps in policy control objectives. The control standard owners are responsible for defining the key controls that mitigate the critical and high inherent risks in the business processes.\n\nThe process of developing policy and process control standard documents includes the following steps: identify the document owner, determine the relevant stakeholders, define a risk-based approach, perform an impact assessment, involve relevant stakeholders and (local) entities for sounding on key and expected controls, and determine an approval body.\n\nThe principal role of the gatekeepers is to provide quality assurance and to advise on the relevant approval bodies. The ICF gatekeepers challenge document owners on the alignment of internal control documents with the agreed methodology and risk taxonomy, and verify that the development and communication of those documents are in line with the agreed process. All policies, control standards, and procedures are published on ING's intranet. New and updated documents are periodically communicated by means of a dedicated policy update bulletin to the country managers and senior heads of business departments.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nAt ING, we attach great importance to a sound risk culture, which is essential for performing our role in society responsibly and to keep the bank safe, secure and compliant. Our risk culture determines the way in which employees identify, understand, discuss, and act on the risks we are confronted with and the risks we take. In 2022, we continued to drive several enhancement projects based on our 2020 assessment of our risk culture. Most notably, enhancing our risk culture monitoring activities and bringing non-financial risk to life. Furthermore, in 2022 we also handed over the responsibility of developing and maintaining the risk culture maturity model and risk culture monitoring dashboard to the Risk Culture & Behavioural Risk department.\n\n## Orange Code and the global Code of Conduct\n\nThe Orange Code and the global Code of Conduct are the foundation of ING's risk culture. The global Code of Conduct defines the most essential conduct principles expected from ING employees in their daily activities, to create additional risk awareness and better meet expectations stated in external rules and guidelines. ING employees are required to take an annual e-learning and attest to their adherence to the global Code of Conduct. In 2021, the global Code of Conduct was embedded into our employees' performance management cycle with the aim ensuring continuous attention to the Global Code of Conduct, and dialogue on how to apply it in our daily work practice.\n\nThe Orange Code is a declaration of who we are. It describes what we can expect from each other when we turn up to work each day. It is a set of standards that we collectively value, strive to live up to, and invite others to measure us by.\n\nThe Orange Code is the sum of two parts, the ING values and ING behaviours, with integrity being the overarching principle. The ING values (being honest, prudent and responsible) are non-negotiable promises we make to the world, principles we seek to stick to, no matter what. The ING behaviours (take it on and make it happen, help others to be successful, and always be a step ahead) represent our way to differentiate ourselves. The Orange Code is embedded in commitments we make to each other and the standards by which we measure each other's performance.\n\n## Orange Code decision-making\n\nTo enhance risk awareness, we continued to support monitoring risk culture and compliance risk in the business. This included training by the experts of the newly created Risk Culture & Behavioural Risk (RC&BR) department, as well as by local compliance experts and data ethics experts with the goal of enhancing balanced decision-making in line with the Orange Code decision-making model. This four-step model supports moral learning and well-balanced decision-making.",

ING's PARP takes an objective, helicopter-view to safeguard the long-term customer's interest (societal developments, changing customer behaviour, life-events and so on) when manufacturing and/or distributing a product. The RC&BR department is continuing to train experts in this area within the local Compliance teams to support the organisation in properly applying the model in practice in their respective countries.\n\n## Learning\n\nIn 2022, we continued to expand and strengthen our required learning curriculum. This is foundational learning that is centrally created and rolled out to all staff across the bank. The focus in 2022 was on cybersecurity, fraud and KYC. Formats for our learning continue to be updated to increase engagement and to drive practical application of the knowledge gained by staff. The curriculum is tracked centrally to monitor timely completion.\n\nWe have expanded our learning for risk professionals, with the Risk Academy providing a range of learning for Risk staff to support their professional development. These take the form of a comprehensive offering of learning modules and learning channels that support employees in developing their knowledge, skills and behaviours.\n\n## Dutch Banker's Oath\n\nIn the Netherlands, all employees are required to take the Bankers' Oath and pledge this promise in a meaningful ceremony. The Oath came into force in the Netherlands on 1 April 2015, as part of a joint approach from all banks, aimed at introducing social regulations, a revised Dutch Banking Code implementing an oath with associated rules of conduct and disciplinary law. This way, Dutch banks show society what they stand for and are accountable for, both as individual banks and as a sector. In 2021, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, ING in the Netherlands held virtual Bankers' Oath ceremonies, instead of physical ones, to allow new employees (around 400 a month) to still take the Oath on time and in a meaningful ceremony. This was continued throughout 2022. Before taking the Oath, an e-learning is provided and the importance of the Oath is discussed. Also, dilemmas that the employees may come across in their daily work are shown, aimed at ensuring careful balancing of the interests of all our stakeholders, in the decisions we make. In 2020 and 2021 the whole Bankers' Oath programme for new joiners was revised and updated, to ensure that all elements still align with current developments, both internally and externally.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nING aims to align its remuneration policy with its risk profile and the interests of all stakeholders. For more information on ING's compensation and benefits policies and its relation to the risk taken, go to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) Remuneration Disclosure published on ing.com.\n\n## Risk Culture & Behavioural Risk department (RC&BR)\n\nIn March 2022, the Behavioural Risk department, the Risk Academy and Culture & Ethics department were combined to form a new Centre of Expertise for Risk Culture & Behavioural Risk, reporting directly to the CRO. The aim of the department is to provide a clear vision, aligned strategy and sound methodological approach to identify, assess and bring change to the way employees act on risks.\n\n## Behavioural risk\n\nBehavioural risk is an increasingly important risk area for ING and across the financial industry. It arises when behavioural patterns are at the root of financial and non-financial risks in the organisation.\n\nThe complexity of this type of risk is that it is less tangible compared to other risk areas because it focuses on behavioural patterns and their drivers. There are patterns in how decisions are made, how people communicate and whether they can take ownership. Behaviour is driven by formal and informal mechanisms. Examples of formal drivers are the processes ING applies and how its governance is structured. Informal drivers are less tangible, such as group dynamics or underlying beliefs that influence behaviour.\n\n## Behavioural risk assessments\n\nBehavioural risk assessments identify and analyse undesired behaviours within ING and provide management with specific direction on how to change these behaviours. They focus on the effectiveness of groups rather than individuals, the role of leadership and on less visible aspects such as team dynamics and unwritten social norms. The goal is to understand and systematically assess what drives undesired habits at ING. The Behavioural Risk Management Framework is used as the standard across ING to signal behavioural risks going forward. In 2022, behavioural risk assessments were carried out and focused on the topic of escalation behaviour.\n\n## Behavioural risk interventions\n\nBased on the results of the executed behavioural risk assessments, the behavioural risk intervention team mitigates behavioural risk in a focused manner. Effective mitigation requires a deep understanding of what drives undesired behaviours. Behavioural and organisational science theories and evidence-based techniques and tools play an important role in designing and facilitating interventions.\n\nIn 2022, the intervention team worked on several intervention plans. Together with Global KYC, the intervention team followed up on the previously held 'KYC World Cafe' - a large group change activity that drives common understanding, engagement and ownership and enhances learning and behavioural change, specifically designed for the KYC community. Another example that the team worked on in 2022 is the development and execution of new interventions that have been designed to improve speak-up and escalation behaviour in certain parts of the organisation.",

        "page_content": "- > Risk Management\n\nThe behavioural risk assessment and intervention team works closely with the business units and departments such as HR, Compliance and Internal Audit to align on and embed desired leadership and risk behaviours (i.e. speak up, psychological safety, communication, guiding leadership).\n\n## Risk Culture programme\n\nThroughout 2021 and 2022, ING executed the risk culture programme that was developed based on the 2020 self-assessment. The emphasis in 2022 was on further evolving the risk culture dashboard as well as facilitating meaningful conversations on risk culture throughout the organisation. Risk culture is actively discussed by the MBB and the SB on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Risk cycle process\n\nING uses a step-by-step risk management approach to identify, manage and mitigate financial and nonfinancial risks. The approach consists of a cycle of five recurrent activities: risk identification, risk assessment, risk control, risk monitoring, and risk reporting. The cycle is designed to determine what the risks are, assess which of these can really do harm, take mitigating measures to control these risks, monitor the development of the risk to see if the measures taken are effective, and report the findings to management at all relevant levels to enable them to take action when needed.\n\nThe cycle recurs in two ways. First, the identification, assessment, review, and update of mitigating measures are repeated periodically. Second, this periodic monitoring exercise may indicate emerging risks, known risks that are changing, risk levels that are changing, or current control measures that are not effective enough. Further analyses of these findings may then result in renewed and more frequent risk identification, and/or assessment, and/or change of mitigating measures.\n\n## Risk identification\n\nRisk identification is a joint effort of the business and the risk management functions. Its goal is to detect potential new risks and determine changes in known risks. Regular risk identification is essential for effective risk management. Potential risks that are not identified, will not be controlled and monitored and may lead to surprises later. Known risks may have changed over time and as a consequence the existing mitigating measures and monitoring may be inadequate or obsolete.\n\nRisk identification is performed periodically. In case of material internal or external change, additional ad hoc risk identification can be performed.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nEach identified risk is assessed qualitatively or quantitatively to determine its importance. This enables ING to decide which of the identified risks need control measures and how strict or tolerant these measures should be. Known risks are reassessed to detect any change in the risk level.\n\nThe importance of a risk is based on both the likelihood that the risk materialises and the subsequent financial or reputational impact that may occur should the risk arise. Unlikely risks with a potentially high impact need to be controlled. A risk that is likely to happen regularly but expected to have a modest financial impact may not need to be mitigated if the consequences are accepted by management.\n\n## Risk control\n\nRisks can be controlled by mitigating measures that lower the likelihood the risk occurs, lower the impact when it occurs or both. The ultimate measure to lower a risk is to stop the activity or service that causes the risk (risk avoidance). Risk control and mitigation measures are defined and maintained both bank-wide and at the local level.\n\n## Monitoring and reporting\n\nING monitors risk-control measures by checking if they are executed, complied with and have the expected mitigating effects and by following the development of the risks and their risk levels. Risk reporting provides senior and local management with the information they need to manage risks.\n\n## Risk Appetite Framework\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) is one of the key elements of the ERM Framework. Its objective is to set an appropriate risk appetite at a consolidated level across different risk categories and to allocate the risk appetite throughout the organisation.\n\n## Policy\n\nThe RAF policy explains the setup of the overarching global risk appetite. Within the RAF, ING monitors a range of financial and non-financial risk metrics with an aim to keep our risk profile in line with our risk appetite while executing our strategy. ING's RAF, which is approved by the SB, defines the desired risk profile that is to be integrated in the strategic decision-making and financial planning process. It is designed to be able to withstand market volatility and stress, while meeting regulatory requirements. The framework, including underlying assumptions and metrics, is regularly reviewed so that it remains relevant. The RAF combines various financial and non-financial risk appetite statements (RAS) into a single, coordinated approach to provide the business with a clear overview of the relevant risks and the tools to manage them.",

        "page_content": "- > Risk Management\n\nThis view allows the EB, the MBB and senior management to form an opinion on the adequacy of internal risk management and control systems for the risks ING faces while pursuing its strategy.\n\n## Process\n\nThe RAF is focused on setting the risk appetite at the consolidated level and across the different risk categories, and provides the principles for cascading this risk appetite down into the organisation. The RAF and underlying limit allocation are reviewed on an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, based on their quarterly review in the MBB, the EB and the SB. It is therefore a top-down process, which bases itself on the ambition of the bank in terms of its risk profile, the regulatory environment and the economic context. Limits that need SB approval are called boundaries and the underlying metrics supporting the boundaries which need EB and MBB approval are called instruments.\n\n## Step 1. Identify and assess ING's key risks\n\nThe outcome of the risk identification and risk assessment process is used as the starting point for the review of the RAF. Within this step, the risks ING faces when executing its strategy are identified in the context of the current economic, political, social, regulatory and technological environment. The assessment identifies whether the potential impact is material and if it is sufficiently controlled within ING's risk management function. It benchmarks the current risk framework against regulatory developments. Known risks are re-assessed either to confirm risk levels or to take account of potential changes. The assessment is executed following the current set of risk appetite statements.\n\n## Step 2. Set Risk Appetite Framework\n\nBased on ING's risk assessment and risk purpose, boundaries for the overarching risk frameworks are set. Once the overarching risk appetite thresholds have been set and approved by EB/MBB and subsequently by SB, the statements are translated into risk-type-specific statements and lower-level thresholds which are set and approved by senior risk committees, like ALCO Bank, GCTP and Bank NFRC. Cascading is done via several detailed risk appetite statements which have been defined per risk type, the combination of which is aimed to ensure compliance with the overarching solvency, concentration and funding and liquidity RASs.\n\n## Examples of underlying risk metrics include:\n\n- \u00b7 Solvency and profitability (e.g. CET1 ratio, MREL ratio and earnings at risk).\n- \u00b7 Credit risk (e.g. exposure at default (EAD) and risk weighted assets (RWA)).\n- \u00b7 Funding and liquidity (e.g. liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR)).\n- \u00b7 Market risk trading book (e.g. event risk, historical value at risk (HVaR)).\n- \u00b7 Non-financial risk (e.g. capital-at-risk and management of audit issues).\n- \u00b7 Market risk banking book (e.g. net interest income (NII) at risk and revaluation reserve at risk).\n- \u00b7 Compliance risk (e.g. key risk indicators on fraud management and sourcing).\n\n- \u00b7 Business risk (e.g. economic capital).\n- \u00b7 Model risk (e.g. number of inadequate pillar 1 models).\n\nING has started including climate risk in its RAF by, among other things, introducing climate risk as one of the dimensions to determine sector concentration as part of the credit risk appetite statements. In the coming years, ING will extend the inclusion of climate risk impact on other risk types with the aim of ensuring that the potential risks stemming from e.g. transition risk and physical risk are properly captured in the RAF.\n\n## Step 3. Cascade into statements per risk type and business unit\n\nThe bank-wide risk appetite is translated per risk type, which is further cascaded into the organisation. Risk appetite statements are then translated into dedicated underlying risk limits that are used for the day-today monitoring and management of ING's risks. The risk appetite statements serve as input for the quarterly planning process as well as for the establishment of key performance indicators and targets for senior management.",

Monitor and manage underlying risk limits\n\nTo verify that it remains within the RAF, ING reports its risk positions vis-\u00e0-vis its limits on a regular basis to senior management committees. The quarterly risk update reflecting the exposure of ING against the risk appetite is submitted quarterly to the MBB, the EB and the SB and its Risk Committee. Moreover, every quarter the financial plan is checked for potential limit excess within a one-year horizon, where in the strategic dialogue the MBB can take mitigating measures or make adjustments to the dynamic plan.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an important risk management tool that provides input for strategic decisions and capital planning. The purpose of stress testing is to assess the impact of plausible but severe stress scenarios on ING's capital and liquidity position. Stress tests provide complementary and forward-looking insights into the vulnerabilities of certain portfolios, with regards to adverse macroeconomic circumstances, stressed financial markets, and changes in the (geo)political climate. Since the outbreak of the Russia/Ukraine war, ING assessed the potential impact on its financial position via different types of stress tests. In addition to assessing P&L, capital and liquidity positions of ING for a range of different scenarios, idiosyncratic risks were also included. The outcome of these stress tests helped management get insight into the potential impact and define actions to mitigate this potential impact.\n\nIn the first half of 2022, ING executed the regulatory climate risks stress-test scenario, which is a part of the biannual ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) stress test. This regulatory stress test, combined with internal analyses done on climate risk, is used for enhancing ING's internal climate risk stress testing. In the last quarter of 2022, ING has introduced a 'Climate Risk with Geopolitical Angle scenario', which will be reported quarterly together with the other standard scenarios.\n\n## Types of stress tests\n\nWithin ING, different types of stress tests are performed. The most comprehensive type of stress tests are the firm-wide scenario analyses, which involve setting scenario assumptions for all the relevant macroeconomic and financial market variables in all countries relevant to ING. These assumptions usually follow a qualitative narrative that provides a background to the scenario. In addition to firm-wide scenario analyses, ING executes scenario analyses for specific countries or portfolios. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are performed, which focus on stressing one or more risk drivers; usually without an underlying scenario narrative. Finally, ING performs reverse stress tests, which aim to determine scenarios that could lead to a pre-defined severe adverse outcome.",

It provides a description of the main risks and risk drivers related to the nature of ING's business, activities and vulnerabilities.\n- \u00b7 Scenario definition and parameterisation: Based on the outcome of the previous step, a set of scenarios is determined with the relevant scope and set of risk drivers for each scenario, as well as its severity, the key assumptions and input parameters. The output of this phase includes a quantitative description of the stress scenarios to be analysed, the relevant output metrics and, when applicable, a narrative description.\n- \u00b7 Impact calculation and aggregation: Based on the quantitative description of the stress scenarios determined in the previous step, the impact is determined for the relevant scenario, scope and horizon. The impact calculation and aggregation can be part of a recurring process or part of a specific process set-up for one-off stress tests.\n- \u00b7 Scenario reporting: For each stress test, a report is prepared after each calculation which describes the results of the scenario and gives a recap of the scenario with its main assumptions and parameters. The stress-test. report is sent to the relevant risk committees and/or senior management. It is complemented, if needed, with advice for management action based on the stress-testing results.\n- \u00b7 Scenario control and management assessment: Depending on the outcomes of the stress test and the likelihood of the scenario, mitigating actions may be proposed. Mitigating actions may include, but are not limited to, sales or transfers of assets and reductions of risk limits.\n\n## Methodology\n\nDetailed and comprehensive models are used to calculate the impact of the scenarios. In these models, statistical analysis is combined with expert opinion to make sure that the results adequately reflect the scenario assumptions. The methodologies are granular and portfolio-specific and use different macroeconomic and market variables as input variables. The calculations are in line with our financial and regulatory reporting frameworks. The stress-testing models are subject to review by Model Risk Management.",

        "page_content": "- > Solvency risk\n\n## Solvency risk\n\n## Introduction\n\nSolvency risk is the risk of lacking sufficient capital to fulfil the business objectives, regulatory requirements or market expectations. A bank that is insolvent is unable to pay its debts and will be forced into bankruptcy.\n\nThe level and quality of capital is crucial for the resilience of individual banks. Banks are expected to assess the risks they face, and in a forward-looking manner ensure that all material risks are identified, managed and covered sufficiently by loss-absorbing capital to ensure continuity in case of materialisation of unexpected risks in times of stress. Given the interdependencies to other financial and non-financial risks, this balancing act of capital adequacy needs to be done within a sound and integrated management approach coherently linking all moving parts of the bank in line with the long-term business strategy.\n\n## Governance\n\nGroup Treasury ('GT') Balance Sheet & Capital Management, is responsible for maintaining the adequate capitalisation of ING Group and ING Bank entities, to manage the risk associated with ING's business activities. This involves not only managing, planning and allocating capital within ING Group, ING Bank and its various entities, but also helping to execute necessary capital market transactions, term (capital) funding and risk management transactions. ING takes an integrated approach to assess the adequacy of its capital position in relation to its risk profile and operating environment. This means GT Balance Sheet & Capital Management takes into account both regulatory and internal, economic based metrics and requirements as well as the interests of key stakeholders such as shareholders and rating agencies.\n\n## ICAAP framework\n\nING's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Processes (ICAAP) aims to ensure that capital levels remain adequate both looking-forward and under adverse conditions in terms of covering material risks-to-capital from both a normative and economic (internal) perspective. The assessment of ING's capital adequacy takes into account its business strategy and risk profile, market environment, and operating macro environment. This implies that views of various stakeholders such as regulators, shareholders, investors, rating agencies, clients and customers do play an important role.\n\nThe continued strength of ING's capital position, the adequacy of the financial position and risk management effectiveness are essential for achieving the strategy. ING's capital and funding strategy determines the underlying ICAAP elements and thereby contributes to the business continuity of ING from different perspectives.\n\nManaging ING's capital entails finding the right balance between supply and demand while taking into account market and macro circumstances. The process of balancing these strategic goals is captured in the ICAAP framework and enabled by six building blocks and underlying elements facilitating the ICAAP. The following building blocks have been defined in the ICAAP Framework, which are applied for both the 'normative' and 'economic' perspective as defined in the ECB Guide to ICAAP, published in November 2018:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk identification and assessment.\n- \u00b7 Solvency stress testing.\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 Planning and forecasting.\n- \u00b7 Continuity.\n- \u00b7 Capital management\n\n## Risk identification and assessment\n\nING's capital management and solvency risk management starts with the risk identification and risk assessment process. Its main purpose is to detect potential new risks and to identify changes in the potential impact of known risks. On an annual basis, ING performs a thorough review of its solvency risks or risks to capital. Within this assessment, bottom-up assessments are combined with top-down assessments, including a questionnaire and interviews with senior management. The results of the risk assessment are discussed in ALCO Bank, which comprises almost the full MBB. Once approved, the conclusions of the risk assessment feed into the annual review of the Risk Appetite Framework, the Stress Testing Framework and the Economic Capital Framework. In addition to this annual process, ING also reassesses its risks as part of its Capital Adequacy Statement, a quarterly process to assess ING's capital adequacy.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nAs explained in the RAF section in the previous chapter, ING has established overarching solvency risk boundaries. Boundaries are risk appetite statements that are essential for risk management activity, making it of paramount importance to keep these boundaries within the defined level. The SB is responsible for approving and monitoring the boundaries. These boundaries are complemented by a sequence of risk-typespecific instruments (risk appetite statements). These underlying risk appetite statements are cascaded down into the organisation and dedicated risk thresholds are set that are used for day-to-day monitoring and management of ING's risks. ING has solvency risk appetite statements in place for the following metrics: CET1 ratio, total capital ratio, leverage ratio, total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) based on RWA/leverage ratio and economic capital adequacy.\n\n## Solvency stress testing\n\nSolvency stress testing allows ING to examine the effect of plausible but severe stress scenarios on the solvency position and provides insight into which entities or portfolios are vulnerable to which type of risks",

Solvency stress testing is an important tool in identifying, assessing, measuring and controlling risks to capital, providing a complementary and forward-looking perspective to other solvency risk management tools. For solvency stress testing, ING follows the same steps that are described in the overall section on stress testing.\n\nING distinguishes the following three types of stress test analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 Sensitivity analysis: Assess the impact of a pre-defined shock in one or more risk drivers. The main purpose of sensitivity analyses is to monitor the impact of this pre-defined (or standardised) shock over time to get an understanding of how the risk profile of the bank has developed. In contrast with scenario analyses, sensitivity analyses are built on a predefined set of shocks that don't necessarily relate to a qualitative story line.\n- \u00b7 Scenario analysis: Used to assess the impact of historical, statistical and/or hypothetical circumstances on the financial position of ING. These stress tests often build on a qualitative scenario narrative and reflect risk topics that are deemed relevant for ING given, for example, its business model or geographical presence. To execute such a stress test, scenarios need to be determined that are dynamic and forward looking and incorporate the occurrence of a string of events through time.\n- \u00b7 Reverse stress testing: The purpose is to identify scenarios that could lead to a pre-defined outcome. This could, for example, be a CET1 ratio or LCR to define the point at which the bank is considered not viable anymore. The added value of reverse stress testing is to explore risk drivers and stress scenarios outside the existing range.\n\nThe outcomes of solvency stress test analyses are taken into account in capital planning, but also for setting risk appetite statements and the capital management buffer.\n\n## Planning and forecasting\n\nThe capital and funding plan is an integral part of the Dynamic Plan, ING's financial and business planning process. Its objective is to inform and advise the management on the capital development and need of ING Group and ING Bank, under base case and adverse scenarios. It describes how ING shall finance the expected capital constraints taking into consideration growth projections, capital and risk evolution, macro and market conditions, both under the normative and economic perspective. The capital and funding plan is discussed and approved by ALCO Bank and updated at least twice a year. Within these updates, ING takes account of recent market and risk developments and aims to ensure that capital planning adheres to the solvency risk appetite set by the SB.\n\n## Capital management\n\nFormulation of the CET1 target is a key element in solvency risk management. The target ratio, based on the management buffer concept, enables ING's senior management to steer, benchmark and assess the\n\nbank's current and future capital levels much more efficiently while the target level clearly supports trust building among ING's key stakeholders (e.g. regulators, investors and customers).\n\nThe capital management buffer aims to protect the interests of key stakeholders and plays an important role in the overall capital adequacy governance. The rationale behind the buffer is that it provides an additional cushion on top of the (local) regulatory minimum requirements (e.g. Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) requirements) to withstand a certain level of stress and to facilitate awareness and preparedness to take management actions. ING reviews its capital management buffer on a regular basis to determine its effectiveness and robustness, updating it as appropriate. See also Note 50 'Capital management'.\n\n## Continuity\n\nRisk events with high severity or significant deteriorations of economic and market conditions beyond ING's control could cause deviations from the business and capital plans, which may result in a potential capital shortfall.\n\nING has therefore set up a continuity (safety) net of contingency and recovery planning. As part of this, ING set up ongoing monitoring of relevant indicators with the aim of awareness and preparedness to act proactively to ensure continuity. The intervention measures which can be activated when deemed necessary, consist of predefined RWA reduction measures, as well as direct capital increasing measures. The escalation mechanisms are defined, governed and detailed in the contingency and recovery plans.\n\nBoth plans aim to restore ING's capital adequacy. Depending on the severity of the situation, the contingency plan can be activated at this warning phase as well as triggering further management action and formation of the contingency crisis teams. Further drops in capital levels trigger the alert phase for recovery monitoring and/or the activation of the recovery plan and corresponding crisis teams.\n\n## Assessing capital adequacy: Capital Adequacy Statement (CAS)\n\nThe CAS is ING Group's quarterly assessment of its capital adequacy and takes into account different elements with respect to its capital position. The degree to which ING's capital position is considered adequate depends on a variety of internal and external drivers:\n\n- \u00b7 Current supervisory requirements and (expected) requirements going forward.\n- \u00b7 Coherence of the available capital with the (realisation of) strategic plans.\n- \u00b7 Current internal requirements and (expected) requirements going forward (economic capital/view).\n- \u00b7 The ability to meet internal and external requirements in the case of stressed events or should a risk materialise.",

On a quarterly basis the CAS document is prepared. Additionally each year, the EB/MBB signs and provides a comprehensive assessment of ING's capital adequacy, supported by the ICAAP outcomes, in the form of a Capital Adequacy Statement.\n\n## Capital developments\n\nING's profit generating capacity was strong in 2022 despite a challenging economic and geopolitical environment. After dividend reserving in line with the distribution policy, we included \u20ac1.7 billion of profit to our capital base.\n\nING's capital ratios decreased compared to 2021, primarily due to additional distributions and higher riskweighted assets. ING distributed an additional \u20ac1.25 billion and \u20ac1.5 billion as next steps to converge the CET1 ratio towards ING's target of around 12.5% by 2025. In line with regulations these additional distributions were fully reflected in ING's capital ratios at year-end although part of the second additional distribution (\u20ac297 million) was paid on 16 January 2023. Risk-weighted assets were mainly impacted by rating downgrades on Russia-related exposure, currency movements, the implementation of EBA guidelines on the treatment of structural FX positions and model impacts. Model impacts reflect the introduction of a risk-weight floor on Dutch residential mortgages by the Dutch central bank as well as ongoing redevelopment of internal models and EBA guidelines. ING continues to maintain a strong and high-quality capital level.\n\nAt the end of 2022, ING Group had a CET1 ratio of 14.5%. The Group's Tier 1 ratio decreased to 16.4%. The total capital ratio decreased from 21.0% to 19.4% compared to last year.\n\nThe leverage ratio was at 5.1%, down from 5.9% at the end of 2021, primarily because the ECB's Covid-19 relief measure to exclude certain central bank exposure expired on 1 April 2022.\n\n## MREL and TLAC requirements\n\nMinimum Requirement for own fund and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) apply to ING Group at the consolidate level of the resolution group. TLAC and MREL provide additional capacity to absorb losses and facilitate recapitalisation in the case of resolution. ING Group has a single point of entry resolution strategy.\n\nAs per year-end 2022, TLAC requirements are 23.10% of RWA and 6.75% of leverage exposure. The available TLAC capacity consists of own funds and senior debt instruments issued by ING Group. With a TLAC ratio of 30.4% on RWA and 9.5% on leverage exposure, ING comfortably meets the TLAC requirements.\n\nIntermediary MREL requirements were 27.39% on RWA and 5.97% on leverage exposure as per year-end 2022. ING meets these MREL requirements with an MREL ratio of 30.4% on RWA and 9.5% on leverage exposure at the end of 2022.\n\n## Issuance\n\nIn 2022, ING issued and redeemed various capital instruments, including grandfathered instruments that lost eligibility as of 1 January 2022. As such, ING has a more efficient capital stack which is in line with capital requirements and a single point of entry resolution strategy. ING redeemed $1 billion AT1 instrument in April 2022 and issued a Green Tier 2 instrument (\u20ac1.0 billion) in August 2022. To further build our MREL capacity, ING Group issued multiple senior debt (HoldCo) instruments in 2022 in various currencies for a total amount of \u20ac10.9 billion.",

Credit risks arise in ING's lending, financial markets and investment activities. The credit risk section provides information on how ING measures, monitors and manages credit risk and gives an insight into the portfolio from a credit risk perspective.\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nING's credit risk strategy is to maintain an internationally diversified loan and bond portfolio, while avoiding large risk concentrations. The emphasis is on managing business developments within the business lines by means of a top-down risk appetite framework (RAF), which sets concentration limits for countries, individual clients, sectors, products, secondary risk (collateral/guarantees) and investment activities. The aim is to support relationship banking activities, while maintaining internal risk/reward guidelines and controls.\n\nA new Credit Risk department was established in 2022. This department is responsible for setting the credit risk strategy for ING and aims to ensure credit risk and credit restructuring are managed from an overarching point of view rather than per business line. The head of Credit Risk is supported by the following teams within this new department:\n\n- \u00b7 Portfolio, Strategy & Governance team: responsible for setting up credit risk strategies and risk appetite statements, performing analysis and monitoring of the credit risk position of ING, as well as setting and maintaining the credit risk framework and policies.\n- \u00b7 Credit Risk Control Unit: responsible for the design or selection, implementation, oversight and performance of the rating systems.\n- \u00b7 Global Credit Risk Restructuring: responsible for a safe, compliant and data driven credit loss process by managing loan loss provisioning and finding solutions for business customers in financial difficulty. The team focuses on management of the global loan loss provisioning, not only of individual WB provisions, but also collective WB and Retail Banking provisions.\n\nWhile the Credit Risk department has oversight of the Group credit risk strategy and risk appetite across Retail Banking risk and Wholesale Banking risk, the head of Retail/Rest of World (RoW) Risk and head of Wholesale Banking Risk aim to ensure the management of the risk within these business lines. Also refer to the Risk governance and organisational structure in the introductory section of the Risk management chapter.\n\nThe credit risk function encompasses the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Measuring, monitoring and managing credit risks in the bank's portfolio, including the measures taken in response to the war in Ukraine.\n- \u00b7 Challenging and approving new and modified transactions and borrower reviews.\n- \u00b7 Providing consistent credit risk policies, systems and tools to manage the credit lifecycle of all activities.\n- \u00b7 Managing the levels of provisioning and risk costs, and advising on impairments.\n\n## Credit risk categories (*)\n\nIn the following table the different types of credit risk categories are described and a reconciliation with the notes in the financial statements is also included:",

It is derived from the concepts of boundaries and instruments as described in the ING Risk Appetite Framework (RAF).\n\nCredit risk appetite is the maximum level of credit risk ING is willing to accept for growth and value creation. The credit risk appetite is linked to the overall bank-wide RAF. The credit risk appetite is expressed in quantitative and qualitative measures. Having a credit risk appetite provides:\n\n- \u00b7 Clarity about the credit risks that ING is prepared to assume, target setting and prudent risk management.\n- \u00b7 Consistent communication to different stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Alignment of business strategies and key performance indicators of business units with ING's credit risk appetite through dynamic planning.\n- \u00b7 Guidelines on how to align reporting and monitoring tools with the organisational structure and strategy.\n\nThe credit risk appetite is set at different levels and dimensions within ING. The credit risk appetite framework specifies the scope and focus of the credit risk which ING takes, and the composition of the credit portfolio, including its concentration and diversification objectives in relation to business lines, sectors and products. The credit risk appetite framework has also been extended to embed climate risk elements. The first steps towards introducing climate risk elements in the credit risk appetite framework were taken in 2022 and these are expected to further evolve and mature. The climate risk elements within the credit risk appetite framework allow for more efficient steering of sector concentrations from a climate risk perspective.\n\nThe credit risk appetite and concentration risk framework is composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 Country risk concentration: Country risk is the risk that arises due to events in a specific country (or group of countries). To manage the maximum country event loss ING is willing to accept, boundaries are approved by the SB. The estimated level is correlated to the risk rating assigned to a given country. Actual country limits are set by means of country instruments, which are reviewed monthly and updated, when needed. For countries with elevated levels of geopolitical or severe economic cycle risk, monitoring is performed on a more frequent basis with strict pipeline and exposure management.\n- \u00b7 Single name and industry sector concentration: ING has an established credit concentration risk framework to identify, measure and monitor single name concentration and industry sector concentration (systemic risk). The same concept of boundaries and instruments is applicable.\n- \u00b7 Product and secondary risk concentration: ING has established a concentration framework to identify, measure and monitor product concentration and secondary risk.\n- \u00b7 Scenarios and stress tests: Stress testing evaluates ING's financial stability under severe, but plausible stress scenarios, and supports decision-making that assures ING remains a going concern even after a",

In addition to the bank-wide stress testing framework described above, ING performs sensitivity analyses regularly to assess portfolio risks and concentrations.\n- \u00b7 Product approvals: The product approval and review process (PARP) assesses and manages risks associated with the introduction of new or modified products. Its goal is that sound due diligence is performed by relevant stakeholders and the relevant risks (credit, operational, compliance, etc.) are addressed appropriately.\n- \u00b7 Strategy and risk appetite papers: These are detailed analyses of defined products and/or industries. The papers include the identification of the major risk drivers and mitigants, the internal business mandate, and propose the risk (including business) parameters - and potentially the maximum product and/or portfolio limit - to support that business. A strategy and risk appetite paper is always prepared by the front office responsible for the internal business mandate and requires an approval from the designated approval authority. Strategy and risk appetite papers may also have geographical and/or business limitations (e.g. local vs. global).\n- \u00b7 Credit approval process: The purpose of the credit approval process is that individual transactions and the risk associated with these transactions are assessed on a name-by-name basis. For each type of client there is a dedicated process with credit risk managers specialised along the business lines of ING, including the use of automated decision-making in certain cases. The credit approval process is supported by a risk rating system and exposure monitoring system. Risk ratings are used to indicate a client's creditworthiness which translates into a probability of default. This is used as input to determine the maximum risk appetite that ING has for a given type of client (reference benchmark). The determination of the delegated authority (the amount that can be approved at various levels of the organisation) is a function of the risk rating of the client and ING's credit risk exposure on the client. Where necessary, underwriting standards are reviewed and refined to limit the credit risk to portfolios particularly sensitive to certain market circumstances, such as Covid-19 at the time, or currently in the context of the deteriorating economic outlook.\n\n## Credit risk models (*)\n\nWithin ING, internal CRR-compliant models are used to determine probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD) for regulatory and economic capital purposes. These models also form the basis of ING's IFRS 9 loan loss provisioning (see 'IFRS 9 models' below). Bank-wide, ING has implemented approximately 100 credit risk models, for regulatory capital, economic capital and loan loss provisioning purposes.\n\nThere are two main types of PD, EAD and LGD models used throughout the bank:\n\n- \u00b7 Statistical models are created where a large set of default or detailed loss data is available. They are characterised by sufficient data points to facilitate meaningful statistical estimation of the model\n\n- parameters. The model parameters are estimated with statistical techniques based on the data set available.\n- \u00b7 Hybrid models contain characteristics of statistical models combined with knowledge and experience of experts from risk management and front-office staff, literature from rating agencies, supervisors and academics. These models are only used for 'low default portfolios', where limited historical defaults exist.\n\n## Credit risk rating process (*)\n\nThe majority of risk ratings are based on a risk rating (PD) Model that complies with the minimum requirements detailed in CRR/CRDIV, ECB Supervisory Rules and European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines. This concerns all borrower types and segments.\n\nING's PD rating models are based on a 1-22 scale (1 = highest rating; 22 = lowest rating) referred to as the 'Master scale', which roughly corresponds to the rating grades that are assigned by external rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. For example, an ING rating of 1 corresponds to an S&P/Fitch rating of AAA and a Moody's rating of Aaa; an ING rating of 2 corresponds to an S&P/Fitch rating of AA+ and a Moody's rating of Aa1, and so on.\n\nThe 22 grades are composed of the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Investment grade (risk rating 1-10).\n- \u00b7 Sub-standard (risk rating 18-19).\n- \u00b7 Non-investment grade (risk rating 11-17).\n- \u00b7 Non-performing (risk rating 20-22).\n\nThe first three categories (1-19) are risk ratings for performing loans. Ratings are calculated in IT systems with internally developed models, based on manually or automatically fed data, or for part of the nonperforming loans set by the global or regional credit restructuring department. Under certain conditions, the outcome of a manually fed model can be challenged through a rating appeal process. For securitisation portfolios, the external ratings of the tranche in which ING has invested are leading indicators.\n\nRisk ratings assigned to clients are reviewed at least annually, with the performance of the underlying models monitored regularly. Some of these models are global in nature, such as those for large corporates, commercial banks, insurance companies, central governments, local governments, funds, fund managers, project finance and leveraged companies. Other models are more regional- or country-specific: there are PD models for small and medium enterprise (SME) in the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland as well as residential mortgage and consumer loan models in the various retail markets.\n\nRating models for retail clients are predominantly statistically driven and automated, such that ratings can be updated on a monthly basis. Rating models for large corporates, institutions and banks include both statistical characteristics and manual input, with the ratings being manually updated at least annually.",

ING has chosen to develop credit risk tools centrally with the philosophy of using a single source of data in an integrated way. This includes applying a combination of the ING policy, the regulatory environment in which we operate and the daily processes that are active throughout the Group. Disciplined application in these three areas is essential for achieving high data quality standards.\n\nThe Credit Risk Control Unit (CRCU), which is part of the Credit Risk department, manages the CRCU control framework offering quality assurance on the regulatory areas of responsibility: the design or selection, implementation, oversight, and performance of the rating systems. This framework leans on control execution in other teams such as Model Development in Integrated Risk where the combination of these different teams is considered for the CRCU self-assessment.\n\n## Credit risk portfolio (*)\n\nING's credit exposure is mainly related to lending to individuals and businesses followed by investments in bonds and securitised assets, and money market. Loans to individuals are mainly mortgage loans secured by residential property. Loans (including guarantees issued) to businesses are often collateralised, but may be unsecured based on the internal analysis of the borrower's creditworthiness. Bonds in the investment portfolio are generally unsecured, but predominantly consist of bonds issued by central governments and EU and/or OECD based financial institutions. Secured bonds, such as mortgage-backed securities and assetbacked securities are secured by the underlying diversified pool of assets (commercial or residential mortgages, car loans and/or other assets) held by the securities issuer. For money market, exposure is mainly deposits to central banks. The last major credit risk source involves pre-settlement exposures which arise from trading activities, including derivatives, repurchase transactions and securities lending/borrowing transactions. This is also commonly referred to as counterparty credit risk.",

lending, pre-settlement, money market and investment activities.\n- 2 Based on the total amount of credit risk in the respective column using ING's internal credit risk measurement methodologies. Economic sectors (industry) below 2% are not shown separately but grouped in Other.\n- 3 Geographical areas are based on country of residence, except for private individuals for which the geographical areas are based on the primary country of risk.\n\n## Overall portfolio (*)\n\nDuring 2022, ING's portfolio size increased by \u20ac24.1 billion (+2.64%) to \u20ac938.1 billion outstandings. The net volume growth was spread across all the business lines. Foreign exchange rate changes had a positive impact on portfolio growth, mainly in WB, and increased total outstanding by \u20ac6.3 billion, driven by the appreciation of the US dollar (+6.2%) against the euro, partially compensated by the British pound sterling (-5.3%), the Polish new zloty (-1.8%) and new Turkish lira (-23.7%) .\n\n## Rating distribution (*)\n\nOverall, the rating class distribution remained stable in 2022. The share of investment grade rating classes increased from 75.0% to 76.2%, while the share of non-investment grade decreased, from 23.2% to 21.7%. Sub-standard grade outstandings increased from 0.4% to 0.8% of the total portfolio, whereas nonperforming loans decreased from 1.3% to 1.2%.\n\nWith respect to the rating distribution within the business lines, in WB, investment grade increased to 81.2% (from 79.7%), where non-investment grade exposures decreased to 16.8% (from 19.1%)  compared to 2021.\n\nSubstandard grade assets increased from 0.2% to 1.0% of total Wholesale Banking assets, primarily as a result of increases in Russia, in the natural resources industry. The share of non-performing loans for WB remained stable at 1.0% (from 0.9%).\n\nThe rating distribution for Retail Benelux improved mostly because of Dutch residential mortgages, shifting from rating class BB/BBB to A. The share of A-rated mortgages increased from 9.3% to 24.0% of the portfolio. In Belgium, residential mortgages showed a modest increase of BBB assets, from single A. Substandard grade Belgium mortgage outstandings increased to 1.0% (from 0.8%).\n\nIn Retail Challengers & Growth Markets, the distribution across rating classes remained rather stable in 2022. Overall share of investment grade decreased from 76.1% to 75.2%. NPL decreased to 1.0% (from 1.3%).\n\n## Industry (*)\n\nIn line with our objective to give stakeholders insight into the portfolio, we present the business lending portfolio per industry breakdown in accordance with the NAICS definition.

The share of the Netherlands in the overall portfolio reduced to 23.3% (2021: 25.1%).\n\nThe most noticeable trend in the Netherlands was the decrease in exposure with central banks (-\u20ac11.7 billion). Outstandings to private individuals were stable at 62.5% (2021: 62.3%) of total outstandings (excl. Central Banks). In Belgium, no substantial moves were observed in the portfolio, apart from a decrease in central banks (\u20ac3.9 billion).\n\nIn terms of rating distribution in individual countries, the total share of investment grade/non-investment grade remains substantial for the Netherlands at 98.5% (2021: 98.5%) and in Belgium 96.3% (2021: 96.5%). Substandard grade assets increased slightly, in the Netherlands from 0.5% to 0.7% and in Belgium from 0.7% to 0.8%. In the Netherlands, the NPL share decreased in 2022, from 1.0% to 0.8%, whereas Belgium remained flat at 2.8%.",

Mortgage portfolios increased in Germany, Australia and Spain in 2022.\n\nThe top-five countries within Rest of Europe based on outstandings were: Switzerland (\u20ac25.0 billion), Italy (\u20ac17.7 billion), Romania (\u20ac10.3 billion), Turkey (\u20ac7.8 billion) and Ireland (\u20ac5.6 billion). Outstandings in Rest of Europe were primarily impacted by Switzerland (central bank outstandings +\u20ac15.3 billion).\n\nIn Europe, outside the Benelux, rating distribution in most countries remained stable. The most noticeable moves in rating distribution were observed in Rest of Europe, where the development of the Russian portfolio caused an increase in substandard from 0.4% to 3.0% and NPL from 1.3% to 1.6%. Note the paragraph on Russian exposures in section 'Risk management at ING Group'. Apart from Russia, noticeable moves occurred in France, where NPL increased from 0.4% to 0.9% impacted by the decommissioning of the Retail business in France. And in the UK, where NPL decreased from 1.6% to 1.2%.\n\nThe increase in exposure in the Americas region was mainly driven by FX impact. In terms of rating distribution for America region, an increase in investment grade is observed to 77.6% (from 73.0%), noninvestment grade decreased to 21.3% from 25.1%. Sub-standard grade increased to 0.4%, while NPL improved to 0.8% (from 1.5%). Australia's rating distribution improved with a decrease of NPL's from 1.9% to 0.8% of the portfolio.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation (*)\n\nING uses various techniques and instruments to mitigate the credit risk associated with an exposure and to reduce the losses incurred subsequent to a default by a customer. The most common terminology used in ING for credit risk protection is 'cover'. While a cover may be an important mitigant of credit risk and an alternative source of repayment, generally it is ING's practice to lend on the basis of the customer's creditworthiness rather than exclusively relying on the value of the cover.\n\n## Cover forms (*)\n\nWithin ING, there are two distinct forms of covers. First, where the asset has been pledged to ING as collateral or security, ING has the right to liquidate it should the customer be unable to fulfil its financial obligation. As such, the proceeds can be applied towards full or partial compensation of the customer's outstanding exposure. This may be tangible (such as cash, securities, receivables, inventory, plant and machinery, and mortgages on real estate properties) or intangible (such as patents, trademarks, contract rights and licences). Second, where there is a third-party obligation, indemnification or undertaking (either by contract and/or by law), ING has the right to claim from that third party an amount if the customer fails on its obligations. The most common examples are guarantees, such as parent guarantees, export credit insurances or third-party pledged mortgages. Insurance or reinsurance covers, including comprehensive\n\nprivate risk insurance (CPRI) may be recognised as guarantees and effectively function in an equivalent manner. ING accepts credit risk insurance companies and export credit agencies (ECAs) as cover providers.\n\n## Cover valuation methodology (*)\n\nGeneral guidelines for cover valuation are established with the objective to ensure consistent application within ING. These also require that the value of the cover is monitored on a regular basis. Covers are revalued periodically and whenever there is reason to believe that the market is subject to significant changes in conditions. The frequency of monitoring and revaluation depends on the type of cover.\n\nThe valuation method also depends on the type of covers. For asset collateral, the valuation sources can be the customer's balance sheet (e.g. inventory, machinery and equipment), nominal value (e.g. cash and receivables), market value (e.g. securities and commodities), independent valuations (e.g. commercial real estate) and market indices (e.g. residential real estate). For third-party obligations, the valuation is based on the value that is attributed to the contract between ING and that third party.\n\nWhere collateral values are used in the calculation of stage 3 individual loan loss provisions, haircuts may be applied to the valuation in specific circumstances, to sufficiently include all relevant factors impacting future cash flows. ING increased the haircuts applied to collateral values used in stage 3 individual provisions as at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2022 to reflect the increased risk of inflated asset prices in certain sectors of the economy. The haircut is applied on real estate, shipping and aviation collateral values used in the calculation of the loss-given-default in recovery scenarios. The haircut reflects the risks of adverse price developments between the moment of valuation of an asset and the actual settlement/cash receipt.\n\n## Cover values (*)\n\nThis section provides insight into the types of cover and the extent to which exposures benefit from collateral or guarantees. The disclosure differentiates between risk categories (lending, investment, money market and pre-settlement). The most relevant types of cover include mortgages, financial collateral (cash and securities) and guarantees. ING obtains cover that is eligible for credit risk mitigation under CRR/CRDIV, as well as cover that is not eligible. Collateral covering financial market transactions is valued on a daily basis, and as such not included in the following tables. To mitigate the credit risk arising from Financial Markets transactions, the bank enters into legal agreements governing the exchange of financial collateral (high-quality government bonds and cash).\n\nThe cover values are presented for the total portfolio of ING, both the performing and non-performing portfolio. Our definition of non-performing is explained in detail in 'Credit restructuring' (below). For additional insight, a breakdown of ING's portfolio by industry and geography is provided.\n\nThe next table gives an overview of the collateralisation of the ING's total portfolio.",

Since investments traditionally do not require covers, the percentage for 'no covers' in this portfolio is above 95%. However, 99% of the investment outstanding is investment grade. Improved economic conditions in ING's main markets contributed to improved collateral valuations, observed in consumer lending. Relative to the overall developments in the housing markets and the impact on provisioning, note the paragraphs on 'management adjustments' in the Loan Loss provisioning section, that were made to reflect potential impact of higher inflation, higher rates and market uncertainty.\n\n## Consumer lending portfolio (*)\n\nThe consumer lending portfolio accounts for 37.7% (2021: 37.7%) of ING's total outstanding, primarily consisting of residential mortgage loans and other consumer lending loans. As a result, most collateral consists of mortgages. Mortgage values are collected in an internal central database and in most cases external data is used to index the market value. A significant part of ING's residential mortgage portfolio is in the Netherlands (34.4%), Germany (28.0%), Belgium and Luxembourg (13.2%) and Australia (10.7%).\n\nRelative to the overall developments in the housing markets and loan loss provisions for the mortgage portfolio's, note that management adjustments are recognised to maintain an appropriate level of provisions. See paragraph on 'management adjustments' in the loan loss provisioning section.\n\n## Business lending portfolio (*)\n\nBusiness lending accounts for 40.4% (2021: 45.3%) of ING's total outstanding. Business lending presented in this section does not include pre-settlement, investment and money market exposures.",

This methodology is applicable to private individuals, as well as business lending. An obligation is considered 'past due' if a payment of interest or principal is more than one day late. ING aims to help its customers as soon as they are past due by reminding them of their payment obligations. In its contact with the customers, ING aims to solve the (potential) financial difficulties by offering a range of measures (e.g. payment arrangements, restructuring). If the issues cannot be cured, for example because the customer is unable or unwilling to pay, the contract is sent to the recovery unit. The facility is downgraded to risk rating 20 (non-performing) when the facility or obligor - depending on the level at which the non-performing status is applied - is more than 90 days past due and to risk rating 21 or 22 in case of an exit scenario.\n\nING has aligned the regulatory concept of non-performing with that of the definition of default. Hence, in WB, obligors are classified as non-performing when a default trigger occurs:\n\n- \u00b7 ING believes the borrower is unlikely to pay. The borrower has evidenced significant financial difficulty, to the extent that it will have a negative impact on the future cash flows of the financial asset. The following events could be seen as indicators of financial difficulty:\n- \u00b7 The borrower (or third party) has started insolvency proceedings.\n- \u00b7 Indication of fraud (affecting the company's ability to service its debt).\n- \u00b7 A group company/co-borrower has NPL status.\n- \u00b7 There is doubt as to the borrower's ability to generate stable and sufficient cash flows to service its debt.\n- \u00b7 Restructuring of debt.\n- \u00b7 ING has granted concessions relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, the effect of which is a reduction in expected future cash flows of the financial asset below current carrying amount.\n- \u00b7 The obligor has failed in the payment of principal, interest or fees, the total past due amount is above the materiality threshold and this remains the case for more than 90 consecutive days.\n\nFurther, WB has an individual name approach, using early warnings indicators to signal possible future issues in debt service.",

Below these thresholds, arrears of more than 90 days are reported as past due.\n\nTotal past due but performing outstanding of business lending decreased by \u20ac462 million. These were mainly contributed by decreased outstanding in the 1-30 days (\u20ac879 million) past due bucket, partly offset by increased outstanding in 61-90 days past due bucket (\u20ac515 million). The top three areas of decrease in the 1-30 days bucket were Belgium (\u20ac1,097 million), Luxembourg (\u20ac284 million) and America (\u20ac175 million). The top three areas of increase in the 1-30 days bucket were Asia (\u20ac277 million), Poland (\u20ac185 million) and the Netherlands (\u20ac177 million).\n\n## Credit restructuring (*)\n\nGlobal Credit Restructuring (GCR) is the dedicated and independent department that deals with nonperforming loans and loans that hold a reasonable probability that ING will end up with a loss, if no specific action is taken. GCR handles accounts or portfolios requiring an active approach, which may include renegotiation of terms and conditions and business or financial restructuring. The loans are managed by GCR or by units in the various regions and business units. ING uses three distinct statuses to categorise the management of clients with (perceived) deteriorating credit risk profiles, i.e. there is increasing doubt as to the performance and the collectability of the client's contractual obligations:\n\n- \u00b7 Watch list: Usually, a client is first classified as watch list when there are concerns of any potential or material deterioration in credit risk profile that may affect the ability of the client to adhere to its debt service obligations or to refinance its existing loans. Watch List status requires more than usual attention, increased monitoring and quarterly reviews. Some clients with a Watch List status may develop into a Restructuring status or even a Recovery status.\n- \u00b7 Restructuring: A client is classified in restructuring when there are concerns about the client's financial stability, credit worthiness, and/or ability to repay, but where the situation does not require the termination or acceleration of facilities or the liquidation of collateral. ING's actions aim to maintain the going concern status of the client by:\n- \u00b7 restoring the client's financial stability;\n- \u00b7 restoring the balance between debt and equity; and\n- \u00b7 supporting the client's turnaround;\n- \u00b7 restructuring the debt to a sustainable situation.\n- \u00b7 Recovery: A client is classified as in recovery when ING and/or the client concludes that the client's financial situation cannot be restored and a decision is made to terminate the (credit) relationship or",

ING prefers an amicable exit, but will enforce and liquidate the collateral or claim under the guarantees if deemed necessary.\n\nWatch list, restructuring and recovery accounts are reviewed at least quarterly by the front office, GCR and the relevant credit risk management executives.\n\n## Forbearance (*)\n\nForbearance occurs when a client is unable to meet their financial commitments due to financial difficulties they face or are about to face and ING grants concessions towards them. Forborne assets are assets in respect of which forbearance measures have been granted.\n\nForbearance may enable clients experiencing financial difficulties to continue repaying their debt.\n\nFor business clients, ING mainly applies forbearance measures to support clients with fundamentally sound business models that are experiencing temporary difficulties with the aim of maximising the client's repayment ability and therewith avoiding a default situation or helping the client to return to a performing situation.\n\nFor ING retail units, clear criteria has been established to determine whether a client is eligible for the forbearance process. Specific approval mandates are in place to approve the measures, as well as procedures to manage, monitor and report the forbearance activities.\n\nING reviews the performance of forborne exposures at least quarterly, either on a case-by-case (business) or on a portfolio (retail) basis.\n\nAll exposures are eligible for forbearance measures, i.e. both performing (Risk ratings 1-19) and nonperforming (risk ratings 20-22) exposures. ING uses specific criteria to move forborne exposures from nonperforming to performing or to remove the forbearance statuses that are consistent with the corresponding European Banking Authority (EBA) standards. An exposure is reported as forborne for a minimum of two years. An additional one-year probation period is applied to forborne exposures that move from nonperforming back to performing.\n\n## Summary Forborne portfolio (*)\n\n| in \u20ac million       | 2022         | 2022                  | 2022                       | 2022                   |              |                       |                            |                       |\n|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Business line      | Outstandings | Of which:  performing | Of which:  non- performing | % of  total  portfolio | Outstandings | Of which:  performing | Of which:  non- performing | % of total  portfolio |\n| Wholesale  Banking | 8,359        | 5,880                 | 2,478                      | 2.7  %                 | 9,798        | 7,455                 | 2,343                      | 3.1  %                |\n| Retail Banking     | 8,080        | 4,973                 | 3,107                      | 1.6  %                 | 10,018       | 6,339                 | 3,679                      | 2.1  %                |\n| Total              | 16,438       | 10,853                | 5,585                      | 2.0 %                  | 19,816       | 13,793                | 6,022                      | 2.5 %                 |\n\n| in \u20ac million       | 2022         | 2022                  | 2022                       | 2022                   |              |                       |                            |                        |\n|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|\n| Forbearance  type  | Outstandings | Of which:  performing | Of which:  non- performing | % of  total  portfolio | Outstandings | Of which:  performing | Of which:  non- performing | % of  total  portfolio |\n| Loan  modification | 15,317       | 10,428                | 4,889                      | 1.9  %                 | 18,311       | 13,128                | 5,183                      | 2.3  %                 |\n| Refinancing        | 1,121        | 426                   | 695                        | 0.1  %                 | 1,505        | 666                   | 839                        | 0.2  %                 |\n| Total              | 16,438       | 10,853                | 5,585                      | 2.0 %                  | 19,816       | 13,793                | 6,022                      | 2.5 %                  |\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, ING's total forborne assets decreased by \u20ac3.4 billion compared to 31 December 2021.

These four economic sectors accounted for 65% of the total WB forborne outstandings. During 2022, an increase in forborne assets was visible in the real estate industry (+\u20ac 0.3 billion), offset by a decrease in natural resources (-\u20ac0.8 billion), automotive (-\u20ac 0.4 billion), food, beverages & personal care (-\u20ac0.1 billion) and transportation & logistics (-\u20ac0.2 billion).\n\n## Retail Banking (*)\n\nAs of the end of December 2022, Retail Banking forborne assets totalled \u20ac8.1 billion, which represented 1.6% of the total Retail Banking portfolio.\n\n## Retail Banking: Forborne portfolio by geographical area (*)\n\n| in \u20ac million   | 2022                       | 2022                   | 2022                      | 2021         | 2021                  | 2021                      |\n|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Region         | performing 2,832     2,043 | Outstandings Of which: | Of which: non- performing | Outstandings | Of which:  performing | Of which: non- performing |\n| Netherlands    |                            |                        | 789                       | 4,171        | 3,224                 | 947                       |\n| Belgium        | 2,644                      | 1,331                  | 1,314                     | 3,319        | 2,035                 | 1,284                     |\n| Germany        | 804                        | 610                    | 194                       | 497          | 306                   | 191                       |\n| Poland         | 588                        | 309                    | 279                       | 450          | 152                   | 298                       |\n| Europe Turkey  | 64                         | 31                     | 32                        | 146          | 97                    | 49                        |\n| Italy          | 131                        | 52                     | 79                        | 129          | 47                    | 82                        |\n| Romania        | 124                        | 53                     | 71                        | 115          | 49                    | 66                        |\n| Spain          | 35                         | 15                     | 20                        | 35           | 11                    | 23                        |\n| Rest of Europe | 73                         | 48                     | 25                        | 99           | 68                    | 30                        |\n| America        | 13                         | 12                     |                           | 9            | 7                     | 2                         |\n| Asia           | 3                          | 1                      | 1                         | 3            | 1                     | 1                         |\n| Australia      | 768                        | 467                    | 302                       | 1,045        | 340                   | 705                       |\n| Africa         |                            | 1                      |                           |              | 1                     |                           |\n| Total          | 8,080                      | 4,973                  | 3,107                     | 10,018       | 6,339                 | 3,679                     |",

Loans to obligors that are considered more than 90 days past due and above applicable thresholds are reclassified as non-performing. For business lending portfolios, there generally are reasons for declaring a loan non-performing prior to the obligor being 90 days past due. These reasons include, but are not limited to, ING's assessment of the customer's perceived inability to meet its financial obligations, or the customer filing for bankruptcy or bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe table below represents the breakdown by industry of credit risk outstandings that have been classified as non-performing.\n\n| in \u20ac million Industry               |       |       | Wholesale  Banking Retail Benelux   | Wholesale  Banking Retail Benelux   | Retail  Challengers &  Growth Markets   | Retail  Challengers &  Growth Markets   |                  | Total 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| in \u20ac million Industry               | 2022  | 2021  | 2022                                | 2021                                | 2022                                    | 2021                                    | 2022             | Total 2021   |\n| Private Individuals                 |       |       | 2,174                               | 2,424                               | 1,954                                   | 2,445                                   | 4,129            | 4,869        |\n| Natural Resources                   | 1,369 | 1,325 | 34                                  | 46                                  | 17                                      | 27                                      | 1,421            | 1,398        |\n| Food, Beverages & Personal  Care    | 672   | 681   | 438                                 | 428                                 | 122                                     | 130                                     | 1,233            | 1,239        |\n| Transportation & Logistics          | 367   | 575   | 165                                 | 180                                 | 51                                      | 52                                      | 583              | 807          |\n| Services                            | 119   | 224   | 448                                 | 499                                 | 61                                      | 63                                      | 628              | 786          |\n| Real Estate                         | 172   | 132   | 486                                 | 495                                 | 54                                      | 59                                      | 712              | 686          |\n| General Industries                  | 114   | 66    | 268                                 | 272                                 | 100                                     | 123                                     | 482              | 461          |\n| Builders & Contractors              | 139   | 93    | 244                                 | 224                                 | 110                                     | 112                                     | 493              | 429          |\n| Retail                              | 98    | 140   | 107                                 | 103                                 | 39                                      | 47                                      | 244              | 290          |\n| Utilities                           | 387   | 199   | 7                                   | 10                                  | 7                                       | 11                                      | 401              | 221          |\n| Chemicals, Health & Pharmaceuticals | 175   | 65    | 115                                 | 70                                  | 20                                      | 22                                      | 310              | 158          |\n| Telecom                             | 288   | 28    | 12                                  | 1                                   | 3                                       | 3                                       | 303              | 31           |\n| Other                               | 440   | 305   | 260                                 | 282                                 | 52                                      | 58                                      | 753              | 646          |\n| Total                               | 4,340 | 3,833 | 4,759                               | 5,035                               | 2,592                                   | 3,153                                   | 11,691    12,021 |              |\n\n- 1 Based on lending and investment outstandings.",

The decrease was driven by Challengers and Growth (-\u20ac561 million) and Market Leaders(-\u20ac276 million), while Wholesale Banking (+\u20ac494 million) increased. The decrease in Challengers & Growth Markets and Market Leaders was mainly witnessed in Private individuals, and was offset by an increase in Wholesale Banking mainly witnessed in Telecom and Utilities industries. The top three countries by NPL outstanding remained Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Together they accounted for 50.9% (\u20ac5.9 billion) of NPL outstanding (Dec 21: 53.8% (\u20ac6.5 billion).\n\n## Loan loss provisioning (*)\n\nING recognises loss allowances based on the expected credit loss (ECL) model of IFRS 9, which is designed to be forward-looking. The IFRS 9 impairment requirements are applicable to on-balance sheet financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), such as loans, debt securities and lease receivables, as well as off-balance sheet items such as undrawn loan commitments, and certain financial guarantees issued.\n\nING distinguishes between two types of calculation methods for credit loss allowances:\n\n- \u00b7 Collective 12-month ECL (Stage 1) and collective Lifetime ECL (Stage 2) for portfolios of financial instruments, as well as Lifetime ECL for credit impaired exposures (Stage 3) below \u20ac1 million.\n- \u00b7 Individual Lifetime ECL for credit-impaired (Stage 3) financial instruments with exposures above \u20ac1 million.\n\n## IFRS 9 models (*)\n\nING's IFRS 9 models leverage on the internal rating-based (IRB) models (PD, LGD, EAD), which include certain required conservatism. To include IFRS 9 requirements, such regulatory conservatism is removed from the ECL parameters (PD, LGD and EAD). The IFRS 9 models apply two other types of adjustments to the IRB ECL parameters: (1) to the economic outlook and (2) for Stage 2 and Stage 3 assets only, to the lifetime horizon. The IFRS 9 model parameters are estimated based on statistical techniques and supported by expert judgement.\n\nING has aligned the definition of default for regulatory purposes with the definition of 'credit-impaired' financial assets under IFRS 9 (Stage 3). ING has also aligned its definition of default between IFRS9 and the regulatory technical standards (RTS) and EBA guidelines. More information can be found in section 1.7.8 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Climate and environmental risks in IFRS 9 models (*)\n\nING is evolving in its credit risk management framework to further develop a better understanding of emerging climate and environmental risks. Banks, including ING, are in the process of collecting and analysing empirical historical data and moving towards embedding these emerging risks into their credit risk management processes and eventually into their IFRS 9 ECL models.\n\nIn 2022, ING continued to enhance the tools used to identify and assess climate and environmental (C&E) risks in our portfolio. We created C&E risk sector heatmaps for both WB and Retail Banking that facilitated the identification of exposure to C&E risks by means of scores assigned to transition and physical risk drivers. They also enabled us to understand the magnitude of the C&E risk impact on a sectoral level and pinpointed sectors with highest C&E risk exposure. In the past two years, we have improved our understanding of the physical risk impact of climate events on our mortgage portfolio.\n\nThe integration of quantified inputs from the heatmaps into risk modelling has not yet been implemented for a number of reasons including a lack of data to assess C&E risks at a client level. Refer to the section 'Environmental, social and governance risk' for further details on the heatmaps and the related challenges.\n\nAt this point in time it is not possible to incorporate climate risk separately into IFRS 9 ECL models given the lack of sufficient empirical historical data and the above-mentioned limitations in the risk assessments on client level. Where climate and environmental factors have impacted the economy in the recent past or present, these impacts are however currently implicitly embedded in ING's IFRS9 ECL models through the projected macroeconomic indicators (e.g. GDP growth and unemployment rates). We note that our ECL models are primarily sensitive to the short-term economic outlook as we use a three-year time horizon for macroeconomic outlook, after which a mean reversion approach is applied.\n\nWith regard to our evaluation of climate-related matters, where such events have already occurred (e.g. floods), the impact of such events are individually assessed in the calculation of Stage 3 Individual provisions or management adjustments to ECL models. For example, we consider whether affected assets have suffered from a significant increase in credit risk (or are credit impaired) and whether the ECL is appropriate. As of 31 December 2022, reported ECL includes a management adjustment of \u20ac10 million to address the increased credit risk in ING's livestock farming portfolio resulting from nitrogen reduction targets introduced by the Dutch Government. Refer to the section 'Management overlays' for further details.",

The transfers of financial instruments represent the impact of stage transfers upon the gross carrying/nominal amount and associated allowance for ECL. This includes the net-remeasurement of ECL arising from stage transfers, for example, moving from a 12-month (Stage 1) to a lifetime (Stage 2) ECL measurement basis.\n\nThe net-remeasurement line represents the changes in provisions for facilities that remain in the same stage.\n\nPlease note the following comments with respect to the movements observed in the table below:\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 gross carrying amount decreased by \u20ac0.4 billion from \u20ac12.1 billion as of 31 December 2021 to \u20ac11.7 billion as of 31 December 2022, mainly as a result of write-offs and generally low inflow into NPL (credit impaired) in 2022. Stage 3 provisions remained however flat at \u20ac3.8 billion, reflecting worsened macroeconomic outlook.\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 gross carrying amount increased by \u20ac21.2 billion from \u20ac49.5 billion as of 31 December 2021 to \u20ac70.7 billion. This is mainly caused by the significant lifetime PD trigger (\u20ac14.8 billion) driven by downgrades of the Russian portfolio and economic turmoil. Furthermore, the implementation of a stricter PD backstop methodology has driven the increase in Stage 2 gross carrying amounts,(\u20ac11.4 billion, mainly investment grade exposures). Other Stage 2 triggers such as the 30 Days past due and watchlist triggers (\u20ac1.2 billion and \u20ac1.1 billion respectively), were more than offset by the forbearance trigger (-\u20ac6.4 billion). For the latter, a two-year probation period is required before a client can move back to Stage 1 and the decrease relates to the fact that the start of the Covid-19 pandemic is now more than two years ago.\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 provisions increased by \u20ac0.7 billion to \u20ac1.7 billion as of 31 December 2022, largely driven by the migration of the Russian portfolio to Stage 2 and worsened macro-economic outlook. The implementation of the threefold increase in lifetime PD backstop trigger had limited impact on provisions as  it mainly impacts investment grade exposures.",

The increase in Stage 2 for non-bank financial institutions mainly resulted from the implementation of the threefold increase in lifetime PD backstop trigger, that mainly impacts investment grade exposures. Other drivers were downgrades in the Russian portfolio and economic turmoil. The largest decreases were in Automotive and Transportation & logistics with \u20ac0.9 billion and \u20ac0.6 billion releases respectively. The largest Stage 2 outstandings per economic sector as of 31 December 2022 are Real estate, Services, Natural resources and Non-bank financial institutions representing 10%, 7%, 7% and 7% of the total Stage 2 gross carrying amounts respectively.\n\nAdditional information on macroeconomic scenarios is included in the section 'Macroeconomic scenarios and sensitivity analysis of key sources of estimation uncertainty'.",

We continue to follow this methodology in generating our probability-weighted ECL, with consideration of alternative scenarios and management adjustments supplementing this ECL where, in management's opinion, the consensus forecast does not fully capture the extent of recent credit or economic events. The macroeconomic scenarios are applicable to the whole ING portfolio in the scope of IFRS 9 ECLs.\n\nThe IFRS 9 standard, with its inherent complexities and potential impact on the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities, represents a key source of estimation uncertainty. In particular, ING's reportable ECL numbers are sensitive to the forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts used as model inputs, the probability-weights applied to each of the three scenarios, and the criteria for identifying a significant increase in credit risk. As such, these crucial components require consultation and management judgement, and are subject to extensive governance.\n\n## Baseline scenario (*)\n\nAs a baseline for IFRS 9, ING has adopted a market-neutral view combining consensus forecasts for economic variables (GDP, unemployment) with market forwards (for interest rates, exchange rates and oil prices). The Oxford Economics' Global Economic Model (OEGEM) is used to complement the consensus with consistent projections for variables for which there are no consensus estimates available (most notably house prices and - for some countries - unemployment), to generate alternative scenarios, to convert annual consensus information to a quarterly frequency and to ensure general consistency of the scenarios. As the baseline scenario is consistent with the consensus view it can be considered as free from any bias.\n\nThe relevance and selection of macroeconomic variables is defined by the ECL models under credit risk model governance. The scenarios are reviewed and challenged by two panels of ING experts. The first panel consists of economic experts from Global Markets Research and risk and modelling specialists, while the second panel consists of relevant senior managers.\n\n## Alternative scenarios and probability weights (*)\n\nTwo alternative scenarios are taken into account: an upside and a downside scenario. The alternative scenarios have statistical characteristics as they are based on the forecast deviations of the OEGEM.\n\nTo understand the baseline level of uncertainty around any forecast, Oxford Economics keeps track of all its deviations (so called forecast errors) of the past 20 years. The distribution of forecast errors for GDP, unemployment, house prices and share prices is applied to the baseline forecast creating a broad range of alternative outcomes. In addition, to understand the balance of risks facing the economy in an unbiased way, Oxford Economics runs a survey with respondents from around the world and across a broad range of industries. In this survey respondents put forward their views of key risks. Following the survey results, the distribution of forecast errors (that is being used for determining the scenarios) may be skewed.\n\nFor the downside scenario, ING has chosen for the 90th percentile of that distribution because this corresponds with the way risk management earnings-at-risk is defined within the Group. The upside scenario is represented by the 10th percentile of the distribution. The applicable percentiles of the distribution imply a 20% probability for each alternative scenario. Consequently, the baseline scenario has a 60% probability weighting. Please note that, given their technical nature, the downside and upside scenarios are not based on an explicit specific narrative.",

The consensus expects recession to occur in many European countries in 2022-2023, while the US economy is anticipated to stagnate. Economic growth is expected to resume in the years thereafter as inflation normalises and monetary conditions become less tight. In economies that have experienced a notable surge in house prices during the pandemic and its aftermath, affordability pressures amid the higher interest rate environment are expected to lead to a moderation of growth or price declines in the near to medium-term.\n\nThe December 2022 consensus expects global output (as measured by the weighted average GDP growth rate of ING's 25 main markets) to slow further from 6.0% in 2021, to 2.5% in 2022 and 1.3% in 2023. For 2024-2025, economic growth is expected to pick up again to 2.4%.\n\nThe US economy is expected to stagnate in 2023 as high inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain difficulties, softer labour market dynamics, and global headwinds weaken demand. Consumer spending growth is under downward pressure as slower employment gains curb income growth and pandemicrelated savings have diminished. With the headwinds seen fading slowly, the US economy is expected to gather strength again in 2024. The consensus expects the growth rate of the US economy to fall from 1.9% in 2022 to 0.2% in 2023 and to recover to on average 1.7% in 2024-2025.\n\nEurozone economies are dealing with the consequences of the ongoing war in Ukraine, broadening inflationary pressures and a general deterioration of sentiment across industries and consumers.\n\nThe ECB has shifted to a hawkish tilt but government fiscal support targeting higher energy prices is softening the economic pain in many countries. Overall, the eurozone economy is forecasted to stagnate in 2023, but Germany - as well as some other countries - faces recession reflecting its large exposure to gas supply cuts, relatively large manufacturing sector and exposure to a slower growing Chinese economy.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, the outlook is equally bleak. In Poland, economic fallout from the war in Ukraine and the related energy price shock point to a significant economic slowdown from 5.0% in 2022 to 1.0% in 2023. However, the scope for a rise in unemployment is seen to be limited as the Polish labour market remains tight, partially due to population ageing. As in the eurozone, the central bank is tightening monetary policy, but fiscal policy remains expansive. The consensus expectation for Turkey is also for economic growth to ease as the economic slowdown in Europe weighs on external demand and high inflation persists. The consensus sees economic growth in Turkey slowing from 5.2% in 2022, to on average 2.4% in 2023-2024 and increasing again to 3.0% in 2025.\n\nAfter a weak growth rate of 3.1% in 2022, economic growth in China is expected to pick-up to on average 4.7% in 2023-2025. The drag exerted by the authorities' Covid-19 policies is assumed to moderate, while state investment will support demand. However, the real estate downturn continues to weigh on the outlook.\n\nThe global economic slowdown, together with tighter monetary policy and high inflation is weighing on economic growth in Australia. After growing by 3.8% in 2022, the outlook sees a growth rate of 1.8% for 2023-2024 and some pick-up to 2.6% for 2025. However, despite the economic slowdown, conditions in the labour market are expected to remain tight.\n\nWhen compared to the December 2021 consensus forecast, used for the 2021 Annual Report, the December 2022 forecast assumes much weaker economic circumstances. Global GDP was expected to increase by 2.5% in 2022 (compared to 4.1% assumed before) and 1.3% in 2023 (3.1% assumed before). The downgrade reflects the economic impacts of the war in Ukraine and tighter monetary conditions.\n\n## Alternative scenarios and risks (*)\n\nBecause of the possible consequences of the war in Ukraine, uncertainty surrounding the forecasts is higher than usual. This relates in particular to uncertainty about European energy supplies and worries about more persistent high inflation. To take the general increase of uncertainty surrounding the forecasts into account, the dispersion of the alternative scenarios has been set again at the widened level used for year-end 2021 provisioning (the half-widened dispersion). As a result, the near-term dispersion of the forward-looking distributions (from which the alternative scenarios are derived) is larger than in normal times. Meanwhile, at the end of the scenario horizon the dispersion has remained unchanged and hence is comparable to scenarios generated prior to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe baseline scenario assumes a significant easing of inflation in 2023 and relatively resilient labour markets. However, a longer period of weakness, due to stickier inflation and more aggressive monetary policy tightening that triggers a more notable softening of the labour market and greater falls in financial asset and property prices, could lead to a more protracted and deeper economic slowdown. As such, the balance of risks to the baseline outlook is negative and the alternative scenarios have a downward skew in line with the outcomes of Oxford Economics' Global Risk Survey. The downward skew is less negative compared to what has been applied for year-end 2021 at which time - set against a higher baseline - apart from higher inflation, worries about supply chain disruptions and further corona virus waves were being seen as top near-term downside risks.\n\nThe downside scenario - though technical in nature - sees for most countries a fast deceleration of economic growth followed by a recession. Unemployment increases strongly in this scenario and house prices in most countries show outright falls. The downside scenario captures a possible escalation of the war in Ukraine and a more pronounced and prolonged surge in inflation.",

The recovery is further supported by looser monetary policy as weaker inflation prompts central banks to hold back tightening.\n\n## Management adjustments applied this year (*)\n\nIn times of volatility and uncertainty where portfolio quality and the economic environment are changing rapidly, models alone may not be able to accurately predict losses. In these cases, management adjustments can be applied to appropriately reflect ECL. Management adjustments can also be applied where the impact of the updated macroeconomic scenarios is over- or under-estimated by the IFRS 9 models.\n\nING has internal governance frameworks and controls in place to assess the appropriateness of all management adjustments.\n\n| Management adjustments to ECL models (*) in \u20ac million   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Economic sector based adjustments                       | 71     | 341    |\n| Second order impact adjustments                         | 334    |        |\n| Payment holiday adjustments                             |        | 32     |\n| Mortgage portfolio adjustments                          | 105    | 124    |\n| Other post model adjustments \u00b9                          | -57    | 121    |\n| Total management adjustments                            | 453    | 618    |\n\nDecember 2021 management adjustments included an economic sector-based management adjustment of \u20ac341 million because of delays in defaults occurring in the Covid-19-related crisis, mainly as a result of government support programmes. In determining the sector-based management adjustment, a heatmap approach was used to adjust the probability of default for sectors where businesses are significantly impacted by the pandemic. In 2022, as it became clearer the Covid-19 pandemic had less impact than expected on the number of defaults, the economic sector-based management adjustment has been largely released and while at the same time management adjustments for the second order impact of the war in Ukraine were introduced (see below). Of the remaining economic sector based adjustments of \u20ac71 million as of 31 December 2022, \u20ac61 million relates to Business Banking clients that have benefited from Covid-19 related government support programmes in the Netherlands such as deferral of tax payments that ended in the second half of 2022, and \u20ac10 million relates to an overlay for livestock farming sector in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, nitrogen reduction targets affect the livestock farming sector mainly because of endorsed closing activities nearby Natura 2000 areas and because of expected transition to\n\nother business models in the sector. As these specific risks are not incorporated in the model ECL, an overlay was recognised.\n\nING has performed an assessment for both WB and Retail Banking on the impact of the war in Ukraine, the increase in energy prices and other second order macroeconomic developments such as an increase in inflation and rising interest rates. This resulted in a second order impact overlay of \u20ac334 million in total as of 31 December 2022, of which \u20ac164 million relates to Retail Banking segments and \u20ac170 million to the Wholesale Banking segment.\n\nAs the credit risk models assume that these second order effects materialise via other risk drivers such as GDP and unemployment rates with a delay, an overlay approach was determined to timely estimate the Expected Credit Losses related to reduced repayment capacity and affordability for private individuals and business clients in the Retail Banking segment. The \u20ac164 million includes an overlay of \u20ac22 million for clients participating in the payment holiday scheme in Belgium that was introduced in 2022 to support customers impacted by the inflation and high energy prices.\n\nIn WB, it was assessed that the economic effects of Covid-19 was not the highest risk anymore and that other risks have emerged - mainly high energy prices, high interest rates and inflation, supply chain issues and staffing shortages. A heatmap approach was used to adjust the probability of default for clients that are expected to be significantly impacted by these emerged risks.\n\nGiven Covid-19-related payment holiday programmes have generally expired, this management adjustment has been fully released in 2022.\n\nModel based ECL of mortgage portfolios has decreased over the past years and until the third quarter of 2022, driven by significant increase of house prices in various countries. Management adjustments of \u20ac105 million in total, mainly in Stage 2 and 3, have been recognised by ING in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Australia to maintain an appropriate level of ECL and reflecting a potential impact of market uncertainty on the recovery value of residential real estate (impacted by higher inflation and interest rates). The management adjustment for the Netherlands and part of the Belgian mortgage portfolio was determined by developing three alternative macroeconomic forecast scenarios, in addition to the consensus base, up- and down-scenarios, that reflect a correction in the house prices in the next three years bringing it back in line with the historical growth rate. For other countries, management adjustments were determined by calculating the impact of lower house prices on LTVs and LGDs.\n\nOther post model adjustments mainly relate to the impact of model redevelopment or recalibration and periodic model assessment procedures that have not been incorporated in the ECL models yet. These result from both regular model maintenance and ING's multiyear programme to update ECL models for the new definition of default. These adjustments will be removed once updates to the specific models have been implemented.",

The countries included in the analysis are the most significant geographic regions, in terms of both gross contribution to reportable ECL, and sensitivity of ECL to forward-looking macroeconomics. Accordingly, ING considers these portfolios to present the most significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of financial assets within the next financial year.

Both 2021 and 2022 contain half-widened dispersion around upside and downside scenarios, for 2021. This reflects continuing but decreased shortterm uncertainty relating to the impact of Covid-19 and for 2022 reflecting short-term uncertainty around the war in Ukraine and its indirect effects. The increase in reportable ECL compared to 2021 is mainly caused by higher model ECL amounts as per December 2022 as a result of increased provisions for Russia-related exposures in Stage 2.\n\nWhile the table above does give a high-level indication of the sensitivity of the outputs to the different scenarios, it does not provide insight into the interdependencies and correlations between different macroeconomic variable inputs. On a total ING level, the unweighted ECL for all collective provisioned clients in the upside scenario was \u20ac2,680 million, in the baseline scenario \u20ac3,177 million and in the downside scenario \u20ac4,456 million compared to \u20ac3,209 million reportable collective provisions as at 31 December 2022 (excluding all management adjustments). This reconciles as follows to the reported ECL's:\n\n| Reconciliation of model (reportable) ECL to total ECL (*)   |       |       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| in \u20ac million                                                | 2022  | 2021  |\n| Total model ECL \u00b9                                           | 3,209 | 2,408 |\n| ECL from individually assessed impairments                  | 2,439 | 2,342 |\n| ECL from management adjustments                             | 453   | 618   |\n| Total ECL                                                   | 6,101 | 5,368 |\n\n## Criteria for identifying a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) (*)\n\nAll assets and off-balance sheet items that are in scope of IFRS 9 impairment and which are subject to collective ECL assessment are allocated a 12-month ECL if deemed to belong in Stage 1, or a lifetime ECL if deemed to belong in Stages 2 or 3. An asset belongs in Stage 2 if it is considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial origination or purchase. ING considers the credit risk of an asset to have significantly increased when either a threshold for absolute change in lifetime probability of default (PD) or a relative change in lifetime PD is reached.\n\nIt should be noted that the lifetime PD thresholds are not the only drivers of stage allocation. An asset can also change stages as a result of other triggers, such as having over 30 days arrears, being on a watch list or being forborne. Refer to section 1.7.8 of Note 1 'Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies' for an exhaustive list. Furthermore, this analysis is rudimentary in the sense that other parameters would change when an asset changes stages.\n\n## Absolute lifetime PD threshold\n\nThe absolute threshold is a fixed value calibrated per portfolio/segment and provides a fixed threshold that, if exceeded by the difference between lifetime PD at reporting date and lifetime PD at origination, triggers Stage 2 classification. The thresholds for the absolute change in lifetime PD vary between 75bps for Retail portfolios, 100bps for WB and 250bps for SMEs, based on the characteristics of the specific portfolio. ING is in the process of refining the thresholds on a portfolio level. These have already been implemented for more than 20 percent of the portfolio, resulting in deviating absolute lifetime PD thresholds.\n\n## Relative lifetime PD threshold\n\nThe relative threshold defines a relative increase of the lifetime PD beyond which a given facility is classified in Stage 2 because of significant increase in credit risk. The relative threshold is dependent on the individual PD assigned to each facility at the moment of origination and a scaling factor calibrated in the model development phase that is optimised depending on the observed default rates and overall average riskiness of the portfolio. While the scaling factor is associated with a whole portfolio/segment, the PD at origination is facility-specific and, in this sense, the relative threshold may differ facility by facility.\n\nUltimately the relative threshold provides a criterion to assess whether the ratio (i.e. increase) between lifetime PD at reporting date and lifetime PD at origination date is deemed a significant increase in credit risk. If the threshold is breached, SICR is identified and Stage 2 is assigned to the given facility.\n\nThe threshold for the relative change in lifetime PD is inversely correlated with the PD at origination; the higher the PD at origination, the lower the threshold. The logic behind this is to allow facilities originated in very favourable ratings to downgrade for longer without the need of a Stage 2 classification. In fact, it is likely that said facilities will still be in favourable ratings even after a downgrade of a few notches. On the contrary, facilities originated in already unfavourable ratings grades are riskier and even a single-notch downgrade might represent a significant increase in credit risk and thus a tighter threshold will be in place. Still, the relative threshold is relatively sensitive for investment grade assets while the absolute threshold primarily affects non-investment grade assets.\n\n## Average threshold ratio\n\nIn the table below the average increase in PD at origination needed to be classified in Stage 2 is reported, taking into account the PD at origination of the facilities included in each combination of asset class and rating quality. In terms of rating quality, assets are divided into 'Investment grade' and 'non-investment grade' facilities. Rating 18 and 19 are not included in the table since facilities are not originated in these ratings and they constitute a staging trigger of their own (i.e. if a facility is ever to reach rating 18 or 19 at reporting date, it is classified in Stage 2). In the table, values are weighted by IFRS 9 exposure and shown for both year-end 2021 and year-end 2022.",

Since breaching only relative or absolute threshold triggers Stage 2 classification, the minimum between the relative and recalculated absolute threshold is taken as value of reference for each facility.\n\n## Quantitative SICR thresholds (*)\n\n|                                   |                                        |                                              | 2021                                   | 2021                                         |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Average threshold ratio           | Investment  grade (rating  grade 1-10) | Non- investment  grade (rating  grade 11-17) | Investment  grade (rating  grade 1-10) | Non- investment  grade (rating  grade 11-17) |\n| Asset class category              |                                        |                                              |                                        |                                              |\n| Mortgages                         | 2.7                                    | 2.3                                          | 2.7                                    | 2.2                                          |\n| Consumer lending                  | 2.8                                    | 1.8                                          | 2.8                                    | 1.7                                          |\n| Business lending                  | 2.8                                    | 2.1                                          | 4.0                                    | 2.2                                          |\n| Governments and fin. institutions | 3.0                                    | 1.9                                          | 7.9                                    | 2.2                                          |\n| Other Wholesale Banking           | 2.8                                    | 1.9                                          | 4.5                                    | 2.0                                          |\n\nAs it is apparent from the disclosures above, as per ING's methodology, the threshold is tighter the higher the riskiness at origination of the assets, illustrated by the difference between the average threshold applied to investment grade facilities and non-investment grade facilities. In 3Q 2022, following up an ECB request, a new backstop trigger was implemented. The new trigger forces Stage 2 classification in case the lifetime PD at reporting date has increased more than three times with respect to the origination, regardless of the actual staging thresholds in force for a given portfolio. The new requirement entails that the threshold ratio in the table above is effectively capped at a threefold increase for December 2022. The effect of this trigger is especially apparent in the average thresholds ratio for investment grade facilities when confronting 2021 and 2022 figures. Since for investment grade assets thresholds tend to be looser given the good quality of underlying counterparties ratings, the backstop trigger is more impactful.\n\nIn terms of impact on ING portfolio, the application of the new backstop trigger resulted in an increase of Stage 2 exposure. However, since the trigger impacts mainly good quality assets for which regular staging thresholds are typically above a threefold increase in PD, the corresponding impact in provisions was limited.\n\n## Sensitivity of ECL to PD lifetime PD thresholds\n\nThe setting of PD threshold bands requires management judgement and is a key source of estimation uncertainty. On Group level, the total model ECL, which is the ECL collective-assessment without taking management adjustments into account, is \u20ac3,209 million (2021: \u20ac2,408 million) of which performing assets constitute \u20ac1,884 million (2021: \u20ac1,003 million). To demonstrate the sensitivity of the ECL to these PD thresholds bands, an analysis was run on all collectively-assessed assets, which assumed all assets were below the threshold (Stage 1) and apportioned a 12-month ECL. On the same asset base, analysis was run which assumed all performing assets were above the threshold (Stage 2) and apportioned a lifetime ECL. This gave rise to hypothetical collective-assessment ECLs of \u20ac1,348 million (2021: \u20ac634 million) and \u20ac3,391 million (2021: \u20ac2,232 million) respectively. Please note that in this analysis, all other ECL risk parameters (except for the stage) were kept equal.",

Market risk either arises through positions in banking books or trading books. The banking book positions are intended to be held for the long term (or until maturity) or for the purpose of hedging other banking book positions. The trading book positions are typically held with the intention of short-term trading or to hedge other positions in the trading book. This means that financial instruments in the trading books should be free of trade restrictions. Policies and processes are in place to monitor the inclusion of positions in either the trading or banking book as well as to monitor the transfer of risk between the trading and banking books.\n\nING recognises the importance of sound market risk management and bases its market risk management framework on the need to identify, assess, control and manage market risks. The approach consists of five recurring activities: risk identification, risk assessment, risk control, risk monitoring and risk reporting.\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nA governance framework has been established defining specific roles and responsibilities of business management units, market risk management units, and internal approval bodies per activity.\n\nSupervision of market risk falls under the responsibility of the EB/MBB and is delegated to the ALCO function, where ALCO Bank is the highest approval authority and sets the market risk appetite. ALCO Bank monitors ING's adherence to the risk appetite for market risk and sets additional limits where appropriate. These limits are cascaded through the organisation through lower level ALCOs. This ALCO structure facilitates top-down risk management, limit setting, and the monitoring and control of market risk.\n\nFR maintains a limit framework in line with ING's Risk Appetite Framework. The businesses are responsible for adhering to the limits which are reviewed on an annual basis and are ultimately approved by the ALCO Bank. Limit excesses are reported to senior management in line with the ALM Limit excess reporting procedure upon which the business needs to act accordingly. To adhere to the established limit framework, ING implements hedging and risk mitigation strategies that range from the use of traditional market instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to more sophisticated hedging strategies.\n\nThe organisational structure facilitates top-down risk management by recognising that risk taking and risk management occur to a large extent at the regional/local level. Bottom-up reporting from regional/local\n\nunits to head office units allows each management level to assess the market risks relevant at the respective levels.\n\nSeveral committees govern communication between the parties involved in market risk management:\n\n- \u00b7 The Market Risk Model Committee (MRMC, reporting to ALCO Bank), is the dedicated authority within ING for the approval of all funding and liquidity risk, banking and trading risk and counterparty credit risk models, methodologies and related parameters. This is comparable with the CTRC, which reports into the GCTP.\n- \u00b7 The Valuation Model Committee approves pricing models for trading and banking books.\n\nFinancial Risk provides risk reporting to the EB and MBB, the ALCO Bank and the senior executive management of related business functions.\n\nThe following sections elaborate on the various elements of the risk management framework for:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk economic capital (trading and banking books).\n- \u00b7 Market risks in trading books.\n- \u00b7 Market risks in banking books.\n\n## Market risk economic capital (trading and banking books)\n\nEconomic capital for market risk is the economic capital necessary to withstand unexpected value movements due to changes in market variables and model risk.\n\nEconomic capital for market risk is calculated for exposures in both banking portfolios and trading portfolios and includes interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange rate risk, customer behaviour risk, model risks and pension risk. Economic capital for market risk is calculated using internally developed methodologies with a 99.9% confidence level and a horizon of one year.\n\nFor the trading books, the linear interest rate risk and other risk types as well as equity investments in the banking books, the Value at Risk (VaR) are taken as a starting point for the economic capital calculations for market risk. The VaR is measured at a 99% confidence level with a one-day holding period.\n\nTo arrive at the economic capital for market risk, a simulation-based model is used which includes scaling to the required confidence level and holding period. In determining this scaling factor, other factors are also taken into account like the occurrence of large market movements (events).\n\nEmbedded options, e.g. the prepayment option and offered rate option in mortgages in the banking books, result in non-linear interest rate risk in the banking books. Embedded options are economically hedged using a delta-hedging methodology, leaving the mortgage portfolio exposed to convexity risk, volatility risk",

For the calculation of economic capital for this non-linear interest rate risk, ING performs a Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nWhile aggregating the different economic capital market risk figures for the different portfolios, diversification benefits (based on stressed correlations) are taken into account as it is not expected that all extreme market movements will appear at the same moment.\n\n## Market risk in banking books (*)\n\nING makes a distinction between the trading and banking (non-trading) books. Positions in banking books originate from the market risks inherent in commercial products that are sold to clients, Group Treasury exposures, and from the investment of our own funds (core capital). Both the commercial products and the products used to hedge-related market risk exposures are intended to be held until maturity, or at least for the long term.\n\n## Risk transfer (*)\n\nMarket risks in the banking book are managed via the risk transfer process. In this process the interest rate, FX, funding and liquidity risks are transferred from the commercial books through matched funding or replication to Group Treasury, where it is centrally managed.

        "page_content": "Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nRisk management\n\n- > Market risk\n\n## Risk measurement (*)\n\nThe main concepts and metrics used for measuring market risk in the banking book are described below per risk type.\n\n## Interest rate risk in banking book (*)\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is defined as the exposure of a bank's earnings, capital, and market value to adverse movements in interest rates originated from positions in the banking book.\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nThe management of interest rate risk follows the Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) framework as approved by ALCO Bank. This framework describes roles, responsibilities, risk metrics, and the policies and procedures related to interest rate risk management. Furthermore, ALCO Bank reviews and sets the risk appetite for interest rate risk, on an annual basis. The risk appetite is translated into limits for the interest rate risk metrics.\n\nAs a result of this framework, ING centralises interest rate risk management from commercial books (that capture the products sold to clients) to globally managed interest rate risk books. This enables a clear demarcation between commercial business results and results based on unhedged interest rate positions.\n\nING distinguishes between three types of activities that generate interest rate risk in the banking book:\n\n- \u00b7 Investment of own funds.\n- \u00b7 Group Treasury exposures including strategic interest rate positions.\n- \u00b7 Commercial business.\n\nGroup Treasury is responsible for managing the investment of own funds (core capital). Capital is invested for longer periods to contribute to stable earnings within the risk appetite boundaries set by ALCO Bank. The main objective is to maximise the economic value of the capital investment book while having stable earnings.\n\nCommercial activities can result in linear interest rate risk, for example, tenors and duration of new production and re-pricing of assets differ from those of liabilities. Also, interest rate risk can arise from customer behaviour and/or convexity risk, depending on the nature of the underlying product characteristics.\n\nCustomer behaviour risk is defined as the potential future (value) loss due to deviations in the actual behaviour of clients versus the modelled behaviour towards the embedded options in commercial products. General sources of customer behaviour risk, among other things, include the state of the economy,\n\ncompetition, changes in regulation, legislation and tax regime, developments in the housing market and interest rate developments.\n\nFrom an interest rate risk perspective, commercial activities can typically be divided into three main product types: funds entrusted as savings and demand deposits, mortgages and loans.\n\nSavings and demand deposits are generally invested in such a way that both the value is hedged  and the sensitivity of the margin to market interest rates is minimised. Interest rate risk can arise when there is a misalignment between the change in market rates and adjustment of savings rates, which can either have a positive or negative impact on the income as a consequence of the potential misalignment to the related (assumption based) investment strategy of ING's savings. Interest rate risk is modelled based on the stability of the deposit and the pass-through rate. This takes account of different elements, such as pricing strategies, volume developments and the level and shape of the yield curve. Savings volumes are typically assumed to be relatively stable and less sensitive to rate changes.\n\nInterest rate risk for mortgages arises due to prepayment possibilities in these mortgages. In modelling this risk, both interest rate dependent pre-payments and constant prepayments are considered. Next to a dependence on interest rates, modelled prepayments may include other effects such as loan-to-value, seasonality and the reset date of the loan. In addition, the interest sensitivity of embedded offered rate options may be considered.\n\nWholesale Banking loans typically do not experience interest rate dependent prepayment behaviour, these portfolios are match-funded taking the constant prepayment model into account and typically do not contain significant convexity risk. Wholesale Banking loans can have an all-in rate floor or a floor on a reference rate.\n\nCustomer behaviour in relation to mortgages, loans, savings and demand deposits is modelled, based on extensive research. However, the substantial change in the interest rate environment makes extensive research more challenging than before and may increase model risk. Models are backtested and updated when deemed necessary in an annual procedure. Model parameters and the resulting risk measures are approved by (local) ALCO.\n\nLinear risk transfers take place from commercial business books to the treasury book (Group Treasury), if necessary, by using estimations of customer behaviour. The originating commercial business is ultimately responsible for estimating customer behaviour, leaving convexity risk and (unexpected) customer behaviour risk with the commercial business. Risk measurement and the risk transfer process take place at least monthly. However, if deemed necessary, additional risk transfers can take place.\n\nThe commercial business manages the convexity risk that is the result of products that contain embedded options, like mortgages. Here the convexity risk is defined as the optionality effects in the value due to",

In some cases, convexity risk is transferred from the commercial books to treasury books using cap/floor contracts.\n\nIn the following sections, the interest rate risk exposures in the banking books are presented. ING uses risk measures based on both an earnings and a value perspective. Net interest income (NII)-at-risk is used to provide the earnings perspective and the net present value (NPV)-at-risk figures provide the value perspective. Please note that the expected interest rate risk coming forward from the business is assumed to be linearly hedged but no additional corrective management actions are taken into account in the NPVat-Risk measure. In the NII-at-Risk measure, a more dynamic hedging process is taken into account.\n\nDuring 2022, the following activities related to the risk measurement for IRRBB were performed:\n\n- \u00b7 Annual review of the risk appetite for Market Risks in the Banking Book including further enhancement.\n- \u00b7 Further assessment and development of sub-risk types, such as tenor basis risk, vega optionality risk and client behaviour risk.\n- \u00b7 Set up of standardised risk measurement related to climate risk.\n- \u00b7 Annual savings/current account model updates.\n- \u00b7 Annual review of the interest rates scenarios used for calculating NII-at-Risk and NPV-at-Risk.\n- \u00b7 Annual update of parameters of prepayment models for market developments.\n- \u00b7 Further enhancement of the IRRBB framework in relation to upcoming regulatory requirements (e.g. anticipation on implementation and measurement of the upcoming regulatory metric NII SOT, development of additional requirements coming forward from latest EBA guidelines).\n- \u00b7 A specific, internal firm-wide stress test relating to climate risk.\n- \u00b7 Improvement of the FX framework.\n\n## Net interest income (NII) at Risk (*)\n\nThe NII-at-Risk measures the impact of changing interest rates on the forecasted net interest income (before tax) of the banking book, excluding the impacts of credit spread sensitivity, fees and fair value impact. Future projected balance sheet developments are included in this risk metric. NII-at-Risk is a metric that helps provide insight to what extent ING's NII under our Dynamic Plan deviates from the interest rates development assumed.\n\nIn its risk management, ING monitors the NII-at-Risk under a three-year timeframe. Interest rates are stressed during the first year versus the prevailing curve, taking gradual changes over the first year. The rate changes considered comprise both upward and downward scenarios, as well as parallel (equal movements across the yield curve) and non-parallel scenarios.\n\nThe impact of changing interest rates on ING's NII is predominantly caused by the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Change in returns of (re-)investments of client deposits.\n\n- \u00b7 Change in deposits client rates (mainly savings), (partially) tracking changes in market interest rates.\n- \u00b7 Change in funding profile of mortgages, due to an expected increase or decrease in expected prepayments.\n- \u00b7 Higher/lower returns of (re-)investments of capital investment.\n- \u00b7 Assumed volume development of the balance sheet in line with ING's dynamic plan.\n- \u00b7 Open interest rate positions, leading to changes in return because of different market rates.\n\nFor projecting the change in client deposit rates, ING uses a client rate model that describes the relation to market interest rates and client deposit rates. The model is calibrated under a range of interest rate scenarios. Per scenario the actual change in client deposit rates may deviate from this calibrated model. The actual NII development of customer deposits may, indeed, differ from the provided scenarios, depending on, amongst others, actual interest rate and savings client rate evolution, as well as changes to ING's balance sheet composition such as net deposit growth and relative share of savings deposits and non-remunerated current accounts.\n\nThe NII-at-Risk figures in the tables below reflect a parallel, linear interest rate movement during a year ('ramped') under the assumption of balance sheet developments in line with the ING's Dynamic Plan with a time horizon of one year.\n\n| in \u20ac million                        | 2022                                    | 2022                                    | 2021                                      | 2021                                      |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                     | Ramped, unfloored parallel  parallel  \u25b2 | Ramped, unfloored parallel  parallel  \u25b2 | Ramped, unfloored parallel  \u25bc parallel  \u25b2 | Ramped, unfloored parallel  \u25bc parallel  \u25b2 |\n|                                     | \u25bc                                       |                                         |                                           |                                           |\n| By business                         |                                         |                                         |                                           |                                           |\n| Wholesale Banking                   | 4                                       | -47                                     | 46                                        | -33                                       |\n| Retail Banking Benelux              | -88                                     | 59                                      | -122                                      | 132                                       |\n| Retail Challengers & Growth Markets | -41                                     | 113                                     | -93                                       | 75                                        |\n| Corporate line banking              | -18                                     | 18                                      | -58                                       | 58                                        |\n| Total                               | -142                                    | 142                                     | -226                                      | 232                                       |\n\nThe NII-at-Risk is primarily driven by the difference in sensitivity of client liabilities, mainly savings, versus the sensitivity of client assets and investments to rate changes.

In this scenario, oneyear (re-) investment returns are higher than the modelled increase in client deposit rates and modelled extra funding costs due to higher funding costs for mortgages.\n\nThe projected change in NII numbers in the tables above include projected changes in client deposit rates for the ramped parallel up scenario. Without increasing client deposit rates, the NII-at-Risk for the parallel ramped up scenario would be significantly higher, meaning that the actual client deposit rate tracking of market interest rates in such scenario is a key driver in the NII development of the bank.\n\nThe change in NII under a declining or upward interest rate scenario may not be equal. This is then caused by different expected reactions in prepayment behaviour of mortgages and different pricing developments of commercial loans and deposits products (mainly savings). This is caused by embedded options, explicit or implicit pricing floors and other (assumed) pricing factors.\n\n## Year-on-year variance analysis (*)\n\nIn 2021, interest rates remained at very low levels and short-term interest rates were even negative. In 2022, interest rates in both short and longer tenors increased significantly. Central banks tightened monetary conditions to counter high inflation specifically as a follow up to high energy prices. In 2022, the rate environment was characterised by increasing interest rates. ING applied a dynamic hedging process, by which interest rate risk was transferred from the business to Group Treasury and subsequently hedged in the markets. This process mitigates interest rate risk resulting in a lower sensitivity for rate changes of ING's NII. However, the main drivers in a potential change of NII sensitivity are balance sheet developments, specifically relating to mortgages, loans and savings. In the eurozone, mortgage production was impacted by an increase in interest rates. Next to the impact on new production, the prepayment incentive decreased due to the increase in interest rates. The funds entrusted volume did not change significantly, The impact of explicit and implicit floors on both rates of client assets and savings phased out in the course of the year on\n\nthe back of the interest rate increases. Pre-existing hedges, as executed by Group Treasury, were also adjusted continuously throughout the year to hedge any interest rate risk coming from higher interest rates. Given that Group Treasury is included in the Wholesale Banking risk numbers, these adjustments changed the Wholesale Banking NII-at-Risk. Furthermore, ING's investment of own funds took place against a lower duration reducing sensitivity. Excluding Model Risk, the total NII-at-Risk remains relatively limited in comparison to ING's total interest income.\n\n## Net Present Value (NPV) at Risk (*)\n\nNPV-at-Risk measures the impact of changing interest rates on the value of the positions in the Banking Book. This does not include positive earnings in our commercial books. The NPV-at-Risk is defined as the outcome of an instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates from applying currency-specific scenarios. The NPV-at-Risk asymmetry between the downward and upward shock is mainly caused by convexity risk in the mortgage and savings portfolio.\n\nThe full value impact cannot be directly linked to the financial position or profit or loss account, as fair value movements in banking books are not necessarily reported through the profit or loss account or through other comprehensive income (OCI). The changes in value are expected to materialise over time in the profit and loss account if interest rates develop according to forward rates throughout the remaining maturity of the portfolio.\n\n| in \u20ac million                        | 2022        | 2022        | 2021                    | 2021                    |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                     | unfloored \u25b2 | unfloored \u25b2 | unfloored \u25bc parallel  \u25b2 | unfloored \u25bc parallel  \u25b2 |\n|                                     | parallel  \u25bc | parallel    | parallel                |                         |\n| By business                         |             |             |                         |                         |\n| Wholesale Banking                   | -1,474      | 1,299       | -1,477                  | 1,444                   |\n| Retail Banking Benelux              | -307        | -76         | -953                    | -202                    |\n| Retail Challengers & Growth Markets | 1,327       | -1,373      | 832                     | -1,111                  |\n| Corporate line banking              | 1,049       | -1,003      | 1,820                   | -1,712                  |\n| Total                               | 594         | -1,153      | 223                     | -1,580                  |\n\nEUR (unfloored) +/- 100bp shock scenario\n\nUSD (unfloored) +/- 120bp shock scenario",

This is mainly due to the shorter duration at which ING strategically invests its own funds. These investments are done in the Corporate Line Banking.\n\nThe changes in NPV-at-Risk in the segments Retail Benelux and Retail Challengers & Growth Markets were partly offsetting, whereby the higher interest rates reduced the overall convexity. The resulting impact on retail sensitivity of the increase in interest rates was hedged by Group Treasury in line with the internal ALM practices. The Group Treasury exposure is reported under business line Wholesale Banking.\n\n## IBOR transition (*)\n\nIn line with the recommendations from the Financial Stability Board, a fundamental review of benchmarks for important interest rates has been undertaken. Some interest benchmarks have been reformed, while others have or will be replaced by risk-free rates (RFR) and discontinued. Following the cessation of GBP, CHF, JPY, and EUR LIBOR rates on 31 December 2021, USD LIBOR will cease on 30 June 2023.\n\nIn 2022, the focus shifted to USD LIBOR, with new USD lending now using the recommended alternative rates based on SOFR. This is consistent with guidance issued to limit the use of USD LIBOR from 1 January 2022 onward. Risk reduction trades to help manage the run-off of existing USD LIBOR contracts and positions are a permitted exception.\n\nTo enable these changes, the financial sector has issued several guidance papers and other initiatives to help phase this transition. For example, ISDA has issued an IBOR fallback supplement to help ensure clear fallback rates apply upon the discontinuation of key IBORs. For loans, various recommendations have been made to help ensure the inclusion of consistent robust fallback provisions. Public authorities have also recognised that many contracts do not contain provisions for any alternatives, contain inappropriate alternatives, or cannot be renegotiated prior to the expected cessation date ('tough legacy' contracts). For example, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is expected to ask the USD LIBOR administrator to continue publishing a 'synthetic' LIBOR rate for 15 months beyond the cessation date to provide extra time for any remaining contracts. A similar action was taken for GBP and JPY LIBOR. The US has also implemented the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, that will revise the contractual terms of in scope contracts to reference a rate based on SOFR upon cessation of USD LIBOR.\n\nDue to the discontinuation of this important rate, ING, its customers, and the financial services industry face a number of risks. These risks include legal, financial, operational, and conduct risk. Legal risks are related to any required changes to existing transactions. Financial risks may arise due to declining liquidity and may impact a contract directly or the ability to hedge the risks in that contract. Operational risks arise due to the requirement to adapt IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational processes. Conduct risk also plays a role, as renegotiation of loan contracts requires active engagement from all parties to a contract,\n\nand may lead to negotiations concentrated in a period close to actual cessation. ING continues to reach out to impacted clients to manage the relevant timelines.\n\nDuring 2022, ING sought to ensure that a large portion of the derivative portfolio is covered by ISDA fallbacks. Regarding the loans, many facilities have already been transitioned to alternative rates. Additionally, for the remaining portfolio the parameters for the required changes have been communicated to counterparties, with many now in active discussions on the remaining steps.\n\nThe ING IBOR programme has governance in place with progress being tracked by business line steering committees reporting to a central IBOR steering committee. The programme assesses and coordinates the actions necessary to manage the required changes to internal processes and systems, including pricing, risk management, legal documentation, hedge arrangements, as well as the impact on customers. ING continues to monitor market developments and reform plans for other rates, to anticipate the impact on the programme, our customers and any related risks.\n\nOne such development concerns key Polish Zloty benchmarks. The roadmap published by the Polish National Working Group in 2022 indicates that the plan is for the market to be ready for a cessation of WIBOR and WIBID Reference Rates in 2025. It is expected that the reform will be completed by the end of 2024, with the offering of financial products using the new benchmark (WIRON) to progress gradually in 2023 and 2024. The WIBOR rates are used in several of our lending and derivative products, and hence a project team has been established to manage the transition.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, ING has exposures that have yet to transition related to USD LIBOR and WIBOR. The tables below summarise these approximate exposures. They exclude exposures that will expire before the transition date 30 June 2023 and 1 January 2025, respectively. The GBP LIBOR, CHF LIBOR and EONIA contracts included as at 31 December 2021 have all transitioned or matured.\n\n## Non derivative Financial instruments to transition to alternative benchmarks (*)\n\n| in \u20ac million at 31 December 2022   | Financial Assets non- derivative   | Financial Liabilities   non-derivative   | Off balance sheet  commitments   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                    | Carrying value                     | Carrying value                           | Nominal value                    |\n| By benchmark rate                  | By benchmark rate                  | By benchmark rate                        | By benchmark rate                |\n| GBP LIBOR                          | GBP LIBOR                          | GBP LIBOR                                | GBP LIBOR                        |\n| USD LIBOR                          | 30,040                             | 1,637                                    | 7,644                            |\n| CHF LIBOR                          | CHF LIBOR                          | CHF LIBOR                                | CHF LIBOR                        |\n| EONIA                              | EONIA                              | EONIA                                    | EONIA                            |\n| WIBOR                              | 22,154                             | 22,154                                   | 1,411                            |\n| Total                              | 52,194                             | 1,637                                    | 9,055                            |",

        "page_content": "- > Market risk\n\nGiven that IBOR Reform may have various accounting implications, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has undertaken a two-phase project:\n\n- \u00b7 Phase 1 addresses those issues that affect financial reporting before the replacement of an existing benchmark. Phase 1 amendments to IFRS were issued by the IASB in 2019 and were early adopted by ING Group in the same year. This allows ING to apply a set of temporary exceptions to continue hedge accounting even when there is uncertainty about contractual cash flows arising from the reform. Under these temporary exceptions, interbank offered rates are assumed to continue unaltered for the purposes of hedge accounting until such time as the uncertainty is resolved.\n- \u00b7 Phase 2 focuses on issues that may affect financial reporting when the existing benchmark rate is reformed or replaced. Phase 2 amendments to IFRS were issued by the IASB in 2020 and became effective in 2021. Phase 2 amendments to IFRS relate mainly to accounting for changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of financial assets and liabilities due to the IBOR reform and impact on hedge accounting when an existing benchmark rate is reformed or replaced with an alternative risk-free rate.\n\nSpecifically, Phase 2 amendments require that the effective interest rate on debt financial instruments is adjusted, and hedge accounting continues on transition to risk free rates, but only to the extent that the modifications made to financial instruments are those necessary to implement the IBOR Reform and that the new basis for calculating cash flows is 'economically equivalent' to the previous basis. By applying these mandatory amendments, ING avoids recognising modification gains and losses on debt instruments that would otherwise be required in the absence of Phase 2 amendments (changes to debt instruments resulting from IBOR Reform are treated as a reset to the instrument's variable interest rate). In addition, ING Group avoids hedge accounting discontinuations when modifying both hedged items and hedging instruments (and related hedge documentation) as a consequence of IBOR reform that would otherwise be required in the absence of Phase 2 amendments.\n\nAs explained above, Phase 1 and Phase 2 IBOR amendments to IFRS, amongst other changes, provide specific hedge accounting reliefs that allow hedge accounting relationships to continue when IBOR Reform is ongoing. Phase 1 reliefs cease to apply when uncertainty arising from IBOR Reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and amount of the IBOR-based cash flows of the relevant instruments. It is ING Group's policy to cease to apply Phase 1 reliefs when the applicable contract (either hedging instrument or hedged item) is actually modified. As a result, for these hedge accounting relationships the applicable Phase 1 reliefs ceased to apply and Phase 2 became applicable. For USD LIBOR exposures, and although the administrator of LIBOR confirmed on 5 March 2021 its plans for the cessation of USD LIBOR rates at the end of June 2023, there is still uncertainty with respect to the timing of the transition as well as the transition strategy for individual hedged items and/or hedging instruments linked to USD LIBOR. Therefore, for USD LIBOR financial instruments designated in hedge accounting the applicable Phase 1 reliefs will continue to apply until the relevant contract is modified. At that point in time, Phase 2 reliefs will become applicable.\n\n## Non derivative financial instruments to transition to alternative benchmarks (*)\n\n| in \u20ac million at 31 December 2021   | Financial assets non- derivative Carrying value   | Financial liabilities   non-derivative Carrying value   | Off balance sheet  commitments Nominal value   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| By benchmark rate 1                |                                                   |                                                         |                                                |\n| GBP LIBOR                          | 764                                               |                                                         | 350                                            |\n| USD LIBOR                          | 41,805                                            | 1,542                                                   | 16,435                                         |\n| CHF LIBOR                          | 1                                                 |                                                         |                                                |\n| EONIA                              |                                                   | 23                                                      | 184                                            |\n| Total                              | 42,570                                            | 1,565                                                   | 16,969                                         |\n\n- 1 WIBOR transition plans became concrete in 2022 and therefore no comparatives for 2021 are included.\n\nFor derivatives linked to USD LIBOR, the conduct risk is limited as the majority are transacted with clearing houses, which will transition through a standardised exercise in the second quarter of 2023.

The policy regarding these exposures is briefly explained below.\n\n## Governance - Core banking business (*)\n\nEvery business unit hedges the FX risk resulting from core banking business activities into its base currency. Consequently, assets and liabilities are matched in terms of currency.\n\n## Governance - FX translation result (*)\n\nING's strategy is to protect the CET1 ratio against adverse impact from FX rate fluctuations, while limiting the volatility in the profit and loss account due to this CET1 hedging and limiting the RWA impact under the regulatory framework. Hedge accounting is applied to the largest extent possible. Taking this into account, the CET1 ratio hedge can be achieved by deliberately taking foreign currency positions equal to certain target positions, such that the CET1 capital and risk-weighted assets are equally sensitive in relative terms to changing FX rates.\n\n## Risk profile - FX translation result (*)\n\nThe following table presents the currency exposures in the banking books for the most important currencies for the FX translation result. Positive figures indicate long positions in the respective currency. As a result of the strategy to hedge the CET1 ratio an open structural FX exposure exists.\n\nTo measure the volatility of the CET1 ratio from FX rate fluctuations, different metrics are used including the CET1 Ratio-at-Risk. The impact is controlled via the Solvency and Market Risk Banking Book RAS.\n\n## EBA Structural FX Guidelines\n\nEBA guidelines on structural FX positions became effective in 2022. Upon permission from the competent authorities, certain currency positions are being excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions under CRR article 352(2). The resulting impact is presented in the Pillar 3 disclosure .\n\n## Foreign currency exposures banking books (*)\n\n| in \u20ac million      | Foreign Investments   | Foreign Investments   |        | Hedges   | Net exposures   | Net exposures   |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                   | 2022                  | 2021                  | 2022   | 2021     | 2022            | 2021            |\n| US dollar 1       | 10,470                | 8,218                 | -2,376 | -99      | 8,093           | 8,119           |\n| Pound sterling    | 1,364                 | 1,593                 | -58    |          | 1,306           | 1,592           |\n| Polish zloty      | 2,714                 | 2,761                 | -321   | -142     | 2,393           | 2,620           |\n| Australian dollar | 3,781                 | 3,774                 | -2,673 | -2,511   | 1,108           | 1,263           |\n| Turkish lira      | 750                   | 729                   |        |          | 750             | 729             |\n| Chinese yuan      | 1,871                 | 1,976                 |        | -107     | 1,871           | 1,869           |\n| Russian rouble    | 391                   | 256                   |        | -174     | 392             | 82              |\n| Other currency    | 5,740                 | 5,860                 | -3,761 | -3,453   | 1,979           | 2,407           |\n| Total             | 27,081                | 25,167                | -9,189 | -6,486   | 17,892          | 18,681          |\n\nHyperinflation accounting and goodwill impairment had limited impact on the Turkish lira FX exposure to the CET1 Ratio.

Local offices are responsible for the management of the equity investment positions. Financial Risk is responsible for monitoring the regulatory capital for equity investments on a monthly basis and acts independently from ING/local management when monitoring these positions.\n\n## Risk profile (*)\n\nEquity price risk arises from the possibility that an equity security's price will fluctuate, affecting the values of the equity security itself as well as other instruments whose value react similarly to the particular security, a defined basket of securities, or a securities index. ING's equity exposure mainly consists of the investments in associates and joint ventures of \u20ac1,500 million (2021: \u20ac1,587 million) and equity securities held at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) of \u20ac1,887 million (2021: \u20ac2,457 million). The value of equity securities held at FVOCI is directly linked to equity security prices with increases/decreases being recognised in the revaluation reserve. Investments in associates and joint ventures are measured in accordance with the equity method of accounting and the balance sheet value is therefore not directly linked to equity security prices.",

These positions are often a result of transactions with clients and may benefit from short-term price movements. In 2022, ING continued its strategy of undertaking trading activities to develop its client-driven franchise and deliver a differentiating experience by offering multiple market and trading products.\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nThe Financial Markets Risk Committee (FMRC) is the market risk committee that, within the risk appetite set by the ALCO Bank, sets the market risk limits both on an aggregated level and on a desk level. Financial Risk/ Trading Risk Management (FR/ TRM) advises both FMRC and ALCO Bank on the market risk appetite of the trading activities.\n\nWith respect to the trading portfolios, TRM focuses on the management of market risks of Wholesale Banking (mainly Financial Markets) as this is the only business line within ING where trading activities take place. Trading activities include facilitation of client business and market making. TRM is responsible for the development and implementation of trading risk policies and risk measurement methodologies, and for reporting and monitoring risk exposures against approved trading limits. TRM also reviews trading mandates and global limits, and performs the gatekeeper role in the product review process. Trading activity is systematically reviewed and positioned against the mandates are assessed jointly by the first and second lines of defence.\n\n## Risk measurement (*)\n\nING uses a comprehensive set of methodologies and techniques to measure market risk in trading books: Value at Risk (VaR) and Stressed Value at Risk (SVaR), Incremental Risk Charge (IRC), and Event Risk (stress testing). Systematic validation processes are in place to validate the accuracy and internal consistency of data and parameters used for the internal models and modelling processes.\n\nAs of June 2022, ING has received an official permission from the ECB to perform offsetting of positions with the exception of Ukraine, Russia and Turkey. Hence the regulatory capital numbers reported from Q2 2022 onwards, are calculated with offsetting for all base entities excluding Ukraine, Turkey  and Russia.\n\n## Value at Risk (*)\n\nTRM uses the historical simulation VaR methodology (HVaR) as its primary risk measure. The HVaR for market risk quantifies, with a one-sided confidence level of 99%, the maximum overnight loss that could occur in the trading portfolio of ING due to changes in risk factors (e.g. interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, implied volatilities) if positions remain unchanged for a time period of one day.\n\nNext to general market movements in these risk factors, HVaR also takes into account market data movements for specific moves in e.g. the underlying issuer or securities. A single model which diversifies general and specific risk is used. In general, a full revaluation approach is applied, while for a limited number of linear trading positions and risk factors in commodity and equity risk classes a sensitivity-based approach is applied. The potential impact of historical market movements on today's portfolio is estimated, based on equally weighted observed market movements of the previous year (260 days). When simulating potential movements in risk factors, depending on the risk factor type, either an absolute or a relative shift is used.\n\nThe data used in the computations is updated daily. ING uses HVaR with a one-day horizon for internal risk measurement, management control, and backtesting, and HVaR with a 10-day horizon for determining regulatory capital. To compute HVaR with a ten-day horizon the one-day risk factor shifts are scaled by the square root of ten and then used as an input for the revaluation. The same model is used for all legal entities within ING with market risk exposure in the trading portfolio.\n\n## Limitations (*)\n\nHVaR has some limitations: HVaR uses historical data to forecast future price behaviour, but future price behaviour could differ substantially from past behaviour. Moreover, the use of a one-day holding period (or ten days for regulatory capital calculations) assumes that all positions in the portfolio can be liquidated or hedged in one day. In periods of illiquidity or market events, this assumption may not hold. Also, the use of a 99 percent confidence level means that HVaR does not take into account any losses that occur beyond this confidence level.\n\n## Backtesting (*)\n\nBacktesting is a technique for the ongoing monitoring of the plausibility of the HVaR model in use. Although HVaR models estimate potential future trading results, estimates are based on historical market data. In a backtest, the actual daily trading results (excluding fees and commissions) is compared with the one-day HVaR.",

        "page_content": "Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nRisk management\n\n- > Market risk\n\nIn addition to using actual results for backtesting, ING also uses hypothetical results, which exclude the effects of intraday trading, fees, and commissions. When an actual or a hypothetical loss exceeds the HVaR, an 'outlier' occurs. Based on ING's one-sided confidence level of 99%, an outlier is expected once in every 100 business days.\n\nOn an overall level in 2022, there were five outliers for hypothetical P&L and three outliers for actual P&L. The actual and hypothetical outliers occurred during the past one year concentrated in 1Q2022 mainly due to large moves in Russian credit default swaps and Rouble volatility.\n\n## Stressed HVaR (*)\n\nThe Stressed HVaR (SVaR) is intended to replicate the HVaR calculation that would be generated on the bank's current portfolio with inputs calibrated to the historical data from a continuous 12-month period of significant financial stress relevant to the bank's portfolio.\n\nTo calculate SVaR, ING uses the same model that is used for 1DHVaR, with a ten-day horizon. The data for the historical stress period used currently includes the height of the credit crisis around the fall of Lehman Brothers, and this choice is reviewed regularly. The historical data period is chosen so that it gives the worst scenario loss estimates for the current portfolio. The same SVaR model is used for management purposes and for regulatory purposes. The same SVaR model is used for all legal entities within ING with market risk exposure in the trading portfolio.\n\n## Incremental risk charge (*)\n\nThe Incremental risk charge (IRC) for ING is an estimate of the default and migration risks for credit products (excluding securitisations) in the trading book, over a one-year capital horizon, with a 99.9% confidence level. Trading positions (excluding securitisations) of ING, which are subject to specific interest rate risk included in the internal model approach for market risk regulatory capital, are in scope of the IRC model. By model choice, equity is excluded from the model. For the calculation of IRC, ING performs a Monte-Carlo simulation based on a multi-factor t-copula. In the multi-factor IRC model the supervisory asset correlations are no longer applicable and the calibration of the correlations are based on historical market data. The rating change is simulated for all issuers over the different liquidity horizons (i.e. time required to liquidate the position or hedge all significant risks) within one year. Movements across different rating categories and probabilities of default are governed by a credit-rating transition matrix. An internal transition matrix along with internal LGDs is used, to comply with the consistency requirement. The financial impact is then determined for the simulated migration to default, or for the simulated migration to a different rating category, based on LGD or credit spread changes, respectively.\n\nThe liquidity horizon has been set to the regulatory minimum of three months for all positions in scope. ING reviews the liquidity horizons on a yearly basis, based on a structured assessment of the time it takes to liquidate the positions in the trading portfolio.\n\n## Stress testing and event risk (*)\n\nStress testing and event risk are valuable risk management tools. In addition to the bank-wide stress test framework as described in the stress-testing section, FI-FM Risk performs additional assessments, specific to the trading book, with various frequencies: sensitivity analyses (single-risk factor and multi-risk factor), adhoc stress tests (e.g. Covid-19 scenarios) and structured stressed scenario tests under the event risk framework - to monitor market risks under extreme market conditions. Event risk evaluates the bank's financial stability under severe but plausible stress scenarios and assists in decision-making aimed at maintaining a financially healthy going-concern institution after a severe event occurs. Event risk is based on historical as well as hypothetical extreme scenarios. The result is an estimate of the profit and loss caused by a potential event and its worldwide impact for ING.\n\nING's event risk policy is based on a large set of possible stress scenarios per risk type. In stress scenarios, shocks are applied to prices (credit spreads, interest rates, equity, commodities, and FX rates) and volatilities. Depending on the type of the stress test, additional scenario assumptions can be made, for example on correlations, dividends, or recovery rates. For equity products, for example, both a crisis scenario (prices decrease) as well as a bull scenario (prices increase) are assumed. Scenarios are calculated based on events happening independently, jointly by region, or in all countries simultaneously. This way, for each risk type, a large set of scenarios is calculated. The worst scenarios per market are combined across markets by assessing both independent events per market, and the worst events happening in all markets at the same time.\n\n## Other trading controls\n\nHVaR and event risk limits are the most important limits to control the trading portfolios. Additionally, limits have been set on SVaR and IRC. Furthermore, ING uses a variety of other controls to supplement these limits. Position and sensitivity limits are used to prevent large concentrations in specific issuers, sectors, or countries. Moreover, other risk limits are set with respect to the activities in complex derivatives trading. The market risk of these products is controlled by product-specific limits and constraints.\n\n## Risk profile\n\nThe following chart shows the development of the overnight HVaR under a 99 percent confidence level and a one-day horizon versus actual and hypothetical daily trading profits and losses. In calculation of the hypothetical daily profit and loss, the trading position is kept constant and only the market movement is taken into account. The overnight HVaR is presented for the ING trading portfolio from 2020 to 2022.",

The average for all risk classes increased in 2022, especially for FX which increased due to the Russian crisis. The 1D HVaR at the period end of 2021 increased from \u20ac6 million to \u20ac14 million at period end of 2022, due to the market recovery from the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nING doesn't calculate comprehensive risk capital charge and therefore it appears as N/A in the table below.\n\n|                                           | EU MR3: internal model approach values for trading portfolios   | EU MR3: internal model approach values for trading portfolios   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| in \u20ac million                              | 2022                                                            | 2021                                                            |\n| VaR (10 day 99%)                          |                                                                 |                                                                 |\n| 1 Maximum value                           | 79                                                              | 78                                                              |\n| 2 Average value                           | 37                                                              | 27                                                              |\n| 3 Minimum value                           | 15                                                              | 12                                                              |\n| 4 Period end                              | 42                                                              | 18                                                              |\n| Stressed VaR (10 day 99%)                 |                                                                 |                                                                 |\n| 5 Maximum value                           | 147                                                             | 105                                                             |\n| 6 Average value                           | 77                                                              | 80                                                              |\n| 7 Minimum value                           | 47                                                              | 64                                                              |\n| 8 Period end                              | 65                                                              | 74                                                              |\n| Incremental risk charge (99.9%)           |                                                                 |                                                                 |\n| 9 Maximum value                           | 270                                                             | 195                                                             |\n| 10 Average value                          | 113                                                             | 71                                                              |\n| 11 Minimum value                          | 34                                                              | 37                                                              |\n| 12 Period end                             | 76                                                              | 65                                                              |\n| Comprehensive risk capital charge (99.9%) |                                                                 |                                                                 |\n| 13 Maximum value                          | n/a                                                             | n/a                                                             |\n| 14 Average value                          | n/a                                                             | n/a                                                             |\n| 15 Minimum value                          | n/a                                                             | n/a                                                             |\n| 16 Period end                             | n/a                                                             | n/a                                                             |\n\n## Regulatory capital\n\nAccording to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR/CRD IV), regulatory capital (own funds requirements) for market risk can be calculated using the standardised approach or an internal model approach.

The main reduction is coming from SVaR where December 2021 was calculated on a fully deconsolidated basis, while HVaR increased due to the high market volatility in 2022.\n\n## EU MR2-A: Market risk under Internal model approach\n\n| in \u20ac million   | in \u20ac million                                                                 | 2022   | 2022                  | 2021   | 2021                  |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------|--------|-----------------------|\n|                |                                                                              | RWA    | Capital  requirements | RWA    | Capital  requirements |\n| 1              | VaR (higher of values a and b)                                               | 2,732  | 219                   | 1,179  | 94                    |\n| (a)            | Previous day's VaR (VaRt-1)                                                  |        | 49                    |        | 21                    |\n| (b)            | Multiplication factor (mc)  x average of previous 60 working  days (VaRavg)  |        | 219                   |        | 94                    |\n| 2              | SVaR (higher of values a and b)                                              | 3,427  | 274                   | 6,336  | 507                   |\n| (a)            | Latest available SVaR (SVaRt-1))                                             |        | 70                    |        | 112                   |\n| (b)            | Multiplication factor (ms)  x average of previous 60 working  days (sVaRavg) |        | 274                   |        | 507                   |\n| 3              | IRC (higher of values a and b)                                               | 1,934  | 155                   | 1,314  | 105                   |\n| (a)            | Most recent IRC measure                                                      |        | 76                    |        | 94                    |\n| (b)            | 12 weeks average IRC measure                                                 |        | 155                   |        | 105                   |\n| 4              | Comprehensive risk measure (higher of values a, b and c)                     |        |                       |        |                       |\n| (a)            | Most recent risk measure of comprehensive risk measure                       |        |                       |        |                       |\n| (b)            | 12 weeks average of comprehensive risk measure                               |        |                       |        |                       |\n| (c)            | Comprehensive risk measure - Floor                                           |        |                       |        |                       |\n| 5              | Other                                                                        | 516    | 41                    | 200    | 16                    |\n| 6              | Total                                                                        | 8,609  | 689                   | 9,029  | 722                   |\n\n## Sensitivities (*)\n\nAs part of the risk monitoring framework, TRM actively monitors the sensitivities of the trading portfolios. Sensitivities measure the impact of movements in individual market risk factors (foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity and commodity prices) on profit and loss results of the trading positions and portfolios.\n\nThe following tables show the five largest trading positions in terms of sensitivities to foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread risk factor movements. These largest exposures also reflect concentrations of risk in FX risk per currency, interest rate risk per currency, and credit spread risk per country, rating and sector. Due to the nature of the trading portfolios, positions in the portfolios can change significantly from day to day, and sensitivities of the portfolios can change daily accordingly.",

ING incorporates funding and liquidity management in its business strategy and has established a funding and liquidity risk framework to manage risks within pre-defined boundaries.\n\nA high-level overview of the F&L framework is provided in the following chart.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > Funding and liquidity risk\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nFunding and liquidity risk management within ING falls under the supervision of the ALCO Bank function that approves the funding and liquidity risk appetite and subsequently cascades it throughout the organisation. ALCO Bank has delegated the responsibilities concerning the Internal Capital and Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ICLAAP) and documents, as per the ICLAAP framework of ING, to the ICLAAP Committee. The ICLAAP Committee therefore focuses on technical liquidity documents and oversees business processes and deliverables concerning the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). The EB, MBB, staff departments from the CRO and CFO domain as well as Group Treasury have oversight of, and are responsible for, managing funding and liquidity risks.\n\nING's funding and liquidity risk governance is based on the three lines of defence structure to set a clear division of responsibilities as well as an independent risk control challenge process. Group Treasury and the business lines have the first line of defence functions which include management of ING's (regulatory) liquidity and funding position, maintaining access to the professional funding markets and managing the liquidity buffer. As the second line of defence, Financial Risk is responsible for developing and maintaining ING's policies, standards and guidelines on F&L risk management as well as for setting the F&L risk appetite through stress testing and other risk measurement activities. The Finance function is responsible for management information and regulatory reporting related to funding and liquidity risk management. For the third line of defence, Corporate Audit Services is responsible for independently assessing the design, effectiveness and implementation of the Funding and Liquidity framework.\n\n## Funding and liquidity management strategy and objectives (*)\n\nThe main objective of ING's funding and liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund the commercial activities of ING both under normal and stressed market circumstances across various locations, currencies and tenors.\n\nING's funding consists mainly of retail and corporate deposits contributing around 50 percent and 25 percent of total funding, respectively. These funding sources provide a relatively stable funding base. The remainder of the required funding is attracted primarily through a combination of long-term and short-term professional funding. Group Treasury manages the professional funding in line with the F&L risk appetite with the aim of ensuring a sufficiently diversified and stable funding base.\n\n| Funding mix  (*)              | 1     | 1     |\n|-------------------------------|-------|-------|\n|                               | 2022  | 2021  |\n| Funding type                  |       |       |\n| Customer deposits (retail)    | 51  % | 51  % |\n| Customer deposits (corporate) | 23  % | 21  % |\n| Interbank                     | 6  %  | 9  %  |\n| Lending/repurchase agreements | 6  %  | 5  %  |\n| CD/CP                         | 3  %  | 3  %  |\n| Long-term senior debt         | 8  %  | 8  %  |\n| Subordinated debt             | 2  %  | 2  %  |\n| Total                         | 100 % | 100 % |\n\nING's long-term professional funding is well-diversified across maturities and currencies.

        "page_content": "- > Funding and liquidity risk\n\n## Funding and liquidity adequacy and risk appetite (*)\n\nING identifies various key drivers of future liquidity and funding needs on an ongoing basis and through the periodic risk identification process. Taking into consideration the identified drivers, ING regularly assesses its current and future liquidity adequacy and, if deemed necessary, takes steps to further improve ING's liquidity position and to have sufficient counterbalancing capacity. A liquidity adequacy statement is formulated on at least a quarterly basis to substantiate and reflect the management view on the current funding and liquidity position as well as the potential future challenges. The quarterly liquidity adequacy statement is an important part of ING's ILAAP process.\n\nING assesses its F&L adequacy through three lenses - stress, economic and normative:\n\n- \u00b7 Through the stress lens, ING evaluates its ability to withstand a period of prolonged F&L stress for both normative and economic requirements or limits under idiosyncratic, market-related or a combination of idiosyncratic and market-related scenarios, which lead to customer deposit outflows, deterioration of access to funding markets, and lower liquidity value of counterbalancing capacity.\n- \u00b7 Through the economic lens, ING assesses the extent to which its customers, professional counterparties and investors are comfortable in providing deposits and funding in tenors, currencies and instruments necessary to sustainably fund the business (intraday, short-term and long-term) in a going-concern situation.\n- \u00b7 Through the normative lens, ING ascertains that the bank is in the position to meet current and forthcoming home and host regulatory requirements.\n\nFor each lens, ING has established a related set of risk appetite statements which define ING's risk appetite commensurate with the principles of liquidity adequacy. These risk appetite statements are summarised in the next graph.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe F&L risk appetite statements are translated into a number of metrics with appropriate boundaries and instruments which are used to measure and manage ING's funding and liquidity risk. The risk appetite with respect to the stress lens aims to have sufficient counterbalancing capacity under various internally defined stress scenarios. Regarding the economic perspective, an internally defined Stable Funding to Loans (SFtL) ratio (supplemented by other metrics) is used to stimulate a diversified funding base and to prevent overreliance on professional funding. Finally, the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) regulatory metrics are monitored in terms of both ING's risk appetite and normative requirements.",

        "page_content": "Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\n- > Funding and liquidity risk\n\nThe macroeconomic and market environment are also important considerations in ING's funding and liquidity framework. The macroeconomic environment comprises various exogenous factors over which ING has no control, but which may have a material impact on ING's F&L position. The main macroeconomic factors analysed on a regular basis include:\n\n- \u00b7 Global and local economic performance e.g. shifts in GDP, inflation rates, unemployment rates and public deficit/surplus.\n- \u00b7 Changing geopolitical trends.\n- \u00b7 Monetary policy with a focus on the unconventional monetary measures employed by central banks in recent years including the measures taken since the start of the Covid-19 crisis and the more recent period of increased inflation.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory requirements, e.g. understanding the changing regulatory landscape as well as the impact of ING's actions on existing regulatory boundaries.\n\nThe strategic ambitions of ING, together with the design and execution of the funding plan, are assessed under both current and projected market conditions. An emphasis is placed on understanding overall market trends and developments, credit rating changes and peer comparisons.\n\n## Liquidity stress-testing (*)\n\nFunding and liquidity stress-testing forms part of the overall F&L framework. It allows ING to examine the effects of exceptional but plausible future events on ING's funding and liquidity position and provides insight into which entities, business lines or portfolios are vulnerable to which types of risk drivers or scenarios.\n\nThe stress-testing framework encompasses the funding and liquidity risks of the consolidated balance sheet of ING Group, including all entities, business lines as well as on, and off-balance, sheet positions. The Net Liquidity Position (NLP) is the main stress-testing measure and is measured at different time buckets.\n\nThe stress-testing framework considers idiosyncratic, market-wide and combined (idiosyncratic and marketwide) stress scenarios. The design of the framework is based on empirical evidence supplemented by expert judgement. The framework can be extended to additional ad-hoc scenarios. For example, it can be used as input for firm-wide stress-testing and reverse stress-testing.\n\nOutcomes of the stress tests are considered in the key aspects of ING's F&L risk framework and F&L risk management, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk Appetite Framework (through risk appetite statements).\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of the liquidity and funding position.\n- \u00b7 Risk identification and assessment.\n- \u00b7 Business actions (if needed).\n\n- \u00b7 Contingency funding plan.\n- \u00b7 Early warning indicators.\n\nThe funding and liquidity stress- testing framework is also subject to regular internal validation by model validation.\n\nIn line with supervisory expectations, ING's liquidity position is stress tested at least monthly using scenarios that form part of the F&L risk appetite statement. The results of all internal stress scenarios are monitored and assessed on a regular basis. In addition, ad-hoc scenarios based on current economic and market developments are run to determine their potential impacts on the funding and liquidity position of ING. In 2022, this included stress-test scenarios dedicated to the war in Ukraine, inflation, and the impact of monetary tightening. The internal stress scenarios also serve as input for decision making on additional contingency measures.\n\nContingent F&L risks are addressed in the Contingency Capital and Funding Plan with a focus on early warning indicators as well as organisation and planning of liquidity management in times of stress. The contingency funding measures are developed in conjunction with the ING Recovery Plan and are tested on a regular basis.",

        "page_content": "- > Environmental, social and governance risk\n\n## Environmental, social and governance risk\n\n## Introduction\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) risk is defined as the risk of losses arising from any negative financial impact on the institution stemming from the current or prospective impacts of environmental, social or governance factors on the institution's counterparties or invested assets.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe ESG governance is cascaded in the organisation through the ad-hoc ESG committee that is responsible for supervising ING's ESG direction, endorsing and monitoring progress, and advising the MBB on dilemmas. The ESG Sounding Board comprised of senior leaders guides the development and implementation of ESG topics as well as reporting on progress. Further details on ESG risk governance are provided in the section below. The overall ESG governance structure is described in the 'Sustainability at the heart' section.\n\n## Environmental and social risk\n\nESR is a risk function that is part of the second line of defence of ING. The ESR team is responsible for developing policies and procedures. The department takes the lead in communicating them internally and in training internal stakeholders. The ESR team also performs an advisory role to support the deal principals, senior credit officers and approval authorities on individual transactions. The degree of the ESR team engagement in transactions is dependent upon (1) the risk profile of the client, project or business engagement, and (2) ING's exposure. In some locations an ESR delegated adviser may be appointed if mutually agreed by the head of ESR and regional head. Such a role would support the senior credit officer (SCO), who would be responsible for ESR in the region.\n\nCommittees involved in managing environmental and social risks include the Global Credit & Trading Risk Committee (GCTP) and the Global Credit Committee GCC(TA). The GCTP approves the policies, methodologies, and procedures related to ESR. The GCC(TA) approves transactions that entail taking higher environmental and social risk.\n\nThe ESR function encompasses the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Create and maintain policies for sensitive industry sectors.\n- \u00b7 Monitor high-risk clients to assess compliance with sustainability criteria.\n- \u00b7 Assess transactions for environmental and social risk.\n- \u00b7 Spread ESR awareness throughout ING.\n- \u00b7 Participate in European and global advisory groups (e.g. OECD advisory group, steering committee to the Equator Principles, Thun Group of Banks) to help bring all banks to the same high standard.\n\n## Climate risk initiative\n\nThe Climate Risk Initiative (CRI) is a programme aiming to address climate-related and environmental (C&E) risks across our organisation in accordance with the ECB's Guide on C&E risks. It is sponsored by the CRO and overseen by a Steering Committee. The programme addresses regulatory expectations on the topics of governance, business strategy, risk identification and assessment, risk appetite, stress testing and disclosures.\n\nThe governance of the programme was strengthened in early 2022 by extending the Steering Committee with representatives from the Wholesale Banking and Retail Banking business lines, the Risk domain and the Internal Audit function. In addition, a permanent Climate Risk Centre of Expertise (CoE) was established within the Global Sustainability department. This team supports workstreams in the establishment of their roadmaps and reports progress to the Steering Committee, internal and external stakeholders. Furthermore, the CoE collaborates with the ESG risk department on continuously embedding C&E risk management practices across the organisation.\n\n## ESG Risk Centre of Expertise\n\nAfter a strategic review of our risk organisational structure, an ESG Risk Centre of Expertise, reporting to ING's CRO, was formed within the Integrated Risk department. This team aims to ensure that relevant ESG regulations are monitored, assessed and implemented in accordance with the expectations of both supervisors and society. Furthermore, it is responsible for developing the overarching ESG risk framework and policies, setting risk appetite as well as coordinating internal and regulatory ESG risk stress-testing.\n\n## Developments in 2022\n\n## External developments\n\nFollowing the introduction of the EU Taxonomy Regulation in 2020 and the EBA consultation on ESG risks in 2021, global ESG regulation continues to evolve bringing new requirements for companies and also financial institutions to report on and prevent adverse impacts on climate, the environment, and human rights. Three of the key regulatory developments that were initiated in 2022 are:\n\n- \u00b7 The European Commission adopted its proposal for the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) in February 2022. However, the proposal is still under debate and needs to be approved in the trialogue between the EU Parliament, the EU Commission and the Council. The CSDDD is an important component of the European Green Deal, as well as a long-promised initiative in the EU's human rights strategy, and will necessitate strategic and operational changes by businesses globally as it aims to foster sustainable and responsible corporate behaviour and to anchor human rights and environmental",

The CSDDD also applies to financial institutions.\n- \u00b7 Earlier elements of the European Green Deal focused on disclosure: in particular, under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, the Taxonomy Regulation and, most recently, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 16 December 2022, having been formally adopted by the European Parliament and Council of the European Union in November 2022. The CSRD will update and reinforce the EU's Non-Financial Reporting Directive and operate in tandem with the CSDDD. Member states are required to implement the CSRD, and its obligations will start to apply in January 2024.\n- \u00b7 In March 2022, the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed rules to require climate change disclosure in the annual reports and registration statements of public companies registered with the SEC, including any company (domestic or foreign) whose stock is listed on a US stock exchange. Hence, it is yet to be seen whether the proposed rules will eventually be implemented in this respect.\n\n## Environmental and Social Risk\n\n## The ESR framework\n\nING's ESR policy framework helps us make informed choices about how, where and with who we do business. In 2022, the ESR Framework was updated to reflect several minor amendments following the last comprehensive review cycle that took place in June 2021. The new release includes among others amendments to the restrictions applied in the tobacco value chain, additional clarity on some of the requirements for the ESR client assessment process concerning a specific group of companies and the required ESR due diligence for public authority entities. For more information please refer to the ESR Framework on our corporate website ing.com\n\n## ESR in practice\n\nThe ESR policy framework includes standards and best practice guidance for ESR-sensitive sectors. It includes explicit restrictions on activities not in line with ING's values and harmful to people and/or the environment (for example companies involved in clearance of primary forest), which we do not want to finance.\n\nThe way the ESR framework is applied in practice differs per product type. The largest potential environmental and social impacts come from large corporates within our Wholesale Banking (WB) segment. However, we also have screening processes covering the Business Banking segment.\n\nWholesale Banking is therefore the primary focus of our assessments and where we promote active ESR dialogue and knowledge sharing. We have been working with wholesale clients for more than 15 years to support them in understanding and managing their environmental and social impact. A simplified approach,\n\nfollowing the same rationale and principles of the ESR policy framework, applies to ING's business banking clients. The ESR framework minimum requirements are also included in ING's procurement policy and apply to the screening of suppliers of ING's global procurement activities.\n\nThe ESR policy framework is incorporated in ING's KYC policy framework, meaning the ESR client assessment is part of regular client on-boarding and review. The ESR policy framework also triggers a dedicated ESR transaction assessment to corporate clients, which will indicate if transactions are categorised as 'ESR high risk', and thus require a separate in-depth advice from the ESR team.\n\nWhile we have a robust ESR policy framework and made progress in enhancing the automation of the checks and controls in the ESR assessment processes, we acknowledge that we need to improve our processes to further ensure adequacy of data necessary to steer and manage these risks at the level of granularity needed.\n\nOf all WB engagements in scope of the ESR policy framework in 2022, 84 percent were considered ESR lowrisk, seven percent ESR medium-risk and nine percent ESR high-risk. ESR high-risk cases require specialised advice from the global ESR team. The ESR advice assesses the specific product offered and environmental and social impacts associated with it, the sector, operating context and geography of the engagement and other relevant factors. Based on this in-depth research, an advice is given that can only be overruled at Global Credit Committee level. Of the 309 ESR advices given in 2022, which are related to new requests, 48 percent were positive, 35 percent positive subject to conditions and 17 percent negative.\n\nConditions can play an important role in helping clients improve their environmental and social performance and transitioning and ensuring their continued compliance with our ESR policy.\n\nThe ESR team mainly focuses on policy development and transaction advice. However, the team also provides training (both in-person and via webinars) to hundreds of colleagues around the world every year in Risk, front-office, KYC and other teams, so that ESR knowledge is built on and spread.\n\nApart from above, ESR in cooperation with the KYC Academy has developed a new e-learning course on Environmental and Social Risk that was launched at the end of 2021. The purpose of this course is to further increase the awareness and understanding on ESR, outline the risks and the responsibilities of the various internal stakeholders and their roles in the process throughout the whole organisation. Since the roll out of the e-earning tool, more than 8,000 employees worldwide completed the course.\n\n## Other ESG-related initiatives within the bank\n\nOur ESR approach helps our clients and ING gradually enhance the implementation of key standards like the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. But beyond stimulating better environmental and social performance in our own portfolio, ING actively",

ING is active in several EP working groups covering social risks, climate change and scope. ING also co-leads the capacity building and training workgroup, and was elected as a member of the EP Steering Committee in 4Q 2022.\n- \u00b7 Shift Business Learning Programme: is a practitioners group organised and supported by Shift, the leading centre of expertise on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The programme focuses on the corporate responsibility to respect human rights as set out in the UN Guiding Principles. Under the leadership of Shift, a group of companies active in various business sectors including financial institutions share challenges and practices through cross-industry workshops and benefit from tailored strategic support. ING participates in the programme. We are also a member of the Financial Institution Practitioners' Circle, a group for selected practitioners in the financial sector to discuss and share approaches to meeting their responsibility to respect human rights, led by Shift experts.\n- \u00b7 Responsible Business Conduct Agreement: following the Dutch Banking Sector Agreement, a new commitment on responsible business was formed among Dutch banks. Global Sustainability is leading the initiative for ING and the ESR team is aligned for any policy implications or client interactions.\n- \u00b7 Thun Group: was initially established in 2011 to support the integration of the UN Guiding Principles (UNGP) on Business and Human Rights into banking activities. The group consists of bank representatives who informally share best practices among participant members to deepen the understanding and application of the UNGP across the range of different banking activities. ING participated in this year's virtual annual meeting. Amongst other topics, the latest developments on human rights due-diligence obligations and the human rights impacts of climate transition plans were discussed.\n\nBy taking part in the above-mentioned initiatives, we aim to contribute our viewpoint and those of our clients, employees and other stakeholders in support of collective ESG responsibilities that will be driving our further development and maintenance of guidelines  that can serve as a standard for our industry.\n\n## Climate-related and environmental risk management\n\nClimate change is increasingly exposing society to a range of physical risks (both acute and chronic) which are linked to environmental risk. ING's response to combatting climate change and environmental degradation is comprised of the incorporation of the C&E risks incorporated in the bank's risk management and client engagement practices.\n\nManaging C&E risks covers both physical risks (e.g. extreme weather events) and transition risks (e.g. policy changes, shifts in market sentiment and consumer demand). The potential impacts that physical and transition risks could have on households, businesses as well as on the macroeconomy can translate into a\n\nrange of financial risks for ING. The C&E risks can materialise through defaults of businesses and households, increased volatility in equity and commodity markets, disruptions to bank's and customers' operations, and litigation procedures. While ING has an inclusive approach for supporting clients in the transition to a netzero economy, we also manage the financial impact of C&E risks on our clients' activities.\n\nThe C&E risk management practices in ING were subject to the ECB's industry-wide Thematic Review in 2022. ECB published the outcome of their review in a public report and shared their observations with individual banks. After the finalisation of the Thematic Review, ING updated its roadmap for the implementation of ECB's expectations to reflect regulatory observations and agreed remediation timelines.\n\nING endorses the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We continue to develop our approach for C&E disclosures as we build our methodology for identifying, measuring and managing these risks. See also 'The world around us'.\n\n## Risk management\n\n## Risk identification and assessment\n\nIn 2022, we continued to enhance the tools used to identify and assess C&E risks in our portfolio. We created C&E risk sector heatmaps for both WB and Retail Banking. The heatmaps facilitated the materiality assessment of C&E risks by means of scores assigned to transition and physical risk drivers. They also enabled us to understand the magnitude of the C&E risk impact on a sectoral level and pinpointed the sectors with highest C&E risk exposure.\n\nThe C&E risk heatmap is one of the tools used by ING to identify and assess C&E risks. For physical risk, the heatmap lists 26 individual climate-change-related physical risk hazards (both acute and chronic weather patterns) and environmental risk drivers (water stress, resource scarcity, biodiversity loss, pollution and waste). The assessment for transition risk is based on seven risk drivers related to policy and regulatory changes, technological developments, and shifts in market sentiment/ demand. For each of the factors under consideration, a low, medium or high score is based on a qualitative assessment taking into account industry standards following a three to five-year horizon. This assessment is performed at the level of the individual sectors of ING's WB portfolio. The geographic distribution of ING's clients is therefore implicitly taken into account but not assessed on an individual client basis.\n\nThe heatmap assessment for all WB sectors was completed in 2022. The results of the exercise are summarised in the following table. Conducting the assessment for medium and long-term horizons and applying a quantitative counterparty assessment approach, could potentially result in different sector scoring. An assessment for the medium to long term horizons may identify increased exposure to both physical and transition risks. For the identification of a financial impact on ING, we also need to take the readiness of ING's counterparties to address these risks into consideration.",

Aggregated scores are presented. The decrease of the percentages in 2022 follows from further review of the ING portfolio. Given the short term horizon of the assessment, a lower financial impact was identified by various sectors and notably for exposure to physical risk.\n\nThe drivers that are considered medium/high risk by most sectors include extreme weather, resource scarcity, and pollution and waste for physical risk, while changes/adoption of regulatory requirements, environmental ING policy changes/adoption, and reputational risk are mostly selected with respect to transition risk.\n\nMoreover, in the last two years we improved our understanding of the physical risk impact of climate events on our mortgage portfolio. For this assessment we collected granular location data and matched it with individual climate hazards provided by Royal HaskoningDHV, in partnership with Ambiental, a company of Royal HaskoningDHV. Applying this methodology, which puts a relative higher weight on the hydrological risks, we were able to cover 99% of our total residential mortgages book.\n\n## Consolidated heatmap scores for Retail Banking\n\n| Climate risk               | O/S Summary       |                             | Aggregated risk levels   | Aggregated risk levels   |          | Individual   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------|--------------|\n| December 2022 in \u20ac million |                   | Meteorological Geo-physical |                          | hydrological Fire        |          |              |\n| Netherlands                | 113,042  Very low | Low                         | Very low                 | Very low                 | Very low | 38           |\n| Germany                    | 91,166  Very low  | Low                         | Very low                 | Very low                 | Very low | 1,309        |\n| Belgium                    | 40,367  Very low  | Low                         | Low                      | Very low                 | Very low | 83           |\n| Australia                  | 35,195  Very low  | Medium                      | Very low                 | Very low                 | Very low | 6,642        |\n| Spain                      | 21,598  Very low  | Low                         | Very low                 | Very low                 | Very low | 5,231        |\n| Poland                     | 11,906  Very low  | Low                         | Very low                 | Very low                 | Very low | 13           |\n| Italy                      | 7,711  Very low   | Low                         | Low                      | Very low                 | Very low | 3,181        |\n| Romania                    | 2,628  Very low   | Low                         | Low                      | Very low                 | Very low | 1            |\n| Luxembourg                 | 3,167  Very low   | Low                         | Very low                 | Very low                 | Very low | 69           |\n| Other                      | 146               |                             |                          |                          |          |              |\n| Total                      | 326,927  Very low | Low                         | Very low                 | Very low                 | Very low | 16,568       |\n\nThe column 'individual' in the above table represents the total outstanding amount of positions with high risk exposure to individual physical hazards per country.\n\nThe initial assessment was based on the situation per September 2021, of which the outcome was included in the ING Climate Report 2022. The key insights from this assessment are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The aggregated ING global mortgage portfolio is in the very low risk category, <1% of the portfolio has a high risk score.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the portfolio on an individual hazard level, approximately five percent of ING's mortgage book has at least one hazard with a high or very high score.\n- \u00b7 Considering the medium and long-term horizons (2030, 2050 and 2100), the aggregated summary climate risk score is expected to increase most for Italy, Romania, and Spain although they will still remain in 'low risk' score category.\n\nFurthermore, the outcome of ING's bank-wide risk identification and assessment process indicates that climate risk is an emerging risk considering both its likelihood and impact. That means it has the potential to significantly affect our performance but its impact on the organisation is more difficult to assess than other risk drivers. The bottom-up risk identification process in the market risk and funding and liquidity (F&L) risk areas applies pre-defined financial impact materiality thresholds (CET1 ratio for Market Risk, LCR Surplus for F&L risk) to assess the significance of risk drivers. Based on these thresholds, it was concluded that climate change is a financially significant risk driver at ING Group level for both risk types. The main portion of the impact is driven by physical risk (extreme weather conditions) for Funding & Liquidity Risk, and by transition risk (change in policy and regulation due to climate change) for both F&L Risk and Market Risk.",

The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) aims to build a risk management and disclosure framework that can be used by organisations to identify, assess, manage and disclose naturerelated dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. ING supports the TNFD framework and intends to use it as guidance in processes and reporting. We are currently piloting TNFD's draft recommendations on sub-sectors to establish how the framework can be used to manage and report on ING's nature-related risks.\n\nMore detailed information on the risk identification and assessment process can be found in the ING Climate Report 2022.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nWe used the outcomes of the C&E risk heatmap exercise to introduce climate risk elements in the 2022 credit risk appetite. A monitoring mechanism was established for WB at the start of 2022 that limits growth of sub-sectors with a higher exposure to C&E risks while allowing for growth within the overall sector limit. As from July 2022, this mechanism has become binding for WB sectors. For Business Banking (BB) sectors a similar approach was used and the BB credit risk appetite has been in a monitoring period since April 2022. In addition, climate risk has been incorporated into the 2023 market risk banking book risk appetite with the introduction of sensitivity metrics per climate risk category.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nThe regulatory climate risk stress test became part of the biannual ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) stress test in 2022 and ING participated in it. The test consisted of three modules (questionnaire, peer benchmark, bottom-up stress test) aimed at testing our capabilities for assessing climate risk. The most significant impact of this scenario is observed in the credit risk area. The ECB shared its assessment of the climate risk stress test on an aggregated basis in its 2022 Climate Stress Test Report as well as in a bankspecific report. The key challenges of the stress test were related to data. The required attributes, such as GHG emissions and energy performance certificates (EPC), were not available for all counterparties and proxies were used. Other challenges were the modelling of new drivers such as carbon pricing and the longterm horizon of 30 years.\n\nThis regulatory climate stress test, combined with our own climate risk analyses, has been used to enhance ING's internal climate risk stress testing through the creation of an internal combined climate risk stress test. The scenario assumes a prolonged war in Ukraine triggering full stoppage of the Russian gas supply to Europe. Extreme weather events (i.e. fires in Southern Europe and floods in Northern Europe) create additional burdens on European economies and energy consumption patterns change. EU governments step up their efforts to meet the well-below 2\u00b0 Paris Agreement target by creating a New Green Deal which leads to soaring carbon taxes. A disorderly transition follows. Moreover, ING faces greenwashing claims in this stress scenario.\n\n## Challenges\n\nBringing our current work to a more mature level is challenging. To fully understand the financial impact of any physical risk driver, we need to understand the transmission channels from physical risk to financial impact. Mapping out the transmission channels is a complex process which deserves better understanding by both banks and supervisors before making decisions. Another challenge is to translate our insights into specific actions for both current and future customers. In addition, we need to assess C&E risks on a client level. To that end we need to be aware of the clients' readiness to transition to a more sustainable economy and their capacity to adapt.\n\nAdditionally, the key challenge in transitioning from a qualitative to a data-driven approach for the C&E risk heatmaps is two-fold: sourcing data and interpreting data. Since our clients are active in various sectors and geographies, we need to consider multiple data sources that often vary in scope, granularity and quality. Access to real-time, consistent data is a major challenge for risk measurement as definitions and quantification methodologies are constantly evolving. In the absence of comprehensive company data, the use of proxies is necessary to assess C&E risks. Due to these limitations, the integration of quantified inputs into risk modelling has not yet been implemented.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn 2023, we will continue our efforts to evaluate both C&E risks and opportunities by further refining our methodologies. We aim to establish quantitative methodologies for C&E risk identification, materiality assessment and risk appetite setting. This is supported by the integration of C&E risk considerations in risk policies and procedures, our C&E risk identification framework as well as the global ESG data management plan we are developing.\n\nMoreover, access to relevant data is essential to managing nature-related risks. We aim to introduce further granularity in our biodiversity hotspot analysis. In relation to that we are testing an approach for measuring biodiversity impact which we expect to give us more detailed insight into the sectors in our portfolio that are both most dependent on and most impacted by biodiversity.\n\nFurthermore, based on the inventory of training needs of critical functions in front office, risk management, leadership and support areas, ING will launch tailored learning journeys in the course of 2023 to educate staff on the C&E risk topic.",

The remaining 5.4% of our lending activities is related to commercial real estate, which we aim to disclose in the coming annual report. 0.1% of the WB book is excluded from the analysis due to data-quality reasons. Some lending activities are excluded from the analysis as they are out of scope for PCAF (e.g. central banks' exposure and personal loans). The estimation of financed emissions of our equity book, including ING's stake in other companies, is at 0.08 million tonnes of CO2e, reflecting scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions of those companies. We aim to include an assessment of ING's investments in sovereign debt in the next annual report, following the December 2022 update.\n\n## EU Taxonomy\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU Taxonomy) is a published regulation in the Official Journal (Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of 18 June 2020) of the European Commission in June 2020, introducing a reporting\n\nobligation for ING as of January 2022. The EU Taxonomy is part of the European Commission's overarching Green Deal and serves as a common classification system for economic activities. The objective is to identify 'environmentally sustainable' activities that significantly contribute to the six environmental goals set out by the European Commission.\n\nNext to the overarching regulation, the two main concepts of the EU Taxonomy for corporations subject to reporting (i.e. NFRD companies to be CSRD with the introduction of Directive 2022/2464), eligibility and alignment, are introduced in Article 8, Delegated Act EU 2021/2178 (DA).\n\nEligible economic activities are described in the Delegated Act under Article 8 as having high potential to contribute to one or both of the first two environmental goals. The assessment of eligibility does not give an indication if the economic activity is environmentally sustainable. For an economic activity to be aligned, the significant contribution to one of the environmental objectives is required. An assessment of technical screening criteria and confirmation that the assessed activity does not do significant harm to any other environmental objective (while safeguarding minimum standards) ensures that the economic activity is either environmentally sustainable or not. Environmentally sustainable activities will ultimately determine the numerator of the Green Asset Ratio (GAR).\n\nWithin the scope of the DA, all non-financial NFRD companies are required to determine the parts of their turnover, capital and operating expenditures that are eligible for inclusion in the EU Taxonomy disclosure over the financial period of 2022. Financial companies, including ING, use the disclosed information from NFRD companies (financial as well as non-financial corporations) to determine eligibility for unknown use of proceeds. For known use of proceeds, the EU Taxonomy defines activities as eligible via the regulation, where NACE codes are suggested on activity level. With the availability of our counterparties relevant eligibility data on capex and turnover, as well as the eligibility ratio of our financial counterparties and known use of proceeds assessed via NACE codes, ING is able to calculate its own eligibility ratio for (non-) financial corporations. ING reports in accordance with the European Taxonomy regulation in the Annual Report 2022.\n\nOur methodological choices let to an overarching eligibility ratio of 36 percent out of the total covered assets identified on ING's balance sheet based on the turnover ratio of our counterparties. The detailed breakdown below shows how ING assesses balance sheet items through the lens of the European Taxonomy and all assets are based on gross carrying amounts (before adjusting for any loss allowance).",

Hence, we've not included lending exposures to non-NFRD companies in our proportion of taxonomy-eligible economic activities. This means that a significant portion of ING's balance sheet will not be immediately subject to evaluation under the Taxonomy's criteria and is excluded from the eligibility ratio. More information on ING's global strategy to increase sustainable finance exposures and the transition to net-zero is reported in the 'Sustainability at the heart' section.\n\nING's largest eligibility exposure is derived from private households. In line with 2021, we deem our global residential mortgage portfolio to be EU Taxonomy eligible. We excluded home renovation loans that are uncollateralised as well as motor vehicle loans from our eligible exposure. We believe a more integrated due diligence is necessary to ensure the highest data quality when it comes to assessing the underlying screening of a retail customer. For the calculation of unknown use of proceeds, ING uses Bloomberg as a data provider to consolidate capex, turnover and eligibility KPIs from counterparties based on their year-end disclosures of 2021. ING recognises the limitations on the data availability of counterparty eligibility via Bloomberg and have adjusted for the most material ones manually by including the counterparties eligibility ratio. For all other eligible counterparties, ING chooses to report zero eligibility as information is not immediately available.\n\nFor the total eligibility ratio that is being calculated in the table, the turnover ratio of our counterparties is taken into account. As per the EU Taxonomy, financial institutions such as ING, have to calculate the eligibility ratio also based on the capex KPI of non-financial counterparties. We have performed the calculation taking into account the capex ratio, which results in a eligibility ratio of 36 percent.\n\nING sees that EU Taxonomy as a tool to continuously improve and review our underlying criteria and approach to identifying and promoting environmentally sustainable investments. Especially when making investment decisions or developing new products and services, the EU Taxonomy criteria play a vital role. For the upcoming period, ING is focusing on the assessment of alignment criteria as set out in the EU Taxonomy. The identification of aligned assets with the EU Taxonomy will enable ING to assess which activities are ultimately green, enable the further development of transition plans and transparently monitor the progress towards net-zero by 2050 or earlier.",

        "page_content": "- > Non-financial risk\n\n## Non-financial risk\n\n## Introduction\n\nNon-financial risk (NFR) is defined as the risk of financial loss, legal or regulatory sanctions, or reputational damage due to inadequate or failing internal processes, people and systems, a failure to comply with laws, regulations and standards, or external events.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe global head of NFR is responsible for developing the framework of NFR policies and standards within ING, and for monitoring the quality of non-financial risk management in the ING entities. In addition to the global steering provided through the framework, the bank's Non Financial Risk Committee (NFRC), chaired by the Group chief risk officer, is the highest level of the non-financial risk committees within ING and is mandated by the MBB to opine on and approve non-financial risk matters, to monitor or verify whether appropriate action is taken by responsible management and endorse the non-financial risk appetite.\n\n## Non-financial risk management\n\n## Risk categories\n\nING categorises non-financial risks in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Compliance risk is the risk of ING's integrity being impaired, which can result in reputational damage, legal or regulatory sanctions, or financial loss, due to a failure (or perceived failure) to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards. See more in 'Compliance risk'.\n- \u00b7 Information (technology) risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to breaches of confidentiality, integrity or availability of information or a lack of information quality within business processes and/or the supporting IT systems.\n- \u00b7 Continuity risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to business disruptions (loss of people, processes, systems, data, premises).\n- \u00b7 Control risk is the risks of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to ineffective organisational structures and governance procedures (including unclear roles and responsibilities and inadequate reporting structure).\n- \u00b7 Processing risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to failed (transaction) processing (input, execution, output) or failing process management.\n- \u00b7 Unauthorised activity risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to employees performing outside the normal course of their business, intentionally giving unauthorised approvals or overstepping their authority.\n\n- \u00b7 Personal and physical security risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to criminal and environmental threats that might endanger the security or safety of ING personnel at work, people in ING locations, ING assets or assets entrusted to ING, people at ING event locations, or might have an impact on ING organisation's confidentiality, integrity or availability.\n- \u00b7 Employment practice risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to acts that are inconsistent with employment, health and/or safety laws, regulations or agreements, from payment of personal injury claims, or from diversity/discrimination events.\n- \u00b7 Fraud is the deliberate abuse of procedures, systems, assets, data, products and/or services of ING by those who intend to deceitfully or unlawfully benefit themselves and/or others. This definition of fraud is specified in the following two categories of fraud.\n- \u00b7 Sourcing risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions and/or reputational damage resulting from sourced activities (both IT and non-IT, including intra-group sourcing) not staying within ING's risk appetite and not being executed as agreed (with captives or partners), including non-compliance with internal or external regulations.\n\nInternal fraud: acts of fraud which involves at least one internal party performed by or in collusion with an ING employee or agent with the consequence of financial loss, regulatory fines, litigation loss, business disruption and/or reputational damage for ING.\n\nExternal fraud: acts of fraud or scams by individuals and/or parties excluding ING staff (including contractors), with the consequence of financial loss, regulatory fines, litigation loss, business disruption and/ or reputational damage for ING.\n\n## Measurement approach\n\nING uses an internal model in line with the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) to determine the regulatory and economic capital amounts that are necessary to cover potential losses resulting from nonfinancial risks. This model predicts non-financial risk losses by combining a forward-looking and a backwardlooking view on non-financial risk events. ING reports the outcome of its AMA model quarterly.\n\n## Main developments in 2022\n\n## Personal and physical security\n\nThe war in Ukraine has had a fundamental impact on the lives of the families of more than a 100 Ukrainian colleagues and the way in which our Ukrainian operations are being conducted. Nevertheless, the impact of the war on ING's non-financial risk profile and on operational event losses continues to be limited thanks to an extensive set of mitigating measures which ING took over the past year.",

Both the frequency and the intensity of attacks continue to increase on a global scale. The sophistication and implications of ransomware attacks are of particular concern in the threat landscape. The continuous enhancement of the control environment to protect from, and detect and respond to, e-banking fraud, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), targeted attacks and more specific ransomware attacks is of the highest priority. Based on regular scenario analysis done in ING's first line of defence, additional controls continue to be embedded in the organisation as part of the overall internal control framework and are continuously re-assessed against existing and new threats. See also 'The world around us' and 'How we make a difference'.\n\nIn addition, ING continues to strengthen its global cybercrime and fraud resilience through collaboration with financial industry peers, law enforcement authorities, government (e.g. National Cyber Security Centre) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Additionally, through ING's Global Fraud Management team, which brings together fraud management experts from across domains, there is a central responsibility to ensure that ING's business and fraud strategy remains aligned on account fraud threats, market best practices, applicable law and legislation, risk appetite and cost targets.\n\nThe further digitalisation of banking services, increasing electronic exchange of information via different consumer channels, use of and dependency on third-party vendors for services, and the implementation of PSD2 are likely to present ongoing cybercrime-resilience, fraud-management and IT-security challenges, both in the short and medium-term. Criminal actors are targetting financial and sensitive (payment) data, such as customer user credentials outside the traditional banking environment. Sensitive (payment) or personal data can be obtained by criminals via social forums such as WhatsApp and by screen scraping user credentials when a fallback procedure within PSD2 is allowed. In 2022, these challenges have further increased with more sophisticated phishing attempts and improved social engineering fraud attempts.\n\nDealing with current and emerging fraud threats, especially given the ever-increasing use of digital and online banking, effectively requires continuous improvement of fraud management capabilities such as real-time transaction monitoring and response capabilities. Furthermore, better alignment and standardisation is needed for cross-border fraud management across ING and related platforms. With legislation such as EBA PSD2 and the continuing emphasis on duty of care, financial institutions are becoming more and more responsible for losses incurred by clients and are taking on more of the burden of reclaiming those losses.\n\n## Data risk management\n\nData, whether customer, financial, risk or other business, - is core to ING's purpose. Data leads to insights and insights empower people to stay a step ahead in life, and in business. In 2022, the ING Data Strategy was aligned under a new chief data office, next to a newly organised COO/Data Operations domain to better create a single vision and governance for data, empowering business users with a harmonised foundation. This encompasses further embedding data functions and improving (bank-wide) data operations in ING's way of working, and simplifying, standardising and modernising its technology and data platforms. Recognising that data risk is an important risk for the bank, ING has created a holistic view and continues to build awareness of how ING manages risks around data, including personal data protection, data security, data quality and data ethics.\n\n## Identity and access management (IAM)\n\nIAM remains one of the focus areas of ING and an important element in our control framework to prevent and mitigate the risk of unauthorised access to IT systems and the data processed and stored therein. This is done by enforcing IAM global processes and controls, which are periodically reviewed and tested. These processes and controls are supported by technologies, tooling and practices managed by a dedicated IAM team in the Chief Information Security Office (CISO), which aim to ensure improvements are identified to address developments both inside and outside ING. In 2022, ING continued to improve, with attention given to tooling, standardisation and harmonisation of processes, workflows and automation of IAM controls.\n\n## Personal data protection\n\nOn 25 May 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective. ING is bound by the GDPR which affords greater protection to individuals and requires more control on data and transparency regarding the use of data by companies. In 2022, ING continued to further enhance the data protection of customers and employees. See also 'The world around us'.",

        "page_content": "- > Compliance risk\n\n## Compliance risk\n\n## Introduction\n\nCompliance risk is defined as a threat posed to ING's standing resulting from failure to act in line with applicable laws and regulations, internal rules (including ING's Orange Code and global Code of Conduct) and/or societal expectations applicable to the bank's services and activities. A failure to adequately mitigate compliance risk may lead to damage to ING's reputation and/or legal/regulatory sanctions, and/or financial loss.\n\nThe mission of Compliance is to support ING in conducting its business activities in line with applicable laws and regulations, taking into account ING's internal code of conduct and societal expectations. Compliance wants to drive compliance risk management by desire and design throughout the organisation, unleashing the power of our data, risk expertise, and ING's workforce to keep the bank safe and sound, and help drive new and sustainable ways of doing business.\n\nWithin ING, compliance risks are defined as those risks that are within the scope of the ING Compliance Risk Catalogue. The following risk categories apply:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial crime risk refers to the risks of the bank's products and services being abused for illicit purpose generating or disguising financial and/or economic crimes (FEC).\n- \u00b7 Conduct risk refers to the compliance risks arising from potential or perceived misconduct by ING or its employees towards its customers, market integrity, business partners, employees and other stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Organisational risk refers to the compliance risks arising from actual, potential or perceived flaws in the way that ING is organised and structured including its regulatory and reporting framework.\n- \u00b7 Data protection (personal data protection, data retention) risk refers to the personal data protection risk of financial loss, (regulatory fines, reputational damage) due to not protecting the personal data rights of individuals as required, so as to data retention risk, on having the records being destroyed too soon or retained too long.\n\nClimate and ESG-related compliance risks are in the process of being added to the Compliance Risk Catalogue where appropriate in close collaboration with internal stakeholders with the aim of ensuring that roles and responsibilities with regard to identifying, assessing, managing and overseeing these risks are fully aligned with ING's organisation globally.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Compliance organisation (comprised of three roles: Group Compliance, geographical compliance and country compliance) is part of ING's second line of defence. Group Compliance sets the methodologies and\n\nminimum standards for the bank. Geographical compliance (Wholesale Banking/Market Leaders/Challengers & Growth Markets) together with the functional lines in the countries are responsible for the execution of these standards, within the risk appetite set. Compliance is tasked with instructing, advising, challenging and having oversight of the first line of defence in their management of compliance risks and has an active role in raising awareness (via training and communication), influencing and stimulating a sound compliance risk culture. The scope of the compliance risks is outlined in the ING Compliance Charter.\n\nCompliance is headed by the chief compliance officer (CCO), who reports directly to the CRO. The CCO has direct access to the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. The CCO and the chairman of the Risk Committee had regular bilateral consultations in 2022.\n\n## OneCompliance strategy\n\nAs a global bank in a fast-changing world we want to do the right thing to be safe, secure and compliant for our customers and for society. We achieve this by living up to the OneCompliance strategy that was launched in 2019.\n\nThe OneCompliance strategy is a multi-year, global compliance strategy and transformation programme that is based on a framework that aims to help ING manage compliance risks consistently across the organisation. In 2022, work continued on the following programme goals: a global identity and risk view allowing people to assess risks in a uniform way; a single, risk-based monitoring methodology to accelerate improvements in addressing risks; simplified work processes through a uniform framework, to allow people to focus on what matters; the necessary skills and resources to deliver at the desired quality; intuitive, actionable and insightful management information and a global dashboard to take smart decisions and keep oversight on steering within risk appetite and steering our global direction to support everyone in Compliance. As we operate in a dynamic and challenging environment we are continuously learning and improving while getting to a more sustainable and mature level within the Compliance department.\n\n## Financial crime risk\n\nFinancial crime risk results from illicit activity in the form of money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, sanctions evasion, fraud and customer tax offences and other predicate offences to money laundering such as environmental crimes and human trafficking. It arises in the course of ING's day-to-day banking operations if our customers, employees or third parties undertake or facilitate financial crime, or if our products and services are misused for illicit purposes to generate or disguise financial crime.\n\nWe have zero tolerance for deliberately or knowingly facilitating financial crime - keeping ING safe, secure and compliant remains a top priority to protect our business and society at large from financial crime and its corrosive effects upon individuals and communities.",

        "page_content": "Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\n- > Compliance risk\n\n## Financial crime risk management\n\nThe bank's NFRC, chaired by ING's CRO, is the principal risk management forum where, among other things, financial crime risk is discussed. This committee reviews, where appropriate, escalates key financial crime topics, threats and risks across ING to the EB and MBB. On KYC (know your customer), the Global KYC Committee), chaired by ING's COO, is mandated by the MBB to steer, prioritise and approve KYC-related topics undertaken across ING, and to oversee compliance with the relevant laws and regulations and internal rules related to KYC. The day-to-day responsibility for the oversight of ING's compliance with our legal and regulatory obligations in relation to financial crime risk resides with the global head Financial Crime Compliance, who reports to ING's chief compliance officer, with oversight by the CRO.\n\nWe believe all of our people have a role to play in the fight against financial crime. Having a robust and sound risk culture embedded in our day-to-day way of working is a foundational element of our financial crime risk control environment. We define the accountabilities and responsibilities of our workforce in accordance with the three lines of defence model, considering our business, geographical and functional structure.\n\nAs an organisation, we're committed to meeting our legal and regulatory requirements and the standards we also expect from ourselves. ING remains subject to (regulatory) investigations and scrutiny in certain jurisdictions, and we're committed to executing and implementing the identified enhancements required to our financial crime risk framework in a sustainable way for the longer-term.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\nING strives to play its part in contributing to the safeguarding of the financial system against illicit financial activity, in the context of heightened and changing regulatory expectations and as financial crime risks continue to evolve. To fulfil our responsibility as a global financial institution in combatting financial crime, we believe it is essential to comply with anti-money laundering and to counter the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), establish a reasonable and risk-based control framework to mitigate financial crime risk, and to seek to provide useful information to relevant government agencies. We also believe it is important to respond swiftly and proactively to new financial crime threats and techniques (which can be increasingly sophisticated as financial criminals harness and misuse new technological capabilities) as well as to relevant media reporting.\n\nTo mitigate financial crime risks, we apply a framework of preventative and detective systems and controls, underpinned by policy, procedures and related control standards across our global business in all locations where we operate. In 2022, we remained focused on our Financial Economic Crime Controls Maturity Programme (FCMP) (see also 'Know your customer (KYC)') by continuing to strengthen our financial crime risk management framework and supporting sustainable remediation of known issues. At the same time, we acknowledge that the continuous maturing of the financial crime risk management framework, as well\n\nas other developments such as regulatory and legislative changes, will continue to require our attention and commitment in future years.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to enhance the annual Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA) across our global footprint, which assesses inherent and residual integrity risks related to financial crime and the effectiveness of the associated processes and controls ING has in place. This provides insights into the financial crime integrity risks that ING may be exposed to, so we can appropriately manage these risks in accordance with our risk appetite. Our risk-based surveillance (screening and monitoring) controls are also designed to identify activity that may require additional investigation or other risk management actions, and where appropriate, reporting to the relevant authorities.\n\nWe monitor our compliance in relation to financial crime risk and our tolerance levels on a regular basis against a set of quantitative and qualitative financial crime risk appetite metrics that are approved by the Non-Financial Risk Committee.\n\n## Bribery and corruption\n\nCorruption fuels instability and conflict and curbs economic growth. It undermines business confidence and corporate integrity, hinders fair business competition and harms international trade. Bribery and corruption risks are part of our non-financial risk framework and are included in the client and third-party due diligence and monitoring measures in our financial crime risk management framework. We have continued to structurally strengthen our response to bribery and corruption risks in key areas as part of our multi-year enhancement programme and FCMP, and in support of our zero-tolerance approach for bribery and corruption.\n\n## Customer tax compliance\n\nING remains committed to its reporting obligations under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and Common Reporting Standards (CRS). Throughout 2022, we have worked to improve the quality of reports provided to tax authorities and reacted to the implementation of mandatory disclosure rules for EU jurisdictions (implemented via the amendment to Directive 2011/16 (DAC6)). We also continue to focus on customer tax integrity, as we do not want to facilitate or be involved in tax-related financial crime through servicing customers.\n\n## Key developments in 2022\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\n2022 saw the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As well as the devastating political, social and economic consequences of the war, it has also had an impact on the nature and scale of FEC-related threats. Since the outbreak of the war, millions of refugees have fled the country making them vulnerable to exploitation by",

There has also been an increase in the scale of illegal trafficking of weapons.\n\nDuring 2022, financial institutions have had to respond to new and complex targeted sanctions, but also remain vigilant to elevated and increased levels of various other financial crimes threats and risks. We have produced regular and actionable guidance on evolving financial crime developments resulting from the war that has been shared across ING, including potential scenarios to identify where these risks may manifest and datapoints that may detect unusual transactions.\n\n## Sanctions related developments\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally changed the global and political landscape, resulting in a world-wide response, whereby new and significant sanctions packages were imposed against Russia and Belarus since the end of February 2022. More than 3000 new sanctions have been implemented. The unprecedented velocity and scope of sanctions imposed by the international community has resulted in a highly complex and changing compliance environment for global financial institutions.\n\nThe international community is leveraging their sanction tools in response to the escalation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, however sanction measures of the US, UK and EU can differ in their scope and these differences present complex operational and legal challenges for business that operate globally or facilitate global trade and payment activities. These complexities and challenging require careful navigation.\n\nAccordingly, as part of ING's know your customer and compliance risk governance and procedures, ING is continuously monitoring the situation to stay abreast on all relevant updates to implement effective and appropriate additional control measures and to manage the increased risk and financial impacts of these developments.\n\nOperationally, the impact of these enhancements has resulted in the need for additional staff members to review and apply greater scrutiny of transactions alerted for heightened risk of noncompliance with applicable sanctions.\n\n## Covid-19 and cost of living\n\nOpportunistic criminals were quick to exploit the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and continue to do so as economic uncertainty and cost of living increases. During 2022, we continued to focus on protecting customers from fraud and cyber-related crimes, as well as identifying evolving criminal money laundering methods.\n\n## Evolving external landscape\n\nFinancial institutions continue to face considerable regulatory scrutiny in relation to detecting and preventing financial crime, and increasing costs of compliance. In addition, the complexity of the regulatory landscape continues to give rise to potential tension between data privacy (GDPR), anti-money laundering/ counter terrorism financing and anti-corruption laws and regulations. This includes requirements for sharing information within ING in relation to financial crime risks to manage our risk exposure, while also complying with relevant data legislation (which can differ significantly depending on jurisdiction). Society's expectations with regard to financial institutions' accountability for safeguarding the integrity of the financial system also create an increasingly demanding environment.\n\nWe take our gatekeeper responsibility seriously. We believe that by proactively participating in publicprivate partnerships and collaborating with other banks, as well as investing in new and innovative technological capabilities, we can be more effective in the collective fight against financial crime.\n\n## Payment service providers\n\nThe position of payment service providers (PSPs) in the financial service industry has become prominent and permanent over the years. PSPs face continuous challenges to demonstrate compliance with industry standards and recommendations, such as the guidance provided by the Wolfsberg Group and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on payment transparency. Having limited transparency on transactions initiated through the different payment platforms increases the challenge of monitoring whether PSPs and banks are potentially misused to facilitate tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nING will continue to contribute to dialogue with PSPs, regulators and industry bodies on these challenges and aim to obtain the required transparency on payment information. This supports compliance with the applicable laws and regulations and internal policies and instructions as well as monitoring to ensure that ING stays within its financial crime risk appetite.\n\n## EU AML/CFT legislative package\n\nIn mid-2021 the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals aimed at strengthening anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) rules. This included amendments to existing legislation to tackle emerging challenges linked to technological innovations, such as virtual assets, as well as the increasingly global nature of terrorist organisations. It also included centralisation of EU AML/CFT supervision (the European Anti-Money Laundering Authority) and establishing a single EU AML/CFT rulebook, which provides financial institutions with harmonised and directly applicable AML/CFT rules. Though not yet finalised, ING welcomes this harmonisation, which removes a degree of regulatory complexity. ING has participated in workstreams and analysis prepared by global banking associations such as the Dutch Banking Association and the European Banking Federations to assist us in assessing the potential impact of the AML legislative package on the bank.",

ING actively participates in related DNB workshops to enhance the effectiveness of fighting financial crime by focusing on higher risks (prioritising these in terms of capacity allocation; i.e. do more where necessary and less where possible).\n\n## Virtual assets\n\nBlockchain technology, which underlies most virtual assets, continued to evolve and be accepted by the public. Crypto assets can be used for legal and illegal purposes. In 2022, global regulators, private industry and policy makers continued to focus on where they may be used for illegal activity, including money laundering, evasion of capital and sanctions, controls and payments in ransomware attacks. While there has been maturity in understanding how virtual assets ecosystems may be potentially abused for financial crime purposes, they continue to pose challenges for financial institutions.\n\nWe continued to contribute to ongoing dialogue with regulators on this topic throughout 2022. We have created and shared guidance on the evolving risks to enhance the knowledge and understanding of the virtual-assets landscape and its convergence with financial crime risk and we strive to ensure that ING remains a safe and compliant bank.\n\n## Environmental crime\n\nEnvironmental crime is among the most profitable criminal enterprises and covers a wide range of unlawful activities including the illegal wildlife trade, the illegal extraction and trade of forestry and natural resources as well as illegal waste and illegal fisheries crime. There is also an increasing interface between environmental crimes and other crimes, most notably corruption, human trafficking and modern slavery and trade-based fraud. Throughout 2022, the topic has gained significant attention from regulators, law enforcement and non-governmental organisations across the globe due to the scale, nature and cost of the crime as well as the damaging effects they have on society.\n\nIn 2022, we examined the risks arising from the illegal trade in wildlife and in waste and how to identify suspicious financial flows and actors linked to them. We continued our membership of the United for Wildlife Financial Taskforce, which also covers illegal forestry trade, We work with private, public and thirdsector partners to detect, disrupt and prevent illegal crimes in the wildlife and forestry trade.\n\n## Know Your Customer (KYC)\n\nKnow your customer and financial crime compliance play a major role in ensuring we only engage and do business with people and entities that meet regulatory requirements. Knowing who we do business with is vital to keeping ING safe, secure and compliant. As part of our ongoing anti-money laundering efforts, we continuously assess relationships with customers and monitor and screen transactions. Potentially unusual or suspicious transactions are reviewed and, where applicable, reported to the relevant authorities.\n\nWe are continuously working to further strengthen the KYC processes across the bank as and where required. This includes enhancing customer due diligence files and making structural improvements in frameworks, processes and systems.\n\n## Global approach\n\nING takes a global approach in its KYC improvement activities. In 2022, ING updated its KYC policies in line with external regulatory developments in anti-money laundering and financial sanctions and continued substituting local technology with centralised global technology enabling us to further improve the way we onboard, monitor and screen customers using a standardised approach across the world. In 2022, among other things, we progressed with the implementation of Global Transaction Monitoring tooling (with the last migration planned to take place in 2023), designed and implemented a global standard Quality Management Frameworks and further centralised operations, bundling expertise in dedicated operational hubs.\n\n## KYC policy framework\n\nThe KYC policy and related control standards (the KYC policy framework) set the minimum requirements and control objectives for all ING entities to guard against involvement in financial crime activity. The KYC policy framework reflects relevant national and international laws, regulations, guidance documents and guidelines from national, European and international authorities, (supra)national risk assessments and industry standards.\n\n## Public-private partnerships\n\nTo continue to be more effective in our efforts to counter financial economic crime, we work closely with our peers, regulators and law enforcement.\n\nThroughout 2022, ING continued to work in a consortium of Dutch banks on Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL). The initiative, which monitors transactions within a combined database, is operational and intersecting with thematic areas of focus for law enforcement, enabling us to better understand potential criminal money flows, and improve our detection controls in response to these insights. In the Netherlands, ING also works with the government's Financial Intelligence Unit and three other banks in the Fintell Alliance.\n\nIn Germany, ING joined the public-private partnership Anti-Financial Crime Alliance (AFCA) in 2020 to foster mutual exchange of information within the financial system. The alliance consists of approximately 30 members, among them BaFin as regulator, the FIU, other public authorities, the largest financial institutions as well as representatives from the non-financial sector. ING in Germany continues to contribute in various forums to the further development of industry-wide standards (e.g. related to digitalisation and information sharing as well as to SAR filing (suspicious activity report) obligations.",

We want to empower our workforce with the skills and knowledge they need to fight financial crime and encourage them to speak up if they have concerns relating to financial crime risk management.\n\nIn 2022, our (mandatory) training programme for KYC staff continued, including our partnership with the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS) to develop and provide tailored, certified training. The ACAMS training portfolio focuses on learning paths that provide professional foundational skills or advance expertise in a range of topics including customer due diligence, screening, transaction monitoring and sanctions. Over 27,000 ACAMS trainings were enrolled in 2022. Our internal training programme for 2022 included additional focus on further strengthening our risk management mindset.\n\nFollowing work in 2021, bottom-up initiatives have been further developed into scalable solutions that address behavioural challenges related to decision-making, ownership and group dynamics. Examples are the 'feedback loop' and 'discover and connect', which is a way to connect employees across the different functions through department visits. Furthermore, as part of a top-down approach, senior leadership came together to discuss drivers and behavioural changes needed to improve decision making and collaboration throughout the entire KYC chain.\n\nRead more on behavioural risk in 'Risk culture'.\n\n## Conduct compliance and ethics\n\nConduct risk is defined by anything we do that can result either in customer detriment or an impact to market integrity. Conduct compliance and ethics includes client protection and transparency (treating customers fairly), market conduct (including market manipulation), anti-competitive conduct, conflicts of interest and ethics. Ethics risk includes the Orange Code, global Code of Conduct, as well as our Whistleblower framework.\n\n## Treating customers fairly\n\nImprovements to our framework around Markets in Financial Services Directive (MiFID) have continued as planned allowing a more effective client protection and product approval committee (CPAC) framework focussing on investment and financial markets products to both WB and Retail clients. The Capital Markets Recovery Package (CMRP) with regards to MiFID, new ESMA Guidelines on appropriateness and executiononly requirements as well as ESMA's statement on payment for order flow (PFOF) have been implemented. Client protection and product approval governance was simplified to support a global and consistent application of risk appetite when offering investment products and services to our customers whether WB or\n\nRetail, while removing overlap from the MiFID implementation. A particular focus this year for CPAC has been to strengthen central guidance on cryptocurrencies and crypto-linked financial products.\n\nAlongside direct consumer protection requirements as laid down in specific regulations (e.g. MiFID II) ING is bound by local consumer protection laws and has adopted its own minimum standards, such as the Customer Golden Rules. These rules were updated and rolled out globally providing further standardisation across all products, services and jurisdictions. This is further enforced by recent market developments such as increased inflation and interest rates, which require  also requiring specific focus on customers in vulnerable positions. The range of products and services in scope will include mortgages and consumer lending.\n\nTransaction reporting activities continued to improve both in terms of reporting quality and scope through a group-wide governance framework and controls. The upload of the main transaction reporting backlog is now completed. Preparations for future transaction reporting changes are being made, including the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) Refit.\n\nIn relation to insurance products, global policy and controls are in place to align with the EU's Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD).\n\nIn response to the increasing importance of sustainable products for our clients and the need for ESG considerations to form an integral part of our products and services to clients, alongside the development and roll-out of policy on SFDR and ESG-related MiFID II and IDD amendments, measures on developing, selling and promoting sustainable products are being strengthened. Compliance is not an exception and ESG continues to be embedded within the ING organisation across all three lines of defence, strengthening compliance with both regulatory requirements and internal standards.\n\n## Market conduct\n\nMarket conduct risk stems from behaviour that can impact market integrity. Public confidence in smooth functioning markets is crucial for economic growth and wealth. As part of our work in 2022 to strengthen our market conduct framework, global procedures on maintaining information barriers, insider lists and communicating inside information were further improved across ING. Steps have been made towards automating, standardising and centralising our approach to personal account dealing rules across the group. Furthermore, two new e-learnings have been designed on inside information and detecting suspicious orders and transactions, with one already rolled out to targeted employees.",

In 2022, the Conflicts of Interest policy was revised and implemented to further align with the standards as defined by enterprise risk management. The policy incorporates key requirements for both personal and organisational conflicts of interest in line with European Bank Authority Guidelines on Internal Governance. Next to the updated policy, mandatory instructions on conflict-of-interest registers are implemented which provides instructions to identify, assess, mitigate or prevent and record all structural and incidental conflicts of interest.\n\n## Whistleblower\n\nThe programme launched in 2021 to enhance the global whistleblower process has been concluded. In 2022, whistleblowing enhancement activities continued with an emphasis on increasing employee awareness on misconduct reporting. Sanitised whistleblowing data has been shared within the organisation to provide more transparency on the types of concerns employees report and the rapidity of our response.\n\n## Innovation, analytics and digitalisation\n\nIn 2022, we took the strategic decision to adapt our innovation approach and unwind ING Neo. This will bring initiatives closer to our core business and functions, in line with our strategic focus of providing a superior customer experience and putting sustainability at the heart of what we do.\n\nWe continue to harness new and innovative technological capabilities to keep customers safer and to enhance their digital journey with ING. To this end, the Blacksmith solution for KYC has become our default tool for financial institutions and the CoorpID platform, which digitalises the KYC process for corporate clients, is now used in nine countries. Further, our Ventures team has also closed an investment in Sardine which provides AI-enabled KYC, compliance and fraud detection platforms to financial services firms. The initiatives and investments help us to respond swiftly and effectively to the changing regulatory landscape and underlying policies in relation to financial crime.",

Model risk can arise from errors in the development, implementation, use or interpretation of models, or from incomplete or wrong data etc., leading to inaccurate, noncompliant or misinterpreted model outputs.\n\nA model is defined as a quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, financial or mathematical theories, techniques, and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates or whose inputs are partially or wholly qualitative or based on expert judgement.\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nThe head of Model Risk Management (MoRM) reports to the ING Group chief risk officer. The Model Risk Management Committee (MoRMC) is the dedicated authority within ING for model risk management. It is a committee designated by the MBB. It is chaired by the ING Group chief risk officer and co-chaired by the head of MoRM.\n\n## Model lines of defence (*)\n\nING's model risk and control structure is based on the three model lines of defence (MLoD) approach. This approach aims to provide a sound governance framework for model risk management by defining and implementing three different management layers with distinct roles and oversight responsibilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Current model RAS metrics are focused on the most important models for ING: credit risk and other models with elevated supervisory attention. These metrics are reported to the MBB on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Model risk management (MoRM) (*)\n\nThe MoRM policy framework comprises the total set of measures and tools put in place to manage model risk.To enable setting model risk management standards that are proportionate to a model's importance, ING classifies models based on their materiality and reputational risk. The classification determines the depth and extent of the applied model risk management activities, including model validation. During 2022, the MoRM policy framework was updated and enhanced, incorporating ING model data-ethics principles and integrating a risk-based approach to model validation. Next to the generic MoRM policy framework, dedicated model validation frameworks are in place. These set the validation standards for the key model types such as credit, market, liquidity, operational risk, IRRBB, KYC, and other model categories. These frameworks are continuously being enhanced to keep up-to-date with regulatory and technical developments.\n\nOn an aggregated level model risk is monitored via analysis of data from the global model inventory. The insights, from aggregated data analysis, are reported to the MoRMC and to the MBB so that senior management can take well-informed decisions on acceptance or further mitigation of model risk.\n\n## Model lifecycle (*)\n\nThe next figure provides a schematic overview of the model lifecycle, where orange represents the activities of the first MLoD, grey represents the second MLoD and light grey is the third MLoD. The objectives of the different processes are outlined below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInitiation or change : The initiation of the development of a new model or change in an existing model can be triggered by internal or external factors, such as business needs, regulation changes and/or model validation findings.\n\nData collection is the process of defining and collecting data that meets the requirements for model development. The process includes the definition of the data needed and assessment of data availability and data quality.",

The approach to model validation is proportional to the model risk as reflected in the ING model risk classification.\n\nThe objective of the model approval stage is to ensure models are formally approved bye the designated approval authority prior to deployment.\n\nDuring the implementation stage, the model is deployed in a production environment, after completion of required model testing and corresponding approval.\n\nIn the model use stage the model is applied by the users for the specific purpose for which it was designed. The model may only be used after formal approval.\n\nThe objective of model monitoring is to determine if the model is performing as expected by regularly assessing model accuracy and/or predictive ability, considering internal or external developments that may influence model performance. Model performance monitoring begins when a model is deployed for use and continues until the model has officially been decommissioned.\n\nPeriodic validation assesses, on a regular basis, whether a model is still valid for its intended use and if the model is used as intended, taking into consideration any internal or external changes since the last validation. The frequency of periodic validation depends on the model risk, model type and applicable regulation.\n\nA model that is/will no longer be used must be decommissioned .",

It is the risk inherent to strategy decisions, internal efficiency and the business environment. Business risk economic capital is calculated via the variancecovariance methodology for these risks, covering the risk that volume/margins, net fee and commission income, and operating expenses will deviate from the expected expenses and incomes over the horizon of the relevant activities.\n\n## Governance and risk management\n\nING applies an explicit risk appetite statement regarding business risk, focusing on earnings stability and diversification of the business mix. Diversification reduces the risk that volumes and/or margins will suddenly drop due to unexpected changes in the business environment for certain markets and products. Furthermore, the underlying risk types (expense risk, volume-margin risk, and net fee and commission income risk) are mitigated and managed differently. Expense risk is monitored and managed via the financial performance of the bank and the local units, whereby the reported expense numbers are compared quarterly with the projected cost/income ratio. Deviations from this ambition are monitored as part of the financial projections that are discussed continuously within different parts of the organisation.",

(Naamloze vennootschap) is a company domiciled in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Commercial Register of Amsterdam, number 33231073. These Consolidated financial statements, as at and for the year ended 31 December 2022, comprise ING Groep N.V. (the Parent company) and its subsidiaries, together referred to as ING Group. ING Group is a global financial institution with a strong European base, offering a wide range of retail and wholesale banking services to customers in over 40 countries.\n\nThe ING Group Consolidated financial statements, as at and for the year ended 31 December 2022, were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Executive Board on 6 March 2023. The Executive Board has the power to amend the financial statements as long as these are not adopted by the General Meeting of Shareholders. The General Meeting of the Shareholders may decide not to adopt the financial statements, but may not amend these.\n\n## 1.2   Basis of preparation of the Consolidated financial statements\n\nThe ING Group Consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and the relevant articles of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nIFRS as adopted by the EU are IFRS Standards and IFRS Interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) with some limited modifications such as the temporary 'carve-out' from IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' (herein, referred to as IFRS).\n\nUnder the EU carve-out, ING Group applies fair value hedge accounting to portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (macro hedging). For further information, reference is made to paragraph 1.7.4 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' of this note and to note 39 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\nThe ING Group Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and there are no significant doubts about the ability of ING Group to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and rounded to the nearest million, unless stated otherwise. Amounts may not add up due to rounding.\n\n## 1.2.1   Presentation of Risk management disclosures\n\nTo improve transparency, reduce duplication and present related information in one place, certain disclosures of the nature and extent of risks related to financial instruments required by IFRS 7 'Financial instruments: Disclosures' are included in the 'Risk management' section of the Annual Report.\n\nThese disclosures are an integral part of ING Group Consolidated financial statements and are indicated in the 'Risk management' section by the symbol (*). Chapters, paragraphs, graphs or tables within the risk management section that are indicated with this symbol in the respective headings or table header are considered to be an integral part of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 1.3   Impact of Russian invasion in Ukraine\n\nThe war in Ukraine had, besides an immense impact on the lives of millions of people, a negative impact on the global economy. While businesses and households were still recovering from the economic consequences of Covid-19, developments in Ukraine further distorted supply chains, caused higher energy costs and aggravated an already high inflation rate environment. This, in combination with central bank rate hikes, worsened the macroeconomic outlook.\n\nAs a result of the economic effects of Russian invasion and second order effects uncertainty and level of management judgement remains at an elevated level in 2022, particularly in the estimation of loan loss provisions (including the need for management adjustments), the determination of fair values and impairment assessment of an investment in an associate.\n\nReference is made to the notes of the financial statements as well as Risk Management chapter for further information on the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and second order impacts.",

Comparative figures for 2021 have been updated accordingly.\n\n## 1.4.1   Changes in IFRS effective in 2022\n\nThe following amended standards became effective in 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3 'Business Combinations': Reference to the Conceptual Framework (issued in May 2020).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment': Proceeds before Intended Use (issued in May 2020).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets':  Onerous Contracts Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (issued in May 2020).\n- \u00b7 Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 Cycle: Amendments to IFRS 1 'First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards', amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and amendments to IFRS 16 'Leases' (issued in May 2020).\n\nThe above changes did not have significant impact on ING Group's Consolidated financial statements. ING Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment in 2022 which has been issued, but is not yet effective.\n\n## 1.4.2   Upcoming changes in IFRS after 2022\n\nThe following published amendments are not mandatory for 2022 and have not been early adopted by ING Group.\n\n## Effective in 2023 (endorsed by the EU):\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' (issued in May 2017), including amendments to IFRS 17 (issued in June 2020).\n\nIFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' is a new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. Once effective, IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts', which allowed diversity in accounting practices for insurance contracts. In June 2020, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 17 including a scope exclusion for credit card contracts and similar contracts that provide insurance coverage, and an optional scope exclusion for loans with death waivers. ING Group does not have an insurance business, but on a limited basis sells insurance products as a broker where it does not run the insurance risk. ING Group performed an impact assessment which revealed that a portfolio of loans with death waivers in the Netherlands with a net carrying amount of approximately of EUR 750 million might be in scope of IFRS 17. Following the above mentioned amendments to IFRS 17 in 2020 which allow an accounting policy choice, ING Group intends to account for assets in this portfolio in their entirety, including death waiver features, using IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and not IFRS 17. As a result, this portfolio will no longer meet the 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI) criterion, causing the portfolio to no longer be recognised at amortised cost but rather at fair value through profit or loss. This reclassification is not expected to have a material impact on equity or result of ING Group, as the fair value is expected not to differ materially from the current book value. Hence, the financial impact of IFRS 17 on ING Group is expected to be limited .\n\nThe following amendments will also be effective in 2023. However, the implementation of these amendments is expected to have no significant impact on ING Group's Consolidated financial statements.\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements': Disclosure of Accounting Policies (issued in February 2021).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors': Definition of Accounting Estimates (issued in February 2021).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes': Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising From a Single Transaction (issued in May 2021).\n\n## Effective in 2024 (not yet endorsed by the EU):\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 16 'Leases': Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (issued in September 2022).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements': Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (issued in January 2020).",

The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and the amounts of the contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date, as well as reported income and expenses for the year. The actual outcome may differ from these estimates. The process of setting assumptions is subject to internal control procedures and approvals.\n\nING Group has identified areas that require management to make significant judgements and use critical accounting estimates and assumptions based on the information and financial data that may or may not change in future periods. These areas are:\n\n- \u00b7 Loan loss provisions (financial assets);\n- \u00b7 Impairment assessment of an investment in associate;\n- \u00b7 The determination of the fair values of financial assets and liabilities;\n- \u00b7 Provisions; and\n- \u00b7 Accounting for Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO).\n\nFor further discussion of the significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions in these areas, reference is made to the relevant parts in paragraph 1.7 'Financial instruments' (specifically 1.7.8 'Impairment of financial assets', 1.7.3 for 'Fair values of financial assets and liabilities', 1.11 'Investments in associates and joint ventures', 1.18 'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets' and 1.7.9 'Accounting for Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO)') of this note and the applicable notes to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 1.6   Other developments\n\nApplication of IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies'\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2022 Turkey became a hyperinflationary economy for accounting purposes. As ING Group has a subsidiary in Turkey, ING Group applied IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies' to its operations as if the economy in Turkey had always been hyperinflationary. Given that ING Group presents its results in EUR, comparatives were not restated and IAS 29 was applied from 1 January 2022 with the impact of the first-time application and the effect for the period both shown in these Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nUnder IAS 29, the results of the operations in Turkey should be stated in terms of the current purchasing power at the reporting date. For that, the consumer price index (CPI) as determined by the Turkish Statistical Institute was used.\n\nThe development of the CPI during the year ended 31 December 2022 was as follows (2003=100):\n\n| 1 January 2022        | 686.95   |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| 31 December 2022      | 1,128.45 |\n| Change for the period | 64.27%   |\n\nTo state all the items in the financial statements in terms of their current purchasing power at the reporting date, ING Group restated the non-monetary items of ING Turkey (such as properties and equipment, intangibles, right-of use assets and shareholder's equity) for the changes in CPI up to the reporting date. Monetary items (such as cash and balances with banks, loans and advances and deposits) are not restated as they are already expressed in the current purchasing power. Furthermore, all items in the statement of comprehensive income were also restated for the effects of inflation based on the developments in CPI during the 12 month period to reflect the purchasing power as at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe effect of such restatement of the statement of comprehensive income and the balance sheet for inflation in the current period has been recognised in the statement of profit or loss within 'Other net income' as a 'Net monetary gain or loss'. The net monetary loss for the period represents the loss of purchasing power by the net monetary position (monetary assets exceeding monetary liabilities) of ING Turkey.\n\nAfter the application of the above restatement procedures in Turkish Lira under IAS 29, the financial position and the results for the period of ING Turkey are translated and presented in EUR at the exchange rate on 31 December 2022. For the statement of comprehensive income this is in contrast with the usual translation procedures where items of comprehensive income are translated at the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Furthermore, ING Group selected to present both the restatement effect resulting from restating ING Group's interest in the equity of ING Turkey as required by IAS 29; and the translation effect from translating at a closing rate that differs from the previous closing rate, in the Currency translation reserve.\n\nRefer to Note 19 'Equity' for the impact of applying IAS 29 during the year ended 31 December 2022.",

        "page_content": "Risk management\n\n- > 1   Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\n\n## 1.7   Financial instruments\n\nING Group applies IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' to the recognition, classification and measurement, and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and the impairment of financial assets. The Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' for hedge accounting purposes.\n\n## 1.7.1   Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments\n\n## Recognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are recognised in the balance sheet when ING Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. For a regular way purchase or sale of a financial asset, trade date and settlement date accounting is applied depending on the classification of the financial asset.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where ING Group has transferred the rights to receive the cash flows from the financial asset or assumed an obligation to pass on the cash flows and has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset. If ING Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset, it derecognises the financial asset if it no longer has control over the asset. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial asset that has been derecognised and the consideration received is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Recognition of financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognised on the date that the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## 1.7.2   Classification and measurement of financial instruments Financial assets\n\nING Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI, or through profit or loss); and\n- \u00b7 those to be measured at amortised cost (AC).\n\nAt initial recognition, ING Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) are expensed in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets - Debt instruments\n\nThe classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows at initial recognition.\n\n## Business models\n\nBusiness models are classified as Hold to Collect (HtC), Hold to Collect and Sell (HtC&S) or Other depending on how a portfolio of financial instruments as a whole is managed. ING Group's business models are based on the existing management structure of the bank, and refined based on an analysis of how businesses are evaluated and reported, how their specific business risks are managed and on historic and expected future sales. Sales are permissible in a HtC business model when these are due to an increase in credit risk, take place close to the maturity date (where the proceeds from the sales approximate the collection of the remaining contractual cash flows), are insignificant in value (both individually and in aggregate) or are infrequent.\n\n## Contractual cash flows Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI)\n\nThe contractual cash flows of a financial asset are assessed to determine whether they represent SPPI. Interest includes consideration for the time value of money, credit risk and for other basic lending risks such as consideration for liquidity risk and costs associated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time. In addition, interest can include a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are SPPI.\n\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, ING Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.\n\nBased on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows, there are three measurement categories into which ING Group classifies its debt instruments:",

Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n- \u00b7 FVOCI:\n\nDebt instruments that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets under a HtC&S business model, where the assets' cash flows represent SPPI, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are recognised in OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and presented in Investment income or Other net income, based on the specific characteristics of the business model. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the EIR method. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## \u00b7 FVPL:\n\nDebt instruments that do not meet the criteria for AC or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. This includes debt instruments that are held-for-trading (presented separately as Trading assets) and all other debt instruments that do not meet the criteria for AC or FVOCI (presented separately as Mandatorily at FVPL). ING Group may in some cases, on initial recognition, irrevocably designate a financial asset as classified and measured at FVPL. This is the case where doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise on assets measured at AC or FVOCI. Fair value movements on trading securities, trading loans and deposits (mainly reverse repo's) are presented fully within valuation result and net trading income, this also includes interest. The interest arising on financial assets designated as at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented within Interest income or Interest expense in the period in which it arises. The interest arising on a debt instrument that is part of a hedge relationship, but not subject to hedge accounting, is recognised in profit or loss and presented within Interest income or Interest expense in the period in which it arises.\n\nING Group reclassifies debt instruments if, and only if, its business model for managing those financial assets changes. Such changes in business models are expected to be very infrequent. There have been no reclassifications during the reporting period.\n\n## Financial assets - Equity instruments\n\nAll equity investments are measured at fair value. ING Group applies the fair value through OCI option to investments which are considered strategic, consisting of investments that add value to ING Group's core banking activities.\n\nThere is no subsequent recycling of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of investments if elected to be classified and measured as FVOCI. However, the cumulative gain or loss is transferred within equity to retained earnings on derecognition of such equity instruments. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as Investment income when ING Group's right to receive payments is established. Impairment requirements are not applicable to equity investments classified and measured as FVOCI.\n\nOther remaining equity investments are measured at FVPL. All changes in the fair value are recognised in Valuation result and Net trading income in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified and subsequently measured at AC, except for financial guarantee contracts, derivatives and liabilities designated at FVPL. Financial liabilities classified and measured at FVPL are presented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of change in the fair value that is attributable to changes in own credit risk of the liability designated at FVPL is presented in OCI. Upon derecognition this Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) impact does not recycle from OCI to profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 the remaining amount of change in the fair value is presented in profit or loss in 'Valuation results and net trading income'. Interest on financial liabilities at FVPL is also recognised in the valuation result, except for items voluntarily designated as FVPL for which interest is presented within 'Interest income (expense).\n\nA financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires ING Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Such a contract is initially recognised at fair value and is subsequently measured at the higher of (a) the amount determined in accordance with impairment provisions of IFRS 9 'Financial instruments' (see section 'Impairment of financial assets') and (b) the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition principle of IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers'.",

The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is generally its transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received). However, if there is a material difference between the transaction price and the fair value of financial instruments whose fair value is based on a valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs, the entire day one difference (a 'Day One Profit or Loss') is deferred. ING Group defers the Day One Profit or Loss relating to financial instruments classified as Level 3 and financial instruments with material unobservable inputs into CVA which are not necessarily classified as Level 3. The deferred Day One Profit or Loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the life of the transaction until the transaction matures, or until the significant unobservable inputs become observable, or until the significant unobservable inputs become non-significant. In all other cases, ING Group recognises the difference as a gain or loss at inception.\n\nSubsequently, except for financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, all the other financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value.\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It assumes that market participants would use and take into account the characteristics of the asset or liability when pricing the asset or liability. Fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on unadjusted quoted market prices where available. Such quoted market prices are primarily obtained from exchange prices for listed financial instruments. Where an exchange price is not available, quoted prices in an active market may be obtained from independent market vendors, brokers, or market makers. In general, positions are valued at the bid price for a long position and at the offer price for a short position or are valued at the price within the bidoffer spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances. In some cases where positions are marked at mid-market prices, a fair value adjustment is calculated.\n\nFor certain financial assets and liabilities, quoted market prices are not available. For such instruments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. These range from discounting of cash flows to various valuation models, where relevant pricing factors including the market price of underlying reference instruments, market parameters (volatilities, correlations and credit ratings), and customer behaviour are taken into account. ING Group maximises the use of market observable inputs and minimises the use of unobservable inputs in determining the fair value. It can be subjective dependent on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. All valuation techniques used are subject to internal review and approval. Most data used in these valuation techniques are validated on a daily basis when possible.\n\nWhen a group of financial assets and liabilities are managed on the basis of their net risk exposures, the fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities are measured on a net portfolio level.\n\nTo include credit risk in fair value, ING Group applies both Credit and Debit Valuation Adjustments (CVA, DVA, also known as Bilateral Valuation Adjustments or BVA). Own issued debt and structured notes that are designated at FVPL are adjusted for ING Group's own credit risk by means of a DVA. Additionally, derivatives valued at fair value are adjusted for credit risk by a BVA. The BVA is of a bilateral nature as both the credit risk on the counterparty (CVA) as well as the credit risk on ING Group (DVA) are included in the adjustment. All input data that is used in the determination of the BVA is based on market implied data. Additionally, wrong-way risk (when exposure to a counterparty is increasing and the credit quality of that counterparty deteriorates) and right-way risk (when exposure to a counterparty is increasing and the credit quality of that counterparty improves) are taken into account in the measurement of the valuation adjustment.\n\nTo include the funding risk, ING Group applies an additional 'Funding Valuation Adjustment' (FVA) to the uncollateralised derivatives based on the market price of funding liquidity.ING Group also applies to certain positions other valuation adjustments to arrive at the fair value: Bid-Offer adjustments, Model Risk Adjustments and Collateral Valuation Adjustments (CollVA).\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Even if market prices are available, when markets are less liquid there may be a range of prices for the same security from different price sources. Selecting the most appropriate price requires judgement and could result in different estimates of fair value.\n- \u00b7 Valuation techniques are subjective in nature and significant judgement is involved in establishing fair values for certain financial assets and liabilities. Valuation techniques involve various assumptions regarding pricing factors. The use of different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of fair value.\n- \u00b7 Price testing is performed to assess whether the process of valuation has led to an appropriate fair value of the position and to minimise the potential risks of economic losses due to incorrect or misused models.\n- \u00b7 Assessing whether a market is active, and whether an input is observable and significant, requires judgement. ING Group categorises its financial instruments that are either measured in the statement of financial position at fair value or of which the fair value is disclosed, into a three level hierarchy based on the observability and significance of the valuation inputs. The use of different approaches to assess whether a market is active, whether an input is observable, and whether an unobservable input is significant could produce different classification within the fair value hierarchy as well as potentially different deferral of the Day One Profit or Loss.\n- \u00b7 Reference is made to Note 38 'Fair value of assets and liabilities ' and to the 'Market risk' paragraph in the 'Risk management' section of the Annual Report for the basis of the determination of the fair value of financial instruments and related sensitivities.",

ING Group decided to exercise this accounting policy choice and did not adopt IFRS 9 hedge accounting as of 1 January 2018. Furthermore, ING Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (macro fair value hedges) in accordance with the EU carve-out version of IAS 39.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, including market transactions and valuation techniques (such as discounted cash flow models and option pricing models), as appropriate. All derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Fair value movements on derivatives are presented in profit or loss in Valuation result and net trading income, except for derivatives in either a formal hedge relationship and so-called economic hedges that are not in a formal hedge accounting relationship where a component is presented separately in interest result in line with ING Group's risk management strategy.\n\nEmbedded derivatives are separated from financial liabilities and other non-financial contracts and accounted for as a derivative if, and only if:\n\n- 1. the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract;\n- 2. a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and\n- 3. the combined instrument is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in profit or loss.\n\nIf an embedded derivative is separated, the host contract is accounted for as a similar free-standing contract.\n\nThe method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. ING Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedge), hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction (cash flow hedge), or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting is used for derivatives designated in this way provided certain criteria are met.\n\nAt the inception of the transaction ING Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, its risk management objective, together with the methods selected to assess hedge effectiveness. ING Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, together with fair value adjustments to the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative adjustment of the hedged item is, in the case of interest bearing instruments, amortised through the statement of profit or loss over the remaining term of the original hedge or recognised directly when the hedged item is derecognised. For non-interest bearing instruments, the cumulative adjustment of the hedged item is recognised in the statement of profit or loss only when the hedged item is derecognised.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in the Other Comprehensive Income are recycled to the statement of profit or loss in the periods in which the hedged item affects net result. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in the Other Comprehensive Income at that time remains in the Other Comprehensive Income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement of profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in the Other Comprehensive Income is transferred immediately to the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income and the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. Gains and losses accumulated in the Other Comprehensive Income are included in the statement of profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed.",

Phase 1 addresses those issues that affect financial reporting before the replacement of an existing benchmark. Phase 1 amendments to IFRS were issued by the IASB in 2019. Phase 2 focuses on issues that may affect financial reporting when the existing benchmark rate is reformed or replaced. Phase 2 amendments to IFRS were issued by the IASB in 2020.\n\nPhase 1 amendments to IFRS allow ING Group to apply a set of temporary exceptions to continue hedge accounting even when there is uncertainty about contractual cash flows arising from the reform. Under these temporary exceptions, interbank offered rates are assumed to continue unaltered for the purposes of hedge accounting until such time as the uncertainty is resolved.\n\nMore specifically, the following temporary reliefs are part of the Phase 1 amendments:\n\n- \u00b7 Highly probable requirement for cash flow hedges When determining whether a forecast transaction is highly probable, it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered as a result of the reform.\n- \u00b7 Prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness When performing the prospective assessment it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered as a result of the reform.\n- \u00b7 Retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness When performing the retrospective assessment hedges are allowed to pass the assessment even if actual results are outside the 80-125% range, during the period of uncertainty arising from the IBOR reform.\n- \u00b7 Designation of a component of an item as a hedged item For hedges of the benchmark component of interest rate risk affected by the reform, the separately identifiable requirement only needs to be demonstrated at the inception of such hedging relationships (including macro hedges).\n\nThe amendments are relevant given that ING Group hedges and applies hedge accounting to benchmark interest rate exposure part of IBOR reform. ING Group hedges are being progressively amended, where\n\nnecessary, to incorporate the new benchmark rates. Temporary exceptions under Phase 1 continued to be relevant for ING Group as at 31 December 2022 (for USD and WIBOR).\n\nING Group will completely cease to apply the amendments when this uncertainty is no longer present or when the hedging relationship is discontinued. Refer to Note 39 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' for the disclosures relating to the application of the amendments as part of Phase 1. Refer to note 'Risk management/ IBOR Transition' for more information regarding the end of Phase 1 reliefs for ING Group's hedging relationships.\n\nPhase 2 amendments require that hedge accounting continues on transition to risk free rates provided that the modifications made to financial instruments are those necessary to implement the IBOR Reform and that the new basis for calculating cash flows is 'economically equivalent' to the previous basis. Particularly, Phase 2 amendments allow the continuation of hedging relationships, subject to amending their documentation to reflect changes in hedged instruments, hedging instruments, hedged risk, and/or the method for measuring effectiveness during the transition to the new benchmark rates. During 2022, Phase 2 continued to be relevant for ING Group when ING actually transitioned its financial instruments (designated in hedge accounting relationships) to the new benchmark rates (mainly, USD LIBOR).\n\nMore specifically, the following temporary reliefs are part of the Phase 2 amendments:\n\n## Relief from discontinuing hedging relationships\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments in the hedge documentation as a consequence of changes required by the IBOR reform do not result in the discontinuation of the hedge relationship nor the designation of a new hedge relationship. The changes can be in form of designating an alternative benchmark rate as a hedged risk, the description of the hedging instrument, the description of the hedged item, or the method to measure the effectiveness.\n- \u00b7 When the hedged item is amended as a consequence of the IBOR reform (or if the hedge has previously been discontinued), amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve are deemed to be based on the Risk-Free Rate (RFR). This results in the release of the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss in the same period or periods in which the hedged cash flows that are now based on the RFR affect profit or loss.\n- \u00b7 When the items within a designated group of hedged items are amended as a consequence of the IBOR reform, the hedging strategy remains and is not discontinued. As items within the hedged group transition at different times from IBORs to RFRs, they are transferred to sub-groups of instruments that reference RFRs as the hedged risk. The existing IBORs remain designated as the hedged risk for the other sub-group of hedged items, until they are also updated to reference the new RFR. The usual hedge accounting requirements are applied to the hedge relationship in its entirety.",

This election is made separately for each hedging relationship (i.e., on a hedge-by-hedge basis).\n- \u00b7 Temporary relief from having to meet the separately identifiable requirement: a RFR is considered a separately identifiable risk component if it is reasonably expected to meet the separately identifiable requirement within 24 months from the date it is first designated as a non-contractually specified risk component (i.e. when the entity first designates the RFR as a non-contractually specified risk component). This relief applies to each RFR on a rate-by-rate basis.\n\n## Non-trading derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\n\nDerivative instruments that are used by ING Group as part of its risk management strategies, but which do not qualify for hedge accounting under ING Group's accounting policies, are presented as non-trading derivatives. Non-trading derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in the fair value taken to the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## 1.7.5   Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position when ING Group has a current legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intends to either settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Offsetting is applied to certain interest rate swaps for which the services of a central clearing house are used.\n\n## 1.7.6   Repurchase transactions and reverse repurchase transactions\n\nSecurities sold subject to repurchase agreements (repos), securities lending and similar agreements continue to be recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position. The counterparty liability is measured at FVPL (designated) and included in Other financial liabilities at FVPL if the asset is measured at FVPL. Otherwise, the counterparty liability is included in Deposits from banks, Customer deposits, or Trading, as appropriate.\n\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos), securities borrowings and similar agreements are not recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position. The consideration paid to purchase securities is recognised as Loans and advances to customers, Loans and advances to banks, Other financial assets at FVPL or Trading assets, as appropriate. The difference between the sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and amortised over the life of the agreement using the effective interest method for instruments that are not measured at FVPL.\n\n## 1.7.7   Credit risk management classification and maximum credit risk exposure\n\nCredit risk management disclosures are provided in the 'Credit risk' paragraph 'Credit risk categories' of the 'Risk management' section in the Annual Report.\n\nThe maximum credit risk exposure for items in the statement of financial position is generally the carrying value for the relevant financial assets. For the off-balance sheet items, the maximum credit exposure is the maximum amount that could be required to be paid. Reference is made to Note 44 'Contingent liabilities and commitments' for these off-balance sheet items. Collateral received is not taken into account when determining the maximum credit risk exposure.\n\nThe manner in which ING Group manages credit risk and determines credit risk exposures for that purpose is explained in the Credit risk paragraph 'Credit Risk Appetite and Concentration Risk Framework' of the 'Risk management' section in the Annual Report.\n\n## 1.7.8   Impairment of financial assets\n\nAn Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is applied to financial assets accounted for at AC or FVOCI such as loans, debt securities and lease receivables, as well as off-balance sheet items such as undrawn loan commitments, certain financial guarantees issued, and undrawn committed revolving credit facilities. Under the ECL model, ING Group calculates the expected credit losses (ECL) by considering on a discounted basis the cash shortfall it would incur in case of a default and multiplying the shortfall by the probability of a default occurring. The ECL is the sum of the probability-weighted outcomes. The ECL estimates are unbiased and include reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions. ING Group's approach leverages the Advanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB) models that are used for regulatory purposes. Adjustments are applied to make these models suitable for determining ECL. ECL is recognised on the balance sheet as loan loss provisions (LLP).\n\n## Three stage approach\n\nFinancial assets are classified in one of the below three Stages at each reporting date. A financial asset can move between Stages during its lifetime. The Stages are based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition and defined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1\n\nFinancial assets that have not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (i.e. no Stage 2 or 3 triggers apply). Assets are classified as Stage 1 upon initial recognition (with the exception of purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI) assets) and ECL is determined by the probability that a default occurs in the next 12 months (12 months ECL);",

For assets in Stage 2 ECL reflects an estimate on the credit losses over the remaining maturity of the asset (lifetime ECL); or\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 3\n\nFinancial assets that are credit-impaired. Also for these assets ECL is determined over the remaining maturity of the asset.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk\n\nING Group established a framework, incorporating quantitative and qualitative indicators, to identify and assess significant increases in credit risk (SICR). This is used to determine the appropriate ECL Stage for each financial asset.\n\nThe main determinate of SICR is a quantitative test, whereby the lifetime Probability of Default (PD) of an asset at each reporting date is compared against its lifetime PD determined at the date of initial recognition. If the delta is above pre-defined absolute or relative thresholds the item is considered to have experienced a SICR. Furthermore, any facility which shows an increase of 200% between the PD at the date of initial recognition and the lifetime PD at the reporting date (i.e. threefold increase in PD) must be classified as Stage 2. This is considered a backstop within the quantitative assessment of SICR. Refer to 'Criteria for identifying a significant increase in credit risk' in the 'Risk Management' section of the Annual Report for more details on relative and absolute PD thresholds, including quantitative disclosures on those thresholds.\n\nConsequently, if the above quantitative SICR thresholds are exceeded, the item moves from Stage 1 to Stage 2 (unless the item is credit-impaired). In these instances, items are no longer assigned a 12 month ECL and instead are assigned a lifetime ECL. Items can return to Stage 1 if there is sufficient evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nING Group also relies on a number of qualitative indicators to identify and assess SICR. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Forbearance status;\n- \u00b7 Intensive care management;\n- \u00b7 Watch List status;\n- \u00b7 Collective SICR assessment;\n- \u00b7 Arrears status (including 30 days past due used as a backstop).\n- \u00b7 Substandard Internal rating; and\n\nAn asset that is in Stage 2 will move back to Stage 1 when none of the above criteria are in place anymore. However, if the asset was moved to Stage 2 based on the forbearance status, then the asset stays in Stage 2 for at least 24 months. If the asset was classified as Stage 2 due to 30 days past due trigger, then the asset is moved back to Stage 1 only after three months from when the trigger no longer applies.\n\n## Credit-impaired financial assets (Stage 3)\n\nFinancial assets are assessed for credit-impairment at each reporting date and more frequently when circumstances warrant further assessment. Evidence of credit-impairment includes arrears of over 90 days on any material credit obligation, indications that the borrower is experiencing significant financial difficulty, a breach of contract, bankruptcy or distressed restructuring. The definition of credit-impaired under IFRS 9 (Stage 3) is aligned with the definition of default used by ING Group for internal risk management purposes, which is also the definition used for regulatory purposes.\n\nAn asset (other than a POCI asset) that is in Stage 3 will move back to Stage 2 when, as at the reporting date, it is no longer considered to be credit-impaired subject to certain probation periods. The asset will migrate back to Stage 1 when its credit risk at the reporting date is no longer considered to have increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios\n\nING Group has established a quarterly process whereby forward-looking macroeconomics scenarios and probability weightings are developed for the purpose of ECL. ING Group applies data predominantly from a leading service provider (Oxford Economics (OE)) enriched with the internal ING Group view. A baseline, upscenario and a down-scenario are determined to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted ECL amount. As a baseline scenario, ING Group applies the market-neutral view combining consensus forecasts for economic variables such as unemployment rates, GDP growth, house prices, commodity prices, and shortterm interest rates. Applying market consensus in the baseline scenario ensures unbiased estimates of the expected credit losses.\n\nThe alternative scenarios are based on observed forecast errors in the past, adjusted for the risks affecting the economy today and the forecast horizon. The probabilities assigned are based on the likelihoods of observing the three scenarios and are derived from confidence intervals on a probability distribution. The forecasts for the economic variables are adjusted on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Measurement of ECL\n\nING Group applies a collective assessment method to measure ECL for Stage 1, Stage 2, and certain Stage 3 assets. Other credit-impaired assets subject to ECL measurement apply the individual assessment method.",

ECL is determined by, expressed simplistically, multiplying the probability of default (PD) with the loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD), adjusted for the time value of money. Assets that are collectively assessed are grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics, taking into account loan type, industry, geographic location, collateral type, past due status and other relevant factors. These characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets by being indicative of the debtors' ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated and the loss in case the debtor is not able to pay all amounts due.\n\nFor Stage 3 assets the PD equals 100% and the LGD and EAD represent a lifetime view of the losses based on characteristics of defaulted facilities.\n\nFor the purpose of ECL, ING Group's expected credit loss models (PD, LGD, EAD) used for regulatory purposes have been adjusted. These adjustments include removing embedded prudential conservatism (such as floors) and converted through-the-cycle estimates to point-in-time estimates. The models assess ECL on the basis of forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts and other inputs. For most financial assets, the expected life is limited to the remaining maturity. For overdrafts and certain revolving credit facilities, such as credit cards, the maturity is estimated based on historical data as these do not have a fixed term or repayment schedule.\n\n## Individually assessed assets (Stage 3)\n\nING Group estimates ECL for individually significant credit-impaired financial assets within Stage 3 on an individual basis. ECL for these Individually assessed assets are determined using the discounted expected future cash flow method. To determine expected future cash flows, one or more scenarios are used. Each scenario is analysed based on the probability of occurrence and includes forward looking information.\n\nIn determining the scenarios, all relevant factors impacting the future cash flows are taken into account. These include expected developments in credit quality, business and economic forecasts, and estimates of if/when recoveries will occur taking into account ING Group's restructuring/recovery strategy.\n\nThe best estimate of ECL is calculated as the weighted-average of the shortfall (gross carrying amount minus discounted expected future cash flow using the original EIR) per scenario, based on best estimates of expected future cash flows. Recoveries can arise from, among others, repayment of the loan, collateral recovery and the sale of the asset. Cash flows from collateral and other credit enhancements are included in the measurement of ECL of the related financial asset when it is part of or integral to the contractual terms of the financial asset and the credit enhancement is not recognised separately. For the individual\n\nassessment, with granular (company or asset-specific) scenarios, specific factors can have a larger impact on the future cash flows than macroeconomic factors.\n\nWhen a financial asset is credit-impaired, interest is no longer recognised based on the accrual income based on the gross carrying amount of the asset. Rather, interest income is calculated by applying the original EIR to the AC of the asset, which is the gross carrying amount less the related loan loss provision.\n\n## Purchased or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) assets\n\nPOCI assets are financial assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition. Impairment on a POCI asset is determined based on lifetime ECL from initial recognition. POCI assets are recognised initially at an amount net of ECL and are measured at AC using a credit-adjusted effective interest rate. In subsequent periods any changes to the estimated lifetime ECL are recognised in profit or loss. Favourable changes are recognised as an impairment gain even if the lifetime ECL at the reporting date is lower than the estimated lifetime ECL at origination.\n\n## Modifications\n\nIn certain circumstances ING Group grants borrowers postponement, reduction of loan principal and/or interest payments on a temporary period of time to maximise collection opportunities, and if possible, avoid default, foreclosure, or repossession. When such postponement, reduction of loan principal and/or interest payments is executed based on credit concerns it is also referred to as forbearance (refer to the 'Risk Management' section of the Annual Report for more details). In such cases, the net present value of the postponement, reduction of loan principal and/or interest payments is taken into account in the determination of the appropriate level of ECL. If the forbearance results in a substantial modification of the terms of the loan, the original loan is derecognised and a new loan is recognised at fair value at the modification date. ING Group determines whether there has been a substantial modification using both quantitative and qualitative factors.\n\n## Write-off and debt forgiveness\n\nLoans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery and/or collectability of amounts due. The following events can lead to a write-off:\n\n- \u00b7 After a restructuring has been completed and there is a high improbability of recovery of part of the remaining loan exposure (including partial debt forgiveness);\n- \u00b7 In a bankruptcy liquidation scenario;\n- \u00b7 Specific fraud cases with no recourse options.\n- \u00b7 After divestment or sale of a credit facility at a discount;",

        "page_content": "Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nStrategy and performance\n\nRisk management\n\n- > 1   Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\n\nWhen a loan is uncollectable, it is written off against the related loan loss provision. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognised in 'Addition to loan loss provisions' in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\nDebt forgiveness (or debt settlement) involves write-off but additionally involves the forgiveness of a legal obligation, in whole or in part. This means that ING Group forfeits the legal right to recover the debt. As a result, the financial asset needs to be derecognised. Distinction is made in situations where ING Group ends the relationship with the client and situations where ING Group (partially) continues the financing of the client.\n\n## Presentation of ECL\n\nECL for financial assets measured at AC are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt instruments at FVOCI, the ECL is recognised in OCI, instead of deducted the carrying amount of the asset. ECL also reflects any credit losses related to the portion of the loan commitment that is expected to be drawn down over the remaining life of the instrument. The ECL on issued financial guarantee contracts, in scope of IFRS 9 and not measured at FVPL, are recognised as liabilities and presented in Other provisions. ECL are presented in profit or loss in Addition to loan loss provision.\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions:\n\nConsiderable management judgement is exercised in determining the amount of ECL for financial assets assessed on both a collective and an individual basis. In particular, this judgement requires ING Group to make various assumptions about the risk of default, the credit loss rates in case of a default and expected future cash flows. These assumptions are based on a combination of ING Group's past history, existing market conditions and forward-looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. Changes in these assumptions may lead to changes in the ECL over time. Given they are subjective and complex in nature, and because the ECL and the underlying exposures subject to ECL are material, these assumptions are considered critical accounting assumptions. The sensitivity of these assumptions is assessed in the credit risk section of the 'Risk Management' section in the Annual Report.\n\n## \u00b7 The use of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios in both collective and individual impairment assessments\n\nForward-looking macroeconomic scenarios are uncertain in nature. The process ING Group follows involves two internal groups, the Macroeconomics Scenarios Team and the Macroeconomics Scenarios Expert Panel. The latter team consists of senior management representatives from the Business, Risk and Finance. These groups review inputs obtained from a third party provider and subject these to internal expert challenge to ensure the inputs used in the models reflect ING Group's view on the macro economy. The use of alternate forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios can produce significantly different estimates of ECL. This is demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis in the 'Risk Management' section of the Annual Report, where the un-weighted ECL under each of the three scenarios for some significant portfolios is disclosed.\n\n## \u00b7 The probability weights applied to each of the three scenarios\n\nING Group uses three macroeconomic scenarios when determining IFRS 9 ECL (baseline, upside and downside). Management judgement is applied in the design of the approach used to determine the weights of each scenario and in selecting the parts of the distribution of forecast errors from which the weights are derived. Reference is made to the 'Alternative scenarios and probability weights' and the sensitivity analysis in the 'Risk Management' section of the Annual Report for further details.",

        "page_content": "Risk management\n\n- > 1   Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\n\n## \u00b7 The criteria for identifying a significant increase in credit risk\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly, ING Group considers reasonable and supportable information to compare the risk of default occurring at reporting date with the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition of the financial asset. Whilst judgement is required in applying a PD rating to each financial asset, there is significant judgement used in determining the Stage allocation PD banding thresholds. The process of comparing a financial asset's PD with the PD banding thresholds determines its ECL Stage. Assets in Stage 1 are allocated a 12 month ECL, and those in Stage 2 are allocated a lifetime ECL, and the difference is often significant. As such, the judgement made in assigning financial asset PDs and the PD banding thresholds constitute a significant judgement. Analysis of the sensitivity associated with the assessment of significant increase in credit risk is presented in the 'Risk Management' section of the Annual Report.\n\n## \u00b7 The definition of default\n\nJudgement is exercised in management's evaluation of whether there is objective evidence that larger exposures are credit-impaired. Management judgement is required in assessing evidence of creditimpairment.\n\n## \u00b7 Management adjustments applied as at 31 December 2022\n\nTo reflect the risks that are not properly captured by the ECL models, a number of management adjustments to the model-based ECL were necessary as at 31 December 2022. Reference is made to the 'Management adjustments applied this year' paragraph in the 'Risk management' section of the Annual Report.\n\n## 1.7.9   Accounting for Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO)\n\nING Group participates in Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III), reference is made to Note 12 'Deposits from banks'.\n\nING Group considers TLTRO funding provided by the ECB to banks to be on market terms on the basis that the ECB has established a separate market with TLTRO programmes. They have specific terms which are different from other sources of funding available to banks, including those provided by the ECB. Consequently, the rate under TLTRO is considered to be a market conforming rate and TLTRO funding is recognized fully as a financial liability.\n\nING Group interprets the whole rate set by the ECB under TLTRO as a floating rate on the financial liability, being the market rate for each specific period in time. This results in discrete rates for discrete interest periods over the life of TLTRO. The change in the applicable rate between interest periods is seen as a change in the floating rate and is accounted for prospectively. Similarly, if the ECB announces changes in the rate for the amounts already drawn under the existing TLTRO, then such changes also represent a change in a floating rate. Following this, such changes lead to the recognition of an increased/decreased interest in the relevant period of life of the exposure, rather than by the recognition of an immediate modification gain or loss at the moment of the change of terms by the ECB. If the change relates to the periods already passed, the impact for those past periods is recognised in profit or loss immediately.\n\nFurthermore, the change in the TLTRO rate driven by changes in expectations of meeting the targets impacts interest income. As a result, interest income which relates to the period that already passed until the moment when the change in expectations occurs, is recognised as a catch up adjustment in Consolidated statement of profit or loss. This change occurs only when ING Group has a reasonable expectation that the lending targets will be met.\n\nING Group views 'reasonable expectation' in case of TLTRO funding as a high hurdle. This is the moment when it becomes highly probable, i.e. the probability of meeting the lending targets is substantially greater than the probability that it will not. As a result, if interest income is recognised during the period based on the expectation of meeting the targets, there should only be a limited possibility that the interest may need to be reversed in future reporting periods. Reference is made to note 12 'Deposits from banks' and to note 20 'Net interest income' for the presentation of ING Group's participation in TLTRO programmes.\n\n## Significant judgements:\n\nSignificant management judgement is exercised in determining the accounting treatment of TLTRO transactions. In particular, ING Group applied judgement in:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing and concluding that in ING Group's view the rate under TLTRO is considered to be a market conforming rate and, hence, accounting for TLTRO in accordance with IFRS 9; and\n- \u00b7 selecting accounting policies regarding the calculation of the effective interest rate under TLTRO. Treatment of changes in expectations of meeting the lending targets was an area of significant judgment in the comparative periods but no longer relevant in 2022.",

(the Parent Company), ING Bank N.V. and all other subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by ING Groep N.V. Control exists if ING Groep N.V. is exposed to or has rights to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through the power over the subsidiary. Control is usually achieved through situations including, but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than half of the voting power;\n- \u00b7 Power to govern operating and financial policies under statute or agreement; and\n- \u00b7 Ability to appoint or remove the majority of the board of directors;\n- \u00b7 Power over more than half of the voting rights through an agreement with other investors.\n\nThe existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing whether ING Group controls another entity.\n\nFor interests in structured entities, the existence of control requires judgement as these entities are designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. This judgement includes, for example, the involvement in the design of the structured entity, contractual arrangements that give rights to direct the structured entities relevant activities and commitment to ensure that the structured entity operates as designed.\n\nA list of principal subsidiaries is included in Note 47 'Principal subsidiaries' and a description of ING's activities involving structured entities is included in Note 48 'Structured entities'.\n\nA list containing the information referred to in Section 379 (1), Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code has been filed with the office of the Commercial Register of Amsterdam, in accordance with Section 379 (5), Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe results of the operations and the net assets of subsidiaries are included in the statement of profit or loss and the statement of financial position from the date control is obtained until the date control is lost. On disposal, the difference between the sales proceeds, net of directly attributable transaction costs, and the net assets is included in net result.\n\nA subsidiary which ING Group has agreed to sell but is still legally owned by ING Group may still be controlled by ING Group at the balance sheet date and therefore, still be included in the consolidation. Such a subsidiary may be presented as a held for sale disposal group if certain conditions are met.\n\nAll intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Where necessary, the accounting policies used by subsidiaries are changed to ensure consistency with group policies. In general, the reporting dates of subsidiaries are the same as the reporting date of ING Groep N.V.\n\nING Groep N.V. and its Dutch group companies are subject to legal restrictions regarding the amount of dividends they can pay to their shareholders. The Dutch Civil Code contains the restriction that dividends can only be paid up to an amount equal to the excess of the company's own funds over the sum of the paid-up capital and reserves required by law. Certain Group companies are also subject to other restrictions in certain countries, in addition to the restrictions on the amount of funds that may be transferred in the form of dividends, or otherwise, to the parent company.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to the restrictions in respect of minimum capital requirements that are imposed by industry regulators in the countries in which the subsidiaries operate, other limitations exist in certain countries.\n\n## 1.9   Segment reporting\n\nAn operating segment is a distinguishable component of ING Group, engaged in providing products or services, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Board of ING Group and the Management Board Banking (together the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM)) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess its performance. A geographical area is a distinguishable component of ING Group engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that differ from those of segments operating in other economic environments.\n\nThe CODM examines ING Group's performance both by line of business and geographic perspective and has identified five reportable segments by line of business. The geographical analyses are based on the location of the office from which the transactions are originated.\n\n## 1.10   Foreign currency translation\n\nFunctional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of ING Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is ING Group's presentation currency.",

Exchange rate differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, except when deferred in equity as part of qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\nExchange rate differences on non-monetary items, measured at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Non-monetary items are retranslated at the date the fair value is determined. Exchange rate differences on non-monetary items measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are included in other comprehensive income and get accumulated in the revaluation reserve in equity.\n\nExchange rate differences in the statement of profit or loss are generally included in 'Valuation results and net trading income'. Reference is made to Note 22 'Valuation results and net trading income', which discloses the amounts included in the statement of profit or loss. Exchange rate differences relating to the disposal of debt and FVPL equity securities are considered to be an inherent part of the capital gains and losses recognised in Investment income. As mentioned below, in Group companies relating to the disposals of group companies, any exchange rate difference deferred in equity is recognised in the statement of profit or loss in 'Result on disposal of group companies'. Reference is also made to Note 19 'Equity', which discloses the amounts included in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Group companies\n\nThe results and financial positions of all group companies that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the statement of financial position;\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions). However, under hyperinflation accounting, income and expenses of ING Turkey are translated at the closing rate; and\n- \u00b7 All resulting exchange rate differences are recognised in a separate component of equity.\n\nOn consolidation, exchange rate differences arising from the translation of a monetary item that forms part of the net investment in a foreign operation, and of borrowings and other instruments designated as\n\nhedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders' equity. When a foreign operation is sold, the corresponding exchange rate differences are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 1.11   Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are all entities over which ING Group has significant influence but not control. Significant influence is the ability to participate in the financial and operating policies of the investee. It generally results from a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights or through situations including, but not limited to one or more of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Representation on the board of directors;\n- \u00b7 Interchange of managerial personnel.\n- \u00b7 Participation in the policymaking process; and\n\nJoint ventures are entities over which ING Group has joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement or entity, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint control means that no party to the agreement is able to act unilaterally to control the activity of the entity. The parties to the agreement must act together to control the entity and therefore exercise the joint control.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\n\nING Group's investment in associates and joint ventures (net of any accumulated impairment loss) includes goodwill identified on acquisition. ING Group's share of its associates and joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition changes in reserves is recognised in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition changes are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When ING Group's share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, including any long-term interests in the associate like uncollateralised loans that are neither planned nor likely to be settled in the foreseeable future, ING Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.",

Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless they provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by ING Group.\n\nThe recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use, of the investment in associate and joint venture is determined when there is an indication of potential (reversal of) impairment. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its recoverable amount. Goodwill on acquisitions of interests in associates and joint ventures is not tested separately for impairment, but is assessed as part of the carrying amount of the investment. An impairment loss is subsequently reversed if there is indication of a reversal and there is a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount, but cannot exceed the original impairment loss.\n\nThe reporting dates of certain associates and joint ventures can differ from the reporting date of the Group, but by no more than three months.\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions:\n\nThe most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the assessment of (reversal of) impairment of the investment in TMBThanachart Bank Public Company Limited (hereafter: TTB) which involves estimation of value in use.\n\nManagement's best estimate of the expected future earnings of TTB is based on forecasts derived from broker consensus over the short to medium term and reasonable and supportable assumptions capturing a combination of TTB specific and market data points for longer term and steady state expectations into perpetuity. A capital maintenance charge is applied, which is management's forecast of the earnings that need to be withheld in order for TTB to meet target regulatory requirements over the forecast period. Both of these factors are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.\n\nKey assumptions used in estimating TTB's value in use and the sensitivity of the value in use calculations to different assumptions are described in note 8 'Investments in associates and joint ventures'.\n\n## 1.12   Property and equipment\n\n## Property in own use\n\nLand and buildings held for own use are stated at fair value at the balance sheet date. Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation of land and buildings held for own use are credited to the revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity. Decreases in the carrying amount that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged against the revaluation reserve directly in equity; all other decreases are charged to the statement of profit or loss. Increases that reverse a revaluation decrease on the same asset previously recognised in net result are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Depreciation is recognised based on the fair value and the estimated useful life (in general 20-50 years). Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis. On disposal, the related revaluation reserve is transferred to retained earnings.\n\nIn principle, the fair values of land and buildings are appraised annually by independent qualified valuers. Subsequent expenditure is included in the asset's carrying amount when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to ING Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\n## Equipment\n\nEquipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. The cost of the assets is depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are generally as follows: for data processing equipment two to five years, and four to ten years for fixtures and fittings. Expenditure incurred on maintenance and repairs is recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred. Expenditure incurred on major improvements is capitalised and depreciated.\n\n## Disposals of property and equipment\n\nThe difference between the proceeds on disposal and net carrying value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss under Other net income.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\n## ING Group as the lessee\n\nA lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a corresponding liability representing its obligation to make lease payments at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by ING Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the repayment of the liability and finance cost. The finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straightline basis.",

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u00b7 Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;\n- \u00b7 The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions. This rate is approximated by using the risk free rate applicable to the lease term, the currency of the lease payment and jurisdiction, with the Fund Transfer Pricing (FTP) rate as an add-on. The FTP rate is used to transfer interest rate risk and funding and liquidity risk positions between the ING Group business and treasury departments. It is determined by either ING Group or Local Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO). Reference is made to the 'Risk management' section of the Annual Report.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs and restoration costs.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straightline basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise mainly IT-equipment (for example mobile phones or laptops) and small items of office furniture.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is included in the statement of financial position line-item 'Property and equipment', the lease liability is included in the statement of financial position line-item 'Other liabilities'. Refer to note 9 'Property and equipment' and to note 16 'Other liabilities'.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, the right-of-use asset amortises using a straight-line method to the income statement over the life of the lease. The lease liability increases for the accrual of interest and decrease when payments are made. Any remeasurement of the lease liability due to a lease modification or other reassessment results in a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.\n\n## 1.13   ING Group as lessor\n\nWhen ING Group acts as a lessor, a distinction should be made between finance leases and operating leases. For ING Group as a lessor these are mainly finance leases and are therefore not included in 'Property and equipment'. Instead, the present value of the lease payments is recognised as a receivable under Loans and advances to customers or Loans and advances to banks. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is unearned finance lease income. Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method (before tax), which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.\n\n## 1.14   Acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nGoodwill resulting from a business combination\n\nING Group's business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The consideration for each business combination is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. Goodwill, being the difference between the cost of the acquisition (including assumed debt) and the Group's interest in the fair value of the investee's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as at the date of acquisition, is capitalised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is only recognised separately on acquisitions. The results of the operations of the acquired companies are included in the statement of profit or loss from the date control is obtained.\n\nWhere applicable, the consideration for the business combination includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisitiondate fair value. Contingent consideration arrangements classified as an asset or a liability, are subsequently measured at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration classified as equity, are not recognised.\n\nWhere a business combination is achieved in stages, ING Group's previously held interests in the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date ING Group obtains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the statement of profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred and presented in the statement of profit or loss as Other operating expenses.\n\nThe initial accounting for the fair value of the net assets of the companies acquired during the year may be determined only provisionally as the determination of the fair value can be complex and the time between",

The initial accounting shall be completed within a year after acquisition. Adjustments to the fair value as at the date of acquisition of acquired assets and liabilities, that are identified within one year after acquisition are recognised as an adjustment to goodwill; any subsequent adjustment is recognised as income or expense. On disposal of group companies where control is lost, the difference between the sale proceeds and carrying value (including goodwill) and the unrealised results (including the currency translation reserve in equity) is included in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and other non-financial assets\n\nING Group assesses at each reporting period, whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset may be impaired. Irrespective of whether there is an indication of impairment, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill acquired in a business combination, and intangible assets not yet available for use, are tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing. These groups of CGUs represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the group of CGUs to the recoverable amount of that group of CGUs. The carrying value is determined on a basis that is consistent with the way in which the recoverable amount of the CGU is determined. The recoverable amount is estimated as the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Impairment of goodwill, if applicable, is included in the statement of profit or loss in Other operating expenses and is not subsequently reversed.\n\n## Computer software\n\nComputer software that has been purchased or generated internally for own use is stated at cost less amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over its useful life. This period will generally not exceed five years. Amortisation is included in Other operating expenses.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets are capitalised and amortised over their expected economic life, which is generally between three and ten years.\n\n## 1.15   Taxation\n\nIncome tax on the result for the year consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss but it is recognised directly in equity if the tax relates to items that are recognised directly in equity.\n\n## Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, for temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated statement of financial position. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided for temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by ING Group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The tax effects of income tax losses available for carry forward are recognised as an asset where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.\n\nFair value remeasurements of debt and equity instruments measured at FVOCI and cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity. Deferred tax related to this fair value remeasurement is also recognised directly in equity and is subsequently recognised in the statement of profit or loss together with the deferred gain or loss.\n\nUncertain tax positions are assessed continually by ING Group and in case it is probable that there will be a cash outflow, a current tax liability is recognised.\n\n## 1.16   Other assets\n\n## Investment property\n\nInvestment properties are recognised at fair value at the balance sheet date. The fair values of investment properties are appraised annually by independent qualified valuers. Changes in the carrying amount resulting from revaluations are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. On disposal, the difference between the sale proceeds and carrying value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Property obtained from foreclosures\n\nProperty obtained from foreclosures is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price, less applicable variable selling expenses. Property obtained from foreclosures is included in Other assets - Property development and obtained from foreclosures.",

Depending on the intention of ING Group after completion of the development, the property is measured as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Intention to sell: at the lower of cost and net realisable value;\n- \u00b7 Intention to use as a real estate investment: at fair value.\n\n## 1.17   Disposal groups held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nDisposal groups (and non-current assets) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This is only the case when the sale is highly probable and the disposal group (or non-current assets) is available for immediate sale in its present condition; including management must be committed to the sale, which is expected to occur within one year from the date of classification as held for sale.\n\nUpon classification as held for sale, the disposal group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except where specifically exempt from IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of the disposal group, but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the disposal group is recognised at the date of derecognition. Assets within the disposal group are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other net income/expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised. The assets of the disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet.\n\nWhen a group of assets that is classified as held for sale represents a major line of business or geographical area the disposal group is classified as discontinued operations. Upon classification of a business as held for sale and discontinued operations the individual income and expenses are presented within the Total net result from discontinued operations instead of being presented in the usual line items in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss. All comparative years in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss are restated and presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Furthermore, the individual assets and liabilities are presented in the Consolidated statement of financial position as Assets and liabilities held for sale and are no longer included in the usual line items in the Consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nChanges in assets and liabilities as a result of classification as held for sale are included in the notes in the line 'Changes in composition of the group and other changes'.\n\n## 1.18   Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is a present obligation arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, however the timing or the amount is uncertain. Provisions are discounted when the effect of the time value of money is significant using a pre-tax discount rate.\n\nReorganisation provisions include employee termination benefits when ING Group is demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.\n\nA liability is recognised for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the liability is recognised only upon reaching the specified minimum threshold.\n\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of ING Group; or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because it is either not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured reliably. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position, but are rather disclosed in the notes unless the possibility of the outflow of economic benefits is remote.\n\nA contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of ING Group. Contingent assets are recognised in the statement of financial position only when realisation of the income that arises from such an asset is virtually certain. Contingent assets are disclosed in the notes when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.",

        "page_content": "## Contents Introduction Strategy and performance\n\nRisk management\n\n- > 1   Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions:\n\nThe recognition and measurement of provisions is an inherently uncertain process involving using judgement to determine when a present obligation exists and estimates regarding probability, amounts and timing of cash flows.\n\nING Group may become involved in governmental, regulatory, arbitration and legal proceedings and investigations and may be subject to third party claims. With or without reference to the above, ING Group may also offer compensation to certain of its customers. Judgement is required to assess whether a present obligation exists and to estimate the probability of an unfavourable outcome and the amount of potential loss. The degree of uncertainty and the method of making the accounting estimate depends on the individual case, its nature and complexity. Such cases are usually one of a kind. For the assessment of related provisions ING Group consults with internal and external legal experts. Even taking into consideration legal experts' advice, the probability of an outflow of economic benefits can still be uncertain and the provision recognised can remain sensitive to the assumptions used. Reference is made to Note 15 'Provisions'. For proceedings where it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the expected financial effect, that could result from the ultimate resolution of the proceedings, no provision is recognised, however disclosure is included in the financial statements, where relevant. Reference is made to Note 45 'Legal proceedings'.\n\nCritical accounting estimates and assumptions for the reorganisation provision are in estimating the amounts and timing of cash flows as the announced transformation initiatives are implemented over a period of several years. Reference is made to Note 15 'Provisions'.\n\n## 1.19   Other liabilities\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe net defined benefit asset or liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair value of the plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.\n\nPlan assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. For determining the pension expense, the return on plan assets is determined using a high quality corporate bond rate identical to the discount rate used in determining the defined benefit obligation.\n\nChanges in plan assets that effect Shareholders' equity and/or Net result, include mainly:\n\n- \u00b7 Return on plan assets using a high quality corporate bond rate at the start of the reporting period which are recognised as staff costs in the statement of profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 Remeasurements which are recognised in Other comprehensive income.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation is calculated by internal and external independent qualified actuaries through actuarial models and calculations using the projected unit credit method. This method considers expected future payments required to settle the obligation resulting from employee service in the current and prior periods, discounted using a high quality corporate bond rate. Inherent in these actuarial models are assumptions including discount rates, rates of increase in future salary and benefit levels, mortality rates, consumer price index and the expected level of indexation. The assumptions are based on available market data as well as management expectations and are updated regularly. The actuarial assumptions may differ significantly from the actual results due to changes in market conditions, economic and mortality trends, and other assumptions. Any changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the defined benefit plan obligation and future pension costs.\n\nChanges in the defined benefit obligation that effect Shareholders' equity and/or Net result, include mainly:\n\n- \u00b7 Service cost which is recognised as staff costs in the statement of profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 Interest expenses using a high quality corporate bond rate at the start of the period which are recognised as staff costs in the Statement of profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 Remeasurements which are recognised in Other comprehensive income (equity).\n\nRemeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are not recycled to profit or loss. Any past service cost relating to a plan amendment is recognised in profit or loss in the period of the plan amendment. Gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nThe recognition of a net defined benefit asset in the Consolidated statement of financial position is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nFor defined contribution plans, ING Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. ING Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as staff expenses in the profit or loss when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.",

The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans.\n\n## 1.20   Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares (own equity instruments bought back by ING Group or its subsidiaries) are deducted from Equity (Other reserves). No gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss when purchasing, selling or cancelling these shares. Treasury shares are not taken into account when calculating earnings per ordinary share or dividend per ordinary share as they are not considered to be outstanding.\n\nTreasury shares can be purchased by ING as part of a share buyback programme. If a share buyback is executed by a broker and the agreement with the broker is irrevocable, ING has a contractual obligation to purchase its own shares that is unavoidable once it signs the agreement with the broker. This is the moment when ING recognises a financial liability measured at the present value of the redemption amount with a corresponding reduction in equity (Retained earnings). During the share buyback programme, ING settles this liability for the actual purchase price paid for the shares bought on a daily basis. Actual shares bought back and held by ING are presented as Treasury shares within Other reserves in equity.\n\n## 1.21   Income recognition\n\n## Interest\n\nInterest income and expense are recognised in the statement of profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, ING Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses.\n\nThe calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.\n\nInterest results on instruments classified at Amortised Cost, assets measured at FVOCI and derivatives in a formal hedge accounting relationship is presented in 'Interest income (expense) using effective interest rate method'. Interest result on financial assets and liabilities voluntarily designated as at FVPL and derivatives in so called economic hedges and instruments designated at fair value are presented in 'Other interest income (expense)'. Interest result on all other financial assets and liabilities at FVTPL is recognised in 'Valuation results and net trading income'.\n\n## Fees and commissions\n\nFees and commissions are generally recognised as the service is provided. Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down are deferred (together with related direct costs) and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan. Loan syndication fees are recognised as income when the performance obligation has been satisfied based on the particular contract and ING Group has retained no part of the loan package for itself or has retained a part at the same effective interest rate as the other participants. Commission and fees arising from negotiating, or participating in the negotiation of, a transaction for a third party - such as the arrangement of the acquisition of shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses - are recognised on completion of the underlying transaction. Portfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognised based on the applicable service contracts as the service is provided. Asset management fees related to investment funds and investment contract fees are recognised on a pro-rata basis over the period the service is provided. The same principle is applied for wealth management, financial planning and custody services that are continuously provided over an extended period of time. Fees received and paid between banks for payment services are classified as commission income and expenses.\n\n## Lease income\n\nThe proceeds from leasing out assets under operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease agreement. Lease payments received in respect of finance leases when ING Group is the lessor are divided into an interest component (recognised as interest income) and a repayment component based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor's net investment in the lease.\n\n## 1.22   Expense recognition\n\nExpenses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred or when a decrease in future economic benefits related to a decrease in an asset or an increase in a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably. Fee and commission expenses are generally a result from a contract with ING service providers in order to perform the service for ING Group's customers. Costs are generally presented as 'Commission expenses' if they are specific, incremental, directly attributable and identifiable to generate commission income.",

Share-based payment expenses are recognised as a staff expense over the vesting period. A corresponding increase in equity is recognised for equity-settled share-based payment transactions. A liability is recognised for cashsettled share-based payment transactions. The fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at the grant date, and the fair value of cash-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at each balance sheet date. Rights granted will remain valid until the expiry date, even if the share based payment scheme is discontinued. The rights are subject to certain conditions, including a pre-determined continuous period of service.\n\n## 1.23   Earnings per ordinary share\n\nEarnings per ordinary share is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. In calculating the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding:\n\n- \u00b7 Own shares held by group companies are deducted from the total number of ordinary shares in issue;\n- \u00b7 In case of exercised warrants, the exercise date is taken into consideration.\n- \u00b7 The computation is based on daily averages; and\n\nDiluted earnings per share data are computed as if all convertible instruments outstanding at year-end were exercised at the beginning of the period. It is also assumed that ING Group uses the assumed proceeds thus received to buy its own shares against the average market price in the financial year. The net increase in the number of shares resulting from the exercise is added to the average number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share.\n\nShare options with fixed or determinable terms are treated as options in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, even though they may be contingent on vesting. They are treated as outstanding on the grant date. Performance-based employee share options are treated as contingently issuable shares because their issue is contingent upon satisfying specified conditions in addition to the passage of time.\n\n## 1.24   Statement of cash flows\n\nThe statement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method, distinguishing cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In the net cash flow from operating activities, the result before tax is adjusted for those items in the statement of profit or loss and changes in items per the statement of financial position, which do not result in actual cash flows during the year.\n\nFor the purposes of the statement of cash flows, Cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with less than three months' maturity from the date of acquisition, including cash and balances with central banks,\n\ntreasury bills and other eligible bills, amounts due from other banks, and deposits from banks. Investments qualify as a cash equivalent if they are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nCash flows arising from foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the date of the cash flows.\n\nThe net cash flow shown in respect of Loans and advances to customers relates only to transactions involving actual payments or receipts. The Addition to loan loss provision which is deducted from the item Loans and advances to customers in the statement of financial position has been adjusted accordingly from the result before tax and is shown separately in the statement of cash flows.\n\nThe difference between the Net cash flow in accordance with the statement of cash flows and the change between the opening and closing balance of Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position is due to exchange rate differences and is presented separately in the cash flow statement.\n\nLiabilities arising from financing activities are debt securities, lease liabilities and subordinated loans.\n\n## 1.25   Parent company accounts\n\nThe parent company accounts of ING Groep N.V. are prepared in accordance with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In accordance with subsection 8 of section 362, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, the recognition and measurement principles applied in the Parent company accounts are the same as those applied in the Consolidated financial statements.",

This was a diversified buy-and-hold portfolio aimed at generating stable dividend income stream.\n\nIn 2022, exchange rate differences of EUR -39 million are mainly related to the stake in Bank of Beijing following the depreciation of CNY vs EUR. Furthermore, changes in unrealised revaluations of equity securities are mainly related to negative revaluation of the stake in Bank of Beijing following a decline in share price (EUR -49 million).\n\n## FVOCI debt instruments\n\nIn 2022, changes in unrealised revaluations of EUR -3,230 million relate to increased yield curves.\n\nReference is made to Note 6 'Securities at amortised cost' for details on ING Group's total exposure to debt securities.\n\n## 6   Securities at amortised cost\n\nSecurities at amortised cost fully consist of Debt securities.

TTB is providing products and services to Wholesale, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME), and Retail customers. TTB is accounted for as an investment in associate based on the size of ING shareholding and representation on the Board.\n\n## Other investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nIncluded in Other investments in associates and joint ventures are mainly financial services and (non) financial technology funds or vehicles operating predominantly in Europe, and represents a number of associates and joint ventures that are individually not significant to ING Group.\n\nSignificant influence for associates in which the interest held is below 20%, is based on the combination of ING Group's financial interest and other arrangements, such as participation in the Board of Directors.\n\nThe associates and joint ventures of ING are subject to legal and regulatory restrictions regarding the amount of dividends they can pay to ING. These restrictions are for example dependent on the laws in the country of incorporation for declaring dividends or as a result of minimum capital requirements that are\n\nimposed by industry regulators in the countries in which the associates and joint ventures operate. In addition, the associates and joint ventures also consider other factors in determining the appropriate levels of equity needed. These factors and limitations include, but are not limited to, rating agency and regulatory views, which can change over time.\n\n| Changes in Investments in associates and joint ventures in EUR million   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Opening balance                                                          | 1,587  | 1,475  |\n| Additions                                                                | 48     | 91     |\n| Revaluations                                                             | -8     | -24    |\n| Share of results                                                         | 92     | 141    |\n| Dividends received                                                       | -48    | -34    |\n| Disposals                                                                | -10    | -23    |\n| Impairments                                                              | -192   | -3     |\n| Exchange rate differences                                                | 27     | -31    |\n| Other                                                                    | 4      | -5     |\n| Closing balance                                                          | 1,500  | 1,587  |\n\nShare of results from associates and joint ventures of EUR 92 million (2021: EUR 141 million) as included in the table above is mainly attributable to results of TTB of EUR 81 million (2021: EUR 61 million). In 2021, share of results from associates includes additional EUR 28 million gain on our stake in Ebusco.\n\n## Impairments\n\nIn 2022, Impairments of EUR 192 million is predominantly attributable to TTB of EUR 165 million. TTB is part of the Retail Other segment.\n\n## Impairment testing TTB\n\nThe fair value of TTB has been below the purchase cost of the investment for a prolonged period of time (since 1Q 2020). This is considered to be objective evidence of impairment. As a result ING performed quarterly impairment tests that led to impairment loss of EUR 165 million (2021: EUR nil).\n\nThe impairment test performed in 2022 led to an impairment at 31 March 2022 of EUR 150 million and EUR 15 million at 30 September 2022, as the recoverable amount as determined by a Value in Use calculation, was below the carrying amount  at that point in time. The impairment test at year end resulted in no further impairments.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and Value in Use ('VIU'). Fair value less costs of disposal is based on observable share price. The VIU calculation uses",

VIU is derived using a Dividend Discount Model (DDM) where distributable equity, i.e. future earnings available to ordinary shareholders, is used as a proxy for future cash flows. The valuation looks at expected cash flows into perpetuity resulting in two main components to the VIU calculation:\n\n- \u00b7 the estimation of future earnings over a 5 year forecast period; and\n- \u00b7 the terminal value being the extrapolation of earnings into perpetuity applying a long term growth rate. The earnings that are used for extrapolation represent the stable long term financial results and position of TTB, i.e. a steady state. The terminal value comprises the majority of the total VIU.\n\n## Key assumptions used in the VIU calculation as at 31 December 2022 (and as at 30 September 2022 resulting in impairment)\n\nThe VIU is determined using a valuation model which is subject to multiple management assumptions. The key assumptions, i.e. those to which the overall result is most sensitive to, are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Expected future earnings of TTB: Short to medium term expectations are based on forecasts derived from broker consensus. Longer term and steady state expectations into perpetuity are derived using reasonable and supportable  assumptions capturing a combination of TTB specific and market data points. A capital maintenance charge is applied, which is management's forecast of the earnings that need to be withheld in order for TTB to meet target regulatory requirements over the forecast period;\n- \u00b7 Discount rate (cost of equity): 9.71% (30 September 2022: 10.54%), based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) calculated for TTB using current market data.\n- \u00b7 Terminal growth rate: 3.05% (30 September 2022: 3.82%) consistent with current long term government bond yield in Thailand as a proxy for a risk-free rate;\n\nTo assess the risk of further impairment at 31 December 2022, the model was evaluated for reasonably possible changes to key assumptions in the model. This reflects the sensitivity of the VIU to each key assumption on its own and it is possible that more than one favourable and/or unfavourable change may occur at the same time. Holding the other key assumptions constant, a reduction in all of the forecasted annual cash flows, including terminal value, of 836bps would reduce the recoverable amount to the carrying amount. An increase of 55bps in terminal growth rate and discount rate would cause the VIU to equal the carrying amount.\n\nReversal of the impairment loss recognised was not considered appropriate as at 31 December 2022 mainly due to the lack of sufficiently positive changes observed in the underlying performance of TTB since the impairment loss as reflected in the broker consensus. Furthermore, the share price remains below the original cost of the investment for a prolonged period of time.\n\n## 9   Property and equipment\n\n| in EUR million              | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Property in own use         | 681    | 702    |\n| Equipment:                  |        |        |\n| - Data processing equipment | 213    | 207    |\n| - Other equipment           | 476    | 493    |\n| Right- of- use assets:      |        |        |\n| - ROU property              | 1,000  | 1,009  |\n| - ROU cars                  | 64     | 83     |\n| - ROU other leases          | 12     | 21     |\n|                             | 2,446  | 2,515  |\n\n## Changes in property and equipment\n\n|                                  | Property in own use   | Property in own use   | Equipment   | Equipment   | Right-of-use assets   | Right-of-use assets   |        | Total   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------|---------|\n| in EUR million                   | 2022                  | 2021                  | 2022        | 2021        | 2022                  | 2021                  | 2022   | 2021    |\n| Opening balance                  | 702                   | 745                   | 699         | 842         | 1,113                 | 1,255                 | 2,515  | 2,841   |\n| Additions                        | 2                     | 9                     | 229         | 175         | 173                   | 164                   | 404    | 348     |\n| Transfers                        | -1                    | -5                    | -1          | 1           | -4                    | -20                   | -5     | -24     |\n| Depreciation                     | -13                   | -15                   | -220        | -287        | -252                  | -271                  | -485   | -573    |\n| Impairments 1                    | -9                    | -10                   | -16         | -8          | -9                    | -15                   | -35    | -33     |\n| Reversals of impairments         | 16                    | 6                     |             |             |                       | 1                     | 16     | 7       |\n| Remeasurements                   | 15                    | 17                    |             |             | 67                    | 6                     | 81     | 24      |\n| Disposals                        | -67                   | -24                   | -15         | -15         | -15                   | -10                   | -98    | -49     |\n| Exchange rate differences        | 36                    | -21                   | 13          | -7          | 3                     | 4                     | 52     | -25     |\n| Closing balance                  | 681                   | 702                   | 688         | 699         | 1,076                 | 1,113                 | 2,446  | 2,515   |\n| Costprice                        | 847                   | 910                   | 3,554       | 3,581       | 1,680                 | 1,738                 | 6,081  | 6,229   |\n| Accumulated depreciation         | -362                  | -373                  | -2,853      | -2,871      | -714                  | -644                  | -3,929 | -3,888  |\n| Accumulated impairments          | -107                  | -134                  | -12         | -10         | -21                   | -29                   | -140   | -173    |\n| Accumulated revaluation  surplus | 304                   | 299                   |             |             |                       |                       | 304    | 299     |\n| Accumulated  remeasurement       |                       |                       |             |             | 130                   | 48                    | 130    | 48      |\n| Net carrying value               | 681                   | 702                   | 688         | 699         | 1,076                 | 1,113                 | 2,446  | 2,515   |\n\n1 Impairments of property and equipment are presented within Other operating expenses in the statement of Profit or Loss.",

Property in own use purchase costs amounted to EUR 847 million (2021: EUR 910 million). Cost or the purchase price less accumulated depreciation and impairments would have been EUR 368 million (2021: EUR 403 million) had property in own use been valued at cost instead of at fair value.\n\nThe reported impairment losses of EUR -35 million (2021: EUR -33 million) mainly result from a change in the post-pandemic way of working through downscaling of physical office spaces.\n\n##

group of cash generating units (CGUs) 'Retail Growth Markets' was re-allocated to the underlying CGUs Retail Romania, Retail Poland and Retail Turkey using a relative value approach.\n\nGoodwill is

quarter by comparing the recoverable amount of each goodwill-carrying CGU with its carrying amount. The key assumptions used in the calculation of the recoverable amounts are included in the table above. Furthermore, ING Group tests goodwill whenever a triggering event is identified, as with the re-allocation from Group of CGUs to country level CGUs on 1 January 2022. The re-allocated goodwill to Turkey CGU, after first being adjusted for hyperinflation accounting for EUR 25 million, was fully impaired for the amount of EUR 32 million (based on discount rate 24.04% and terminal growth rate 10.40% as per 1 January 2022). Turkey is part of the Retail Other segment.\n\nAt the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the CGUs as at 31 December 2022 and therefore no impairment is required.\n\n## Methodology\n\nIn line with IFRS, the recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and Value in Use (VIU). The VIU calculation is based on a Dividend Discount model using three year management approved plans, updated for expected changes in the macroeconomic environment. When estimating the VIU of a CGU, local conditions and requirements determine the capital requirements, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. These local conditions and requirements determine the ability to upstream excess capital and profits to ING Group. The discount rate calculation includes other inputs such as equity market premium, country risk premium, and long term inflation which are based on market sources and management's judgement. The long term growth rate for EU-countries is based on long term risk-free rate by reference to the yield of a composite index consisting of Euro generic government bonds, with a maturity of 30 years. For other countries, the growth rate includes long term inflation rate obtained from market sources.",

A decrease in the available cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate of 1 percent point or a reduction of future growth rate to zero are considered reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. If the aforementioned changes occur to one of the above key assumptions holding the other key assumptions constant, goodwill of the remaining CGUs will continue to be recoverable.\n\n## Other changes\n\nOther changes in goodwill in 2022 relate to changes in currency exchange rates of Retail Poland and Retail Romania goodwill.\n\n## Software\n\nSoftware includes internally developed software amounting to EUR 540 million (2021: EUR 573 million).\n\nSoftware is reviewed for indicators of impairment. Irrespective of whether there is an indication of impairment, software under development is tested annually for impairment.

For further information, reference is made to Note 30 'Dividend per ordinary share'.\n\n## Other changes\n\nOther changes includes an amount of EUR -1,983 million (2021: EUR -140 million), which corresponds to the purchase and cancellation of treasury shares purchased under the share buyback programmes.\n\nOrdinary shares - Restrictions with respect to dividend and repayment of capital The following equity components cannot be freely distributed: Revaluation reserves, Net defined benefit asset/liability remeasurement reserve, Currency translation reserve, Share of associates and joint ventures reserve and Other reserves including the part related to the former Stichting Regio Bank and the former Stichting Vakbondsspaarbank SPN.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, an amount of EUR 2,264 million (2021: EUR 2,103 million; 2020: EUR 1,912 million) related to the former Stichting Regio Bank and the former Stichting Vakbondsspaarbank SPN is included.\n\nING Groep N.V. is subject to legal restrictions regarding the amount of dividends it can pay to the holders of its ordinary shares. Pursuant to the Dutch Civil Code, dividends can only be paid up to an amount equal to the excess of the company's own funds over the sum of the paid-up capital and reserves required by law.\n\nMoreover, ING Groep N.V.'s ability to pay dividends is dependent on the dividend payment ability of its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. ING Groep N.V. is legally required to create a non-distributable reserve insofar as profits of its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are subject to dividend payment restrictions which apply to those subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures themselves.\n\nNon distributable reserves, determined in accordance with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, from ING Group's subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are as follows:\n\n## Non-distributable reserves\n\n| In EUR million             | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| ING Bank                   | 8,408  | 8,205  | 9,829  |\n| Other                      | 0      | 0      | 2      |\n| Non-distributable reserves | 8,408  | 8,205  | 9,831  |\n\nIn addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions on distributing dividends from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to ING Groep N.V. there are various other considerations and limitations that are taken into account in determining the appropriate levels of equity in the Group's subsidiaries, associates and joint\n\nventures. These considerations and limitations include, but are not restricted to, minimum capital requirements that are imposed by industry regulators in the countries in which the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures operate, or other limitations which may exist in certain countries and may or may not be temporary in nature. It is not possible to disclose a reliable quantification of these limitations. Without prejudice to the authority of the Executive Board to allocate profits to reserves and to the fact that the ordinary shares are the most junior securities issued by ING Groep N.V., no specific dividend payment restrictions with respect to ordinary shares exist. Refer to Note 50 'Capital management' for further details of the minimal capital requirements and dividend policy of ING Group.\n\nFurthermore, ING Groep N.V. is subject to legal restrictions with respect to repayment of capital to holders of ordinary shares. Pursuant to the Dutch Civil Code, capital may only be repaid if none of ING Groep N.V.'s creditors opposes such a repayment within two months following the announcement of a resolution to that effect.\n\n## Cumulative preference shares (not issued)\n\nPursuant to the Articles of Association of ING Groep N.V. the authorised cumulative preference share capital consists of 4.6 billion cumulative preference shares, of which none have been issued. The par value of these cumulative preference shares is EUR 0.01. A right to acquire cumulative preference shares has been granted to Stichting Continu\u00efteit ING (ING Continuity Foundation).\n\nThe cumulative preference shares rank before the ordinary shares in entitlement to dividend and to distributions upon liquidation of ING Groep N.V.\n\nThe dividend on the cumulative preference shares will be equal to a percentage, calculated on the amount compulsorily paid up or yet to be paid up. This percentage shall be equal to the average of the Euro shortterm rate (\u20acSTR) as calculated by the European Central Bank during the financial year for which the distribution is made; this percentage being weighted on the basis of the number of days for which it applies, and increased by 2.585 percentage points.\n\nIf, and to the extent that the profit available for distribution is not sufficient to pay the dividend referred to above in full, the shortfall will be made up from the reserves insofar as possible. If, and to the extent that, the dividend distribution cannot be made from the reserves, the profits earned in subsequent years shall first be used to make up the shortfall before any distribution may be made on shares of any other category.\n\nING Groep N.V.'s Articles of Association make provision for the cancellation of cumulative preference shares. Upon cancellation of cumulative preference shares and upon liquidation of ING Groep N.V., the amount paid up on the cumulative preference shares will be repaid together with the accrued dividend as well as any dividend shortfall in preceding years, insofar as this shortfall has not yet been made up. No specific dividend payment restrictions with respect to the cumulative preference shares exist.",

Despite a one-off impact related to credit moratoria in Poland (EUR -343 million), net interest income is increasing: a reflection of the changing interest rate environment which reprices faster on the asset side than the liability side of the balance sheet.\n\nNegative interest on liabilities in 2022, amounting to EUR 887 million (2021: EUR 1,487 million) includes ECB funding rate benefit from the TLTRO III programme of EUR 314 million (2021: EUR 808 million).\n\nAs ING met the 2020-2021 TLTRO III lending growth targets, the funding rate for TLTRO III amounted -100 bps during the special interest periods between 24 June 2020 and 23 June 2022 (of which -50 bps was\n\nunconditional and -50 bps was conditional). As a result, -100 bps was the applicable TLTRO III rate throughout the entire 2021 and the first half of 2022 until 23 June 2022.\n\nIn October 2022, the ECB changed the terms of the unconditional interest related to the periods before and after the special interest periods. Interest rate before 24 June 2020 and from 23 June 2022 until 22 November 2022 is now based on the average Deposit Facility (DF) rate during the period between the draw down date until 22 November 2022. As ING participated in series 3, 4 and 7 of TLTRO III, 3 different average DF rates apply to those and comprised -37 bps, -36 bps and -29 bps, respectively.\n\nUnder the revised terms of TLTRO III, interest rate after 22 November 2022 until maturity is now based on the average DF rate during that period instead of the average DF rate for the whole life of TLTRO III, as it was",

The securities trading results are partly offset by results on these derivatives. The result of these derivatives is included in Derivatives trading results.\n\nOther trading results include the results of trading loans and funds entrusted.\n\nForeign exchange transactions results include gains and losses from spot and forward contracts, options, futures, and translated foreign currency assets and liabilities. The result on currency trading is included in foreign exchange transactions results.\n\nNet trading income relates to trading assets and trading liabilities which include assets and liabilities that are classified under IFRS as Trading but are closely related to servicing the needs of the clients of ING. ING offers products that are traded on the financial markets to institutional clients, corporate clients, and governments. ING Group's trading books are managed based on internal limits and comprise a mix of products with results which could be offset. A significant part of the derivatives in the trading portfolio are related to servicing corporate clients in their risk management to hedge for example currency or interest rate exposures. From a risk perspective, the gross amount of trading assets must be considered together with the gross amount of trading liabilities, which are presented separately on the statement of financial position. However, IFRS does not always allow netting of these positions in the statement of financial position. Reference is made to Note 4 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' and Note 14 'Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss' for information on trading assets and trading liabilities respectively.\n\n'Valuation results and net trading income' include the fair value movements on derivatives (used for both hedge accounting and economically hedging exposures) as well as the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities included in hedging relationships as hedged items. During 2022, the interest rate movements significantly affected the fair value changes of other non-trading derivatives as well as the fair value changes of both the derivatives and the hedged items designated in fair value hedges. Reference is made to Note 39 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' for information on derivatives used for hedge accounting.\n\nFurthermore, derivatives trading results is also impacted by fair value movements arising from changes in credit spreads (CVA and DVA), bid offer spreads, model risk and incremental cost of funding on derivatives (FVA and CollVA). Spreads widened in 2022 compared to 2021 and the fair value changes increased.\n\nIn 2022, Derivatives trading results include EUR 43 million CVA/DVA adjustments on trading derivatives (2021: EUR 98 million; 2020: EUR 17 million).\n\nValuation results on assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (excluding trading)' include fair value changes on financial assets and financial liabilities driven by changed market conditions. Refer to Note 4 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' and to Note 14 'Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss'.\n\nIn addition, 'Valuation results on assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (excluding trading)' include fair value adjustments on own issued notes amounting to EUR 745 million (2021: EUR 65 million; 2020: EUR -1 million).\n\nInterest income from trading assets in 2022 amounted to EUR 18,593 million (2021: EUR 13,737 million; 2020: EUR 13,412 million).

This was offset by a tax profit for the same amount resulting from the release of the provision for uncertain tax positions in current tax liabilities.\n\n## 26   Staff Expenses\n\n| in EUR million                                      | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Salaries                                            | 4,145  | 4,011  | 3,751  |\n| Pension costs and other staff-related benefit costs | 390    | 408    | 395    |\n| Social security costs                               | 584    | 563    | 538    |\n| Share-based compensation arrangements               | 26     | 31     | 19     |\n| External employees                                  | 738    | 699    | 881    |\n| Education                                           | 47     | 47     | 43     |\n| Other staff costs                                   | 222    | 182    | 186    |\n|                                                     | 6,152  | 5,941  | 5,812  |\n\nShare-based compensation arrangements include EUR 25 million (2021: EUR 29 million; 2020: EUR 17 million) relating to equity-settled share-based payment arrangements and EUR 1 million (2021: EUR 2 million; 2020: EUR 2 million) relating to cash-settled share-based payment arrangements.\n\n| Number of employees                                                        | Netherlands   | Netherlands   | Netherlands   | Rest of the world   | Rest of the world   | Rest of the world   | Rest of the world   |        |        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                                                            | 2022          | 2021          | 2020          | 2022                | 2021                | 2020                | 2022                | 2021   | 2020   |\n| Total average number of  internal employees at full  time equivalent basis | 14,488        | 15,138        | 15,201        | 43,081              | 42,523              | 40,701              | 57,569              | 57,660 | 55,901 |\n\nRemuneration of senior management, Executive Board and Supervisory Board Reference is made to Note 49 'Related parties'.\n\n## Share plans and Stock Options\n\nING grants various types of share awards, namely deferred shares, performance shares and upfront shares, which form part of the variable remuneration offering via the Long-term Sustainable Performance Plan (LSPP). The entitlement to the LSPP share awards is granted conditionally. If the participant remains in employment for an uninterrupted period between the grant date and the vesting date, the entitlement becomes unconditional, with the exception of the upfront shares which are immediately vested upon grant. Upfront and deferred shares awarded to the Management Board members of ING Group as well as identified staff, have a retention obligation that must be adhered to upon vesting, typically a minimum retention of 12 months applies. ING has the authority to apply a holdback to awarded but unvested shares and a clawback to vested shares.\n\nThe share awards granted in 2022 relate to the performance year 2021. In 2022, 55,651 share awards (2021: 0; 2020: 63,837) were granted to the members of the Executive Board of ING Groep N.V., and 137,506 share awards (2021: 123,750; 2020: 122,338) were granted to the Management Board Banking. To senior management and other employees 2,913,926 share awards (2021: 3,267,372; 2020: 3,678,776) were granted.\n\nThe obligations with regard to share plans are funded by newly issued shares at the discretion of ING Group.",

In calculating the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, own shares held by group companies (including share buyback programmes) are deducted from the total number of ordinary shares in issue.\n\n## Dilutive instruments\n\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated as if the share plans outstanding at the end of the period had been exercised at the beginning of the period and assuming that the cash received from dilutive instruments (if any) is used to buy own shares against the average market price during the period. The net increase in the number of shares resulting from exercising share plans is added to the average number of shares used for the calculation of diluted earnings per share. From 2021, the effect of dilutive instruments no longer includes stock options. The stock option scheme was terminated in 2020.\n\n## 30   Dividend per ordinary share\n\n## Dividends to shareholders of the parent\n\n|                                             | Per ordinary share (in EUR)   | Total (in EUR million)   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Dividends on ordinary shares:               |                               |                          |\n| - Interim dividend, paid in February 2021 1 | 0.12                          | 468                      |\n| Total dividend in respect of 2020           | 0.12                          | 468                      |\n| In respect of 2021                          |                               |                          |\n| - Interim dividend, paid in October 2021    | 0.21                          | 820                      |\n| - Final dividend, paid in May 2022          | 0.41                          | 1,548                    |\n| Total dividend in respect of 2021           | 0.62                          | 2,368                    |\n| In respect of 2022                          |                               |                          |\n| - Interim dividend, paid in August 2022     | 0.17                          | 636                      |\n| - Final dividend declared                   | 0.389                         | 1,408                    |\n| Total dividend in respect of 2022           | 0.559                         | 2,044                    |",

The Executive Board and the Management Board Banking consider this to be relevant to an understanding of the Group's financial performance, because it allows investors to understand the primary method used by management to evaluate the Group's operating performance and make decisions about allocating resources.\n\nING Group reconciles the total segment results to the total result using Corporate Line. The Corporate Line is a reflection of capital management activities and certain income and expenses that are not allocated to the banking businesses. Furthermore, the Corporate Line includes the isolated legacy costs (mainly negative interest results) caused by the replacement of short-term funding with long-term funding during 2013 and 2014. ING Group applies a system of capital charging for its banking operations in order to create a comparable basis for the results of business units globally, irrespective of the business units' book equity and the currency they operate in. In 2022, results in the Corporate Line were impacted by the application of hyperinflation accounting in the consolidation of our subsidiary in Turkey.\n\nIncome in 2022 included a hyperinflation accounting impact of EUR -279 million and a net TLTRO impact of EUR 16 million, while previous year was supported by a EUR 143 million net TLTRO impact and the recognition of a EUR 72 million receivable related to the insolvency of a financial institution. The decline was partly compensated by higher income from foreign currency ratio hedging, mainly on US dollar and the Polish zloty. Expenses in 2022 included a hyperinflation impact of EUR 30 million and a EUR 32 million impairment loss related to the goodwill allocated to Turkey, while previous year had included EUR 87 million of regulatory costs due to an incidental 50% increase in the Dutch bank tax.\n\nThe information presented in this note is in line with the information presented to the Executive Board of ING Group and Management Board Banking.\n\nThis note does not provide information on the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues, as this is not reported internally and is therefore not readily available.",

A geographical area is a distinguishable component of the Group engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of geographical areas operating in other economic environments. The geographical analyses are based on the location of the office from which the transactions are originated and do not include countries where ING only has representation offices. The Netherlands is ING Group's country of domicile.\n\nIn order to increase ING Group's tax transparency, additional financial information on a per country basis has been included in this disclosure: Tax paid represents all income tax paid to and/or received from tax authorities in the current year, irrespective of the fiscal year to which these payments or refunds relate.\n\n## Additional information by country\n\nTotal assets by country does not include intercompany balances and reconciles to the total assets in the consolidated statement of financial position of ING Group. In December 2021 the OECD released a draft legislative framework that is designed to ensure, from 2024 onwards, that large multinational groups pay income tax at a minimum rate of 15% in all the countries they are present in. At the date when these financial statements were authorized for issue, of all the countries ING is present in, only South Korea has enacted legislation to this effect. At 31 December 2022 ING Group does not have sufficient information to determine the future potential quantitative impact.\n\nThe table below provide additional information, for the years 2022, 2021

Philippines.\n\n## 2022\n\nThe higher tax charge of 39% in the Netherlands (compared to the statutory rate of 25.8%) is mainly caused by the non-deductible Dutch bank tax (EUR 179 million) and the non-deductible impairments regarding goodwill ING Turkey (EUR 32 million) and TTB (EUR 165 million).\n\nThe higher positive tax charge of Turkey combined with its accounting loss based on hyperinflation accounting  is mainly caused by the non deductibility of this loss for tax purposes.\n\nSince the Russian invasion of the Ukraine our strategy is no new business with Russian clients, including Russian owned entities outside of Russia and to get existing Russia-related credit exposures repaid as quickly as possible. These exposures are booked in various countries and totalled EUR 6.7 billion, published on 4 March 2022. Remaining at risk for ING Group at year-end 2022 is EUR 0.3 billion local equity and EUR 2.5 billion credit exposures booked outside of Russia. In 2022, ING's results in connection with Russia-related credit exposures declined significantly, as we have recognized EUR 0.5 billion",

This was driven by the high local interest rate environment and increased rouble inflow from existing, predominantly non-Russian, clients. Under local law and banking regulations, ING Russia must accept these rouble inflows. Furthermore, the local result before tax expressed in euro (EUR 128 million) was positively impacted by the appreciation of the rouble against the euro for an amount of EUR 80 million throughout 2022. Going forward, we will continue to actively reduce our Russia-related credit exposure.\n\nThe higher tax charge in Poland is mainly caused by non-deductible regulatory and other costs.\n\n## 2021\n\nThe higher tax charge of 35% in the Netherlands (compared to the statutory rate of 25%) is mainly caused by the non-deductible Dutch bank tax (EUR 260 million) and the impairments on deferred tax assets regarding Payvision and Yolt (EUR 26 million tax).\n\nThe lower tax charge in Austria is caused by previously not recognised tax losses (EUR -10 million tax).\n\nThe higher tax charge in Poland is mainly caused by non-deductible regulatory- and other costs.\n\n## 2020\n\nThe higher tax charge of 45% in the Netherlands (compared to the statutory rate of 25%) is mainly caused by the non-deductible Dutch bank tax (EUR 169 million) and the non-deductible impairments regarding goodwill (EUR 266 million) and TMB (EUR 230 million).\n\nThe lower tax charge in Australia is caused by a release of a tax provision after concluding a settlement with the Australian Tax Authorities on an issue related to former Insurance activities, which issue was fully indemnified by NN Group.\n\nThe higher tax charges in Brazil and the Philippines are mainly caused by the de-recognition of tax benefits for incurred tax losses due to expected insufficient future taxable profits.\n\nThe higher tax charges in Poland and Belgium are mainly caused by non-deductible regulatory- and other costs.\n\n## Additional notes to the Consolidated financial statements\n\n## 36   Pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\nMost group companies sponsor defined contribution pension plans. The assets of all ING Group's defined contribution plans are held in independently administered funds. Contributions, including the defined contribution plan in the Netherlands, are principally determined as a percentage of remuneration. These plans do not give rise to provisions in the statement of financial position, other than relating to short-term timing differences included in other assets and in other liabilities.\n\nING Group maintains defined benefit retirement plans in some countries. These plans provide benefits that are related to the remuneration and service of employees upon retirement. The benefits in some of these plans are subject to various forms of indexation. The indexation is, in some cases, at the discretion of management; in other cases it is dependent upon the sufficiency of plan assets.\n\nAnnual contributions are paid to the funds at a rate necessary to adequately finance the accrued liabilities of the plans calculated in accordance with local legal requirements. Plans in all countries are designed to comply with applicable local regulations governing investments and funding levels.\n\nING Group provides other post-employment benefits to certain former employees. These are primarily discounts on ING products.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nING, as part of the labour agreements with its employee's , sponsors a number of defined contribution plans. ING's obligation is limited to contributions which are agreed in advance and also includes employee contributions. The most significant plans are in The Netherlands and Belgium. The Employer contribution are recognized as an expense which amounted for 2022 EUR 364 million (2021: EUR 369 million).",

The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were determined using the projected unit credit method.\n\nThe current worldwide uncertainty due to the Russian invasion in the Ukraine and the resulting increasing interest rates and inflation has a strong negative impact on most investment markets in 2022, the effect on the fair value of ING Group's plan assets and defined benefit obligation is significant however the funding status declined only by EUR -78 million mainly following the Liability Driven Investment (LDI) strategy in the United Kingdom.\n\nChanges in the fair value of plan assets for the period were as follows:\n\n| Changes in fair value of plan assets in EUR million                                 | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Opening balance                                                                     | 3,671  | 3,583  |\n| Interest income                                                                     | 54     | 37     |\n| Remeasurements: Return on plan assets excluding amounts included in interest income | -947   | 2      |\n| Employer's contribution                                                             | 34     | 26     |\n| Participants contributions                                                          | 3      | 2      |\n| Benefits paid                                                                       | -126   | -136   |\n| Exchange rate differences                                                           | -53    | 158    |\n| Closing balance                                                                     | 2,637  | 3,671  |\n| Actual return on the plan assets                                                    | -894   | 39     |\n\nAs at 31 December 2022 the defined benefit plans did not hold any direct investments in ING Groep N.V. (2021: nil). During 2022 and 2021 there were no purchases or sales of assets between ING and the pension funds.\n\nING does not manage the pension funds and thus receives no compensation for fund management. The pension funds have not engaged ING in any swap or derivative transactions to manage the risk of the pension funds.\n\nNo plan assets are expected to be returned to ING Group during 2023.",

Also the war in Ukraine and high inflation had impact on the investment return. Material changes in interest rates and equity returns impacted plan assets negatively during 2022 substantially.\n\nThe EUR 882 million (2021: EUR 122 million) actuarial gains arising from changes in financial assumptions in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation are mainly due to an increase in discount rates.\n\nThe accumulated amount of remeasurements recognised directly in Other comprehensive income is EUR -289 million (EUR -232 million after tax) as at 31 December 2022 (2021: EUR -296 million; EUR -212 million after tax).\n\nAmounts recognised in the statement of profit or loss related to pension and other staff related benefits are as follows:\n\n|                                             | Net defined benefit  asset/liability   | Net defined benefit  asset/liability   | Net defined benefit  asset/liability   | Other post-employment   | Other post-employment   | Other post-employment   |      |      |      |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------|------|------|\n| in EUR million                              | 2022                                   | 2021                                   | 2020                                   | 2022                    | 2021                    | 2020                    | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n| Current service cost                        | 33                                     | 33                                     | 31                                     | 1                       | 1                       | -2                      | 34   | 34   | 29   |\n| Past service cost                           |                                        |                                        | 2                                      | -1                      |                         |                         |      |      | 2    |\n| Net Interest cost                           | -8                                     | -6                                     | -6                                     | 1                       | 2                       | 2                       | -6   | -4   | -4   |\n| Effect of curtailment or settlement         |                                        |                                        |                                        |                         | -2                      |                         |      | -2   |      |\n| Defined benefit plans                       | 26                                     | 27                                     | 27                                     | 2                       | 1                       | 0                       | 27   | 28   | 28   |\n| Defined contribution plans                  |                                        |                                        |                                        |                         |                         |                         | 364  | 369  | 356  |\n| Pension and other post employment  benefits |                                        |                                        |                                        |                         |                         |                         | 392  | 397  | 383  |\n| Other staff related benefits                |                                        |                                        |                                        |                         |                         |                         | -2   | 11   | 12   |\n| Pension and other staff-related benefits    |                                        |                                        |                                        |                         |                         |                         | 390  | 408  | 395  |\n\n## Determination of the net defined benefit asset/liability\n\nThe net defined benefit asset/liability is reviewed and adjusted annually. The assumptions used in the determination of the net defined benefit asset/liability and the Other post-employment benefits include discount rates, mortality rates, expected rates of salary increases (excluding promotion increases), and indexation. The rates used for salary developments, interest discount factors, and other adjustments reflect country-specific conditions.\n\nThe key assumption in the determination of the net defined benefit asset/liability is the discount rate. The discount rate is the weighted average of the discount rates that are applied in different regions where ING Group has defined benefit pension plans (weighted by the defined benefit obligation). The discount rate is based on a methodology that uses market yields on high quality corporate bonds of the specific regions",

Market yields of high quality corporate bonds reflect the yield on corporate bonds with an AA rating for durations where such yields are available. An extrapolation is applied in order to determine the yield to the longer durations for which no AA-rated corporate bonds are available. As a result of the limited availability of long-duration AA-rated corporate bonds, extrapolation is an important element of the determination of the discount rate. The weighted average discount rate applied for net defined benefit asset/liability for 2022 was 4.3% (2021: 1.5%) based on the pension plan in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, The United States of America, and the United Kingdom. The average discount rate applied for Other post-employment benefits in 2022 was 5.5% (2021: 2.9%).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of key assumptions\n\nING performs sensitivity analyses on the most significant assumptions: discount rates, mortality, expected rate of salary increase, and indexation. The sensitivity analysis has been carried out under the assumption that the changes occurred at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis calculates the financial impact on the defined benefit obligation of an increase or decrease of the weighted averages of each significant actuarial assumption, all other assumptions held constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and some changes of the assumptions may be correlated. Changes to mortality, expected rate of salary increase, and indexation would have no material impact on the defined benefit obligation. The most significant impact would be from a change in the discount rate. An increase or decrease in the discount rate of 1.0% creates an impact on the defined benefit obligation of  EUR 247 million (decrease) and EUR 287 million (increase), respectively.\n\n## Expected cash flows\n\nAnnual contributions are paid to the funds at a rate necessary to adequately finance the accrued liabilities of the plans calculated in accordance with local supervisory requirements. Plans in all countries are designed to comply with applicable local regulations governing investments and funding levels.

Other in 2022 is EUR -123 million (2021:EUR -83 million) is due to FX developments following the USD depreciation and the application of IAS 29 Hyperinflation in Turkey and also due to the increase in the Liability Credit Reserve due to spread widening.\n\n## Changes in deferred tax\n\n| in EUR million  2021                                  | Net  liability (-)  Net asset (+)  opening  balance   | Change  through  equity   | Change  through  net result   | Exchange  rate  differenc es   | Changes in  the composi- tion of the  group and  other  changes   | Net  liability (-)  Net asset (+)  ending  balance   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets at FVOCI                             | -103                                                  | 26                        | -1                            | 1                              | 7                                                                 | -70                                                  |\n| Financial assets and liabilities at FVPL              | 134                                                   |                           | -39                           | 20                             | -7                                                                | 107                                                  |\n| Depreciation                                          | -10                                                   |                           | 5                             | -2                             |                                                                   | -7                                                   |\n| Cash flow hedges                                      | -360                                                  | 233                       |                               | 1                              |                                                                   | -126                                                 |\n| Pension and post-employment benefits                  | 36                                                    | -54                       | -23                           | -8                             |                                                                   | -49                                                  |\n| Other provisions                                      | -5                                                    |                           | 28                            | -4                             |                                                                   | 19                                                   |\n| Loans and advances                                    | 517                                                   | -2                        | -83                           | -1                             |                                                                   | 430                                                  |\n| Unused tax losses carried forward                     | 63                                                    |                           | 129                           | 7                              |                                                                   | 199                                                  |\n| Other                                                 | -82                                                   | -83                       | 15                            | 1                              |                                                                   | -148                                                 |\n| Total                                                 | 190                                                   | 120                       | 30                            | 15                             | -1                                                                | 354                                                  |\n| Presented in the statement of financial  position as: |                                                       |                           |                               |                                |                                                                   |                                                      |\n| -

This tax loss can be carried forward for 5 years. Based on a taxable profit forecast, ING considers it probable that the future taxable profits will compensate for this tax loss carry forward position within 2 years. Based on this a deferred tax asset on unused tax losses carried forward (EUR 224 million) is fully recognised. The remaining deferred tax asset in Poland of EUR 167 million relates to temporary tax differences on loans and advances and financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nRecognition is based on the fact that it is probable that the entity will have taxable profits and/or can utilise tax planning opportunities before expiration of the deferred tax assets. Changes in circumstances in future periods may adversely impact the assessment of the recoverability. The uncertainty of the recoverability is taken into account in establishing the deferred tax assets.\n\nAt 31 December 2021 and 2022, ING Group had no significant temporary differences associated with the parent company's investments in subsidiaries as any economic benefit from those investments will not be taxable at parent company level.\n\n## Statement of profit or loss -

It is a marketbased measurement, which is based on assumptions that market participants would use and takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability.\n\nFair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on quoted prices in active market where available. When such quoted prices are not available, the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques.\n\nIn 2022 the financial market witnessed globally a higher-volatility due to a confluence of factors, such as changing expectations about the paths of future interest rates in major advanced economies, energy crisis and geopolitical tensions after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Globally, interest rates hike across EU and US. The USD appreciates against EURO and various currencies during the year. These main factors drive the market-to-market movements across different asset classes and spread movement through the year.\n\nOverall in 2022, financial assets and liabilities, including Level 3, continued to be valued using agreed methodologies and ING continued to limit the unobservable input to arrive at the most appropriate Fair Market value.\n\n## b) Valuation Control framework\n\nThe valuation control framework covers the product approval process (PARP), pricing, market data assessment and independent price verification (IPV), valuation adjustments, model use, fair value hierarchy and day one profit or loss. Valuation processes are governed by various governance bodies, including Local Parameter Committees, Global Valuation and Impairment Committee, Market Data Committee and Valuation Model Committee. All relevant committees meet on a regular basis (monthly/quarterly), where agenda covers the aforementioned valuation controls.\n\nThe Global Valuation and Impairment Committee is responsible for the oversight and the approval of the outcome of impairments (other than loan loss provisions) and valuation processes. It oversees the quality and coherence of valuation methodologies and performance. The Valuation Model Committee is responsible for the approval of all valuation models used for the Fair valuation (IFRS) and Prudent Valuation (CRR) of positions measured at fair value. The Local Parameter Committee discusses the valuation results and monitors the performance of the valuation activities carried out on local or regional level. The Market Data Committee is responsible for the approval of the market data used in valuation.",

They are the adjustments to the output from a valuation technique in order to appropriately determine a fair value in accordance with IFRS13. ING considers various fair value adjustments including Bid-Offer adjustments, Model Risk adjustments, Bilateral Valuation Adjustments (BVA, consisting of Credit Valuation Adjustments or CVA, and Debit valuation Adjustments or DVA), Collateral Valuation Adjustment (CollVA) and Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA).\n\nFor financial instruments where the fair value at initial recognition is based on one or more significant unobservable inputs, a difference between the transaction price and the fair value resulting from the internal valuation process can occur. Such difference is referred to as Day One Profit or Day One Loss (DOP). ING defers material Day One Profit or Loss of instruments with significant unobservable valuation inputs, which are the financial instruments classified as Level 3 and financial instruments with material unobservable inputs into CVA which are not necessarily classified as Level 3. The Day One Profit or Loss is amortised over the life of the instrument, or until the significant unobservable inputs become observable, or until the significant unobservable inputs become non-significant. Both the impact on the profit and loss in 2022 and the Day One Profit or Loss reserve is disclosed in the below table.\n\nThe following table presents the models reserves for financial assets and liabilities.\n\n| in EUR million                     |   2022 |   2021 |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Deferred Day One Profit or Loss  1 |   -108 |     -7 |\n| Own credit adjustments  2          |     75 |    -95 |\n| Bid/Offer                          |   -216 |   -143 |\n| Model Risk                         |    -13 |    -11 |\n| CVA                                |   -192 |   -159 |\n| DVA  2                             |     99 |     30 |\n| CollVA                             |     -8 |     -8 |\n| FVA                                |    -78 |    -95 |\n| Total Valuation Adjustments        |   -441 |   -489 |\n\nOverall, the fair value adjustments balance move down compared to last year end explained by own credit adjustments on own issued liabilities, mainly driven by the widening of ING CDS curve spread across all tenors, and for DVA on derivatives.\n\n## Deferred Day One Profit or Loss Reserve\n\nThe table below summarizes the movement in the aggregate profit not recognised when financial instruments were initially recognised (Day One Profit or Loss), because of the use of valuation techniques for which not all the inputs were market observable data.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022 ING further refined the thresholds to identify trades with significant unobservable CVA which triggered more Day One Profit or Loss deferral. Reference is made to the table below.\n\n| in EUR million                                                      |   2022 |   2021 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Opening balance at 1 January                                        |     -7 |     -5 |\n| DOP deferred on new transactions during the period                  |   -107 |     -8 |\n| DOP recognised in the statement of profit or loss during the period |      6 |      6 |\n| Closing balance at 31 December                                      |   -108 |     -7 |\n\n## Own Credit Adjustment\n\nOwn issued debt and structured notes that are designated at fair value through profit or loss are adjusted for ING's own credit risk by means of DVA.\n\n## Bid-Offer Adjustment\n\nFor positions priced based upon mid-market input parameters, Bid-Offer adjustments are required in order to reflect the valuation of that position based on bid price or offer price. In practice this adjustment accounts for the difference in valuation from 'mid to bid' and 'mid to offer' for long and short exposures respectively. In principle assets are valued at the bid prices and liabilities are valued at the offer price. For certain assets or liabilities, where a market quoted price is not available, the price used is the fair value that is most representative within the bid-offer spread.\n\n## Model Risk Adjustment\n\nFinancial instruments that are valued using a valuation model can be subject to model risk. Model risk is the risk of possible financial loss resulting from pricing model or model-based parameter deficiencies and/or uncertainties.\n\n## Bilateral Valuation Adjustments (Credit and Debit Valuation Adjustments)\n\nBilateral Valuation Adjustment is the valuation adjustment reflecting the counterparty credit risk of derivative contracts. It has a bilateral nature, where both the counterparty's credit risk (i.e. Credit Valuation Adjustment or CVA) and ING's own credit risk (Debit Valuation Adjustment or DVA) are taken into account:\n\n- \u00b7 CVA is the fair value adjustment applicable to derivative instruments to account for the possibility that the counterparty defaults (i.e. it is the market value of the counterparty's credit risk).",

The counterparties' risk of default is measured by probability of default and expected loss given default, which is based on market information including credit default swap (CDS) spreads. Where counterparty CDS spreads are not available, relevant proxy spreads are used. Additionally, wrong-way risk (which occurs when the probability of default by the counterparty increases (decreases) when ING's exposure to the counterparty increases (decreases)) and right-way risk (which occurs when the probability of default by the counterparty increases (decreases) when ING's exposure to the counterparty decreases (increases)) are included in the adjustment.\n\n## Collateral Valuation Adjustment (CollVA)\n\nCollateral Valuation Adjustment is a fair valuation adjustment applied on derivative instruments to capture specific features of CSA (Credit Support Annex) with a counterparty that the regular OIS discounting framework does not capture. Non-standard CSA features may include deviations in relation to the currencies in which ING posts or receives collateral, deviations in remuneration rate on collateral which may pay lower or higher rate than overnight rate or even no interest at all; other deviations can be posting securities rather than cash as collateral, etc.\n\n## Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA)\n\nFunding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) is a fair valuation adjustment applied on derivative instruments to address the asymmetry in funding costs or funding benefits between collateralized and uncollateralized derivatives portfolios. This adjustment is based on the expected exposure profiles of the uncollateralized or partially collateralized OTC derivatives and market-based funding spreads.\n\n## d) Fair value hierarchy\n\nING Group has categorised its financial instruments that are either measured in the statement of financial position at fair value or of which the fair value is disclosed, into a three level hierarchy based on the observability of the valuation inputs. Highest priority is retained to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to valuation techniques supported by unobservable inputs.\n\nTransfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels are made on a quarterly basis at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Level 1 - (Unadjusted) quoted prices in active markets\n\nThis category includes financial instruments whose fair value is determined directly by reference to\n\n(unadjusted) quoted prices in an active market. A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer markets, brokered markets, or principal to principal markets. Those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Transfers out of Level 1 into Level 2 or Level 3 occur when ING Group establishes that markets are no longer active and therefore (unadjusted) quoted prices no longer provide reliable pricing information.\n\n## Level 2 - Valuation technique supported by observable inputs\n\nThis category includes financial instruments whose fair value is based on market observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, other than quoted prices included within Level 1. The fair value for financial instruments in this category can be determined by reference to quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or market-corroborated inputs. ING analyses how the prices are derived and determines whether the prices are liquid tradable prices or model-based consensus prices taking various data as inputs.\n\nFor financial instruments that do not have a reference price available, fair value is determined using a valuation technique (e.g., a model), where inputs in the model are taken from an active market or are observable, such as interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities, and credit spreads.\n\nInstruments, where inputs are unobservable are classified in this category, provided that the impact of those unobservable inputs on the overall valuation is insignificant. The notion of significant is particularly relevant for the distinction between Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities, as the significance assessment of the valuation input on the entire fair value measurement will determine whether the instrument should be classified as Level 2 or Level 3. Expert judgement is required on the significance assessment approach.\n\n## Level 3 - Valuation technique supported by unobservable inputs\n\nThis category includes financial instruments whose fair value is determined using a valuation technique for which a significant part of the overall valuation is driven by unobservable valuation inputs. Where valuation inputs are unobservable, the Group must use the best information available to value the instruments. This may require internally derived inputs taking into account market participants assumptions that are reasonably available, including assumptions on the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value and the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Unobservable inputs may include, among others, volatility, correlation, spreads to discount rates, default rates, recovery rates, prepayment rates, and certain credit spreads.",

In absence of active markets, fair values are estimated by analysing the investee's financial position, result, risk profile, prospect, price, earnings comparisons and revenue multiples. Additionally, reference is made to valuations of peer entities where quoted prices in active markets are available. For equity securities best market practice will be applied using the most relevant valuation method. All non-listed equity investments, including investments in private equity funds, are subject to a standard review framework which ensures that valuations reflect the fair values.\n\nFair value hierarchy: The majority of equity securities are publicly traded and quoted prices are readily and regularly available. Hence, these securities are classified as Level 1.  Equity securities which are not traded in active markets mainly include corporate investments, fund investments and other equity securities and are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nInstrument description: Debt securities include government bonds, financial institutions bonds and Assetbacked securities (ABS).\n\nValuation: Where available, fair values for debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices. Quoted market prices are obtained from an exchange market, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory service. The quoted prices from non-exchange sources are reviewed on their tradability of market prices. If quoted prices in an active market are not available, fair value is based on an analysis of available market inputs, which includes consensus prices obtained from one or more pricing services. Furthermore, fair values are determined by valuation techniques discounting expected future cash flows using market interest rate curves, referenced credit spreads, maturity of the investment, and estimated prepayment rates where applicable.\n\nFair value hierarchy: Government bonds and financial institutions bonds are generally traded in active markets, where quoted prices are readily and regularly available and are hence, classified as Level 1. The remaining positions are classified as Level 2 or Level 3.  Asset backed securities for which no active market is available and a wide discrepancy in quoted prices exists, are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nInstrument description: Derivatives contracts can either be exchange-traded or over the counter (OTC). Derivatives include interest rate derivatives, FX derivatives, Credit derivatives, Equity derivatives and commodity derivatives.\n\nValuation: The fair value of exchange-traded derivatives is determined using quoted market prices in an active market and are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

OTC derivatives and derivatives trading in an inactive market are valued using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques and inputs depend on the type of derivatives and the nature of the underlying instruments. The principal techniques used to value these instruments are based on (amongst others) discounted cash flows, option pricing models and Monte Carlo simulations. These valuation models calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, based on 'no-arbitrage' principles. The models are commonly used in the financial industry and inputs to the validation models are determined from observable market data where possible. Certain inputs may not be observable in the market, but can be determined from observable prices via valuation model calibration procedures. These inputs include prices available from exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of pricing, yield curves, credit spreads, default rates, recovery rates, dividend rates, volatility of underlying interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates and reference is made to quoted prices, recently executed trades, independent market quotes and consensus data, where available.\n\nFor uncollateralised OTC derivatives, ING applies Credit Valuation Adjustment to correctly reflect the counterparty credit risk in the valuation and Debit Valuation Adjustments to reflect the credit risk of ING for its counterparty. In addition, for these derivatives ING applies Funding Valuation Adjustment. See sections CVA/DVA and FVA in section c) Valuation Adjustments for more details regarding the calculation. Fair value hierarchy: The majority of the derivatives are priced using observable inputs and are classified as Level 2. Derivatives for which the input cannot be implied from observable market data are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Loans and receivables\n\nInstrument description: Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables carried at fair value includes trading loans, being securities lending and similar agreement comparable to collateralised lending, syndicated loans, loans expected to be sold and receivables with regards to reverse repurchase transactions.\n\nValuation: The fair value of loans and receivables is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects credit risk, liquidity, and other current market conditions. The fair value of mortgage loans is estimated by taking into account prepayment behaviour. Fair value hierarchy: Loans and receivables are predominantly classified as Level 2. Loans and receivables for which current market information about similar assets to use as observable, corroborated data for all significant inputs into a valuation model is not available, are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss\n\nInstrument description: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss include debt securities, debt instruments, primarily comprised of structured notes, which are held at fair value under the fair value option. Besides that, it includes derivative contracts and repurchase agreements.\n\nValuation: The fair values of securities in the trading portfolio and other liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are based on quoted market prices, where available. For those securities not actively traded, fair values are estimated based on internal discounted cash flow valuation techniques using interest rates and credit spreads that apply to similar instruments.\n\nFair value hierarchy: The majority of the derivatives and debt instruments are classified as Level 2. Derivatives and debt instruments for which the input cannot be derived from observable market data are classified as Level 3.\n\n## e) Transfers between Level 1 and 2\n\nAs a consequence of change in observable inputs, ING recorded an EUR 1.8 billion transfer from Level 2 to Level 1 in debt securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. No significant transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 were recorded in the reporting period 2022.\n\n## f) Level 3: Valuation techniques and inputs used\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities in Level 3 include both assets and liabilities for which the fair value was determined using (i) valuation techniques that incorporate unobservable inputs as well as (ii) quoted prices which have been adjusted to reflect that the market was not actively trading at or around the balance sheet date. Unobservable inputs are inputs which are based on ING's own assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. Unobservable inputs may include volatility, correlation, spreads to discount rates, default rates and recovery rates, prepayment rates, and certain credit spreads. Valuation techniques that incorporate unobservable inputs are sensitive to the inputs used.\n\nOf the total amount of financial assets classified as Level 3 as at 31 December 2022 of EUR 7.5 billion (31 December 2021: EUR 6.2 billion), an amount of EUR 2.2 billion (29.2%) (31 December 2021: EUR 2.0 billion, being 32.5%) is based on unadjusted quoted prices in inactive markets. As ING does not generally adjust quoted prices using its own inputs, there is no significant sensitivity to ING's own unobservable inputs.\n\nFurthermore, Level 3 financial assets includes approximately EUR 4.2 billion (31 December 2021: EUR 2.9 billion) which relates to financial assets that are part of structures that are designed to be fully neutral in terms of market risk. Such structures include various financial assets and liabilities for which the overall sensitivity to market risk is insignificant.

As explained above, the fair value of each of the components of these structures may be sensitive to unobservable inputs, but the overall sensitivity is by design not significant.\n\nThe remaining EUR 0.1 billion (31 December 2021: EUR 0.1 billion of the fair value classified in Level 3 financial liabilities is established using valuation techniques that incorporates certain inputs that are unobservable.\n\nThe table below provides a summary of the valuation techniques, key unobservable inputs and the lower and upper range of such unobservable inputs, by type of Level 3 asset/liability. The lower and upper range mentioned in the overview represent the lowest and highest variance of the respective valuation input as actually used in the valuation of the different financial instruments. Amounts and percentages stated are unweighted. The range can vary from period to period subject to market movements and change in Level 3 position. Lower and upper bounds reflect the variability of Level 3 positions and their underlying valuation inputs in the portfolio, but do not adequately reflect their level of valuation uncertainty. For valuation uncertainty assessment, reference is made to section Sensitivity analysis of unobservable inputs (Level 3).",

Prices of 0% are distressed to the point that no recovery is expected, while prices significantly in excess of 100% or par are expected to pay a yield above current market rates.\n\n## Credit spreads\n\nCredit spread is the premium above a benchmark interest rate required by the market participant to accept a lower credit quality. Higher credit spreads indicate lower credit quality and a lower value of an asset.\n\n## Volatility\n\nVolatility is a measure for variation of the price of a financial instrument or other valuation input over time. Volatility is one of the key inputs in option pricing models. Typically, the higher the volatility, the higher value of the option. Volatility varies by the underlying reference (equity, commodity, foreign currency and interest rates), by strike, and maturity of the option. The minimum level of volatility is 0% and there is no theoretical maximum.\n\n## Correlation\n\nCorrelation is a measure of dependence between two underlying references which is relevant for valuing derivatives and other instruments having more than one underlying reference. High positive correlation (close to 1) indicates strong positive (statistical) relationship, where underliers move, everything else equal, into the same direction. The same holds for a high negative correlation.\n\n## Reset spread\n\nReset spreads are key inputs to mortgage linked prepayment swaps valuation. Reset spread is the future spread at which mortgages will re-price at interest rate reset dates.\n\nInflation rate Inflation rate is a key input to inflation linked instruments. Inflation linked instruments protect against price inflation and are denominated and indexed to investment units. Interest payments would be based on the inflation index and nominal rate in order to receive/pay the real rate of return. A rise in nominal coupon payments is a result of an increase in inflation expectations, real rates, or both.\n\n## Dividend yield\n\nDividend yield is an important input for equity option pricing models showing how much dividends a company is expected to pay out each year relative to its share price. Dividend yields are generally expressed as an annualised percentage of share price.\n\n## Jump rate\n\nJump rates simulate abrupt changes in valuation models. The rate is an added component to the discount rate in the model to include default risks.\n\n## Prepayment rate\n\nPrepayment rate is a key input to mortgage and loan valuation. Prepayment rate is the estimated rate at which mortgage borrowers will repay their mortgages early, e.g. 5% per year. Prepayment rate and reset spread are key inputs to mortgage linked prepayment swaps valuation.",

The structured notes were transferred out of Level 3 as the valuation was no longer impacted by significantly unobservable inputs.\n\n## g) Recognition of unrealised gains and losses in Level 3\n\nAmounts recognised in the statement of profit or loss relating to unrealised gains and losses during the year that relates to Level 3 assets and liabilities are included in the line item 'Valuation results and net trading income' in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## h) Level 3: Sensitivity analysis of unobservable inputs\n\nWhere the fair value of a financial instrument is determined using inputs which are unobservable and which have a more than insignificant impact on the fair value of the instrument, the actual value of those inputs at the balance date may be drawn from a range of reasonably possible alternatives. In line with market practice the upper and lower bounds of the range of alternative input values reflect a level of valuation certainty. The actual levels chosen for the unobservable inputs in preparing the financial statements are consistent with the valuation methodology used for fair valued financial instruments.\n\nIn practice valuation uncertainty is measured and managed per exposure to individual valuation inputs (i.e. risk factors) at portfolio level across different product categories. Where the disclosure looks at individual Level 3 inputs, the actual valuation adjustments may also reflect the benefits of portfolio offsets.\n\nThis disclosure does not attempt to indicate or predict future fair value movement. The numbers in isolation give limited information as in most cases these Level 3 assets and liabilities should be seen in combination with other instruments (for example as a hedge) that are classified as Level 2.\n\nThe valuation uncertainty in the table below is broken down by related risk class rather than by product. The possible impact of a change of unobservable inputs in the fair value of financial instruments where unobservable inputs are significant to the valuation is as follows:\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of Level 3 instruments\n\n|                                                                       | Positive fair value  movements from  using reasonable  possible alternatives   | Positive fair value  movements from  using reasonable  possible alternatives   |   Negative fair value  movements from  using reasonable  possible alternatives | Negative fair value  movements from  using reasonable  possible alternatives   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| in EUR million                                                        | 2022                                                                           | 2021                                                                           |                                                                           2022 | 2021                                                                           |\n| Equity (equity derivatives, structured notes)                         | 12                                                                             | 3                                                                              |                                                                             -6 | -27                                                                            |\n| Interest rates (Rates derivatives, FX derivatives)                    | 22                                                                             | 15                                                                             |                                                                            -14 | -1                                                                             |\n| Credit (Debt securities, Loans, structured notes, credit derivatives) | 32                                                                             | 27                                                                             |                                                                            -28 | -2                                                                             |\n| Loans and advances                                                    |                                                                                |                                                                                |                                                                            -32 |                                                                                |\n|                                                                       | 65                                                                             | 45                                                                             |                                                                            -80 | -30                                                                            |\n\n## i) Financial instruments not measured at fair value\n\nThe following table presents the estimated fair values of the financial instruments not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position.

were used by ING Group to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments which are nor recorded and measured at fair value. These fair values were calculated for disclosure purposes only. The carrying amount of financial instruments presented in the above table includes the fair value hedge adjustment, this explains why the carrying amount approximates fair value.\n\n## Loans and advances to banks\n\nFor short term receivables from banks carrying amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The fair value of long term receivables from banks is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate based on specific available market data, such as interest rates and appropriate spreads that reflects current credit risk or quoted bonds.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\nFor short term loans carrying amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The fair value of long term loans is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects current credit risk, current interest rates, and other current market conditions where applicable. The fair value of mortgage loans is estimated by taking into account prepayment behaviour. Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for calculation purposes.\n\n## Deposits from banks\n\nFor short term payables to banks carrying amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The fair value of long term payables to banks is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate based on available market interest rates and appropriate spreads that reflects ING's own credit risk.\n\n## Customer deposits\n\nThe carrying values of customer deposits with an immediate on demand features approximate their fair values. The fair values of deposits with fixed contractual terms have been estimated based on discounting future cash flows using the interest rates currently applicable to deposits of similar maturities.\n\n## Debt securities in issue\n\nThe fair value of debt securities in issue is generally based on quoted market prices, or if not available, on estimated prices by discounting expected future cash flows using a current market interest rate and credit spreads applicable to the yield, credit quality and maturity.\n\n## Subordinated loans\n\nThe fair value of publicly traded subordinated loans are based on quoted market prices when available.",

The primary objective of ING's hedging activities is to manage the risks which arises from structural imbalances in the duration and other profiles of its assets and liabilities. The objective of economic hedging is to enter into positions with an opposite risk profile to an identified risk exposure to reduce that exposure. The main risks which are being hedged are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. These risks are primarily hedged with interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and foreign exchange forwards/swaps.\n\nING uses credit derivatives to manage its economic exposure to credit risk, including total return swaps and credit default swaps, to sell or buy protection for credit risk exposures in the loan, investment, and trading portfolios. Hedge accounting is not applied in relation to these credit derivatives.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nDerivatives that qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS are classified and accounted for in accordance with the nature of the instrument hedged and the type of IFRS hedge accounting model that is applicable. The three models applicable under IFRS are: fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, and hedge accounting of a net investment in a foreign operation. How and to what extent these models are applied are described under the relevant headings below. The company's detailed accounting policies for these three hedge models are set out in paragraph 1.7 'Financial instruments' of Note 1 'Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies'.\n\n## IBOR transition\n\nReference is made to the note Risk management/ IBOR Transition for information on how ING is managing the transition to alternative benchmark rates and INGs progress in completing the transition. At the reporting date, ING assessed the extent to which hedge relationships are subject to uncertainties driven by IBOR reform.\n\nThe IBOR's in scope of ING's IBOR Transition program are a component of either the hedging instrument and/ or the hedged item where the interest rate and/or foreign currency risk are the designated hedged risk. The hedged exposures are mainly loan portfolios, issued debt securities and purchased debt instruments.\n\nING early adopted the amendments to IAS 39 issued in September 2019 to these hedging relationships directly affected by IBOR reform (Phase 1). This excludes EURIBOR hedges as EURIBOR is Benchmarks Regulation compliant and continues to be available. Refer to section 1.7.4 of Note 1 'Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies' for more information on the Phase 1 amendments.\n\nPhase 1 amendments to IFRS allow ING to apply a set of temporary exceptions to continue hedge accounting even when there is uncertainty about contractual cash flows arising from IBOR reform. Phase 1 reliefs cease to apply when uncertainty arising from IBOR Reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and amount of the IBOR-based cash flows of the relevant instruments.\n\nIn Poland the local working group (the 'National Working Group') for benchmark reform issued a roadmap to replace the current Polish benchmark rate Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate (WIBOR) with a new rate named Warsaw Interest Rate Overnight (WIRON). The National Working Group indicated that the plan is for the market to be ready for a cessation of WIBOR by the start of 2025, consequently ING extended the application of the phase 1 reliefs to those hedge accounting relationships that will be subject to WIBOR reform.\n\nHedging relationships are being amended to incorporate the new benchmark rates. During 2022, ING focussed on USD LIBOR contracts. In the coming year, ING will continue the focus on the remaining USD LIBOR contracts as the used USD LIBOR tenors will cease to be published on 30 June 2023.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, USD LIBOR and WIBOR indexed fair value and cash flow hedges are directly affected by the uncertainties arising from the IBOR reform. In particular, uncertainties over the timing and amount of the replacement rate may impact the effectiveness and highly probable assessment.\n\nFor these affected fair value and cash flow hedge relationships ING assumes that the USD LIBOR and WIBOR based cash flows from the hedging instrument and hedged item will remain unaffected.\n\nThe same assumption is used to assess the likelihood of occurrence of the forecast transactions that are subject to cash flow hedges. The hedged cash flows in cash flow hedges directly impacted by the IBOR reform still meet the highly probable requirement, assuming the USD LIBOR and WIBOR benchmark on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered as a result of the reform.\n\nThe total gross notional amounts of hedging instruments as at 31 December that are used in the ING's hedge accounting relationships for which the Phase 1 amendments to IAS39 were applied are:",

Approximately 71% of the notional amounts for WIBOR have a maturity date beyond 1 January 2025.\n\nThe notional amounts of the derivative hedging instruments provide a close approximation of the extent of the risk exposure ING manages through these hedging relationships.\n\n## TLTRO\n\nING hedged the interest rate risk of the TLTRO-III funding with derivatives and designated this in a fair value hedge relationship. In Q4 2022 the ECB changed the terms of the TLTRO-III, resulting in the discontinuation of the hedging relationship. The fair value hedge adjustment was amortized to profit or loss over the revised interest period (i.e. until the date the change in TLTRO-III terms became effective). The impact of this is recorded in net interest income. Refer to Note 20 'Net interest income' for more details.\n\n## Fair value hedge accounting\n\nING's fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate instruments due to movements in market interest rates. ING's approach to manage market risk, including interest rate risk, is discussed in 'Risk management -Market risk'. ING's exposure to interest rate risk is disclosed in paragraph 'Interest rate risk in banking book'.\n\nING Group designates specific non-contractual risk components of hedged items. This is usually determined by designating benchmark interest rates such as EURIBOR, SOFR, SONIA or TONAR, between others.\n\nBy using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, ING also exposes itself to credit risk of the derivative counterparty, which is not offset by the hedged item. ING minimises counterparty credit risk in derivative instruments by clearing most of the derivatives through Central Clearing Counterparties. In addition, ING only enters into transactions with high-quality counterparties and requires posting collateral.\n\nING applies fair value hedge accounting on micro level in which one hedged item is hedged with one or multiple hedging instruments as well as on macro level whereby a portfolio of items is hedged with multiple\n\nhedging instruments. For these macro hedges of interest rate risk ING applies the EU carve-out. The EU 'carve-out' for macro hedging enables a group of derivatives (or proportions) to be viewed in combination and jointly designated as the hedging instrument and removes some of the limitations in fair value hedge accounting relating to hedging core deposits and under-hedging strategies. In retail operations, exposure on retail funding (savings and current accounts) and retail lending (mortgages) is initially offset. The remaining exposure is hedged in a portfolio hedge, using the EU carve-out, in which a portion of the retail lending portfolio and core deposits are designated as a hedged item for hedge accounting purposes.\n\nFor portfolio hedges the fair value is projected based on contractual terms and other variables including prepayment expectations. These projected fair value of the portfolios form the basis for identifying the notional amount subject to interest rate risk that is designated under fair value hedge accounting.\n\nMicro fair value hedge accounting is mainly applied on issued debt securities and purchased debt instruments for hedging interest rate risk.\n\nBefore fair value hedge accounting is applied, ING determines whether an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument exists based on an evaluation of the quantitative characteristics of these items and the hedged risk that is supported by quantitative analysis. ING considers whether the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument closely align when assessing the presence of an economic relationship. ING evaluates whether the fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument respond similarly to similar risks. In addition, ING is mainly using regression analysis to assess whether the hedging instrument is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item.\n\nFor the macro hedge on the loan portfolio ING follows a dynamic hedging strategy. This means that on monthly basis, based on the new portfolio projection, the hedging relationship is renewed. From an operational point of view, the existing hedging relationship is adjusted based on the new portfolio projection and additional hedging instruments are added to the hedging relationship.\n\nING uses the following derivative financial instruments in a fair value hedge accounting relationship:\n\n| in EUR million                           | Assets 2022   | Liabilities   | Assets   | Liabilities   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------|---------------|\n|                                          |               | 2022          | 2021     | 2021          |\n| As at 31 December                        |               |               |          |               |\n| Hedging instrument on interest rate risk |               |               |          |               |\n| - Interest rate swaps                    | 40,346        | 32,482        | 6,629    | 5,940         |\n| - Other interest derivatives             | 395           | 39            | 87       | 83            |",

Refer to note 22 'Valuation results and net trading income'.\n\nIn addition, the decrease in customer deposits is due to the discontinuation of the customer deposits portfolio fair value hedge in Belgium. This hedge was discontinued and the related fair value adjustment released due to changes in expected repricing of client rates as a result of the steep increase in interest rates occurred in 2022. Discontinued hedges further mainly relate to the transfer of derivatives from UK based clearing houses to EU based clearing houses related to Brexit in 2020.",

ING's cash flow hedges mainly consist of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against the exposure to variability in future cash flows on non-trading assets and liabilities that bear interest at variable rates or are expected to be refunded or reinvested in the future. The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected for each portfolio of financial assets and liabilities, based on contractual terms and other variables including estimates of prepayments. These projected cash flows form the basis for identifying the notional amount subject to interest rate risk or foreign currency exchange rate risk that is designated under cash flow hedge accounting.\n\nING's approach to manage market risk, including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk, is discussed in 'Risk management - Credit risk and Market risk'. ING determines the amount of the exposures to which it applies hedge accounting by assessing the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the future cash flows from its floating-rate assets and liabilities. This assessment is performed using analytical techniques.\n\nAs noted above for fair value hedges, by using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, ING exposes itself to credit risk of the derivative counterparty, which is not offset by the hedged items. This exposure is managed similarly to that for fair value hedges.\n\nGains and losses on the effective portions of derivatives designated under cash flow hedge accounting are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. Interest cash flows on these derivatives are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in 'Net interest income' consistent with the manner in which the forecasted cash flows affect net result. The gains and losses on ineffective portions of such derivatives are recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss in 'Valuation results and net trading income'.\n\nING determines an economic relationship between the cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument based on an evaluation of the quantitative characteristics of these items and the hedged risk\n\nthat is supported by quantitative analysis. ING considers whether the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument closely align when assessing the presence of an economic relationship. ING evaluates whether the cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument respond similarly to the hedged risk, such as the benchmark interest rate of foreign currency. In addition, a regression analysis is performed to assess whether the hedging instrument is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item.\n\nING uses the following derivative financial instruments in a cash flow hedge accounting relationship:\n\n| Gross carrying value of derivatives used for cash flow hedge accounting   | Assets   | Liabilities   | Assets   | Liabilities   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|----------|---------------|\n| in EUR million                                                            | 2022     | 2022          | 2021     | 2021          |\n| As at 31 December                                                         |          |               |          |               |\n| Hedging instrument on interest rate risk                                  |          |               |          |               |\n| - Interest rate swaps                                                     | 10,038   | 14,836        | -437     | 781           |\n| Hedging instrument on combined interest and FX rate risk                  |          |               |          |               |\n| - Cross currency interest rate derivatives                                | 428      | 168           | 73       | 285           |\n\nThe derivatives used for cash flow hedge accounting are included in the statement of financial position lineitem 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - Non-trading derivatives' EUR 814 million (2021: EUR 300 million) respectively 'Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss - Non-trading derivatives' EUR 1,275 million (2021: EUR 485 million). The difference between the gross carrying value as presented in the table and the net carrying value as presented in the statement of financial position is due to offsetting with other derivatives and collaterals paid or received.\n\nFor the main currencies the average fixed rate for interest rate swaps used in cash flow hedge accounting are 0.51% (2021: -0.16%) for EUR, 3.27% (2021: 1.73%) for PLN, 1.96% (2021: 2.09%) for USD and 1.28% (2021: 0.55%) for AUD. The average currency exchange rates for cross currency swaps used in cash flow hedge accounting is for EUR/USD 0.99 (2021: 1.01) and for EUR/AUD 1.58 (2021: 1.61).\n\nThe following table shows the net notional amount of derivatives designated in cash flow hedging split into the maturity of the instruments.

The risk arises from the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsidiaries and ING's presentation currency, which causes the amount of the net investment to vary in the consolidated financial statements of ING. This risk may have a significant impact on ING's financial statements. ING's policy is to hedge these exposures only when not doing so it is expected to have a significant impact on the regulatory capital ratios of ING and its subsidiaries.\n\nING's net investment hedges principally consist of derivatives (including currency forwards and swaps) and non-derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency denominated funding. When the hedging instrument is foreign currency denominated debt, ING assesses effectiveness by comparing past changes in the carrying amount of the debt that are attributable to a change in the spot rate with past changes in the investment in the foreign operation due to movement in the spot rate (the offset method).\n\nGains and losses on the effective portions of derivatives designated under net investment hedge accounting are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. The balance in equity is recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the related foreign subsidiary is disposed. The gains and losses on ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss in 'Valuation results and net trading income'.\n\nING has the following derivative financial instruments used for net investment hedging:\n\n| Gross carrying value of derivatives used for net investment hedging   | Assets   | Liabilities   | Assets   | Liabilities   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|----------|---------------|\n| in EUR million                                                        | 2022     | 2022          | 2021     | 2021          |\n| As at 31 December                                                     |          |               |          |               |\n| - FX forwards and Cross currency swaps                                | 119      | 83            | 18       | 88            |\n\nThe derivatives used for net investment hedge accounting are included in the statement of financial position line-item 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - Non-trading derivatives' EUR 119 million (2021: EUR 18 million) respectively 'Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss - Non trading derivatives' EUR 83 million (2021: EUR 88 million).\n\nFor ING's main currencies the average exchange rates used in net investment hedge accounting for 2022 are EUR/USD 1.06 (2021: 1.18), EUR/PLN 4.68 (2021: 4.58), EUR/AUD 1.52 (2021: 1.58) and EUR/THB 36.87 (2021: 37.84).\n\nThe following table shows the notional amount of derivatives designated in net investment hedging split into the maturity of the instruments:\n\n| in EUR million As at  31 December  2022   | Less than  1 month       | 1 to 3  months           | 3 to 12  months          | 1 to 2  year             | Total                    |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| - FX forwards and  cross currency  swaps  | -6,164                   | -2,638                   | -97                      |                          | -8,899                   |\n| As at  31 December  2021                  | As at  31 December  2021 | As at  31 December  2021 | As at  31 December  2021 | As at  31 December  2021 | As at  31 December  2021 |\n| - FX forwards and  Cross currency  swaps  | -4,462                   | -461                     | -590                     |                          | -5,514                   |\n\nThe effect of the net investment hedge accounting in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income is as follows:",

For other derivative liabilities the contractual gross cash flow payable is included.\n- \u00b7 Undiscounted future coupon interest on financial liabilities payable is included in a separate line and in the relevant maturity bucket.\n- \u00b7 Non-financial liabilities are included based on a breakdown of the amounts per statement of financial position, per expected maturity.\n- \u00b7 Loans and other credit-related commitments are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be drawn down.\n\nING Group's expected cash flows on some financial liabilities vary significantly from contractual cash flows. Principal differences are in demand deposits from customers that are expected to remain stable or increase and in unrecognised loan commitments that are not all expected to be drawn down immediately. Reference is made to the liquidity risk paragraph in 'Risk Management - Funding and liquidity risk' for a description on how liquidity risk is managed.",

They serve to secure margin accounts and are used for other purposes required by law. Pledges are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for collateralised transactions including standard sale and repurchase agreements, securities lending and borrowing and derivatives margining. The financial assets pledged are as follows:\n\n| in EUR million                                        | 2022   | 2021               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Banks                                                 |        |                    |\n| -  Cash and balances with central banks               | 364    | 465                |\n| -  Loans and advances to banks                        | 4,007  | 3,310              |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss | 17,079 | 15,334             |\n| Financial assets at fair value through OCI            | 2,142  | 2,320              |\n| Securities at amortised cost                          | 3,578  | 4,468              |\n| Loans and advances to customers                       |        | 98,917    118,868  |\n| Other assets                                          | 596    | 796                |\n|                                                       |        | 126,682    145,560 |\n\nIn addition, in some jurisdictions ING Bank N.V. has an obligation to maintain a reserve with central banks.

The amounts included consist of all recognised financial instruments that are presented net in the statement of financial position under the IFRS netting criteria (legal right to offset and intention to settle net or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously) and amounts presented gross in the statement of financial position but subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar arrangements.\n\nAt ING Group amounts that are offset mainly relate to derivatives transactions, sale and repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements and cash pooling arrangements. A significant portion of offsetting is applied to OTC derivatives which are cleared through central clearing parties.\n\nRelated amounts not set off in the statement of financial position include transactions where:\n\n- \u00b7 The counterparty has an offsetting exposure and a master netting or similar arrangement is in place with a right to set off only in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy, or the offsetting criteria are otherwise not satisfied, and\n- \u00b7 In the case of derivatives and securities lending or sale and repurchase agreements, cash and non-cash collateral has been received or pledged to cover net exposure in the event of a default or other predetermined events. The effect of over-collateralisation is excluded.\n\nThe net amounts resulting after set off are not intended to represent ING's actual exposure to counterparty risk, as risk management employs a number of credit risk mitigation strategies in addition to netting and collateral arrangements. Reference is made in the Risk Management Credit risk' section 'Credit risk mitigation'.",

These products include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments.\n\n| Contingent liabilities and commitments in EUR million   | 2022    | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Contingent liabilities in respect of                    |         |         |\n| -  Guarantees                                           | 28,859  | 26,461  |\n| -  Irrevocable letters of credit                        | 15,682  | 16,851  |\n| -  Other                                                | 3       | 8       |\n|                                                         | 44,544  | 43,319  |\n| Guarantees issued by ING Groep N.V.                     | 336     | 316     |\n| Irrevocable facilities                                  | 161,940 | 144,167 |\n|                                                         | 206,820 | 187,802 |\n\nGuarantees relate both to credit and non-credit substitute guarantees. Credit substitute guarantees are guarantees given by ING Group in respect of credit granted to customers by a third party. Many of them are expected to expire without being drawn on and therefore do not necessarily represent future cash outflows.\n\nIrrevocable letters of credit mainly secure payments to third parties for a customer's foreign and domestic trade transactions in order to finance a shipment of goods. ING Group's credit risk in these transactions is limited since these transactions are collateralised by the commodity shipped and are of a short duration.\n\nOther contingent liabilities include acceptances of bills and are of a short-term nature. Other contingent liabilities also include contingent liabilities resulting from the operations of the Real Estate business including obligations under development and construction contracts.\n\nIrrevocable facilities mainly constitute unused portions of irrevocable credit facilities granted to corporate clients. Many of these facilities are for a fixed duration and bear interest at a floating rate. ING Group's credit risk and interest rate risk in these transactions is limited. The unused portion of irrevocable credit facilities is partly secured by customers' assets or counter-guarantees by the central governments and other public sector entities under the regulatory requirements. Irrevocable facilities also include commitments made to purchase securities to be issued by governments and private issuers.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, ING Groep N.V. guarantees various US dollar debentures (that mature between 2023 and 2036) which were issued by a subsidiary of Voya Financial Inc. In accordance with the Shareholder's agreement, the net exposure of ING Groep N.V. as at 31 December 2022 was nil, as the outstanding principal amount of the US dollar debentures was fully covered with collateral of EUR 344 million(2021: EUR 320 million) pledged by Voya Financial Inc.\n\nIn addition to the items included in contingent liabilities, ING Group has issued certain guarantees as participant in collective arrangements of national banking funds and as a participant in required collective guarantee schemes which apply in different countries.\n\nING Bank N.V. provided a guarantee to the German Deposit Guarantee Fund ('Einlagensicherungsfonds' or ESF) under section 5 (10) of the by-laws of this fund, where ING Bank N.V. indemnifies the Association of German Banks Berlin against any losses it might incur as result of actions taken with respect to ING Germany. The ESF is a voluntary collective guarantee scheme for retail savings and deposits in excess of EUR 100,000.\n\nFurthermore we refer to Note 45 'Legal proceedings' for any contingent liabilities in respect of legal proceedings.",

In certain of such proceedings, very large or indeterminate amounts are sought, including punitive and other damages. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending or threatened governmental, regulatory, arbitration and legal proceedings and investigations, ING is of the opinion that some of the proceedings and investigations set out below may have or have in the recent past had a significant effect on the financial position, profitability or reputation of the ING and/or the ING and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nSettlement agreement : On 4 September 2018, ING announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with the Dutch Public Prosecution Service relating to previously disclosed investigations regarding various requirements for client on-boarding and the prevention of money laundering and corrupt practices. Following the entry into the settlement agreement, ING has experienced heightened scrutiny from authorities in various countries. ING is also aware, including as a result of media reports, that other parties may, among other things, seek to commence legal proceedings against ING in connection with the subject matter of the settlement. Certain parties filed requests with the Court of Appeal in The Netherlands to reconsider the prosecutor's decision to enter into the settlement agreement with ING and not to prosecute ING or (former) ING employees. In December 2020, the Court of Appeal issued its final ruling. In this ruling the prosecutors' decision to enter into the settlement agreement with ING was upheld, making the settlement final. However, in a separate ruling, the Court ordered the prosecution of ING's former CEO.\n\nFindings regarding AML processes: As previously disclosed, after its September 2018 settlement with Dutch authorities  concerning  anti-money  laundering  matters,  and  in  the  context  of  significantly  increased attention  on  the  prevention  of  financial  economic  crime,  ING  has  experienced  heightened  scrutiny  by authorities in various countries. The interactions with such regulatory and judicial authorities have included, and  can  be  expected  to  continue  to  include,  onsite  visits,  information  requests,  investigations  and  other enquiries.  Such  interactions,  as  well  as  ING's  internal  assessments  in  connection  with  its  global enhancement programme, have in some cases resulted in satisfactory outcomes, and also have resulted in, and  may  continue  to  result  in,  findings,  or  other  conclusions  which  may  require  appropriate  remedial actions by ING, or may have other consequences. ING intends to continue to work in close cooperation with authorities  as  it  seeks  to  improve  its  management  of  non-financial  risks  in  terms  of  policies,  tooling, monitoring, governance, knowledge and behaviour.\n\nIn January 2022, a Luxembourg investigating judge informed ING Luxembourg that he intends to instruct the relevant prosecutor to prepare a criminal indictment regarding alleged shortcomings in AML process at ING Luxembourg. Although this matter remains at an early procedural stage and it is currently not possible\n\nto determine how this matter will be resolved or the timing of any such resolution, ING does not expect a financial outcome of this matter to have a material effect.\n\nPayvision is the subject of a criminal investigation by Dutch authorities regarding money laundering and various requirements of the Dutch act on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing, focusing on the period from 1 January 2015 up to and including April 2020. Payvision is cooperating with such ongoing investigation. It is currently not feasible to determine how the ongoing investigation may be resolved or the timing of any such resolution, nor to estimate reliably the possible timing, scope or amounts of any resulting fines, penalties and/or other outcome.\n\nING continues to take steps to enhance its management of compliance risks and embed stronger awareness across the whole organisation. These steps are part of the global KYC programme and set of initiatives, which includes enhancing KYC files and working on various structural improvements in compliance policies, tooling, monitoring, governance, knowledge and behaviour.\n\nTax cases : Because of the geographic spread of its business, ING may be subject to tax audits, investigations and procedures in numerous jurisdictions at any point in time. Although the Issuer believes that it has adequately provided for all its tax positions, the ultimate resolution of these audits, investigations and procedures is uncertain and may result in liabilities which are materially different from the amounts recognised.\n\nLitigation regarding products of a former subsidiary in Mexico: Proceedings in which ING is involved include complaints and lawsuits concerning the performance of certain interest sensitive products that were sold by a former subsidiary of ING in Mexico.\n\nSIBOR - SOR litigation: In July 2016, investors in derivatives tied to the Singapore Interbank Offer Rate ('SIBOR') filed a U.S. class action complaint in the New York District Court alleging that several banks, including ING, conspired to rig the prices of derivatives tied to SIBOR and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate ('SOR'). The lawsuit refers to investigations by the Monetary Authority of Singapore ('MAS') and other regulators, including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC'), in relation to rigging prices of SIBOR- and SOR based derivatives. In October 2018, the New York District Court issued a decision dismissing all claims against ING Group and ING Capital Markets LLC, but leaving ING Bank, together with several other banks, in the case, and directing plaintiffs to file an amended complaint consistent with the Court's rulings. In October 2018, plaintiffs filed such amended complaint, which asserts claims against a number of defendants but none against ING Bank (or any other ING entity), effectively dismissing ING Bank from the case. In December 2018, plaintiffs sought permission from the Court to file a further amended complaint that names ING Bank as a defendant. In July 2019, the New York District Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss and denied leave to further amend the complaint, effectively dismissing all remaining claims against ING Bank. In March 2021, the Second Circuit court vacated the District Court's ruling. The case was remanded to the District Court to reconsider the amended complaint that would add",

In April 2021, the defendants filed a petition for rehearing with the Second Circuit court. In May 2021, the Second Circuit court denied the defendants' petition. In March 2022, plaintiffs and ING executed a formal class settlement agreement. On 29 November 2022, the Court entered its final judgement, approving ING's settlement (and those of all other defendants) with plaintiffs. The case is now closed.\n\nClaims regarding accounts with predecessors of ING Bank Turkey: ING Bank Turkey has received numerous claims from (former) customers of legal predecessors of ING Bank Turkey. The claims are based on offshore accounts held with these banks, which banks were seized by the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund ('SDIF') prior to the acquisition of ING Bank Turkey in 2007 from OYAK. Pursuant to the acquisition contract, ING can claim compensation from SDIF if a court orders ING to pay amounts to the offshore account holders. SDIF has made payments to ING pursuant to such compensation requests, but filed various lawsuits to receive those amounts back. These lawsuits are ongoing. In April 2022 the Turkish Supreme Court decided that the prescription period for the offshore account holders' compensation claims starts on the transfer date of the account holders to the offshore accounts. The exact impact of this decision on the ongoing cases is not clear yet. At this moment it is not possible to assess the outcome of these procedures nor to provide an estimate of the (potential) financial effect of these claims.\n\nInterest rate derivatives claims: ING is involved in several legal proceedings in the Netherlands with respect to interest rate derivatives that were sold to clients in connection with floating interest rate loans in order to hedge the interest rate risk of the loans. These proceedings are based on several legal grounds, depending on the facts and circumstances of each specific case, inter alia alleged breach of duty of care, insufficient information provided to the clients on the product and its risks and other elements related to the interest rate derivatives that were sold to clients. In some cases, the court has ruled in favour of the claimants and awarded damages, annulled the interest rate derivative or ordered repayment of certain amounts to the claimants.\n\nInterest surcharges claims: ING received complaints and was involved in litigation with certain individuals in the Netherlands regarding increases in interest surcharges with respect to several credit products, including but not limited to commercial property. ING has reviewed the relevant product portfolio. The provision previously taken has been reversed for certain of these complaints. All claims are dealt with individually. Thus far, the courts have ruled in favour of ING in each case, ruling that ING was allowed to increase the interest surcharge based upon the essential obligations in the contract. In a relevant case the Dutch Supreme Court ruled in favor of another Dutch bank, addressing the question whether or not a bank is allowed to increase interest surcharges unilaterally. The Supreme Court ruled affirmative and referred the case to the Court of Appeal in The Hague. The Court of Appeal also ruled in favour of the Dutch bank in October 2022. ING will continue to deal with all claims individually.\n\nMortgage expenses claims: ING Spain has received claims and is involved in procedures with customers regarding reimbursement of expenses associated with the formalisation of mortgages. In most court\n\nproceedings in first instance the expense clause of the relevant mortgage contract has been declared null and ING Spain has been ordered to reimburse all or part of the applicable expenses. Since 2018, the Spanish Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice have issued rulings setting out which party should bear notary, registration, agency, and stamp duty costs. In January 2021, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled that valuation costs of mortgages, signed prior to 16 June 2019, the date the new mortgage law entered into force, should be borne by the bank. Media attention for the statute of limitations applicable to the right to claim reimbursement of costs resulted in an increased number of claims at the beginning of 2021. In June 2021, the Supreme Court published a press release informing of its decision to ask the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling regarding the criteria that should be applied to determine the date from which the action for claiming the reimbursement of mortgage expenses is considered to be expired.  ING Spain has also been included, together with other Spanish banks, in three class actions filed by customer associations. In one of the class actions an agreement was reached with the association. In another class action ING filed an appeal asking the Spanish Court of Appeal to determine that the ruling of the court of first instance is only applicable to the consumers that were part of the case. The National Court has revoked the ruling and declared that the consumers will not be able to initiate an action for compensation based on the first instance ruling, as the claimant association intended. This last decision is not yet final, as it could be appealed in the Supreme Court. A provision has been established in the past and has been adjusted where appropriate.\n\nImtech claim: In January 2018, ING Bank received a claim from Stichting ImtechClaim.nl and Imtech Shareholders Action Group B.V. on behalf of certain (former) shareholders of Imtech N.V. ('Imtech'). Furthermore, in March 2018, ING Bank received another claim on the same subject matter from the Dutch Association of Stockholders (Vereniging van Effectenbezitters, 'VEB'). In June 2022, VEB reiterated and further substantiated its claim in a letter to ING. Each of the claimants allege inter alia that shareholders were misled by the prospectus of the rights issues of Imtech in July 2013 and October 2014. ING Bank, being one of the underwriters of the rights issues, is held liable by the claimants for the damages that investors in Imtech would have suffered. ING Bank responded to the claimants denying any and all responsibility in relation to the allegations made in the relevant letters. In September 2018, the trustees in the bankruptcy of Imtech claimed from various financing parties, including ING, payment of what the security agent has collected following bankruptcy or intends to collect, repayment of all that was repaid to the financing parties, as well as compensation for the repayment of the bridge financing. At this moment it is not possible to assess the outcome of these claims nor to provide an estimate of the (potential) effect of these claims.\n\nClaims regarding mortgage loans in Swiss franc in Poland: ING Poland is a defendant in several lawsuits with retail customers who took out mortgage loans indexed to the Swiss franc. Such customers have alleged that the mortgage loan contract contains abusive clauses. One element that the court is expected to consider in determining whether such contracts contain abusive clauses is whether the rules to determine the exchange rate used for the conversion of the loan from Polish zloty to Swiss franc are unambiguous and verifiable. In December 2020, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA) proposed that lenders offer borrowers voluntary out-of-court settlements on foreign-currency mortgage disputes, with mortgages indexed to Swiss franc serving as a reference point. In February 2021, ING Poland announced its support for",

ING has recorded a portfolio provision with respect to the claims and the PFSA proposal. The Polish Supreme Court was expected to provide further clarity on this topic in a ruling scheduled for November 2021, however the court's session on this matter was postponed and the date of the next session has not yet been announced. In October 2022, a hearing of the European Court of Justice (CJEU) was held inter alia on the question whether, after cancellation of a contract regarding a Swiss franc loan by a court, banks may still charge interests for the amount borrowed under such loan prior to cancellation.\n\nOn 16 February 2023, the Advocate General (AG) of the CJEU provided his opinion on the matter. The AG opined that banks cannot claim any remuneration (i.e. interest) for the duration the principal amount was available to the customer. The customer, however, may assert claims against banks in addition to reimbursement of interest and instalments previously paid to the bank. The AG's opinion is not binding on the CJEU. His role is to propose to the CJEU a legal solution to this case. Should the CJEU follow the opinion of the AG, this will have negative effect for banks in Poland. The CJEU's ruling is expected within a few months.\n\nCertain Consumer Credit Products: In October 2021, ING announced that it would offer compensation to certain of its Dutch retail customers in connection with certain revolving consumer loans with variable interest rates that allegedly did not sufficiently follow market rates. This announcement was made in response to a number of rulings by the Dutch Institute for Financial Disputes (Kifid) regarding similar products at other banks. ING currently expects that any such compensation will be paid before the end of 2022. ING has recognized a provision of EUR 180 million in 2021 for compensation and costs in connection with this matter. On 22 December 2021, ING announced that it has reached an agreement with the Dutch Consumers' Association (Consumentenbond) on the compensation methodology for revolving credits. Based on a recent Kifid ruling regarding similar products, ING will amend its previously announced compensation scheme by also compensating interest on interest. In the third quarter of 2022, ING increased its provision for this matter by EUR 75 million. In the fourth quarter of 2022, ING and the Dutch Consumers' Association reached an agreement on the compensation of customers who have had an overdraft or a revolving credit card with a variable interest rate. ING will compensate such customers according to Kifid jurisprudence about revolving credits including 'interest-on-interest'-effect. Compensation will start in the first half of 2023.\n\n## 46   Consolidated companies and businesses acquired and divested Acquisitions\n\nThere were no significant acquisitions in 2022, 2021 or 2020.\n\n## Divestments 2022\n\nING announced at 13 December 2022 that it has sold their interest (80%) in Intersoftware Holding BV to the\n\nSky Group/ DIAS and realised a transaction result of EUR 11.0 million which consists of a profit of EUR 7.0 on sale of InterSoftware Holding BV and the release of the redemption liability of EUR 3.0 million.\n\n## Divestments 2021\n\nOn 18 February 2021 ING announced the intention to withdraw from the retail banking market in the Czech Republic.  The decision to discontinue Czech Retail Banking entails the closure of retail customer accounts / mutual funds and the sale of assets comprising the related government bond portfolio. ING's retail customers in the Czech Republic have received a welcome offer from Raiffeisenbank Czech Republic. ING's departure from the Czech Retail banking market resulted in EUR 2.5 billion saving accounts being transferred to Raiffeisenbank and the government bond portfolio with a carrying amount of EUR 0.5 billion being sold in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nAt 12 July 2021, ING announced that it has reached an agreement to transfer ING's Retail Banking operations in Austria to Bank99. Under the terms of the agreement, approximately EUR 1.7 billion of savings deposits and approximately EUR 1.0 billion of mortgages, approximately EUR 0.4 billion other personal lending and approximately EUR 0.4 billion loans to banks of ING Austria have been transferred to Bank99. In December 2021 the transaction was completed and a loss on disposal of EUR 26 million was realised. In 2022 some final closing activities resulted in an additional loss of EUR 1 million. ING Austria was included in the segment Retail Challengers & Growth Markets.\n\nIn 2021, ING and the board of Makelaarsland agreed to continue Makelaarsland independently. The new board will take over all clients and employees, and services to clients will continue unchanged. The negative result on disposal of group companies from this management buyout amounted to approximately EUR 3 million.\n\nOn 28 October 2021 ING announced that its subsidiary Payvision will start phasing out its services as a payment service provider and acquirer. In 2021, Payvision recognised an impairment loss of intangible assets of EUR 44 million, mainly with respect to Brand, IT and Customer relationships and an impairment loss of the deferred tax asset of EUR 14 million.\n\nING has been active in the French retail banking market since 2000 as an online bank. In December 2021 ING announced that it will leave the retail banking market in France in order to sharpen the focus of its business portfolio. ING and Boursorama (a subsidiary of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale) have signed an agreement to offer the attractive services to retail customers of ING in France.\n\nThe contract allows ING customers to join Boursorama and benefit from a simplified account opening process and exclusive offers. The agreement also includes the transfer to Boursorama of 'assurance'vie' (investment products) contracts, for which ING acts as a broker with Generali Vie. Home loans",

ING will continue its Wholesale Banking activities in France, with a focus on strengthening its position and the ambition to be the go-to bank for sustainable finance.\n\n## Most significant companies disposed in 2021\n\n| in EUR million                               | Makelaarsland  BV & Above BV   | ING Austria  Retail Banking   | Total divested   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| Sales Proceeds                               |                                |                               |                  |\n| Sales proceeds                               |                                | 29                            | 29               |\n| Non-cash proceeds                            |                                |                               |                  |\n| Cash proceeds                                |                                | 29                            | 29               |\n| Cash outflow / inflow on disposal            |                                | 29                            | 29               |\n| Assets                                       |                                |                               |                  |\n| Cash assets                                  | 3                              |                               | 3                |\n| Loans and advances to customers              |                                | 1,404                         | 1,404            |\n| Amounts due from banks                       |                                | 378                           | 378              |\n| Miscalleneous other assets                   |                                | 8                             | 8                |\n| Liabilities                                  |                                |                               |                  |\n| Customer deposits and other funds on deposit |                                | 1,725                         | 1,725            |\n| Miscallaneous other liabilities              | 1                              | 8                             | 9                |\n| Net assets                                   | 3                              | 56                            | 58               |\n| % disposed                                   | 100 %                          | 100 %                         |                  |\n| Net assets disposed                          | 3                              | 56                            | 58               |\n| Result on disposal                           | -3                             | -26                           | -29              |\n\n- In 2020 there were no significant divestments.\n\n## 47   Principal subsidiaries, investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nFor the majority of ING's principal subsidiaries, ING Groep N.V. has control because it either directly or indirectly owns more than half of the voting power. For subsidiaries in which the interest held is below 50%, control exists based on the combination of ING's financial interest and its rights from other contractual arrangements which result in control over the operating and financial policies of the entity.\n\nFor each of the subsidiaries listed, the voting rights held equal the proportion of ownership interest and consolidation by ING is based on the majority of ownership.\n\nFor the principal investments in associates and joint ventures ING Group has significant influence but not control. Significant influence generally results from a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, but also the ability to participate in the financial and operating policies through situations including, but not limited to one or more of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Representation on the board of directors;\n- \u00b7 Interchange of managerial personnel.\n- \u00b7 Participation in the policymaking process; and",

A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. ING Group's involvement in these entities varies and includes both debt financing and equity financing of these entities as well as other relationships. Based on its accounting policies, as disclosed in the section Principles of valuation and determination of results of these financial statements, ING establishes whether these involvements result in no significant influence, significant influence, joint control or control over the structured entity.\n\nThe structured entities over which ING can exercise control are consolidated. ING may provide support to these consolidated structured entities as and when appropriate. However, this is fully reflected in the consolidated financial statements of ING Group as all assets and liabilities of these entities are included and off-balance sheet commitments are disclosed.\n\nING's activities involving structured entities are explained below in the following categories:\n\n- 1. Consolidated ING originated securitisation programmes;\n- 2. Consolidated ING originated Covered bond programme (CBC);\n- 3. Consolidated ING sponsored Securitisation programme (Mont Blanc);\n- 4. Unconsolidated Securitisation programme; and\n- 5. Other structured entities.\n\n## 1. Consolidated ING originated securitisation programmes\n\nING Group enters into liquidity management securitisation programmes in order to obtain funding and improve liquidity. Within the programme ING Group sells ING originated assets to a structured entity. The underlying exposures include residential mortgages and SME loans in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Australia and Germany.\n\nThe structured entity issues securitised notes (traditional securitisations) which are eligible collateral for central bank liquidity purposes. In most programmes ING Group acts as investor of the securitised notes. ING Group continues to consolidate these structured entities if it is deemed to control the entities.\n\nThe structured entity issues securitisation notes in two or more tranches, of which the senior tranche obtains a high rating (AAA or AA) by a rating agency. The tranche can subsequently be used by ING Group as collateral in the money market for secured borrowings.\n\nING Group originated various securitisations, as at 31 December 2022, these consisted of approximately EUR 65 billion (2021: EUR 74 billion) of senior and subordinated notes, of which approximately EUR 1 billion (2021: EUR 1 billion) were issued externally. The underlying exposures are residential mortgages and SME loans. Apart from the third party funding, these securitisations did not impact ING Group's Consolidated statement of financial position and profit or loss.\n\nIn 2022, there are no non-controlling interests as part of the securitisation structured entities that are significant to ING Group. ING Group for the majority of the securitisation vehicles provides the funding for the entity except for EUR 1 billion (2021: EUR 1 billion).\n\nIn addition ING Group originated various securitisations for liquidity management optimisation purposes. As at 31 December 2022, these consisted of EUR 444 million (2021: EUR 662 million) of senior secured portfolio",

The underlying exposures are senior loans to large corporations and financial institutions, and real estate finance loans, mainly in the Netherlands. These securitisations did not impact ING Group's consolidated statement of financial position and profit or loss.\n\n## 2. Consolidated ING originated Covered bond programme (CBC)\n\nING Group has entered into a covered bond programme. Under the covered bond programme ING issues bonds. The payment of interest and principal is guaranteed by the ING administered structured entities, ING Covered Bond Company B.V., and ING SB Covered Bond Company B.V. In order for these entities to fulfil their guarantee, ING legally transfers mainly Dutch mortgage loans originated by ING. Furthermore ING offers protection against deterioration of the mortgage loans. The entities are consolidated by ING Group.\n\n| Covered bond programme       | Fair value pledged  mortgage loans   | Fair value pledged  mortgage loans   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| in EUR million               | 2022                                 | 2021                                 |\n| Dutch Covered Bond Companies | 21,379                               | 16,586                               |\n|                              | 21,379                               | 16,586                               |\n\nIn addition, subsidiaries of ING in Germany, Belgium and Australia also issued covered bonds with pledged mortgages loans of approximately EUR 24,880 million (2021: EUR 22,597 million) in total.\n\nFor the covered bond programme, third-party investors in securities issued by the structured entity have recourse to the assets of the entity and to the assets of ING Group.\n\n## 3. Consolidated ING sponsored Securitisation programme (Mont Blanc)\n\nIn the normal course of business, ING Group structures financing transactions for its clients by assisting them in obtaining sources of liquidity by selling the clients' receivables or other financial assets to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). The senior positions in these transactions may be funded by the ING administered multi seller Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) conduit Mont Blanc Capital Corp. (rated A-1/P-1). Mont Blanc Capital Corp. funds itself externally  in the ABCP markets.\n\nIn its role as administrative agent, ING Group facilitates these transactions by acting as administrative agent, swap counterparty and liquidity provider to Mont Blanc Capital Corp. ING Group also provides support facilities (i.e. liquidity) backing the transactions funded by the conduit. The types of asset currently in the Mont Blanc conduit include trade receivables, consumer finance receivables, car leases and residential mortgages.\n\nING Group supports the commercial paper programmes by providing Mont Blanc Capital Corp. with shortterm liquidity facilities. Once drawn these facilities bear normal credit risk.\n\nThe liquidity facilities, provided to Mont Blanc are EUR 2,446 million (2021: EUR 2,581 million). The drawn liquidity amount is nil as at 31 December 2022 (2021: nil).\n\nThe standby liquidity facilities are reported under irrevocable facilities. All facilities, which vary in risk profile, are granted to the Mont Blanc Capital Corp. subject to normal ING Group credit and liquidity risk analysis procedures. The fees received for services provided and for facilities are charged subject to market conditions.\n\n## 4. Unconsolidated Securitisation programme\n\nIn 2013 ING transferred financial assets (mortgage loans) for an amount of approximately EUR 2 billion to a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The transaction resulted in full derecognition of the financial assets from ING's statement of financial position. Following this transfer ING continues to have two types of on-going involvement in the transferred assets: as counterparty to the SPE of a non-standard interest rate swap and as servicer of the transferred assets. ING has an option to unwind the transaction by redeeming all notes at their principal outstanding amount, in the unlikely event of changes in accounting and/or regulatory requirements that significantly impact the transaction.

This involves not only managing, planning and allocating capital within ING Group, ING Bank and its various entities, but also helping to execute necessary capital market transactions, term (capital) funding and risk management transactions. ING takes an integrated approach to assess the adequacy of its capital position in relation to its risk profile and operating environment. This means GT Balance Sheet & Capital Management takes into account both regulatory and internal, economic based metrics and requirements as well as the interests of key stakeholders such as shareholders and rating agencies.\n\nING applies the following main capital definitions:\n\n- \u00b7 Common equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) - is defined as shareholders' equity less regulatory adjustments. CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets equals the CET1 ratio.\n- \u00b7 Tier 1 capital - is defined as CET1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 (hybrid) securities and other regulatory adjustments. Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets equals the Tier 1 capital ratio.\n- \u00b7 Total capital - is Tier 1 capital plus subordinated Tier 2 liabilities and regulatory adjustments. Total capital divided by risk-weighted assets equals the Total capital ratio.\n- \u00b7 CET1 ratio target - is built on the CET1 requirements specified for ING, potential increase in the regulatory requirement of the Countercyclical Buffer, the potential impact of a standardised and pre-determined stress scenario and general uncertainties.\n- \u00b7 Leverage ratio (LR) - is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by the leverage exposure.\n- \u00b7 Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) - is Total capital plus senior unsecured bonds and amortisations. TLAC ratios are based on both risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure.\n- \u00b7 Minimum Required Eligible Liabilities (MREL) - is Total capital plus senior unsecured bonds and amortisations. MREL ratios are based on both risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure.\n\n## Capital developments\n\nING's capital position remained strong despite the challenging economic and geopolitical environment. At both the consolidated and entity level, ING has sufficient buffers to withstand various stressed scenarios.\n\nING's CET1 target level of around 12.50% is well above the prevailing Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) level of 10.58%, implying a management buffer of about 190 basis points.\n\nING's capital ratios at the end of the year decreased compared to 2021 primarily due to additional distributions and higher risk-weighted assets. ING distributed an additional EUR 1.25 billion and EUR 1.5 billion as next steps to converge the CET1 ratio towards ING's CET1 target by 2025. Risk-weighted assets\n\nwere mainly impacted by rating downgrades on Russia-related exposure, currency movements, the implementation of EBA guidelines on the treatment of structural FX positions, and model impacts. Model impacts reflect the introduction of a risk-weight floor on Dutch residential mortgages by the Dutch Central Bank as well as ongoing redevelopment of internal models and EBA guidelines.\n\nING Groep N.V. has a CET1 ratio of 14.5% at 31 December 2022 versus an overall SREP requirement (including buffer requirements) of 10.58%. The Group's Tier 1 ratio decreased to 16.4%. The Total capital ratio decreased from 21.0% to 19.4% compared to last year.\n\nING Bank N.V. has a CET1 ratio of 12.6% versus an overall CET1 requirement (including buffer requirements) of 7.10%. The Bank's Tier 1 ratio decreased from 16.5% to 14.5% compared to last year. The Banks's Total capital ratio decreased to 17.5%.\n\n## ING Group capital position according to CRR II / CRD V\n\n| in EUR million                                 | 2022     | 2021     |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Shareholders' equity  1                        | 49,909   | 53,919   |\n| - Interim profits not included in CET1 capital | -1,411   | -1,568   |\n| - Other adjustments                            | -537     | -2,590   |\n| Regulatory adjustments                         | -1,948   | -4,159   |\n| Available common equity Tier 1 capital         | 47,961   | 49,760   |\n| Additional Tier 1 securities                   | 6,295    | 6,808    |\n| Regulatory adjustments additional Tier 1       | 60       | 50       |\n| Available Tier 1 capital                       | 54,316   | 56,618   |\n| Supplementary capital Tier 2 bonds  2          | 10,046   | 9,341    |\n| Regulatory adjustments Tier 2                  | -32      | -158     |\n| Available Total capital                        | 64,330   | 65,801   |\n| Risk weighted assets                           | 331,520  | 313,064  |\n| Common equity Tier 1 ratio                     | 14.47 %  | 15.89 %  |\n| Tier 1 ratio                                   | 16.38  % | 18.09  % |\n| Total capital ratio                            | 19.40  % | 21.02  % |",

Resilient net profit is defined as net profit adjusted for significant items not linked to the normal course of business. The 50% pay-out may be in the form of cash, or a combination of cash and share repurchases, with the majority in cash. Additional distributions to be considered periodically, taking into account alternative opportunities, macro-economic circumstances and the outcome of our capital planning.\n\nFor 2022, the resilient net profit amounts to EUR 4,038 million, of which EUR 2,019 million was reserved for distribution outside of CET1 capital reflecting ING's distribution policy of a 50% pay-out ratio. Resilient net\n\nprofit includes a positive adjustment to the net profit of EUR 363 million related to hyperinflation accounting according to IAS 29 in the consolidation of our subsidiary in Turkey and the impairment of the goodwill allocated to Turkey.\n\nFollowing ING's distribution policy of a 50% pay-out ratio on resilient net profit:\n\n- \u00b7 A final dividend over 2021 of EUR 0.41 per share was paid was paid after shareholders' approval at the Annual General Meeting in April 2022.\n- \u00b7 An interim dividend over 2022 of EUR 0.17 per share was paid on 15 August 2022.\n- \u00b7 The Board has proposed to pay a final cash dividend over 2022 of EUR 0.389 per share. This is subject to the approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in April 2023.\n\nIn addition to this, ING distributed an additional EUR 1.25 billion and EUR 1.5 billion:\n\n- \u00b7 An additional EUR 1.25 billion by means of a cash distribution of EUR 0.232 per share which was paid on 18 May 2022 and a share buyback programme by which a total number of 40.7 million ordinary shares for the amount of EUR 380 million had been repurchased between 12 May and 14 July 2022.\n- \u00b7 An additional distribution of EUR 1.5 billion, by means of a share buyback programme by which a total number of 107.0 million ordinary shares for the amount of EUR 1.2 billion had been repurchased between 3 November and 28 December 2022 and the remaining amount has been paid in cash (EUR 0.082 per share) to shareholders on 16 January 2023.\n\n## Processes for managing capital\n\nGT Balance Sheet & Capital Management ensures adherence to ING's solvency risk appetite statements by planning and executing capital management transactions. The ongoing assessment and monitoring of capital adequacy is embedded in the capital planning process as part of the ICAAP framework. As part of the dynamic business planning process, ING prepares a capital and funding plan on a regular basis for all its material businesses and assesses continuously the timing, need and feasibility for capital management actions in scope of its execution strategy. Sufficient financial flexibility should be preserved to meet important financial objectives. Risk appetite statements are at the foundation of the capital plan and are cascaded to the different businesses in line with ING's risk management framework. Contingency capital measures and early warning indicators are in place in conjunction with ING's contingency and recovery plan to support the strategy in times of stress.\n\nAdverse planning and stress testing, which reflect the outcome of the annual risk assessment, are integral components of ING's risk and capital management framework. It allows to (i) identify and assess potential vulnerabilities in ING's businesses, business model, portfolios or operating environment; (ii) understand the sensitivities of the core assumptions used in ING's strategic and capital plan; and (iii) improve decision-",

In 2010, the Basel Committee issued new solvency and liquidity requirements that superseded Basel II, implemented in the EU via CRR / CRD. In accordance with the CRR the minimum Pillar 1 capital requirements applicable to ING Group are: a CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and a Total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets.\n\nThe overall SREP CET1 requirement (including buffer requirements) for ING Group at a consolidated level increased slightly during 2022 due to announcements in the Countercyclical Buffer and was 10.58% at the end of 2022. This requirement is the sum of a 4.5% Pillar I requirement, a 0.98% Pillar II requirement, a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB), a 0.10% Countercyclical Buffer (CCyB) (based on December 2022 positions) and a 2.5% O-SII buffer that is set separately for Dutch systemic banks by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank). This requirement excludes the Pillar II guidance, which is not disclosed.\n\nThe Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) trigger level stood at 10.58% in 2022 for CET1, 12.41% for Tier 1 Capital and 14.85% for Total Capital. These MDA levels are in line with the application of Art.104a in CRD V, which allows ING to partly fulfil the total Pillar II requirement (1.75%) with Additional Tier 1  and Tier 2 securities. As per 1 January 2023 a MDA requirement on the leverage ratio of 3.5% applies to ING Group. In the event that ING Group breaches an MDA level, ING may face restrictions on dividend payments, coupons on AT1 securities and payment of variable remuneration.\n\n## Ratings\n\nING's credit ratings and outlook are shown in the table below. Each of these ratings reflects only the view of the applicable rating agency at the time the rating was issued, and any explanation of the significance of a rating may be obtained only from the rating agency.\n\n## Main credit ratings of ING at 31 December 2022\n\n|                         | S&P    | Moody's   | Fitch   | GBB-Rating    |\n|-------------------------|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|\n| ING Groep N.V.          |        |           |         |               |\n| Issuer rating           |        |           |         |               |\n| Long-term               | A-     | n/a       | A+      |               |\n| Short-term              | A-2    | n/a       | F1      |               |\n| Outlook                 | Stable | Stable 1) | Stable  |               |\n| Senior unsecured rating | A-     | Baa1      | A+      |               |\n| ING Bank N.V.           |        |           |         |               |\n| Issuer rating           |        |           |         |               |\n| Long-term               | A+     | A1        | AA-     | A+            |\n| Short-term              | A-1    | P-1       | F1+     | n/a           |\n| Outlook                 | Stable | Stable    | Stable  | Indeterminate |\n| Senior unsecured rating | A+     | A1        | AA-     |               |\n\n1 Outlook refers to the senior unsecured rating.\n\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of other ratings. There is no assurance that any credit rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agency if, in the rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. ING accepts no responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of the ratings.\n\n## 51   Subsequent events\n\nOn 6 February 2023, a devastating earthquake with multiple aftershocks struck southern and central Turkey and northern and western Syria causing a significant tragedy for the people and is causing disruption to business and economic activity in the region. This qualifies as a non-adjusting subsequent event.",

Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\nWe believe the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion about the Non-Financial Information and our opinion on the Three Specific Topics.\n\n## Reporting criteria\n\nThe Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics need to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria. ING Group is solely responsible for selecting and applying these reporting criteria, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting.\n\nThe Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics are prepared in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards) and in accordance with the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in section 'About this report' of the annual report.\n\nThe absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure Non-Financial Information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\n## Materiality\n\nBased on our professional judgement we determined materiality levels for each relevant part of the Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics and for the Non-Financial Information as a whole. When evaluating our materiality levels, we have taken into account quantitative and qualitative considerations as well as the relevance of information for both stakeholders and the Company.\n\n## Scope of the group examination\n\nING Groep N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. The Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics incorporate the consolidated information of this group of entities to the extent as specified in the section 'About this report'.\n\nOur assurance procedures consisted of both assurance procedures at consolidated level and at country level. Our selection of countries in scope of our assurance procedures is primarily based on the countries' individual contribution to the consolidated information.\n\nBy performing our assurance procedures at country level, together with additional assurance procedures at consolidated level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence about the group's sustainability information to provide a conclusion about the Non-Financial Information and an opinion on the Three Specific Topics.\n\n## Limitations to the scope of our review and audit\n\nThe Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics include prospective information such as ambitions, strategy, plans, expectations and estimates.

The Non-Financial Information in scope is defined as 'material topic' on page 16 (excluding information related to financial performance); and\n- - audited the 'Understanding what matters most' section (pages 14-16), the data for the Net Promoter Score for Retail Banking and Channel Availability marked with the footnote 1' , as on pages 5 and 37 (hereafter: 'the Three Specific Topics').\n\nof ING Groep N.V.

The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our assurance procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our conclusion and opinion.\n\nWe apply the 'Nadere Voorschriften Kwaliteitssystemen' (NVKS, Regulations for Quality management systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nWe have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the review and audit, in accordance with the Dutch Standard 3000A, ethical requirements and independence requirements.\n\nOur assurance procedures for the Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics included among others:\n\n- - performing an analysis of the external environment and obtaining an understanding of relevant societal themes and issues, and the characteristics of ING Group;\n- - evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related disclosures in the Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics. This includes the evaluation of the results of stakeholders' dialogue and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Executive Board;\n- - obtaining an understanding of the reporting processes for the Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics, including obtaining a general understanding of internal control relevant to our review on the Non-Financial Information and our audit on the Three Specific Topics;\n- - identifying areas of the Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics where a material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, are most likely to occur;\n- - designing and performing assurance procedures responsive to these areas and obtaining assurance information that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion and opinion. These procedures included, amongst others:\n- - interviewing management and relevant staff at Group level responsible for the strategy, policy and results;\n- - interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control procedures over, and consolidating the data in the Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics;\n- - obtaining assurance information that the Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics reconcile with underlying records of ING Group;\n- - reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant internal and external documentation;\n- - performing an analytical review of the data and trends.\n- - evaluating the consistency of the Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics with the information in the Annual Report which is not included in the scope of our review on the Non-Financial Information and our audit on the Three Specific Topics;\n- - evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics;\n- - evaluating whether the Non-Financial Information and the Three Specific Topics as a whole, including the disclosures, reflects the purpose of the reporting criteria used.",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of ING Groep N.V. in accordance with the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\nWe designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The information in respect of fraud, non-compliance with laws and regulations, going concern, climaterelated risks and the key audit matters was addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.\n\nWe believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Information in support of our opinion\n\n## Summary\n\n## Materiality\n\n- - Group materiality of EUR 250 million (2021: EUR 250 million).\n- - 4.5% of profit before taxation from continuing operations (2021: 3.7% of profit before taxation from continuing operations).\n\n## Group audit\n\n- - 83% of profit before taxation from continuing operations covered by audit procedures performed by component auditors (2021: 81%).\n- - 92% of total assets covered by audit procedures performed by component auditors (2021: 93%).\n\nTo: the General Meeting of Shareholders and the Supervisory Board of ING Groep N.V.\n\n## Report on the audit of the financial statements 2022 included in the annual report\n\n## Our opinion\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- - the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of ING Groep N.V. as at 31 December 2022 and of its result and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code;\n- - the accompanying parent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of ING Groep N.V. as at 31 December 2022 and of its result for the year then ended in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n## What we have audited\n\nWe have audited the financial statements 2022 of ING Groep N.V.

The materiality is determined with reference to profit before taxation from continuing operations and represents 4.5% (2021: 3.7%) of that balance. We consider profit before tax from continuing operations as the most appropriate benchmark based on our assessment of the general information needs of the users of the financial statements and given the fact that ING Group is a profit-oriented listed entity. We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board that misstatements identified during our audit in excess of EUR 12.5 million (2021: EUR 12.5 million) would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Scope of the group audit\n\nING Group is at the head of a group of components. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of ING Group.\n\nING Group is structured in 6 segments: Retail Netherlands, Retail Belgium, Retail Germany, Retail Other, Wholesale Banking and Corporate Line Banking, each comprising of multiple legal entities and/or covering different countries.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the group audit, we are responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect, we have determined the nature and extent of audit procedures to be carried out for group entities or so-called components.\n\nOur group audit mainly focused on significant components. These components are either individually financially significant due to their relative size in the group or because we identified a significant risk of material misstatement for one or more account balances of these entities. In addition, we included certain other non-significant components in the scope of our group audit in order to arrive at a sufficient coverage over all significant account balances.\n\nThis resulted in a full or specific scope audit for 41 components globally, in total covering 17 countries. This resulted in a coverage of 83% of profit before tax from continuing operations and 92% of total assets. For the remaining 17% of profit before tax from continuing operations and the remaining 8% of total assets, procedures were performed at the group level including analytical procedures in order to corroborate that our scoping remained appropriate throughout the audit.\n\nThe consolidation of components in the group, the disclosures in the financial statements and certain accounting topics that are performed on a group level were further covered by the group audit team. Procedures performed by the group audit team included, but were not limited to, substantive procedures with respect to equity and hyperinflation accounting, and certain elements of the expected credit loss provisioning process.\n\nAll components in scope for group reporting are audited by KPMG member firms. We sent detailed audit instructions to all component auditors, covering significant areas such as the identified risks of material misstatement on a group level and further set out the information that is required to be reported to the group audit team.\n\nWe performed site visits with local management and local audit teams, also to perform file reviews in The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, South Korea, and Turkey. We performed a remote file review for the USA and Australia. We visited Singapore and Australia during the year to meet local management and local audit teams to discuss the design and progress of their audit work.\n\nFor all components in scope of the group audit, we held our annual planning conference in The Netherlands. This was the first time after the COVID-19 period. Our component auditors were directly informed by the Group CFO, Group CRO, Global Head of Sustainability and Head of CSI on current developments. In addition, we had conference calls with these component audit teams and we attended closing meetings with management for components in The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. During these meetings and calls, the planning, risk assessment, procedures performed, findings and observations reported to the group auditor were discussed in detail and any further work deemed necessary by the group audit team was then performed.\n\nThe group audit team set component materiality levels which ranged from EUR 20 million to EUR 95 million, based on the mix of relative size and financial statement risk profile of the components within the group in order to reduce the aggregation risk to an acceptable level.\n\nBy performing the procedures mentioned above together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial information to provide an opinion about the financial statements.\n\nOur procedures as described above can be summarized as follows:",

In the Supervisory Board report the assessment by the Risk Committee in respect of these topics is described.\n\nAs part of our audit, we have gained insights into the Company and its business environment and assessed the design and implementation and where considered appropriate tested operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls that mitigate fraud and non-compliance risks.\n\nOur procedures included, among other things, assessing the Company's code of conduct, the whistle blower process, and its procedures to investigate indications of possible fraud and non-compliance. Furthermore, we performed relevant inquiries with management, the Supervisory Board and other relevant functions, such as the General Legal Counsel and the head of Compliance and Internal Audit.\n\nIn performing these procedures, we involved our forensic specialists.\n\n## As part of our audit procedures, we:\n\n- - obtained an understanding of how the Company uses information technology (IT) and the impact of IT on the financial statements, including the potential for cybersecurity incidents to have a material impact on the financial statements;\n- - assessed other positions held by Executive Board members and/or other employees and paid special attention to procedures and governance/compliance in view of possible conflicts of interest;\n- - evaluated reports from Compliance and Internal Audit and investigation reports on indications of possible fraud and non-compliance;\n- - evaluated correspondence with supervisory authorities and regulators as well as legal letters.\n\n## Non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe performed procedures to obtain an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Company and identified the following areas as those most likely to have a material effect on the financial statements:\n\n- - anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing law;\n- - sanctions law;\n- - data protection law;\n- - fraud, corruption and anti-bribery law; and\n- - prudential and supervision regulations from the European Central Bank and the Dutch Central Bank.\n\nWith respect to the bank wide Know Your Customer enhancement program (the 'KYC enhancement program') as disclosed in the Executive Board report in order to improve governance, systems and tools around client due diligence and transaction monitoring, we inquired with senior management, the General Legal Counsel and the heads of Compliance and Internal audit.\n\nWe inspected the progress reports in relation to the KYC enhancement program and we evaluated and discussed internal audit reports in relation to compliance.\n\nWe also visited one of the ING Group hubs, in Slovakia, together with our forensic specialist. This hub performs client due diligence and transaction monitoring activities on behalf of many ING group companies. We deepened our understanding of the work performed in this hub.\n\nWe observed that the KYC enhancement program made further progress in 2022, and the finalisation of the KYC enhancement program will continue to require ongoing attention from management, the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Total assets",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nWe evaluated the fraud and non-compliance risk factors to consider whether those factors indicate a risk of material misstatement in the financial statements.\n\n## Revenue recognition (a presumed risk)\n\nWe assessed the presumed fraud risk on revenue recognition. We disaggregated revenues and considered interest income, fee and commission income, valuation results and net trading income, and other income. We considered the relative size and nature of these revenue categories and based on that focused on interest income and fee and commission income. For both revenue categories we assessed the composition of these revenues, taking into account homogeneity, routine or non-routine characteristics, whether there is an estimation uncertainty in recognising income, whether there is significant related party involvement and whether there are complexities in the related reporting.\n\nBased on these procedures we concluded the fraud risk as irrelevant, because the accounting of interest income and fee and commission income is predominantly based on automatically generated accruals based on static data taken from source systems and therefore contain routine transactions not subject to management judgement. As a consequence, we did not identify an incentive nor pressure for the Executive Board members to achieve certain results or specific finance income targets and there appears to be limited perceived opportunity to commit a material fraud in this area.\n\nBased on the above and on the auditing standards, we identified the following fraud risks that are relevant to our audit and responded as follows:\n\n## Management override of controls (a presumed risk)\n\nManagement is in a unique position to manipulate accounting records and prepare fraudulent financial statements by overriding controls that otherwise appear to be operating effectively, such as reporting fictitious journal entries. Although the level of risk of management override of controls may vary from entity to entity, the risk nevertheless is present at all entities, including at ING Group level. A fraud risk is by nature considered a significant audit risk.\n\nWe evaluated the design and the implementation and where considered appropriate tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate fraud risks, such as processes related to journal entries and estimates related to loan loss provisions.\n\nWe performed a data analysis of high-risk journal entries and evaluated key estimates and judgments for bias by the Company's management. Where we identified instances of unexpected journal entries or other risks through our data analytics, we performed additional audit procedures to address each identified risk, including testing of transactions back to source information.\n\nWe incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit, including making changes to our high-risk criteria that we applied to journal entry testing, varying the timing of audit procedures including testing of controls and a site visit to a remote entity (South Korea).\n\n## Management override of collective loan loss provisioning (ECL)\n\nWith respect to the risk of fraud in relation to management override of Expected Credit Loss provision results, we refer to the Key audit matter 'Assessment of Expected Credit Losses on loans and advances to customers and loans and advances to banks'.\n\nWe communicated our risk assessment, audit responses and results to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. Our evaluation of procedures performed related to fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations did not result in an additional key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures did not reveal indications and/or reasonable suspicion of fraud and non-compliance that are considered material for our audit.\n\n## Audit response to going concern\n\nThe Executive Board has performed its going concern assessment and has not identified any going concern risks. Our main procedures to assess the Executive Board's assessment were:\n\n- - we considered whether the Executive Board's assessment of the going concern risks includes all relevant information of which we are aware as a result of our audit;\n- - we analysed the Company's financial position as at year-end and compared it to the previous financial year in terms of indicators that could identify going concern risks;\n- - we inspected documentation of stress testing of the economic and regulatory capital position performed during the year by management;\n- - we inspected regulatory correspondence to obtain an understanding of the Company's capital and liquidity position, that underpins management's assessment of the going concern assumption for financial reporting.\n\nThe outcome of our risk assessment procedures did not give reason to perform additional audit procedures on the Executive Board's going concern assessment.\n\n## Audit response to climate-related risks\n\nIn planning our audit, we considered the potential impact of risks arising from climate change on the Company's business and its financial statements. The Company has set out its commitments and ambitions relating to climate change in the chapter 'Strategy and performance' ('Sustainability at the heart') of the annual report. The Company aims to reach net zero in their own operations, to steer the most carbon-intensive parts of the loan portfolio towards net zero by 2050 or sooner, and to finance and advise specific clients in line with a net-zero economy.\n\nManagement extensively assessed how climate-related risks and opportunities and the company's own commitments and ambitions could have a significant impact on its business or could impose the need to adapt its strategy and operations.\n\nManagement considered the impact of both transition and physical risks on the financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework, specifically the expected credit losses of loans and advances, as described in the chapter 'Risk management - environmental, social and governance risk' and the section 'Risk management climate and environmental risks in IFRS9 models' of the annual report. Management disclosed considerations directly impacting the financial statements captions as well as the medium to longer term risk drivers that do not have a material direct impact on the 2022 financial statements.",

In the Supervisory Board report, the involvement of the Audit Committee and the ESG-Committee in overseeing the financial statement process in relation to climate-related risks is reflected on.\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for the analysis of the impact of climate-related risks on the Company's business and operations going forward and on the financial statements.\n\nAs part of our audit, we performed a risk assessment of the impact of climate-related risks, the commitments and ambitions made by the Company in respect of climate change on the financial statements and our audit approach. In doing this we performed the following:\n\n- - To understand management's processes, against the background of ING's business and operations:\n- -we made inquiries with the Executive Board and other senior management and inspected relevant documents to understand management's assessment of the potential impact of climate-related risk and opportunities on the Company's financial statements and the Company's preparedness for this;\n- -we inquired on this topic with members of the ESG Committee and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board;\n- -we read the minutes of meetings of the Executive Board, Management Board Banking and the Supervisory Board. We also inspected regulatory correspondence to obtain an understanding of management's assessment of climate risk and the related risk management thereof;\n- -we performed an analysis of the external environment and obtained an understanding of relevant sustainability themes and issues relevant for ING;\n- -we gained an understanding whether any current and/or future regulations may impact the Company, such as greenhouse gas emission regulations, potential increases in taxes on current products and future climate reporting obligations;\n- - We evaluated climate-related fraud risk factors on reporting inappropriate disclosures on climate-related risk and pressures for management to meet the climate targets, since that such targets are linked to the Executive Board's remuneration.\n- - We used our climate change subject matter experts to assist in understanding how climate-related risks and pressures for management to meet the climate targets and opportunities may affect the Company and its accounting in the current year's financial statements.\n- - We used our climate change subject matter experts and modelling experts to assist in gaining understanding how climate-related risks are of impact on the expected credit loss estimation, including the credit risk models, as determined by the Company.\n\nBased on the procedures performed above we concluded that climate-related risks have no material impact on the 2022 financial statements under the requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and no impact on our key audit matters.\n\nFurthermore, we have read the 'Other information' with respect to climate-related risks as included in the annual report and considered the material consistency with the financial statements, our knowledge obtained through the audit, as described above and our knowledge obtained otherwise.\n\n## Our key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.\n\n## Assessment of expected credit losses on loans and advances to customers and loans and advances to banks\n\n## Description\n\nAs discussed in the Credit Risk section on pages 117-148 and in Note 3 and Note 7 in the consolidated financial statements, the loans and advances to customers amount to EUR 636 billion and loans and advances to banks amount to EUR 35 billion as at 31 December 2022. These loans and advances are measured at amortized cost, less expected credit losses ('ECL') of EUR 6.0 billion.\n\nManagement estimated ECL using three components: probability of default ('PD'), loss given default ('LGD') and exposure at default ('EAD'). Management applied forward looking economic scenarios with associated weights. Relevant macroeconomic factors include the gross domestic product ('GDP'), house price index ('HPI') and unemployment rate. The recent economic conditions are outside the bounds of historical experience used to develop ECL model methodologies and result in greater uncertainties to estimate ECLs. These uncertainties are addressed by judgmental overlays by management.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe identified the assessment of ECL on loans and advances to customers and loans and advances to banks as a key audit matter because of the significant and complex auditor judgment and specialised skills and knowledge required to evaluate the following elements of the overall ECL estimate:\n\n- - The judgements used to develop the PD, LGD, EAD, including model or manually determined expected future recovery cash flow assessments of individual loan provisions for impaired loans.\n- - Use of forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts in ECL, including GDP, HPI and unemployment rate.\n- - The consistent identification and application of criteria for significant increase in credit risk ('SICR') in an increased uncertain and worsened macroeconomic environment and geopolitical situation.\n- - Calculation of management overlays to the modelled ECL due to the increased uncertainty in the macroeconomic outlook in the global economy. These management overlays included economic sector-based adjustments in the Netherlands, second order impact adjustments for both wholesale bank and retail bank, and overlays to residential mortgages.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n- - We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the ECL process for loans and advances to customers and loans and advances to banks. This included controls related to the assumptions (including PD, LGD, EAD and macroeconomic forecasts), review of model outputs, the application of the definition of default, the update of data history, governance and monitoring of the ECL, reconciliations, determination of credit risk ratings, the estimated future recovery cash flows of individual loan provisions and management overlays to the modelled ECL.\n- - We involved credit risk professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the assumptions to determine the PD, LGD, and EAD parameters in models used by the Company to determine the collective provisions including the evaluation of the recalibrated and redeveloped credit risk models. This included reperforming back-testing of certain models to evaluate the current model performance. In addition, we tested management overlays recorded to the ECL, including economic sector-based adjustments in the Netherlands, second order impact adjustments for both wholesale bank and retail bank, and overlays to residential mortgages. We considered the impact these overlays have on model calculations and results when reaching our conclusions.\n- - We involved economic professionals with specialised skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the Company's methodology to determine the macroeconomic forecasts used in the ECL. We tested the reasonableness of management's forecasts against other external benchmarks and our own internal forecasts.\n- - We involved corporate finance professionals with specialised skills and knowledge, who assisted in examining the methodologies, cash flows and collateral values used in expected future recovery cash flow assessments of individual loan provisions for impaired loans. We challenged management's use of recovery scenarios and expected cash flows considering industry trends and comparable benchmarks, recalculated recovery amounts and performed reconciliations.\n- - We evaluated the identification of SICR in loans by challenging the scope of management's criteria used in staging assessments, consistent application of the thresholds applied within each criterion, and the ability of staging criteria to identify SICR prior to loans being credit impaired.\n- - We assessed whether the credit risk management disclosures appropriately reflect and address the uncertainties which exist in determining the ECL.\n\n## Our observation\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we found management's overall assessment relating to the valuation of loans and advances to customers and banks within an acceptable range and adequately disclosed in Note 3 and Note 7 of the financial statements.\n\n## Risk of inappropriate access or changes to information technology systems\n\n## Description\n\nING Group is highly dependent on its IT environment for the continuity of its operations. Inappropriate access or changes to an application or supporting infrastructure could compromise the continuity of ING Group's operations and the reliability of financial data. The IT environment of ING Group evolves over time. One of these changes regards the implementation of automation to support control execution related to user access management and change management.\n\nDue to the above, we consider the operation of IT systems relevant for financial reporting and the related internal controls a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur audit approach depends to a large extent on the effectiveness of automated controls and, therefore, procedures are designed to test among others access and change management controls over IT systems. Given the IT technical characteristics of this part of the audit, IT auditors are an integral part of our engagement team. As part of our risk assessment and design of the IT audit approach we:\n\n- - examined the framework of governance over ING Group's IT organisations, the IT general (including cybersecurity) controls and application controls;\n- - assessed the reliability and continuity of the IT environment when relevant for the scope of our audit of the financial statements;\n- - took into account regulatory correspondence related to IT;\n- - determined which controls are required prior to using automation for control execution, in response to the implementation of automation to support control execution related to user access and change management;\n- - held corroborative inquiries with the personnel at the Security Operations Center and with the Group's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).\n\nWe performed testing of operating effectiveness of user access and change management controls. We developed our understanding and tested key controls in the new automated tooling to support control execution related to user access management and change management where relevant to our audit. We performed test procedures to respond to specific risks such as the ongoing data migration to the ING Private Cloud and replacement of their global identify and access management system.\n\nWe identified areas for improvement in the control execution relating to information used in the control, interface testing and change management. Control deficiencies relate to both automated and manual control execution. Management has put efforts to remediate identified control deficiencies. For those control deficiencies that were not remediated, we tested compensating controls that addressed the same risk or mitigating controls that lowered the risk of the deficiency and performed additional substantive testing.\n\nAs for the continuity of its operations and financial reporting ING Group has established a framework to ensure operational resilience in business and IT services and to mitigate the risks related to cybercrime. We developed our understanding of key controls supporting their cyber operations. Incidents that occurred during 2022, were handled by management in accordance with that framework and without impact to ING assets.\n\n## Our observation\n\nThe combination of the tests of the controls and the substantive tests performed, provided sufficient evidence to enable us to rely on the adequate and continued operation of the IT systems for the purposes of our audit.\n\nKPMG Accountants N.V., a Dutch limited liability company registered with the trade register in the Netherlands under number 33263683, is a member firm of the global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.",

The requirements for this are set out in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).\n\nIn our opinion the annual report prepared in XHTML format, including the (partly) marked-up consolidated financial statements as included in the reporting package by ING Group, complies in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for preparing the annual report including the financial statements in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby the Executive Board combines the various components into one single reporting package.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the annual report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF. We performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3950N 'Assurance-opdrachten inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor het opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument' (assurance engagements relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting). Our examination included among others:\n\n- - Obtaining an understanding of the entity's financial reporting process, including the preparation of the reporting package.\n- - Identifying and assessing the risks that the annual report does not comply in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing further assurance procedures responsive to those risks to provide a basis for our opinion including:\n- -obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine whether the reporting package containing the Inline XBRL instance document and the XBRL extension taxonomy files have been prepared in accordance with the technical specifications as included in the RTS on ESEF; and\n- -examining the information related to the consolidated financial statements in the reporting package to determine whether all required mark-ups have been applied and whether these are in accordance with the RTS on ESEF.\n\n## Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements\n\n## Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as the Executive Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In that respect the Executive Board, under supervision of the Supervisory Board, is responsible for the prevention and detection of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, including determining measures to resolve the consequences of it and to prevent recurrence.",

Our audit included among others:\n\n- - identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- - obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control;\n- - evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Executive Board;\n- - concluding on the appropriateness of the Executive Board's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- - evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures; and\n- - evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe are solely responsible for the opinion and therefore responsible to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the financial statements. In this respect we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit.\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect we also submit an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audits of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine the key audit matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.",

ING may face a number of the risks described below simultaneously and some risks described below may be interdependent. While the risk factors below have been divided into categories, some risk factors could belong in more than one category and investors should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this section. Additional risks of which the Company is not presently aware, or that are currently viewed as immaterial, could also affect the business operations of ING and have a material adverse effect on ING's business activities, financial condition, results and prospects. The market price of ING shares or other securities could decline due to any of those risks including the risks described below, and investors could lose all or part of their investments.\n\nAlthough the most material risk factors have been presented first within each category, the order in which the remaining risk factors are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising, of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to our business, results, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## Risks related to financial conditions, market environment and general economic trends\n\nOur revenues and earnings are affected by the volatility and strength of the economic, business, liquidity, funding and capital markets environments of the various geographic regions in which we conduct business, as well as by changes in customer behaviour in these regions, and an adverse change in any one region could have an impact on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nBecause ING is a multinational banking and financial services corporation, with a global presence and serving around 37 million customers, corporate clients and financial institutions in over 40 countries, ING's business, results and financial condition may be significantly impacted by turmoil and volatility in the worldwide financial markets or in the particular geographic areas in which we operate. In Retail Banking, our products include savings, payments, investments, loans and mortgages in most of our Retail Banking markets. In Wholesale Banking, we provide specialised lending, tailored corporate finance, debt and equity market solutions, payments & cash management, trade and treasury services. As a result, negative developments in financial markets and/or countries or regions in which we operate, have in the past had and may in the future have a material adverse impact on our business, results and financial condition, including as a result of the potential consequences listed below.\n\nFactors such as inflation or deflation, interest rates, securities prices, credit spreads, liquidity spreads, exchange rates, consumer spending, changes in customer behaviour, climate change, business investment,\n\nreal estate values and private equity valuations, government spending the volatility and strength of the capital markets, political events and trends, supply chain disruptions, shortages, terrorism, pandemics and epidemics (such as the recent Covid-19 pandemic) or other widespread health emergencies all impact the business and economic environment and, ultimately, our solvency, liquidity and the amount and profitability of business we conduct in a specific geographic region. Certain of these risks are often experienced globally as well as in specific geographic regions and are described in greater detail below under the headings '-Interest rate volatility and other interest rate changes may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition', '-Inflation and deflation may negatively affect our business, results and financial condition', '-Market conditions, including those observed over the past few years may increase the risk of loans being impaired and have a negative effect on our results and financial condition' and '-Continued risk of political instability and fiscal uncertainty in Europe and the United States, as well as ongoing volatility in the financial markets and the economy generally have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, results and financial condition'. All of these are factors in local and regional economies as well as in the global economy, and we may be affected by changes in any one of these factors in any one country or region, and more if more of these factors occur simultaneously and/ or in multiple countries or regions or on a global scale.\n\nIn case one or more of the factors mentioned above adversely affects the profitability of our business, this might also result, among other things, in the following:\n\n- \u00b7 inadequate reserves or provisions, in relation to which losses could ultimately be realised through profit and loss and shareholders' equity;\n- \u00b7 the write-down of tax assets impacting net results and/or equity;\n- \u00b7 impairment expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, impacting our net result and equity; and/or\n- \u00b7 movements in risk-weighted assets for the determination of required capital.\n\nIn particular, we are exposed to financial, economic, market and political conditions in the Benelux countries and Germany, from which we derive a significant portion of our revenues in both Retail Banking and Wholesale Banking, and which could present risks of economic downturn. Though less material, we also derive substantial revenues in the following geographic regions: United States, Turkey, Poland and the remainder of Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, East Asia (primarily Singapore among others) and Australia. In an economic downturn affecting some or all of these jurisdictions, we expect that higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, higher corporate and private debt defaults, lower business investments and lower consumer spending would adversely affect the demand for banking products, and that ING may need to increase its reserves and provisions, each of which may result in overall lower earnings. Securities prices, real estate values and private equity valuations may also be adversely impacted, and any such losses would be realised through profit and loss and shareholders' equity. We also offer a number of financial products that expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates, securities prices, corporate and private default rates, the value of real estate assets, exchange rates and credit",

Further, while the Covid-19 pandemic and related response measures have eased, the effects of these measures are still being felt in the financial performance and stability of certain of our business customers. As a result, their impact may continue to affect our business. We also have wholesale banking activities in both Russia and Ukraine, as well as investments in Russia, some of which are denominated in local currency. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the international community imposed various punitive measures, including sanctions, capital controls, restrictions on SWIFT access and restrictions on central bank activity. These measures have significantly impacted, and may continue to significantly impact, Russia's economy and have contributed to heightened instability in global markets and increased inflation due in part to supply chain constraints, as well as higher energy and commodity prices. Should prices remain elevated for an extended period, most businesses and households would be negatively impacted, and our business in Russia and Ukraine, as well as our broader business, may be adversely affected, including through spill-over risk to the entire wholesale banking portfolio (e.g. commodities financing, energy and utilities and energy-consuming clients).\n\nEnvironmental and/or climate risks may also directly and indirectly impact ING, for example through (among other things) losses suffered as a result of extreme weather events, the impact of climate related transition risk on the risk and return profile or value of security or operations of certain categories of customer to which ING has exposure. In addition, these risks may also increase ING's reputational and litigation risk if the economic activity that ING supports is not in line with community expectations or ING's external commitments (this includes, but is not limited to, greenwashing risk).\n\nFor further information on ING's exposure to particular geographic areas, see Note 35 'Information on geographical areas' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nING's business, results and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and the related response measures introduced by various national and local governmental authorities (such as restrictions on social activity, travel, movement and certain economic activity) have had, and are expected to continue to have, adverse effects on global economic conditions, including inflation, depressed global economic growth, disrupted supply chains, manufacturing, tourism, reduced consumer spending, lower asset prices and higher unemployment levels, as well as increased volatility and uncertainty across the global economy and financial markets.\n\nIf these effects are prolonged, or if new Covid-19 variants emerge which require reimplementation of the response measures outlined above, the economies in which we and our customers and counterparties operate may experience heightened stress and an increased risk of recession, which may increase the risk of customer defaults and materially adversely affect ING's business, results, financial condition and prospects.\n\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2022, a significant portion of our staff continue to work from home on a full- or part-time basis. If due to illness, technical limitations or other restrictions, employees are unable to work or are not able to operate as effectively and efficiently remotely as they did in the office, this may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nIn addition, a situation in which most or some of our employees continue working from home may raise operational risks, including with respect to information security, data protection, availability of key systems and infrastructure integrity. There is also a risk that we will not be effective in implementing regulatory or strategic change programs in the current environment. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to new banking behaviour from customers. There has been an increase in the digital behaviour of our customers leading to reduced traffic in branches. Over 95% of our customers now interact with us via digital channels only. This increased reliance on digital banking and remote working may increase the risk of cybersecurity breaches, loss of personal data and related reputational risk. If any of these risks were to materialise that may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nInterest rate volatility and other interest rate changes may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nChanges in prevailing interest rates may negatively affect our business, including the level of net interest revenue we earn, and the levels of deposits and the demand for loans. In response to rising inflation globally, central banks (including the ECB, the US Federal Reserve and the RBA and RBNZ) have begun to rapidly increase policy rates. This cycle is expected to continue throughout FY2023. This rapid rise in policy rates may result in:\n\n- \u00b7 a decrease in the demand for loans;\n- \u00b7 higher interest rates to be paid on customer deposits and on debt securities that we have issued or may issue on the financial markets from time to time to finance our operations, which would increase our interest expenses and reduce our results;\n- \u00b7 changes to customer demand, particularly an increase in the attractiveness of certain products, such as fixed term deposits, which may lead to ING being required to pay higher rates on its liabilities;\n- \u00b7 higher interest rates which can lead to lower investments prices and reduce the revaluation reserves, thereby lowering IFRS equity and the capital ratios. Also the lower securities value leads to a loss of liquidity generating capacity which needs to be compensated by attracting new liquidity generating capacity which reduces our results;\n- \u00b7 prepayment losses if prepayment rates are lower than expected or if interest rates increase too rapidly to adjust the accompanying hedges; and/or(depending on the position) a significant collateral posting requirement associated with our interest rate hedge program.",

        "page_content": "- > Risk factors\n\nFurther, a sustained increase in the inflation rate in our principal markets and related interest rate volatility may also reduce disposable income for households and may increase household and business financial stress, and therefore negatively affect our business, results and financial condition. A failure to accurately anticipate inflation on an ongoing basis and factor it into our product pricing assumptions may result in mispricing of our products, which could materially and adversely impact our results.\n\nDespite the recent rise in policy rates, in which policy rates in various jurisdictions in which we operate have risen at a rapid pace as set out above, interest rates are still relatively low by historical standards and have been low for a prolonged period, which has resulted in, and may (if the expected rate rises do not materialise) continue to result in:\n\n- \u00b7 lower earnings over time on investments, as reinvestments will earn lower rates;\n- \u00b7 increased prepayment or redemption of mortgages and fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolios, as well as increased prepayments of corporate loans. This as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates potentially combined with lower credit spreads. Consequently, we may be required to reinvest the proceeds into assets at lower interest rates;\n- \u00b7 lower profitability as the result of a decrease in the spread between client rates earned on assets and client rates paid on savings, current account and other liabilities;\n- \u00b7 higher costs for certain derivative instruments that may be used to hedge certain of our product risks;\n- \u00b7 lower profitability since we may not always be entitled to impose surcharges to customers to compensate for the decline in interest rates;\n- \u00b7 lower profitability since we may not be able to fully track the decline in interest rates in our savings rates;\n- \u00b7 lower profitability since we may have to pay a higher premium for the defined contribution scheme in the Netherlands for which the premium paid is dependent on interest rate developments and the Dutch Central Bank's ('DNB's') methodology for determining the ultimate forward rate;\n- \u00b7 lower interest rates may cause asset margins to decrease thereby lowering our results. This may for example be the consequence of increased competition for investments as result of the low rates, thereby driving margins down; and/or\n- \u00b7 (depending on the position) a significant collateral posting requirement associated with our interest rate hedge programs, which could materially and adversely affect liquidity and our profitability.\n\nEach of the preceding risks, should they materialise, may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nThe default of a major market participant could disrupt the markets and may have an adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nWithin the financial services industry, the severe distress or default of any one institution (including sovereigns and central counterparties (CCPs)) could lead to defaults by, or the severe distress of, other market participants. While prudential regulation may reduce the probability of a default by a major financial institution, the actual occurrence of such a default could have a material adverse impact on ING. Such distress of, or default by, a major financial institution could disrupt markets or clearance and settlement systems and lead to a chain of defaults by other financial institutions, since the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely related as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships. Also the perceived lack of creditworthiness of a sovereign or a major financial institution (or a default by any such entity) may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. This risk is sometimes referred to as 'systemic risk' and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges with whom we interact on a daily basis and financial instruments of sovereigns in which we invest. Systemic risk could impact ING directly, by exposing it to material credit losses on transactions with defaulting counterparties or indirectly by significantly reducing the available market liquidity on which ING and its lending customers depend to fund their operations and/or leading to a write down of loans or securities held by ING. In addition, ING may also be faced with additional open market risk for which hedging or mitigation strategies may not be available or effective (either by hedges eliminated by defaulting counterparties, or reduce market liquidity). Systemic risk could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise new funding and on our business, results and financial condition. In addition, such distress or failure could impact future product sales as a potential result of reduced confidence in the financial services industry.\n\nContinued risk of political instability and fiscal uncertainty in Europe and the United States, as well as ongoing volatility in the financial markets and the economy generally have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, results and financial condition.\n\nOur global business and results are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. In Europe, there are continuing concerns over weaker economic conditions, levels of unemployment in certain countries, the availability and cost of credit, as well as credit spreads. In addition, geopolitical issues, including trade tensions between the US and China, increasing protectionism between key countries, and issues with respect to the Middle East and North Korea may all contribute to adverse developments in the global capital markets and the economy generally. In addition, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and related international response measures have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative impact on regional and global economic conditions, including heightened instability in global markets and increased inflation due in part to supply chain constraints, as well as higher energy and commodity prices. Should prices remain elevated for an extended period, most businesses and households would be negatively impacted, and our business in Russia and Ukraine, as well as our broader business, may be adversely affected, including through  spill-over risk to our entire wholesale banking portfolio, in areas such as commodities financing, energy and utilities and energy-consuming clients.",

In addition, the confluence of these and other factors has resulted in volatile foreign exchange markets. International equity markets have also continued to experience heightened volatility and turmoil, with issuers, including ourselves, that have exposure to the real estate, mortgage, private equity and credit markets particularly affected. These events, market upheavals and continuing risks, including high levels of volatility, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our results, in part because we have a large investment portfolio.\n\nThere is also continued uncertainty over the long-term outlook for the tax, spending and borrowing policies of the US, the future economic performance of the US within the global economy and any potential future budgetary restrictions in the US, with a potential impact on a future sovereign credit ratings downgrade of the US government, including the rating of US Treasury securities. A downgrade of US Treasury securities could also impact the ratings and perceived creditworthiness of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by institutions, agencies or instrumentalities directly linked to the US government. US Treasury securities and other US government-linked securities are key assets on the balance sheets of many financial institutions and are widely used as collateral by financial institutions to meet their day-to-day cash flows in the short-term debt market. The impact of any further downgrades to the sovereign credit rating of the US government or a default by the US government on its debt obligations would create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which would weigh heavily on the global financial system and could consequently result in a significant adverse impact to the Group's business and operations.\n\nIn many cases, the markets for investments and instruments have been and remain illiquid, and issues relating to counterparty credit ratings and other factors have exacerbated pricing and valuation uncertainties. Valuation of such investments and instruments is a complex process involving the consideration of market transactions, pricing models, management judgement and other factors, and is also impacted by external factors, such as underlying mortgage default rates, interest rates, rating agency actions and property valuations. Historically these factors have resulted in, among other things, valuation and impairment issues in connection with our exposures to European sovereign debt and other investments.\n\nAny of these general developments in global financial and political conditions could negatively impact to our business, results and financial condition in future periods.\n\nDiscontinuation of interest rate benchmarks may negatively affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nChanges to major interest rates benchmarks may negatively affect our business, including the level of net interest revenue. Financial markets have historically relied on Interbank Offered Rates ('IBORs') benchmarks, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), the Euro Over Night Index Average ('EONIA') and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate ('EURIBOR'). While some interest benchmarks have been reformed and will\n\ncontinue to exist, such as EURIBOR, others such as EONIA, LIBOR and the Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate ('WIBOR') have been or will be replaced by recommended alternative rates. EONIA ceased to be published on 3 January 2022, and is succeeded by \u20acSTR. All GBP, JPY, CHF and EUR LIBOR settings ceased on 31 December 2021.\n\nThe most used USD LIBOR tenors will continue to be published until 30 June 2023 to support existing contracts, with the use of USD LIBOR for new contracts only allowed in limited circumstances.\n\nPublic authorities have recognised that many contracts do not contain reference to alternative rates, or reference inappropriate alternatives, or cannot be renegotiated or amended prior to the cessation of the relevant benchmark.  In response the UK government has granted additional powers to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to enable the temporary publication of a 'synthetic' LIBOR using a different methodology and inputs. The FCA used these powers to ensure GBP and JPY LIBOR continued to be available using this 'synthetic' methodology for a limited time to assist in transition. The FCA has proposed a requirement for the LIBOR benchmark administrator to publish synthetic 1-, 3- and 6-month USD LIBOR until 30 September 2024 to support those contracts not transitioned by 30 June 2023. This proposal is currently in consultation. The U.S has also passed legislation to assist in benchmark transition covering most contracts governed by U.S law that involve USD LIBOR.  The legislation has the effect, for those contracts that do not include suitable 'fallback' rate provisions, of amending the contractual terms to switch to the recommended fallback rate for USD LIBOR (being the Secured Overnight Financing Rate), which is economically similar to synthetic LIBOR.\n\nAdditionally, in 2022 the Polish National Working Group published a roadmap indicating that the market should be prepared for a cessation of, among others, the WIBOR reference rate in 2025. It is expected that the reform will be completed by the end of 2024, with the offering of financial products using the new benchmark (WIRON) to progress gradually in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe discontinuation of USD LIBOR, WIBOR and related interest rate benchmarks could result in a number of risks for the Group, its customers, and the financial services industry more widely. These risks include legal risks and costs in relation to changes required to documentation for existing transactions. In addition to the heightened conduct and operational risks, the process of adopting new reference rates may expose the Group to an increased level of financial risk, such as potential earnings volatility resulting from contract modifications and changes in hedge accounting relationships.\n\nIt is not possible to determine the full impact of each of the USD LIBOR and WIBOR transitions on the Group. However, the experience gained, solutions put in place for the other LIBOR rates, and specific project team established to manage the transition of WIBOR, together with our investment in and ability to offer a wide range of products using the alternative rates of each of USD LIBOR and WIBOR, should help to limit any material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.",

If the increased in inflation are prolonged in our principal markets, this could have multiple impacts on us and may negatively affect our business, results and financial condition. For example, a sustained increase in the inflation rate may result in an increase in market interest rates, which may:\n\n- \u00b7 decrease the estimated fair value of certain fixed income securities that we hold in our investment portfolios, resulting in:\n- \u00b7 reduced levels of unrealised capital gains available to us, which could negatively impact our solvency position and net income, and/or\n- \u00b7 a decrease in collateral values,\n- \u00b7 result in increased withdrawal of certain savings products, particularly those with fixed rates below market rates,\n- \u00b7 require us, as an issuer of securities, to pay higher interest rates on debt securities that we issue in the financial markets from time to time to finance our operations, which would increase our interest expenses and reduce our results,\n- \u00b7 result in further customer defaults as interest rate rises flow through into payment stress for lower credit quality customers.\n\nA significant and sustained increase in inflation has historically also been associated with decreased prices for equity securities and sluggish performance of equity markets generally. A sustained decline in equity markets may:\n\n- \u00b7 result in impairment charges to equity securities that we hold in our investment portfolios and reduced levels of unrealised capital gains available to us which would reduce our net income, and\n- \u00b7 lower the value of our equity investments impacting our capital position.\n\nIn addition, a failure to accurately anticipate higher inflation and factor it into our product pricing may result in a systemic mispricing of our products, which would negatively impact our results.\n\nOn the other hand, deflation could be experienced in our principal markets adversely affecting our financial performance. Deflation may erode collateral values and diminish the quality of loans and cause a decrease in borrowing levels, which would negatively affect our business and results.\n\nMarket conditions, including those observed over the past few years, may increase the risk of loans being impaired and have a negative effect on our results and financial condition.\n\nWe are exposed to the risk that our borrowers (including sovereigns) may not repay their loans according to their contractual terms and that the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient. We may see adverse changes in the credit quality of our borrowers and counterparties, for example, as a result of their inability to refinance their indebtedness, with increasing delinquencies, defaults and insolvencies across a range of sectors. This may lead to impairment charges on loans and other assets, higher costs and additions to loan loss provisions. A significant increase in the size of our provision for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.\n\n## We may incur losses due to failures of banks falling under the scope of state compensation schemes.\n\nWhile prudential regulation is intended to minimize the risk of bank failures, in the event such a failure occurs, given our size, we may incur significant compensation payments to be made under the Dutch Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS), which we may be unable to recover from the bankrupt estate, and therefore the consequences of any future failure of such a bank could be significant to ING. Such costs and the associated costs to be borne by us may have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. On the basis of the EU Directive on deposit guarantee schemes, ING pays quarterly risk-weighted contributions into a DGS-fund. The DGS-fund is to grow to a target size of 0.8% of all deposits guaranteed under the DGS, which is expected to be reached in July 2024. In case of failure of a Dutch bank, depositor compensation is paid from the DGS-fund. If the available financial means of the fund are insufficient, Dutch banks, including ING, may be required pay to extraordinary ex-post contributions not exceeding 0.5% of their covered deposits per calendar year. In exceptional circumstances and with the consent of the competent authority, higher contributions may be required. However, extraordinary ex-post contributions may be temporarily deferred if, and for so long as, they would jeopardise the solvency or liquidity of a bank. Depending on the size of the failed bank, the available financial means in the fund, and the required additional financial means, the impact of the extraordinary ex-post contributions on ING may be material.\n\nSince 2015, the EU has been discussing the introduction of a pan-European deposit guarantee scheme ('EDIS'), (partly) replacing or complementing national compensation schemes in two or three phases. Proposals contain elements of (re)insurance, mutual lending and mutualisation of funds. The new model is intended to be 'overall cost-neutral'.\n\nIn February 2021, the European Commission issued a public consultation on the review of the bank crisis management and deposit insurance (CMDI) framework, with a focus on three EU legislative texts: the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR), and the",

The anticipated revision of the CMDI framework is part of the debate on the completion of the Banking Union and in particular its third and missing pillar EDIS. The consultation period ran until May 2021. It is uncertain when the next steps towards revision of the CMDI framework, including EDIS, can be expected.\n\n## Risks related to the regulation and supervision of the Group\n\nNon-compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, including with respect to financial economic crimes, could result in fines and other liabilities, penalties or consequences for us, which could materially affect our business and reduce our profitability.\n\nING has faced, and in the future may continue to face, the risk of consequences in connection with noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. For additional information on legal proceedings, see Note 45 'Legal proceedings' to the consolidated financial statements. There are a number of risks in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear, subject to multiple interpretations or under development, or where regulations may conflict with one another, or where regulators revise their previous guidance or courts overturn previous rulings, which could result in our failure to meet applicable standards. Regulators and other authorities have the power to bring administrative or judicial proceedings against us, which could result, among other things, in suspension or revocation of our licenses, cease and desist orders, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties or other disciplinary action, which could materially harm our results and financial condition as well as ING's reputation. If we fail to address, or appear to fail to address, any of these matters appropriately, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to additional legal risk, which could, in turn, increase the size and number of claims and damages brought against us or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties.\n\nFurthermore, as a financial institution, we are exposed to the risk of unintentional involvement in criminal activity in connection with the commission of financial economic crimes, including with respect to sanctions and money laundering and the funding of terrorist and other criminal activities. The failure or perceived failure by us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements with respect to financial economic crimes may result in adverse publicity, claims and allegations, litigation and regulatory investigations and sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results, financial condition and/or prospects in any given period. For further discussion of the impact of litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations or other regulatory actions with respect to financial economic crimes, see '- We may be subject to litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations or other regulatory actions, and adverse publicity' below.\n\nChanges in laws and/or regulations governing financial services or financial institutions or the application of such laws and/or regulations may increase our operating costs and limit our activities.\n\nWe are subject to detailed banking laws and financial regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Regulation of the industries in which we operate is becoming more extensive and complex, while also attracting supervisory scrutiny. Compliance with applicable and new laws and regulations is resourcesintensive, and may materially increase our operating costs. Moreover, these regulations intended to protect our customers, markets and society as a whole and can limit our activities, among others, through stricter net capital, market conduct and transparency requirements and restrictions on the businesses in which we can operate or invest.\n\nOur revenues and profitability and those of our industry have been and will continue to be impacted by requirements relating to capital, additional loss-absorbing capacity, leverage, minimum liquidity and longterm funding levels, requirements related to resolution and recovery planning, derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of regulatory oversight, as well as limitations on which and, if permitted, how certain business activities may be carried out by financial institutions.\n\nWe are subject to additional legal and regulatory risk in certain countries where we operate with less developed or predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.\n\nIn certain countries in which we operate, judiciary and dispute resolution systems may be less effective. As a result, in case of a breach of contract, we may have difficulties in making and enforcing claims against contractual counterparties and, if claims are made against us, we might encounter difficulties in mounting a defence against such allegations. If we become party to legal proceedings in a market with an insufficiently developed judicial system, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and net results.\n\nIn addition, as a result of our operations in certain countries, we are subject to risks of possible nationalisation, expropriation, price controls, exchange controls and other restrictive government actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities and or war, in these markets. In particular, we have wholesale banking activities in both Russia and Ukraine, as well as investments in Russia, some of which are denominated in local currency, and other counterparties located in Russia. Furthermore, the current economic environment in certain countries in which we operate may increase the likelihood for regulatory initiatives to enhance consumer protection or to protect homeowners from foreclosures. Any such regulatory initiative could have an adverse impact on our ability to protect our economic interest, for instance in the event of defaults on residential mortgages.",

        "page_content": "- > Risk factors\n\n## We are subject to the regulatory supervision of the ECB and other regulators with extensive supervisory and investigatory powers.\n\nIn its capacity as principal prudential supervisor in the EU, the ECB has extensive supervisory and investigatory powers, including the ability to issue requests for information, to conduct regulatory investigations and on-site inspections, and to impose monetary and other sanctions. For example, under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the regulators with jurisdiction over the Group, including the ECB, may conduct stress tests and have discretion to impose capital surcharges on financial institutions for risks that are not otherwise recognised in risk-weighted assets or other surcharges depending on the individual situation of the bank and take or require other measures, such as restrictions on or changes to the Group's business. Competent authorities may also prohibit the Group from making dividend payments to shareholders or distributions to holders of its regulatory capital instruments if the Group fails to comply with regulatory requirements, in particular with supervisory actions, minimum capital requirements (including buffer requirements) or with liquidity requirements, or if there are shortcomings in its governance and risk management processes. A failure to comply with prudential or conduct regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results and financial condition.\n\nFailure to meet minimum capital and other prudential regulatory requirements as applicable to us from time to time may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition and on our ability to make payments on certain of our securities.\n\nING is subject to a variety of regulations that require us to comply with minimum requirements for capital (own funds) and additional loss absorbing capacity, as well as for liquidity, and to comply with leverage restrictions. In addition, such capital, liquidity and leverage requirements and their application and interpretation may change. Any changes may require us to maintain more capital or to raise a different type of capital by disqualifying existing capital instruments from continued inclusion in regulatory capital, requiring replacement with new capital instruments that meet the new criteria. Sometimes changes are introduced subject to a transitional period during which the new requirements are being phased in, gradually progressing to a fully phased-in, or fully-loaded, application of the requirements.\n\nAny failure to comply with these requirements, or to adapt to changes in such requirements, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition, and may require us to seek additional capital. Failures to meet minimum capital or other prudential requirements may also result in ING being prohibited from making payments on certain of our securities. Because implementation phases and transposition into EU or national regulation where required may often involve a lengthy period, the impact of changes in capital, liquidity and leverage regulations on our business, results and financial condition, and on our ability to make payments on certain of our securities, is often unclear.\n\nOur US commodities and derivatives business is subject to CFTC and SEC regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nOur affiliate ING Capital Markets LLC is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a swap dealer and is subject to CFTC regulation of the off-exchange derivatives market pursuant to Title VII of the US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). Operating as a swap dealer requires compliance with CFTC regulatory requirements, which may be burdensome, impose additional compliance costs and could adversely affect the profitability of this business, as well as exposing ING to the risk of non-compliance with these regulations.\n\nING Capital Markets LLC is also registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer pursuant to DoddFrank and SEC regulations enacted thereunder with respect to security-based swaps and that became required on 1 November 2021. While ING Capital Markets LLC, as a security-based swap dealer, is required to comply with SEC rules with respect to most of these requirements, SEC rules have permitted an Alternative Compliance Mechanism that allows for compliance, subject to eligibility requirements, with CFTC capital and margin rules applying to swap dealers in lieu of SEC capital and margin rules applying to security-based swap dealers. ING Capital Markets LLC has elected to use the Alternative Compliance Mechanism. However, should ING Capital Markets LLC in the future be ineligible for the Alternative Compliance Mechanism it would be subject to SEC capital and margin security-based swap dealer rules instead of the CFTC capital and margin security-based swap dealer rules which could be more capital intensive. Registration as a securitybased swap dealer requires compliance with SEC regulatory requirements, which may be burdensome, impose additional compliance costs and could adversely affect the profitability of this business, as well as exposing ING to the risk of non-compliance with these regulations.\n\nIn March 2023, ING Capital Markets LLC determined that errors in its calculation of its regulatory capital resulted in ING Capital Markets LLC holding less than the minimum capital required under CFTC rules during prior periods and self-reported the issue to the CFTC and SEC. This issue could lead to regulatory investigations, enforcement actions and sanctions by the CFTC and/or SEC.\n\nOn 15 December 2021, the SEC proposed new rules that would for the first time impose public reporting requirements for some significant security-based swaps positions. The rules would apply even to trades between non-US counterparties, including ING Bank, provided that the issuer of the reference securities underlying the security-based swaps is organised in the US, the issuer of the reference securities underlying the security-based swaps has its principal place of business in the US, or the securities are in certain categories registered with the SEC.\n\nThese proposed regulations, if adopted in their current form, could constrain trading activity in securitybased swaps. In addition, there are, or may be in the future, regulatory requirements or limitations related to other categories of equity derivatives, such as options or forwards, that could similarly constrain trading activity in such instruments as well. These various requirements and limitations with respect to equity",

On 1 January 2023, these position limits were extended to certain positions in swaps that are 'economically equivalent' to the enumerated futures contracts. The position limits on futures and related swaps could limit ING's position sizes in these futures contracts and similarly limit the ability of counterparties to utilise certain of our products to the extent hedging exemptions from the position limits are unavailable. In addition, position limits on swaps on the same physical commodities will become effective in January 2023, which could further limit the ability of ING and its counterparties to enter into such swaps. Such regulation of the derivative markets and market participants will likely result in increased cost of hedging and other trading activities, both for ING and its customers, which could expose our business to greater risk and reduce the size and profitability of our customer business. The imposition of these regulatory restrictions and requirements, could also result in reduced market liquidity, which could in turn increase market volatility and the risks and costs of hedging and other trading activities.\n\nAny of the foregoing factors, and any further regulatory developments with respect to commodities and derivatives, could have a material impact on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to several other bank recovery and resolution regimes that include statutory write down and conversion as well as other powers, which remains subject to significant uncertainties as to scope and impact on us.\n\nWe are subject to several recovery and resolution regimes, including the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), the 'Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive' (BRRD) as implemented in national legislation, such as the Dutch Financial Supervision Act. The SRM applies to banks that are supervised by the ECB under the SSM, with the aim of ensuring an orderly resolution of failing banks at minimum cost for taxpayers and the real economy. The BRRD establishes a common framework for the recovery and resolution of banks within the European Union, with the aim of providing supervisory authorities and resolution authorities with common tools and powers to address banking crises pre-emptively to safeguard financial stability and minimise taxpayers' exposure to losses. Any application of statutory write-down and conversion or other powers would not be expected to constitute an event of default under our securities entitling holders to seek repayment. If any of these powers were to be exercised in respect of ING, there could be a material adverse effect on both ING and on holders of ING securities, including through a material adverse effect on credit ratings and/or the price of our securities. Investors in our securities may lose their investment if resolution measures are taken under current or future regimes.\n\n## Risks related to litigation, enforcement proceedings and investigations and to changes in tax laws\n\nWe may be subject to litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations or other regulatory actions, and adverse publicity.\n\nWe are involved in governmental, regulatory, arbitration and legal proceedings and investigations involving claims by and against us which arise in the ordinary course of our businesses, including in connection with our activities as financial services provider, employer, investor and taxpayer. As a financial institution, we are subject to specific laws and regulations governing financial services and/or financial institutions. See 'Risks related to the regulation and supervision of the Group. Changes in laws and/or regulations governing financial services or financial institutions or the application of such laws and/or regulations may increase our operating costs and limit our activities\" and 'Our US commodities and derivatives business is subject to CFTC and SEC regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act' above. Financial reporting irregularities involving other large and well-known companies, possible findings of government authorities in various jurisdictions which are investigating several rate-setting processes, notifications made by whistleblowers, increasing regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny of 'know your customer' anti-money laundering, tax evasion, prohibited transactions with countries or persons subject to sanctions, and bribery or other anti-corruption measures and anti-terrorist-financing procedures and their effectiveness, regulatory investigations of the banking industry, and litigation that arises from the failure or perceived failure by us to comply with legal, regulatory, tax and compliance requirements could result in adverse publicity and reputational harm, lead to increased regulatory supervision, affect our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and maintain access to the capital markets, result in cease and desist orders, claims, enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal penalties, other disciplinary action or have other material adverse effects on us in ways that are not predictable. With respect to sanctions, beginning in February 2022, the EU, UK and the US, in a coordinated effort joined by several other countries, imposed a variety of new sanctions with respect to Russia and various Russia-related parties. Despite significant similarities between these Russia-related sanctions programmes, there are notable differences between the EU, UK and US sanctions programmes, which have evolved and may continue to evolve and have required ING to implement new control measures with related costs and risks of non-compliance. While various sanctions include grace periods before full compliance is required, there is no guarantee that ING will be able to implement all required procedures within the applicable grace periods. In addition, some claims and allegations may be brought by or on behalf of a class and claimants may seek large or indeterminate amounts of damages, including compensatory, liquidated, treble and punitive damages. Our reserves for litigation liabilities may prove to be inadequate. Claims and allegations, should they become public, need not be well founded, true or successful to have a negative impact on our reputation. In addition, press reports and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing could result in inquiries or investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials, and responding to these inquiries and investigations, regardless of their ultimate outcome, is time consuming and expensive.

Changes in tax laws could also make certain ING products less attractive, which could have adverse consequences for our businesses and results. On 7 June 2021, the Dutch government received a formal notice of termination of the Dutch-Russian tax treaty from Russia, and as a result, the tax treaty was terminated as of 1 January 2022. The termination of the Dutch-Russian tax treaty or any other similar developments may have adverse effects on ING and ING's customers.\n\nBecause of the geographic spread of its business, ING may be subject to tax audits, investigations and procedures in numerous jurisdictions at any point in time. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for all our tax positions, the ultimate resolution of these audits, investigations and procedures may result in liabilities which are different from the amounts recognized.

These include FATCA, which requires ING to provide certain information for the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Qualified Intermediary (QI) requirements, which require withholding tax on certain US-source payments. Failure to comply with FATCA and/or QI requirements and regulations could harm our reputation and could subject the Group to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenues, results, financial condition and prospects.\n\nING is exposed to the risk of claims from customers or stakeholders who feel misled or treated unfairly because of advice or information received.\n\nOur products and services, including banking products and advice services for third-party products are exposed to claims from customers who might allege that they have received insufficient advice or misleading information from advisers (both internal and external) as to which products were most appropriate for them, or that the terms and conditions of the products, the nature of the products or the circumstances under which the products were sold, were misrepresented to them. When new financial products are brought to the market, ING engages in a multidisciplinary product approval process in connection with the development and distribution of such products, including production of appropriate marketing and communication materials. Notwithstanding these processes, customers may make claims against ING if the products do not meet their expectations , either at the purchase/execution of the product and/or through the life of the product. Customer protection regulations, as well as changes in interpretation and perception by both the public at large and governmental authorities of acceptable market practices, influence customer expectations.\n\nProducts distributed through person-to-person sales forces have a higher exposure to such claims as the sales forces may provide face-to-face financial planning and advisory services. Complaints may also arise if customers feel that they have not been treated reasonably or fairly, or that the duty of care has not been complied with. While a considerable amount of time and resources have been invested in reviewing and assessing historical sales practices and products that were sold in the past, and in the maintenance of risk management, legal and compliance procedures to monitor current sales practices, there can be no assurance that all of the issues associated with current and historical sales practices have been or will be identified, nor that any issues already identified will not be more widespread than presently estimated.\n\nThe negative publicity associated with any sales practices, any compensation payable in respect of any such issues and regulatory changes resulting from such issues, has had and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results, financial condition and prospects. For additional information regarding legal proceedings or claims, see Note 45 'Legal proceedings' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risks related to the Group's business and operations\n\nING may be unable to meet internal or external aims or expectations with respect to ESG-related matters.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) is an area of significant and increased focus for governments and regulators, investors, ING's customers and employees, and other stakeholders or third parties (e.g., nongovernmental organisations or NGOs). As a result, an increasing number of laws, regulations and legislative actions have been introduced to address climate change, sustainability and other ESG-related matters, including in relation to the financial sector's operations and strategy. Such recent regulations include the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), EU Taxonomy regulation and EU Green Bond Standards,",

These laws, regulations and legislative frameworks may directly and indirectly impact the business environment in which ING operates and may expose ING to significant risks; amongst others greenwashing risk.\n\nNational or international regulatory actions or developments may also result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure from internal and external stakeholders regarding the management and disclosure of their ESG risks and related lending and investment activities. ING may from time to time disclose ESG-related initiatives or aims in connection with the conduct of its business and operations. However, there is no guarantee that ING will be able to implement such initiatives or meet such aims within anticipated timeframes, or at all. ING may fail to fulfil internal or external ESG-related initiatives, aims or expectations, or may be perceived to fail to do so, or may fail to adequately or accurately report performance or developments with respect to such initiatives, aims or expectations. ING could therefore be criticised or held responsible for the scope of its initiatives or goals regarding such matters. In addition, ING might face requests for specific strategies, plans or commitments to address ESG-related matters, which may or may not be viewed as satisfactory to the relevant internal and external stakeholders (including NGOs). Any of these factors may have an adverse impact on ING's reputation and brand value, or on ING's business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## ING may be unable to adapt its products and services to meet changing customer behaviour and demand, including as a result of ESG-related matters.\n\nCustomers or other counterparties may increasingly assess sustainability or other ESG-related matters in their economic decisions. For instance, customers may choose investment products or services based on sustainability or other ESG criteria, or may look at a financial institution's ESG-related lending strategy when choosing to make deposits. To remain competitive and to safeguard its reputation, ING is required to continuously adapt its business strategy, products and services to respond to emerging, increasing or changing sustainability and other ESG-related demands from customers, investors and other stakeholders. However, there is no guarantee that ING's current or future products or services will meet applicable ESGrelated regulatory requirements, customer preferences or investor expectations.\n\n## ING's business and operations are exposed to physical risks, including as a direct result of climate change.\n\nING's business and operations may be exposed to the impacts of physical risks arising from climate and weather-related events, including heatwaves, droughts, flooding, storms, rising sea levels, other extreme weather events or natural disasters, and to the impacts of physical risks arising from the environmental degradation, including loss of biodiversity, water or resources scarcity, pollution or waste management. Such physical risks could disrupt ING's business continuity and operations or impact ING's premises or\n\nproperty portfolio, as well as its customers' property, business or other financial interests. These risks could potentially result in impairing asset values, financial losses, declining creditworthiness of customers and increased defaults, delinquencies, write-offs and impairment charges in ING's portfolio, etc. In particular, changing climate patterns resulting in more frequent and extreme weather events, such as the severe flooding that occurred in Western Europe in July 2021, the long-lasting bushfires in Australia in February 2021 or the severe flooding in the eastern states of Australia in early 2022, could lead to unexpected business interruptions or losses for ING or its customers.\n\nFor a description of physical risks to our operations and business other than resulting from natural disasters as a result of climate change, see '-Operational and IT risks, such as systems disruptions or failures, breaches of security, cyber attacks, human error, changes in operational practices, inadequate controls including in respect of third parties with which we do business or outbreaks of communicable diseases may adversely impact our reputation, business and results' below.\n\n## ING's business and operations are exposed to transition risks related to climate change.\n\nThe transition to a low carbon or net zero economy may give rise to risks and uncertainties associated with climate change-related laws, regulations and oversight, changing or new technologies, and shifting customer sentiment. For instance, ING may be required to change its lending portfolio to comply with new climate change-related regulations. As a result, it might be unable to lend to certain prospective customers, or might even lead to the termination of certain existing relationships with certain customers. This could result in claims or legal challenges from such customers against ING. This transition may also adversely impact the business and operations of ING's customers and other counterparties. If ING fails to adequately factor in such risks in its lending or other business decisions, ING could be exposed to losses.\n\nThe low carbon or net zero transition may also require ING to modify or implement new compliance systems, internal controls and procedures or governance frameworks. The integration and automation of internal governance, compliance, and disclosure and reporting frameworks across ING could lead to increased operational costs for ING and other execution and operational risks. The implementation cost of these systems may especially be higher in the near term as ING seeks to adapt its business, or address overlapping, duplicative or conflicting regulatory or other requirements in this fast-developing area. Furthermore, ING's ongoing implementation of appropriate systems, controls and frameworks increasingly requires ING to develop adequate climate change-related risk assessment and modelling capabilities (as there is currently no standard approach or methodology available), and to collect customer, third party or other data. There are significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the development of new risk modelling methodologies and the collection of data, potentially resulting in systems or frameworks that could be inadequate, inaccurate or susceptible to incorrect customer, third party or other data.\n\nAny delay or failure in developing, implementing or meeting ING's climate change-related commitments and regulatory requirements may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition,",

Operational and IT risks are inherent to our business. Our businesses depend on the ability to process and report a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately. In addition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. Losses can result from inadequately trained or skilled personnel, IT failures (including due to a computer virus or a failure to anticipate or prevent cyber attacks or other attempts to gain unauthorised access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or impairing operational performance, or security breaches by third parties), inadequate or failed internal control processes and systems, regulatory breaches, human errors, employee misconduct, including fraud, or from natural disasters or other external events that interrupt normal business operations. Such losses may adversely affect our reputation, business and results.\n\nWe depend on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. The equipment and software used in our computer systems and networks may not always be capable of processing, storing or transmitting information as expected. Despite our business continuity plans and procedures, certain of our computer systems and networks may have insufficient recovery capabilities in the event of a malfunction or loss of data. We are consistently managing and monitoring our IT risk profile globally. ING is subject to increasing regulatory requirements including EU General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') and EU Payment Services Directive ('PSD2'). Failure to appropriately manage and monitor our IT risk profile could affect our ability to comply with these regulatory requirements, to securely and efficiently serve our clients or to timely, completely or accurately process, store and transmit information, and may adversely impact our reputation, business and results. For further description of the particular risks associated with cybercrime, which is a specific risk to ING as a result of its strategic focus on technology and innovation, see 'We are subject to increasing risks related to cybercrime and compliance with cybersecurity regulation' below.\n\nWidespread outbreaks of communicable diseases may impact the health of our employees, increasing absenteeism, or may cause a significant increase in the utilisation of health benefits offered to our employees, either or both of which could adversely impact our business. In addition, other events including unforeseeable and/or catastrophic events can lead to an abrupt interruption of activities, and our operations may be subject to losses resulting from such disruptions. Losses can result from destruction or impairment\n\nof property, financial assets, trading positions, and the loss of key personnel. If our business continuity plans are not able to be implemented, are not effective or do not sufficiently take such events into account, losses may increase further.\n\n## We are subject to increasing risks related to cybercrime and compliance with cybersecurity regulation.\n\nLike other financial institutions and global companies, we are regularly the target of cyber attacks, which is a specific risk to ING as a result of its strategic focus on technology and innovation. In particular, threats from Distributed Denial of Service ('DDoS'), targeted attacks (also called Advanced Persistent Threats) and ransomware have intensified worldwide, and attempts to gain unauthorised access and the techniques used for such attacks are increasingly sophisticated. We have faced, and expect to continue to face, an increasing number of cyber attacks (both successful and unsuccessful) as we have further digitalised. This includes the continuing expansion of our mobile- and other internet-based products and services, as well as our usage and reliance on cloud technology.\n\nCybersecurity, customer data and data privacy have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The EU's second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and GDPR are examples of such regulations. In certain locations where ING is active, there are additional local regulatory requirements and legislation on top of EU regulations that must be followed for business conducted in that jurisdiction. Some of these legislations and regulations may be conflicting due to local regulatory interpretations. We may become subject to new EU and local legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity, security of customer data in general or the privacy of information we may store or maintain. Compliance with such new legislation or regulation could increase the Group's compliance cost. Failure to comply with new and existing legislation or regulation could harm our reputation and could subject the Group to enforcement actions, fines and penalties.\n\nING may be exposed to the risks of misappropriation, unauthorised access, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other external attacks or internal breaches that could have a security impact. These events could also jeopardise our confidential information or that of our clients or our counterparties. These events can potentially result in financial loss and harm to our reputation, hinder our operational effectiveness, result in regulatory censure, compensation costs or fines resulting from regulatory investigations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenues, results, financial condition and prospects. Even when we are successful in defending against cyber attacks, such defence may consume significant resources or impose significant additional costs on ING.\n\nBecause we operate in highly competitive markets, including our home market, we may not be able to increase or maintain our market share, which may have an adverse effect on our results.",

Customer loyalty and retention can be influenced by a number of factors, including brand recognition, reputation, relative service levels, the prices and attributes of products and services, scope of distribution, credit ratings and actions taken by existing or new competitors (including non-bank or financial technology competitors). A decline in our competitive position as to one or more of these factors could adversely impact our ability to maintain or further increase our market share, which would adversely affect our results. Such competition is most pronounced in our more mature markets of the Netherlands, Belgium, the rest of Western Europe and Australia. In recent years, however, competition in emerging markets, such as Asia and Central and Eastern Europe, has also increased as large financial services companies from more developed countries have sought to establish themselves in markets which are perceived to offer higher growth potential, and as local institutions have become more sophisticated and competitive and proceeded to form alliances, mergers or strategic relationships with our competitors. The Netherlands is our largest market. Our main competitors in the banking sector in the Netherlands are ABN AMRO Bank and Rabobank.\n\nCompetition could also increase due to new entrants (including non-bank and financial technology competitors) in the markets that may have new operating models that are not burdened by potentially costly legacy operations and that are subject to reduced regulation. New entrants may rely on new technologies, advanced data and analytic tools, lower cost to serve, reduced regulatory burden and/or faster processes to challenge traditional banks. Developments in technology have also accelerated the use of new business models, and ING may not be successful in adapting to this pace of change or may incur significant costs in adapting its business and operations to meet such changes. For example, new business models have been observed in retail payments, consumer and commercial lending (such as peer-to-peer lending), foreign exchange and low-cost investment advisory services. In particular, the emergence of disintermediation in the financial sector resulting from new banking, lending and payment solutions offered by rapidly evolving incumbents, challengers and new entrants, in particular with respect to payment services and products, and the introduction of disruptive technology may impede our ability to grow or retain our market share and impact our revenues and profitability.\n\nIncreasing competition in the markets in which we operate (including from non-banks and financial technology competitors) may significantly impact our results if we are unable to match the products and services offered by our competitors. Future economic turmoil may accelerate additional consolidation activity. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms or have declared bankruptcy. These developments could result in our competitors gaining greater access to capital and liquidity, expanding their ranges of products and services, or gaining geographic diversity. We may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors in the event that some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nWe may not always be able to protect our intellectual property developed in our products and services and may be subject to infringement claims, which could adversely impact our core business, inhibit efforts to monetize our internal innovations and restrict our ability to capitalize on future opportunities.\n\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on a combination of contractual rights with third parties and copyright, trademark, trade name, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property, which we develop in connection with our products and services. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. In that event, we may be required to incur significant costs, and our efforts may not prove successful. The inability to secure or protect our intellectual property assets could have an adverse effect on our core business and our ability to compete, including through the monetization of our internal innovations.\n\nWe may also be subject to claims made by third parties for (1) patent, trademark or copyright infringement, (2) breach of copyright, trademark or licence usage rights, or (3) misappropriation of trade secrets. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property right, we could in some circumstances be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or from utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licences. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or to implement a costly workaround. Any of these scenarios could have a material adverse effect on our business and results and could restrict our ability to pursue future business opportunities.\n\nThe inability of counterparties to meet their financial obligations or our inability to fully enforce our rights against counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our results.\n\nThird parties that have an payment obligations to ING, or obligations to return money, securities or other assets, may not pay or perform under their obligations. These parties include the issuers and guarantors (including sovereigns) of securities we hold, borrowers under loans originated, reinsurers, customers, trading counterparties, securities lending and repurchase counterparties, counterparties under swaps, credit default and other derivative contracts, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries. Defaults by one or more of these parties on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate values, continuing low oil or other commodity prices, operational failure or other factors, or even rumours about potential defaults by one or more of these parties or regarding a severe distress of the financial services industry generally, could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition and liquidity.

This is particularly relevant to our franchise as an important and large counterparty in equity, fixed income and foreign exchange markets, including related derivatives.\n\nWe routinely execute a high volume of transactions, such as unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions and equity investments with counterparties and customers in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, insurance companies, institutional clients, futures clearing merchants, swap dealers, and other institutions, resulting in large periodic settlement amounts, which may result in us having significant credit exposure to one or more of such counterparties or customers. As a result, we could face concentration risk with respect to liabilities or amounts we expect to collect from specific counterparties and customers. We are exposed to increased counterparty risk as a result of recent financial institution failures and weakness and will continue to be exposed to the risk of loss if counterparty financial institutions fail or are otherwise unable to meet their obligations. As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and related international response measures, including sanctions and capital controls, we may be exposed to increased risk of default of counterparties located in Russia and Ukraine, counterparties of which the ultimate parent is located in Russia or may be considered effectively controlled or influenced through Russian involvement, and other counterparties in sectors affected by the response measures. Also liquidity or currency controls enforced by the Russian central bank may impact Russian companies' ability to pay. In addition, we have counterparty exposure to Russian entities in connection with foreign exchange derivatives for future receipt of foreign currencies against Russian rouble (RUB). Remaining at risk for ING at year-end 2022 is \u20ac0.3 billion local equity and \u20ac2.5 billion credit exposures booked outside of Russia, and \u20ac0.5 billion with clients in Ukraine. A default by, or even concerns about the creditworthiness of, one or more of these counterparties or customers or other financial services institutions could therefore have an adverse effect on our results or liquidity.\n\nWith respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. We also have exposure to a number of financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions and equity investments. For example, we hold certain hybrid regulatory capital instruments issued by financial institutions which permit the issuer to cancel coupon payments on the occurrence of certain events or at their option. The ECB has indicated that, in certain circumstances, it may require these financial institutions to cancel payment. If this were to happen, we expect that such instruments may experience ratings downgrades and/or a drop in value and we may have to treat them as impaired, which could result in significant losses. There is no assurance that losses on, or impairments to the carrying value of, these assets would not materially and adversely affect our business, results or financial condition.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. The deterioration or perceived deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses and/ or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate\n\nor otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our income and risk weighting, leading to increased capital requirements. While in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. Also in this case, our credit risk may also be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us, which is most likely to occur during periods of illiquidity and depressed asset valuations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis of 2008. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims. Bankruptcies, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral tend to increase in times of market stress and illiquidity. Any of these developments or losses could materially and adversely affect our business, results, financial condition, and/or prospects.\n\nRatings are important to our business for a number of reasons, and a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our credit ratings could have an adverse impact on our results and net results.\n\nCredit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity's ability to repay its indebtedness. Our credit ratings are important to our ability to raise capital and funding through the issuance of debt and to the cost of such financing. In the event of a downgrade, the cost of issuing debt will increase, having an adverse effect on our net results. Certain institutional investors may also be obliged to withdraw their deposits from ING following a downgrade, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. They can also have lower risk appetite for our debt notes, leading to lower purchases of (newly issued) debt notes. We have credit ratings from S&P, Moody's Investor Service and Fitch Ratings. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings and rating methodologies on a recurring basis and may decide on a downgrade at any time.\n\nAs rating agencies continue to evaluate the financial services industry, it is possible that rating agencies will heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to financial institutions, increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, request additional information from the companies that they rate and potentially adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. It is possible that the outcome of any such review of us would have additional adverse ratings consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. We may need to take actions in response to changing standards or capital requirements set by any of the rating agencies, which could cause our business and operations to suffer. We cannot predict what additional actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies.",

Downgrades of these assets could result in a higher riskweighting, which may result in higher capital requirements. This may impact net earnings and the return on capital, and may have an adverse impact on our competitive position.\n\n## An inability to retain or attract key personnel may affect our business and results.\n\nING Group relies to a considerable extent on the quality of its senior management, such as members of the executive committee, and management in the jurisdictions which are material to ING's business and operations. The success of ING Group's operations is dependent, among other things, on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for key personnel in most countries in which ING Group operates, and globally for senior management, is intense. ING Group's ability to attract and retain key personnel, in senior management and in particular areas such as technology and operational management, client relationship management, finance, risk and product development, is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent.\n\nThe increasing restrictions on, and public and political scrutiny of, remuneration (especially in the Netherlands), may continue to have an impact on existing ING Group remuneration policies and individual remuneration packages for personnel. For example, under the EU's amended Shareholder Rights Directive, known as SRD II, which came into effect on 10 June 2019, ING is required to hold a shareholder binding vote on ING's Executive Board remuneration policy and Supervisory Board remuneration policy at least every four years. Furthermore the shareholders have an advisory vote on ING's remuneration report annually. This may restrict our ability to offer competitive compensation compared with companies (financial and/or nonfinancial) that are not subject to such restrictions and it could adversely affect ING Group's ability to retain or attract key personnel, which, in turn, may affect our business and results.\n\nWe may incur further liabilities in respect of our defined benefit retirement plans if the value of plan assets is not sufficient to cover potential obligations, including as a result of differences between actual results and underlying actuarial assumptions and models.\n\nING Group companies operate various defined benefit retirement plans covering the post-employment benefits of a number of our employees. The liability recognised in our consolidated balance sheet in respect of our defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of each plan's assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and unrecognised past service costs. We determine our defined benefit plan obligations based on internal and external actuarial models and calculations using the projected unit credit method. Inherent in these actuarial models are assumptions, including discount rates, rates of increase in future salary and benefit levels, mortality rates and consumer price index. These assumptions are based on available market\n\ndata and are updated annually. Nevertheless, the actuarial assumptions may differ significantly from actual results due to changes in market conditions, economic and mortality trends and other assumptions. Any changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our present and future liabilities and costs associated with our defined benefit plans.\n\n## Risks related to the Group's risk management practices\n\nRisks relating to our use of quantitative models or assumptions to model client behaviour for the purposes of our market calculations may adversely impact our reputation or results.\n\nWe use quantitative methods, systems or approaches that apply statistical, economic financial, or mathematical theories, techniques and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates. Errors in the development, implementation, use or interpretation of such models, or from incomplete or incorrect data, can lead to inaccurate, noncompliant or misinterpreted model outputs, which may adversely impact our reputation and results. In addition, we use assumptions in to model client behaviour for the risk calculations in our banking books. Assumptions are used to determine the interest rate risk profile of savings and current accounts and to estimate the embedded option risk in the mortgage and investment portfolios. Assumptions based on past client behaviour may not always be a reliable indicator of future behaviour. The realisation or use of different assumptions to determine client behaviour could have a material adverse effect on the calculated risk figures and, ultimately, our future results or reputation. Furthermore, we may be subject to risks related to changes in the laws and regulations governing the risk management practices of financial institutions. For further information, see Risks related to the regulation and supervision of the Group - Changes in laws and/or regulations governing financial services or financial institutions or the application of such laws and/or regulations may increase our operating costs and limit our activities' above. As noted there, regulation of the industries in which we operates is becoming increasingly more extensive and complex, while also attracting supervisory scrutiny. Compliance failures may lead to changes in the laws and regulations governing the risk management practices and materially increase our operating costs.\n\n## We may be unable to manage our risks successfully through derivatives.\n\nWe employ various economic hedging strategies with the objective of mitigating the market risks that are inherent in our business and operations. These risks include currency fluctuations, changes in the fair value of our investments, the impact of interest rates, equity markets and credit spread changes, the occurrence of credit defaults and changes in client behaviour. We seek to control these risks by, among other things, entering into a number of derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forward contracts, including, from time to time, macro hedges for parts of our business, either directly as a counterparty or as a credit support provider to affiliate counterparties. Developing an effective strategy for dealing with these risks is complex, and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with those fluctuations.",

Accordingly, our hedging activities may not have the desired beneficial impact on our results or financial condition. Poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions could actually increase our risks and losses. Hedging strategies involve transaction costs and other costs, and if we terminate a hedging arrangement, we may also be required to pay additional costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. There have been periods in the past, and it is likely that there will be periods in the future, during which we have incurred or may incur losses on transactions, possibly significant, after taking into account our hedging strategies. Further, the nature and timing of our hedging transactions could actually increase our risk and losses. Hedging instruments we use to manage product and other risks might not perform as intended or expected, which could result in higher realised or unrealised losses, such as credit value adjustment risks or unexpected P&L effects, and unanticipated cash needs to collateralise or settle such transactions. Adverse market conditions can limit the availability and increase the costs of hedging instruments, and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged. In addition, hedging counterparties may fail to perform their obligations, resulting in unhedged exposures and losses on positions that are not collateralised. As such, our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use or may use may not adequately mitigate or offset the risks they intend to cover, and our hedging transactions may result in losses.\n\nOur hedging strategy additionally relies on the assumption that hedging counterparties remain able and willing to provide the hedges required by our strategy. Increased regulation, market shocks, worsening market conditions (whether due to the ongoing euro crisis or otherwise), and/or other factors that affect or are perceived to affect the financial condition, liquidity and creditworthiness of ING may reduce the ability and/or willingness of such counterparties to engage in hedging contracts with us and/or other parties, affecting our overall ability to hedge our risks and adversely affecting our business, results and financial condition.\n\n## Risks related to the Group's liquidity and financing activities\n\nWe depend on the capital and credit markets, as well as customer deposits, to provide the liquidity and capital required to fund our operations, and adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets, or significant withdrawals of customer deposits, may impact our liquidity, borrowing and capital positions, as well as the cost of liquidity, borrowings and capital.\n\nAdverse capital market conditions have in the past affected, and may in the future affect, our cost of borrowed funds and our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis, thereby impacting our ability to support and/or grow our businesses. Furthermore, although interest rates are still relatively low by historical standards and have been since the financial crisis in 2008, interest rates are rising and we have\n\nexperienced, and may continue to experience, increased funding costs due in part due to the withdrawal of perceived government support of financial institutions in the event of future financial crises. In addition, liquidity in the financial markets has also been negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures adjust to new regulations.\n\nWe need liquidity to fund new and recurring business, to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock, maintain our securities lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations and our business will suffer. The principal sources of our funding include a variety of short-and long-term instruments, including deposit fund, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, medium- and long-term debt, subordinated debt securities, capital securities and shareholders' equity.\n\nIn addition, because we rely on customer deposits to fund our business and operations, the confidence of customers in financial institutions may be tested in a manner that may adversely impact our liquidity and capital position. Consumer confidence in financial institutions may, for example, decrease due to our or our competitors' failure to communicate to customers the terms of, and the benefits and risks to customers of, complex or high-fee financial products. Reduced confidence could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital position through withdrawal of deposits, in addition to our revenues and results. Because a significant percentage of our customer deposit base is originated via internet banking, a loss of customer confidence may result in a rapid withdrawal of deposits over the internet.\n\nIn the event that our current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may need to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Also see under the heading 'Ratings are important to our business for a number of reasons, and a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our credit ratings could have an adverse impact on our results and net results'. Similarly, our access to funds may be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, there is a risk that we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favourable terms, or at all. Any actions we might take to access financing may, in turn, cause rating agencies to re-evaluate our ratings.\n\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital. Such market conditions may in the future limit our ability to raise additional capital to support business growth, or to counterbalance the consequences of losses or increased regulatory capital and rating agency capital requirements. This could force us to (1) delay raising capital, (2) reduce, cancel or postpone payment of dividends on our shares, (3) reduce, cancel or postpone interest payments on our other securities, (iv) issue capital of different types or under different terms than we would otherwise, or (v) incur a higher cost of capital than in a more stable market environment. This would have the potential to decrease both our",

Our results, financial condition, cash flows, regulatory capital and rating agency capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets.\n\nFurthermore, regulatory liquidity requirements in certain jurisdictions in which we operate are remain stringent, undermining our efforts to maintain centralised management of our liquidity. These developments may cause trapped pools of liquidity and capital, resulting in inefficiencies in the cost of managing our liquidity and solvency, and hinder our efforts to integrate our balance sheet. An example of such trapped liquidity includes our operations in Germany where German regulations impose separate liquidity requirements that restrict ING's ability to move a liquidity surplus out of the German subsidiary.\n\nAs a holding company, ING Groep N.V. is dependent for liquidity on payments from its subsidiaries, many of which are subject to regulatory and other restrictions on their ability to transact with affiliates.\n\nING Groep N.V. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments to its shareholders and to fund all payments on its obligations, including debt service obligations.\n\nING Groep N.V.'s ability to obtain funds to meet its obligations depends on legal and regulatory restrictions applicable to ING Groep N.V.'s subsidiaries. Many of ING Groep N.V.'s direct and indirect subsidiaries, including certain subsidiaries of ING Bank N.V., may be subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, as well as requirements with respect to capital and liquidity levels. For example, certain local governments and regulators have taken steps and may take further steps to 'ring fence' or impose minimum internal total loss-absorbing capacity on the local affiliates of a foreign financial institution to protect clients and creditors of such affiliates in the event of financial difficulties involving such affiliates or the broader banking group. Increased local regulation and supervision have therefore limited and may in the future further limit the ability to move capital and liquidity among affiliated entities and between ING Groep N.V. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, limit the flexibility to structure intercompany and external activities of ING as otherwise deemed most operationally efficient, and increase in the overall level of capital and liquidity required by ING on a consolidated basis.\n\nLower earnings of a local entity may also reduce the ability of such local entity to make dividends and distributions to ING Groep N.V. Other restrictions, such as restrictions on payments from subsidiaries or limitations on the use of funds in client accounts, may also apply to distributions to ING Groep N.V. from its subsidiaries.\n\nING Groep N.V. has also in the past guaranteed and may in the future continue to guarantee the payment obligations of some of its subsidiaries, including ING Bank N.V. Any such guarantees may require ING Groep\n\nN.V. to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or the creditors or counterparties of these subsidiaries at a time when the guaranteed subsidiary is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations.\n\nFinally, ING Groep N.V., as the resolution entity of ING, has an obligation to remove impediments to resolution and to improve resolvability. Regulatory authorities have required and may continue to require ING to increase capital or liquidity levels at the level of the resolution entity or at particular subsidiaries. This may result in, among other things, the issuance of additional long-term debt issuance at the level of ING Groep N.V. or particular subsidiaries.\n\n## Additional risks relating to ownership of ING shares\n\nHolders of ING shares may experience dilution of their holdings and may be impacted by any share buyback programme.\n\nING's AT1 Securities may, under certain circumstances, convert into equity securities. Such conversion would dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of ING shares and such dilution could be substantial. Additionally, any conversion, or the anticipation of the possibility of a conversion, could depress the market price of ING shares. Furthermore, we may undertake future equity offerings with or without subscription rights. In case of equity offerings without subscription rights, holders of ING shares may suffer dilutions. In case of equity offerings with subscription rights, holders of ING shares in certain jurisdictions, however, may not be entitled to exercise such rights unless the rights and the related shares are registered or qualified for sale under the relevant legislation or regulatory framework. Holders of ING shares in these jurisdictions may suffer dilution of their shareholding should they not be permitted to, or otherwise chose not to, participate in future equity offerings with subscription rights.\n\nAny share repurchases could affect the price of our ordinary shares, ADSs or other securities and increase trading price volatility. The existence of a share buyback programme could also cause the price of our ordinary shares, ADSs or other securities to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a share buyback programme, and could potentially reduce the market liquidity of our ordinary shares, ADSs or other securities. There can be no assurance that any share buybacks will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our ordinary shares or ADSs may decline below the levels at which we repurchase any ordinary shares or ADSs.\n\nIn addition, ING cannot guarantee that any future share buyback programme will be fully consummated. The timing and amount of share repurchases pursuant to a share buyback programme will depend upon a number of factors, including market, business conditions, and the trading price of the our ordinary shares or ADSs. A share buyback programme may also be suspended or terminated at any time, and any such suspension or termination could negatively affect the trading price of, increase trading price volatility of or reduce the market liquidity of our ordinary shares, ADSs or other securities. Additionally, a share buyback",

As a result, investors may not be able to serve process on those persons within the United States or to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in US courts against us or those persons based on the civil liability provisions of the US securities laws.\n\nInvestors also may not be able to enforce judgments of US courts under the US federal securities laws in courts outside the United States, including the Netherlands. The United States and the Netherlands do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the US federal securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands unless the underlying claim is re-litigated before a Dutch court. However, under current practice, the courts of the Netherlands may be expected to render a judgment in accordance with the judgment of the relevant US court, provided that such judgment (1) is a final judgment and has been rendered by a court which has established its jurisdiction on the basis of internationally accepted grounds of jurisdictions, (2) has not been rendered in violation of elementary principles of fair trial, (3) is not contrary to the public policy of the Netherlands, and (4) is not incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a Netherlands court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or (b) a prior judgment of a foreign court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same subject matter and based on the same cause of action, provided that such prior judgment is not capable of being recognised in the Netherlands. It is uncertain whether this practice extends to default judgments as well.\n\nBased on the foregoing, there can be no assurance that US investors will be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors, officers or certain experts named herein who are residents of the Netherlands or countries other than the United States any judgments obtained in US courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the US federal securities laws.\n\nIn addition, there is doubt as to whether a Dutch court would impose civil liability on us, the members of our board of directors, our officers or certain experts named herein in an original action predicated solely upon\n\nthe US federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands against us or such members, officers or experts, respectively.",
