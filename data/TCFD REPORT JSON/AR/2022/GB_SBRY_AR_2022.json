Following the launch of the campaign we have seen an incremental 1 million web visits. Our investment in brand, alongside our direct digital  marketing  investment,  has  contributed  to  further  improving  our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndirect/aggregator sourced customer mix (a 4% growth YoY) and helps us in reducing our cost to acquire new business.\n\nIn Argos Financial Services (AFS), we have  enhanced  connectivity with Argos  throughout the year, with new marketing channels launching and increased integration of our products across Argos channels and events.\n\nOur  Net Promoter Score (NPS) for Sainsburys Bank and Argos Financial Services brands  remains strong,  supported by  continued developments of customer online journeys.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Argos Financial Services, our customer base is more digitally engaged than ever with 91% of our active customers now registered for our Mobile app, up 3% from last year, and we saw a 2% increase in the share of payments coming through our digital channels - now up to 79% of total payment value. In Insurances we have seen a record level of our Car and Home Insurance customers register for online self-service, with 87% of our live book now registered customers. Our profile of digital customers shows that they spend more, borrow more and save more across our products.\n\nIn Credit Cards, we launched Apple Pay in June 2022 with customers already making 4.7m transactions. Further app functionality was added through the year.\n\nIn Loans and Savings , we delivered  further enhancements to  our  new  the  application journey, offering  a more seamless, fully digital 'short apply' experience for existing customers looking for a loan or savings product.\n\nIn Insurances , to simplify and automate processes, improving customer experience and increasing efficiency within our Car and Home insurance business, we introduced robotic process automation.\n\n## Reopening of Travel Money Business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTravel Money, after a couple years of disruption, saw turnover more than treble as demand for foreign travel returned. Our 225 in-store bureaux re-opened, as colleagues returned from supporting Sainsburys stores, serving over 2 million customers. For the first time the campaign via Nectar360 was promoted to increase customer awareness in stores. Our Travel Money Card relaunched in November, increasing the number of currencies you can hold on it to 15.\n\n## Response to cost of living\n\nAs a trusted ally, we're here to support customers through the cost-of-living crisis. Our cost-of-living hub launched on 30 Sept 2022, which houses tools, information and practical support for those in need.\n\nAffordability calculations have been updated to reflect ongoing inflation, including rising energy costs, and we have strengthened our approach to validating customer income.\n\n## Launch of Monthly Payment Plan\n\nInterest bearing Monthly Payment Plans rolled out to all Argos categories (excluding clothing) during this financial year, giving Argos customers a monthly payment option on higher price items when purchasing online for instore collection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

A dividend of \u00a350m was paid in April 2022.\n\nWe continue to operate with sufficient capital and liquidity buffers to protect against potential future stress scenarios and our mortgage book continues to run off.\n\nWe continue developing our products and services that appeal to more Sainsbury's  customers,  listening  to  them  and  what  they  tell  us.  We continue to improve online customer journeys and invest in faster and smoother digital application processing.\n\nWhilst very much still at the core of our focus and strategy, due to the economic headwinds of recent years we anticipate a delay in achieving the following targets:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe were targeting to reduce our cost to income ratio to circa 50% within 5  years,  however  this  is  challenging  with  Covid-19  and  economic headwinds  impacting  revenue  through  reduced  credit  demand  and travel. Our cost income ratio has decreased to 64% (from 68% in FY22) and is expected to further improve.\n\nOur target was to double underlying profits and reach double digit ROCE within 5 years. While we expect profitability to improve, there is likely to be a delay in us reaching these levels.\n\n## Connectivity\n\nOur number of customers in Sainsbury's Bank has increased from 1.8 million at February 2022 to 1.9 million at February 2023, largely driven by increases across Cards and Savings products. Customer numbers in Argos Financial Services remained stable at 2.1 million.\n\nNectar continues to be an integral part of our strategy to connect with Sainsbury's customers, with circa 80% of our customers holding a Nectar card and benefiting from Nectar points and rewards across a range of products. This year we issued 2.8 billion of Nectar points to our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  continue  to  support  the  growth  of  our  Sainsbury's  core  food  business  and  general merchandising, funding over \u00a31.7bn of retail spend on our Credit Cards, Store Cards and Monthly Payment Plan products across Sainsbury's, Argos and Habitat.",

Its governance framework and regular programme of agenda items ensures it has due regard to:\n\n- \u00b7 The likely longer-term consequences of its decisions. For example, the Board approves a rolling five-year strategic plan on an annual basis and regularly monitors its progress through key metrics (which form the basis of KPIs outlined on pages 15 to 16) and sub-committees to provide appropriate review, balanced challenge and transparency on decision making.\n- \u00b7 Maintaining the reputation of the Bank (and the Sainsbury's Group brands it uses) for high standards of business conduct. The Board promotes the values of the wider Sainsbury's Group across the organisation. These values help colleagues to know how to act at work and we believe they are right because they are also the way that many of us live outside of work too. Sainsbury's Group (including the Bank and its subsidiaries) has always had a strong sense of social, environmental and economic responsibility and an understanding that our success depends on society's success. Further details on our approach to diversity, environmental and social factors are outlined in the Non-Financial reporting section on pages 8 to 13.\n- \u00b7 The views and interests of its key stakeholders. The Board seeks to understand the views of key stakeholders in order to inform effective decision-making and to deliver long-term success. It identifies our core stakeholders as: customers and communities; colleagues; investors; suppliers; and regulators.\n\nBy taking regard of these factors, the Board seeks to ensure that the Directors have acted both individually and collectively in a way that would, in good faith, be considered likely to promote the success of the Group while having due regard to all its stakeholders and to the matters set out in paragraphs a to f of section 172 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nFurther information of our consumer duty can be found on page 21 of the strategic report.

They trust us to be a responsible business, whether that's by supporting the communities we serve and source from, managing our environmental impacts or contributing to a healthier, more inclusive society.\n\nWe strive to do the best for our customers and the business, addressing key ESG issues and living up to our Sainsbury's values. We are committed to driving improvements across the ESG agenda while also leveraging Sainsbury's environmental agenda.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe section below gives more details on our Environmental and Social strategy and along with some of our successes to date. Refer to page 26 for our section on Governance.\n\n## Environmental Strategy\n\nOur ESG strategy specifically includes the commitment to reduce our own Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions covering our direct and indirect emissions within our operations, and commit to be net zero by 2035, in line with the wider Sainsbury's Group target. More information on the Sainsbury's Group commitment can be found in the Sainsbury's Sustainability update found at https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/sustainability/plan-for-better/reports-policies-and-standards/2022\n\nAs  part  of  Sainsbury's,  our  facilities  management  approach  actively  manages,  and  looks  to  continuously  improve  our  waste management and recycling. We frequently use video and telephone conferencing facilities rather than travel to meetings. Colleagues are encouraged to use public transport and cycle to work. We take time to identify practical ways to reduce the environmental impact of our leaflets and Point of Sale materials in stores.\n\nThings we have achieved since the launch of our plan for better strategy include:\n\n- \u00b7 Reduction in paper usage by encouraging customers to go paperless for statements and delivering a number of online apps which encourage customers to self-serve online and in time will reduce the need for written correspondence\n- \u00b7 Our new credit cards issues are made from 57% recycled plastic\n- \u00b7 Adding symbols to our instore marketing materials so instore colleagues know how to recycle them\n- \u00b7 In our offices we have upgraded to LED lighting and have an active campaign ongoing to reduce consumption of single-use plastics and paper\n- \u00b7 Updated our Wholesale Credit Risk Policy such that the Group will not directly finance companies or organisations whose main activities actively contribute to climate change.\n\n## Environmental Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\nThe following table compares Scope 1 and 2 Greenhouse gas emissions for FY23 (current year) and FY22 (prior year).\n\n| Environmental Data                     | 2023   | 2022   | % change   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| GHG emissions (tCO2e) - Location Based |        |        |            |\n| Scope 1 bs                             | 290.32 | 345.41 | (16)%      |\n| Scope 2 emissions                      | 328.00 | 227.63 | 44%        |\n|                                        | 618.32 | 573.04 | 8%         |\n| GHG emissions (tCO2e) - Market Based   |        |        |            |\n| Scope 1 emissions                      | 290.32 | 345.41 | (16)%      |\n| Scope 2 emissions                      | -      | 257.78 | (100)%     |\n|                                        | 290.32 | 603.19 | (52)%      |\n\nThe  Group's  Scope  1  emissions  decrease  was  predominately  driven  by  lower  heating  emissions  in  the  offices,  due  to  milder temperatures.

All Scope 2 Location based emissions have been calculated using UK Government's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2022. Market based Electricity is covered by either a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), a certified green tariff, or falls within onsite renewable generation from wind and solar energy.\n\nThe Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosed above relate to electricity and gas used in Group office locations and company car fuel use associated with Group employee travel. Note it does not currently include a percentage allocation of office locations for centralised shared services.\n\n## Note on scope 3 emissions\n\nThe  SBTi  drives  ambitious  climate  action  by  enabling  companies  to  set  science-based  emissions  reduction  targets.  Financial institutions differ from other economic sectors in that they provide finance to the companies that are responsible for reducing emissions, rather than exercise direct control over emission reductions. Therefore, financial institutions require an approach within the SBTi that is tailored to their role. Currently unsecured consumer lending products are out of scope of the SBTi guidance for financial institutions.\n\nIn the absence of a methodology to calculate our scope 3 impact, we are none the less considering actions that will have a positive impact in this area. Active monitoring and management of our metrics and targets within our risk appetite statements contribute to this effort.\n\n## TCFD Roadmap\n\nWe are committed to seeking to better understand climate-related risk in relation to our business and prepare a response in alignment with the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD).

We consider not only acquiring new customers, but also how best to retain and reward those already with us. We also want to make our services as simple as possible for everyone to use, including people who have a disability. Our website sets out the areas we are working hard to continually improve our online accessibility: https://www.sainsburysbank.co.uk/onlinesupport/support-online-accessibility\n\nThis year we commenced preparation for the forthcoming Consumer Duty regulation to ensure that good customers outcomes are delivered to all customers, including vulnerable customers. More detail on this programme of work has been included in the s172 statement on page 7.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is measured through Net Promoter Score (NPS), capturing online and telephone feedback, and is reported to the Board. Findings are used to improve our customers' experience and engagement with knowledge being shared across all our business. We also have a clear process for responding to customer complaints and any key themes that are identified are reviewed by the Board and senior management.\n\n## Communities\n\nThe Sainsbury's Group Values and Sustainability Plan underpin our approach to what we do, and how. By acting in  the  best  interests  of  all  our  stakeholders,  we  can  make  a  sustainable  and  positive  contribution  to  our community. We also know that playing an active and supportive role in our community is really important to our colleagues. It makes us all feel good to know we're doing something for someone else. We actively participate in national awareness events, such as LGBT+ History Month, Black History Month and Purple Tuesday.\n\nIn 2022/23, our colleagues raised over \u00a360,000 for charity, with \u00a355,000 of this for Maggie's who help to provide free practical, emotional and social support to people with Cancer. Maggie's have been our charity partner since 2019 and we have raised over \u00a3150,000 for Maggie's Centres since then.\n\n## Colleagues\n\nWe aim to make the Group a great place to work for all colleagues. Our 'Great Place to Work Group' is part of the group-wide approach, enabling colleagues' voices to be heard and providing an effective way to communicate what matters to our colleagues to make a difference in our business.\n\nThis financial year, we've enhanced our colleague proposition with the introduction of Smarter Working - a big, ambitious change for our business with a focus on more efficient  meetings  and  working  practices  to  allow  more  flexible  working  for  all colleagues. By empowering our teams to work differently, we can individually and collectively be more productive, alongside having more time for customer-centric thinking, innovation, focussed work and personal development. And we unlock better flexibility, choice, and balance in the way we work. It's a bold opportunity to make things  better  for  everyone,  boost  our  productivity  and  engagement,  and  deliver improved outcomes for our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We want our colleagues to feel connected and engaged and we measure this through our annual colleague engagement survey. The colleague happiness score of 71 for FY23 is up from 66 last year. Feedback on how line management treat, and support colleagues continues to be a real positive, with colleagues saying they felt supported with their wellbeing, are well communicated to and that their line manager is approachable and accessible. We also carry out an additional check-in survey to ensure we're engaging with colleagues regularly on how they're feeling and get their input on business activities.\n\n## A diverse and inclusive place to work\n\nAs part of the Sainsbury's Group, we support the Sainsbury's Group's vision to become the 'most inclusive' retailer by embracing our differences. The activities we're undertaking to be a more diverse and inclusive organisation are fundamentally about fairness and equality. We are active in our drive for inclusivity and the progression of our diverse talent.

In FY23, 81% of colleagues shared their ethnicity with us (up from 78% last year).\n\nWe have workplace adjustments process in place for our colleagues who are living with a disability or long term health condition which operates through the Government's Access to Work scheme.

The gap is, in part, reflective of the number of  in-store Travel Money Bureaux colleagues with around 32% of Sainsbury's Bank colleagues working in these roles on hourly rates of pay and over 70% of these roles being held by women. In addition to the Travel Money colleague composition, Sainsbury's Bank still has more men than women in the most senior roles and more women than men in hourly paid positions, further impacting the pay gap.\n\nWe continue to see an improvement in female representation at senior levels since signing up to the Women in Finance Charter (WIF) in 2018. We had a target to achieve 40% female representation at senior levels by February 2024. We have managed to meet this target a year early, reaching 41% by February 2023, up from 37% last year.\n\nWe actively support our colleagues of all gender identities through our inclusion strategy and our LGBT+ colleague network, Proud@Sainsbury's.\n\n## Ethnicity Pay Gap\n\nSainsbury's Group include voluntary disclosures on the ethnicity pay gap at a group level.

Our Board sets our risk appetite to support and protect investor value and to ensure we operate within appropriate and agreed levels and types of risks.\n\nOur strategic aim is to be the provider of Financial Services for loyal Sainsbury's Group customers. The Group's interests are represented by an appointed Non-executive Director to ensure effective challenge and collaboration to grow our connected services. Where interests are not aligned, this is managed through disclosure and activities to minimise potential conflicts.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nOur Board understands the importance of our supply chain in delivering our plans and the long-term success of the business. We seek a strong degree of engagement with 3 rd party suppliers across the end-to-end supplier management process, from sourcing to procurement to relationship management to contract reviews. We recognise that when we outsource a service, we do not outsource the responsibility. We ensure our suppliers are compliant with regulatory requirements and have the necessary controls in place in line with risks to make sure we continue to meet a high standard of conduct for our customers. Our Supply chain Oversight Committee provides performance oversight of our suppliers and reports to senior management and the Board.\n\nContinuous and pro-active collaboration with our suppliers is undertaken on a regular basis. This provides a forum for developing the business relationship and to ensure we receive an effective service, identify and manage risk appropriately and operate in line with our values. A key factor in building effective relationships with our suppliers is ensuring our requirements are clear and that they are paid on time. The Bank's iSupplier internet portal provides suppliers with access to the purchase orders raised and allows them to allocate their respective invoices once they have fulfilled the order requirements.\n\n## Regulators\n\nWe are regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority for prudential issues and by the Financial Conduct Authority for conduct of business matters. We engage with regulators on an open and proactive basis, ensuring full compliance with the letter and spirit of the rules we operate within.\n\nWe recognise the trust that customers place in the Sainsbury's and Argos brands and seek to maintain that by operating in a safe and sound way. Our Head of Conduct and Compliance provides oversight of any emerging compliance risks and reports any areas of concern to the Board.\n\n## Consumer Duty\n\nDuring the financial year, the Board and management invested extensive time and effort in understanding and monitoring the implementation of the FCA's new Consumer Duty rules. In March 2022 the Board was provided with a high level overview of Consumer Duty and its potential impact on the Bank and its subsidiaries together with an overview of the preparatory work underway at the time to meet the requirements of this significant regulatory change. This allowed the Board to understand and query the requirements from the business between then and July 2023 (when the new regulation comes into effect).\n\nAt the outset, the Board agreed that Consumer Duty related decisions may influence the strategic direction of the Group's products and services, determine how successfully they met the needs of the Group's customers and would define to what extent business profitability would be impacted. A dedicated change project was established, with the Bank's Chief Customer Officer appointed as Accountable Executive for its delivery although, given the cross-cutting nature of the changes needed, other holders of Senior Manager Functions within the Bank were appointed with accountability for delivering different aspects of it.\n\nAt its request, regular briefings on progress against the agreed milestones were provided to the Bank Board with extended updates provided by the Accountable Executive at its meetings in August, September and October 2022 and February 2023.\n\nOne of the Bank's Independent Non-Executive Directors was appointed as Board Champion for Consumer Duty, although all Board members were fully engaged in the project via the regular briefings. The Board Champion interrogated the detailed plan and worked with the business to ensure it was robust. The Board then signed off the Consumer Duty implementation plan at its October 2022 meeting in advance of the due date of the 31 st October, 2022.",

The rules would also reinforce a culture of fairness and reasonableness with the Group's colleagues.\n\nDuring the regular briefings, the Board challenged management on whether they were satisfied that the Group was identifying all vulnerable customers properly. Management confirmed that the project would integrate its existing work on customer vulnerability into Consumer Duty. ExCo members have been more closely involved in strategic projects, specifically the development of the new Everyday Credit Card and Essentials Car insurance.\n\nThe Board agreed that compliance with the new Consumer Duty rules would ensure a positive impact on the communities the Group serves and would demonstrate greater levels of care for vulnerable customers in society. The Board was also advised that delivery of Consumer Duty would encourage greater collaboration and shared values with suppliers to achieve fair value and good outcomes for customers, whilst achieving mutually beneficial business models.\n\nOverall, the Board was fully engaged with the development of the plans for compliance with the new Consumer Duty rules, devoting extensive time at its meetings to it, challenging management on progress and signing off the plans and approach as necessary.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\n<!-- image -->",

We adopt a holistic, end-to-end view of risk, ensuring that the material risks arising from our key processes and activities are effectively identified, assessed, managed and controlled to make well informed decisions. This is supported and implemented via a three lines of defence model. This framework covers the Bank and its subsidiaries. The Chief Risk Officer performs a strategic risk management role and is responsible for managing and enhancing the enterprise-wide risk management framework.\n\nOur approach to EWRMF includes the following key steps:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Strategy and Culture\n\nOur risk strategy and culture are a critical factor within the EWRMF which outlines the shared set of values and behaviours that defines how all colleagues approach and take ownership for the management of risks within the Bank. This approach is underpinned by the Senior Managers and Certification Regime introduced by the FCA in 2016. The following key aims and principles define our risk strategy and culture.\n\n| Aims (what)      | Insightful                                   | Customer-Focused                                        | Alert                                               | Resilient                                                | Engaged                                                                    |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Principles (how) | We identify and  manage risk  concentrations | Good customer  outcomes are at the  heart of what we do | We anticipate  market trends; we  don't follow them | We fund before we  lend, and we  control before we  grow | Material risks are  identified, and key  controls are tested  and reported |\n\n## Risk Appetite\n\nThe principal financial and non-financial risks identified within the EWRMF each have qualitative risk appetite statements that informs our strategy for managing risk. From these statements specific quantitative metrics are established which articulate how much risk the Group is to take in the pursuit of our strategic objectives. These metrics are reviewed and approved on an annual basis by Board.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite reporting structure includes:\n\n- \u00b7 A 'High-Level' Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) that provides a concise set of key Group-wide targets and limits, with a balance of current, forward-looking and stress-based metrics for financial and non-financial risks.\n- \u00b7 'Directional' RAS limits for each of the Group's key risk types (e.g. retail credit risk, operational risk). These Directional limits are designed to give early indications of changes in the internal and external risk environment, providing an outlook on whether we remain on-track to meet our 'high-level' risk appetite targets.\n\nPerformance against both the 'High-level' and 'Directional' RAS measures are monitored and reported to our Executive Risk Committee (ERC) monthly, and at each Board Risk Committee (BRC). Additionally, escalation processes are clearly embedded in the enterprisewide risk management policy framework to notify Senior Executives and Board members of any high-level RAS measure operating outside of approved thresholds, including recommendations to reduce exposures back within appetite levels.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\n## Risk Policies\n\nWe have identified a set of principal risk types to which our business model is inherently exposed ( see separate section below ). Each risk type has a principal risk owner that actively manages and oversees the risks in the Group in line with associated policy and supporting policy standards. These policies clearly articulate the objectives and requirements to be met to ensure that that these risks are managed effectively on a day-to-day basis, in-line with risk appetite.\n\n## Evidence of Control\n\nWe use Process Risks and Control Assessments (PRCAs) to provide a process-centric approach to identify, measure and control our key risks, which is underpinned by a robust evidence-based assessment of the control environment. Each material risk is assessed based on its inherent and residual risk exposure in the prevailing control environment and its target exposure if different from current residual levels. Where it is identified that controls need to be strengthened, treatment plans are put in place and actioned to mitigate the risk. This process, whilst in operation, is one which continues to be refined and matured to ensure the organisation's control environment is operating within our risk appetite.\n\nOur Business Enterprise Risk Tool (BERT) is used to record and manage our key processes, the controls we have in place, any treatment plans to improve our control environment and to record our management of risk events. All required colleagues have access to BERT enabling them to view risk data against their own processes as well as across the organisation.\n\nWe continually look to improve our controls in line with industry best practice and the environment in which we operate.\n\n## Risk Reporting\n\nOur risk reporting processes are critical to understanding the specific and aggregate levels of risk to which we are exposed and the effectiveness of our controls to manage these risks. We promote insightful reporting at all levels to encourage debate on what matters most, and to ensure effective action is being taken at an appropriate level to address any current or emerging areas of concern.\n\n## Resilience plans and stress testing\n\nFinancial and Operational Resilience are key areas of focus. Our capital and liquidity adequacy are assessed on at least an annual basis through the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment process (ICAAP) and the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment process (ILAAP). Business recovery plans for severe incidents are reviewed on a regular basis, while our Recovery and Resolution Plans review and test our playbooks and recovery capacity in response to extreme but plausible threats to our viability. The Group also undertakes selfassessment of its Operational Resilience Framework on an annual basis which is approved by the Board.\n\n## Risk Management Structure\n\nWe adopt a Three Lines of Defence framework to provide a basis for the identification and management of all risks associated with our business model and strategy which ensures there is effective oversight and challenge in place.\n\nOur Three Lines of Defence framework is deployed on the following basis:\n\n- \u00b7 First Line . Primary responsibility for the identification, management, monitoring and control of risks rests with our commercial and operational teams. The First Line teams, as subject matter experts, own the processes and controls used to manage risks within risk appetite complying with requirements detailed within risks policies and policy standards.\n- \u00b7 Second Line . The independent Risk Management Division is responsible for setting risk frameworks, policies, guidance and oversight within which the First Line can manage its risks.\n- \u00b7 Third Line. Our Internal Audit Division provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of risk management and internal control processes in mitigating and reporting risks.\n\n## Emerging Risks\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging and evolving changes in the risk environment in order to promote early discussion to understand and address any threats or opportunities to our business model. We consider specific emerging threats and opportunities  under the following broad themes:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic . Reflects both our business model and the markets in which we operate. For example, regular consideration is given to changes in the competitive market resulting from new entrants or mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, and any resultant impact on margins.",

For example, we continually review the evolving nature of cyber-crime and its impact on the  Group  in terms of financial losses and operational costs to protect our customers.\n- \u00b7 Geo-Political and Economic. Reflects the impact of macroeconomic conditions and government policy on our markets. For example, we continue to reflect on UK market conditions arising from the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the impact changes in interest rates, inflation, the employment market or house prices may have on the availability and demand for our products given the cost-of-living pressures.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory and Conduct .  Reflects  continued  developments  within  the  financial  services  sector  including  PRA  and  FCA consultations and changes to Basel regulations.\n\nAs more information is known about an emerging risk relevant to SBAFS it will be subject to a full risk assessment. Actions will then be taken to manage and control the risk, unless it is assessed as not relevant or not material to the Group.\n\nCost of living Sustained pressures on the cost of living, mostly driven by higher energy and food prices, rising interest rates and changes to taxes and benefits is straining customer's household incomes and their ability to spend thereby impacting economic growth prospects. Customer impacts are closely monitored with support offered as required. The  Group  also undertakes stress testing scenarios to ensure it has enough capital and liquidity to operate over a range of economic outcomes including higher inflation.\n\nRussia/Ukraine conflict -The impact of increasing geopolitical risks, via Russia and Ukraine, further exacerbates potential downside economic risks in energy and commodity shortages, impacting the economic environment.\n\nCyber Security - The Russia/Ukraine conflict is also raising our inherent Information Security Risk, with heightened monitoring in place for the detection of ransomware attacks. We also see data protection risks increasing as a function of cyber threats which may feed through into higher conduct and fraud risk (anti money laundering and sanctions risks) if we were to witness non-compliant use of data.\n\nBanking  Sector  volatility -  Following  the  recent  bank  failures  in  the  US  and  Europe  the  Group  has  been  actively  tracking developments and possible impacts to the Group if we were to experience a broader financial crisis, albeit it is noted that the regulatory response has been strong to date. The Group's initial focus has been on the risks to the Treasury portfolio, which are held primarily for liquidity management purposes, consisting of floating rate assets with no exposures or limits to those impacted banks. The credit quality of the portfolio remains low risk, concentrated in AA-/Aa3 or higher counterparties, suggesting a very low probability of default.\n\nClimate Change potentially exposes the Group to direct and indirect financial risks. In line with PRA guidance (SS3/19), we have developed a strategy to identify, assess and manage our exposure across the key areas of governance, risk management, scenario analysis and disclosure. A framework has been established to ensure appropriate visibility of the risks arising from climate change and our ICAAP includes an assessment of the impact of financial risks from climate change, including the impact of extreme weather on our ability to serve our customers.\n\nWe have assessed climate related risk factors across credit, market and operational risk and have also considered reputational risk. To date none of the assessed risks has resulted in a material financial impact, however we continually monitor the outlook and amend our responses and risk appetite accordingly.\n\n| Area        | Assessment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Impact to date                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Outlook                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Market risk | Increased sovereign risk could result  in a downgrade to national or local  government's  credit  rating,  thereby  impacting the value of securities held  on the Group's balance sheet.

Details of the Board composition may be found below. The Directors of the subsidiary entities hold Board meetings to cover statutory matters however the key decision making is covered within the Bank Board.\n\n## Relationship with J Sainsbury Plc\n\nThe Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of J Sainsbury plc, a listed retailer. J Sainsbury plc currently has one Director on the Bank Board acting in the capacity of a Non-Executive Director. The J Sainsbury plc appointed director has equal rights and powers as the other directors. J Sainsbury plc is not involved in the day-to-day management of the Group. However, J Sainsbury plc has certain reserved powers and decisions which fall within those powers must be referred to them by the Bank Board for their consent before being confirmed as fully approved. Primarily, these reserved matters relate to significant change in the size and scale of the Group's operations, changes in its capital structure including any increases or decreases to capital, significant contracts or legal disputes, changes to Directors or Officers of the Bank and share schemes.\n\n## Board Composition\n\n## Chair\n\nThe Bank has a separate Chair (an Independent Non-Executive Director) and Chief Executive (an Executive Director) to ensure that the balance of responsibilities, accountabilities and decision making are effectively maintained. The Chair plays a key role in creating the conditions for overall Board and individual director effectiveness.\n\n## Balance and Diversity\n\nRecruitment on to the Bank Board combines an assessment of both technical capability and competency skills to ensure the optimum blend of individual and aggregate expertise having regards to the Bank's long term strategic plan. Such recruitment is subject to the approval of the Nominations Committee, the Bank Board, J Sainsbury plc (as the decision falls within reserved matters) and the relevant regulatory bodies (where applicable).\n\nIndependent Non-Executive Directors bring their experience to bear from across various sectors, notably Financial Services but also from across Retail, Digital and E-Commerce. These are key areas of focus for the Bank and aligned to its strategy. Directors update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Bank by meeting senior management, a programme of developmental training (from both internal and external speakers) and by attending appropriate external seminars. There is an induction programme for all new Directors which is tailored to their specific needs and which provides access to all parts of the business.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\nThe Independent Non-Executive Directors are wholly independent in that they have no material business or relationships with the company that might influence their independence or judgement. In addition, certain governance responsibilities are delegated to other  Board  Committees  (Audit  Committee,  Board  Risk  Committee,  Remuneration  Committee  and  Nominations  Committee). Membership of these committees is entirely made up of Non-Executive Directors of the Bank with members of the Bank's Executive team and other senior colleagues in attendance. These committees support effective decision making and independent challenge.\n\n## Size and Structure\n\nThe structure of the Bank Board seeks to ensure the right leadership is in place to become an agile, capital and cost-efficient provider of simple, mobile-led financial services to Sainsbury's and Argos customers.\n\nThe Bank Board is comprised of an Independent Chair, four other Independent Non-Executive Directors, one Non-Executive Director nominated by J Sainsbury plc and two Executive Directors -  the Bank's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer. A biography for each Board Director can be found on the J Sainsbury plc corporate website: www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/ourmanagement#sainsburys-bank\n\nThe Directors have equal voting rights when making decisions, except the Chair, who has a casting vote at the Bank Board. All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and may, if they wish, take professional advice at the company's expense. Directors' duties are exercised through the Board and its sub-committees per the Governance structure on Page 26. Each of these is chaired by one of the Independent Non-Executive Directors.\n\n## Director Responsibilities\n\n## Accountability\n\nEach Board Director has a clear understanding of their accountability and responsibilities via the Individual Accountability Regime. Whilst Board oversight is always maintained, key decisions are made by the individuals and committees with the most appropriate knowledge and experience.\n\nThe Board had a programme of nine main meetings in 2022/23. Additional Board meetings were convened to consider certain matters where it was not felt appropriate to defer until the next full meeting. Governance requirements (including quorum adherence) were applied as if these additional meetings were full Board meetings. A programme of nine main meetings is planned for 2023/24.\n\nOne of the Board meetings is usually set aside each year for strategic planning with the Executive Committee and key stakeholders from across the Bank, AFS and J Sainsbury plc as appropriate. As part of their annual review, the Bank Chair undertakes a Fit and Proper Assessment and Attestation with each Board Director. The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director undertakes the same for the Bank Chair.\n\n## Integrity of information\n\nThe Board receives regular and timely information at its meeting on all key aspects of the business supported by a range of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The Bank's various functions prepare and maintain the integrity of this information in accordance with the Bank's risk management framework.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nAny potential conflicts of interest are identified and considered as part of the recruitment process for on-boarding new Directors on to the Bank Board. Where there are any concerns raised, they are considered by the Bank's Nominations Committee and again at the Board meeting when the recommendation is brought for approval.\n\nOnce in situ, should a Director be offered the opportunity to take up a position (Executive or Non-Executive), whilst retaining their role on the Bank Board, they are required to inform the Bank Chair and the Board would then be asked to confirm that no conflicts of interest existed or were perceived to exist before accepting the additional role. Where there are any potential conflicts, appropriate safeguards would be implemented.\n\n## Committees\n\nA number of Board functions are delegated to four key sub-committees. The role and scope of authority for each sub-committee is fully outlined in a documented Terms of Reference:\n\n- \u00b7 Audit Committee .  The Audit Committee's key responsibility is to advise the Board on the Bank's financial statements, including systems and controls and related policy issues together with relationships with external auditors.

Recruitment into the Board combines an assessment of both technical, leadership capability and competency skills to ensure the optimum blend of individual and aggregate capability having regard to our long term strategic plan. Board recruitment is subject to the approval of the Nominations Committee, the Board and the relevant regulatory bodies (PRA/FCA).\n\n## Board diversity\n\nWe are committed to promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace at all levels, reflective of the communities in which we do business. Our diversity and inclusion vision aligns with that of our parent J Sainsbury plc whose aim is to be 'the most inclusive retailer'. We will achieve this aspiration by recruiting, retaining and developing diverse and talented people and creating an inclusive environment where everyone can be the best they can be and where diverse views are welcomed. The Nominations Committee is responsible for ensuring there is an appropriate balance of skills and experience across the Board.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nThe Bank has provided an indemnity for the benefit of all of its current Directors which is a qualifying third party indemnity provision for the purpose of the Companies Act 2006.

The Group continues to maintain its strong capital and liquidity position and has also been subject to review and challenge by the PRA as part of its remit as lead regulator of the Group.\n\nFurther information on the key financial risks of the business can be found in note 33.\n\nThe Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements, taking into account a range of possible operational, economic and legal scenarios.

Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the Group's financial statement close process, which included how the going concern assessment for the Group is undertaken. We engaged with Management early to ensure all key factors were considered in the Group's going concern  assessment;\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the Directors' rationale for the use of the going concern basis of accounting through reviewing their going concern assessment conclusions, which stressed the underlying forecasts and assumptions, and performed inquiries of Management and those charged with governance;\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the Group's going concern assessment which included reviewing the evaluation of the Group's resilience to financial and operational stress on capital and liquidity requirements. The Group included a number of adverse scenarios in their forecasts in order to incorporate unexpected changes to their forecasted capital and liquidity levels and we have tested the clerical accuracy of these forecasts and assessed the assumptions applied within the forecasts;\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the Groups assessment by considering viability and operational resilience under different stress scenarios, including the impact of strategic plans and the continued impact of the current economic environment. We also challenged the Group's considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and associated disclosures;\n- \u00b7 We have reviewed the stress and reverse stress testing performed in order to identify what factors would lead to all of the Group's capital and liquidity eroding during the going concern period and assessed those factors against the likelihood of occurrence;\n- \u00b7 We reviewed the Group's going concern disclosures included in the annual report in order to assess whether the disclosures were appropriate and in conformity with the reporting standards.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Overview of our audit approach\n\n| Audit scope       | \u00b7 We performed an audit of the complete financial information of the group and parent  company.  \u00b7 All audit work performed for the purposes of the Group audit was undertaken by the  primary team.   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Key audit matters | \u00b7 Expected credit loss provision                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|                   | \u00b7 Effective Interest Rate accounting                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                   | \u00b7 Valuation of intangible assets                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|                   | \u00b7 Reliance on the processes and controls of third-party service providers                                                                                                                              |\n| Materiality       | \u00b7 Overall group materiality of \u00a36.2m which represents 1.5% of gross margin.                                                                                                                            |",

The Group has determined that the most significant future impacts from climate change on its operations will be from transitional risks on the wider UK economy. These are explained in the strategic report on pages 23-24. They have also explained their climate commitments on pages 9 to 11 in the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures. All of these disclosures form part of the 'Other information,' rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on 'Other information'.\n\nIn planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the Group's business and any consequential material impact on its financial statements.\n\nThe Group has explained in note 33 to the financial statements on page 98 its articulation of how climate change has been reflected in the financial statements and of the significant judgements and estimates made in this regard. These disclosures also explain where governmental and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing, and where the degree of certainty of these changes means that they cannot be taken into account when determining asset and liability valuations under the requirements of International Accounting Standards.\n\nOur audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the financial statements was focused on evaluating management's assessment of the impact of climate risk, physical and transition, their climate commitments, the effects of material climate risks disclosed on pages 23 and 24 including the significant judgements As part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment to determine the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements from climate change which needed to be considered in our audit.\n\nWhere considerations of climate change were relevant to our assessment of going concern, these are described above.\n\nBased on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to materially impact a key audit matter.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n| Risk                                                                                                                                                           | Our response to the risk                                                                                                                                                                                            | Key observations communicated  to the Audit Committee                                                                                                                                                          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Expected Credit Loss Provisions                                                                                                                                | Expected Credit Loss Provisions                                                                                                                                                                                     | Expected Credit Loss Provisions                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Impairment Provision (2023: \u00a3259m,  2022: \u00a3221m)   Refer to Accounting policies (page 53);  and Note 13 of the Consolidated  Financial Statements (page 66)    | We assessed the design effectiveness of  key controls across the processes relevant  to the impairment provision calculation,  involving specialists to assist us in  performing our procedures where  appropriate. | We are satisfied provisions for the  impairment of loans and advances  to customers are reasonable and  recognised in accordance with the  applicable reporting framework  based on our procedures  performed. |\n| Customer receivables comprise  unsecured personal loans, credit cards,  mortgages and store cards.

Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be \u00a36.2m which is 1.5% of gross margin. We have not provided prior year comparatives for materiality thresholds because previously the Group has not presented consolidated financial information. We believe that gross margin provides us with an appropriate basis for materiality as the Group is composed of profit-orientated entities. This basis is consistent with the basis used for materiality in previous periods for the Parent Company financial statements when a consolidated Group position was not reported.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be \u00a34.3m (2022: \u00a33.6m), which is 1.5% (2022: 1.5%) of gross margin.\n\n## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% of our planning materiality, namely \u00a34.7m. We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to a limited history of misstatements or significant control deficiencies.\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \u00a30.3m which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.",

We also performed review of regulatory correspondence and reviewed minutes of the Board and Board Risk Committee meetings held. We gained an understanding of the Bank's approach to governance demonstrated by the Board's enterprise risk management framework ('ERMF') and internal control processes. We also reviewed the Bank's complaints process and Whistleblowing.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by assessing the controls that have established to address risks of fraud identified by the Bank, or that otherwise seek to prevent, deter, or detect fraud. We also considered performance and incentive plan targets and their potential to influence Management to manage earnings.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved inquiries of legal counsel, executive management, internal audit, and performed procedures over the risk of management override of internal control. We also focused our audit procedures on areas identified as higher risk as referred to in the Key Audit Matters section of this report.\n- \u00b7 The Bank operates in the financial services industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such, the Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabilities, which included the use of specialists where appropriate.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 Following the recommendation from the audit committee we were appointed by the company on 16 August 2017 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 28 February 2018 and subsequent financial periods.\n- \u00b7 The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 6 years, covering the years ending 28 February 2018 to 28 February 2023.\n- \u00b7 The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company and we remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting the audit.\n- \u00b7 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\nBlake Adlem (Senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor Edinburgh 26 April 2023",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## 1. Basis of Preparation\n\nThe Sainsbury's Bank consolidated financial statements represent the year ended 28 February 2023 and incorporate the financial  statements  of  the  Bank  and  the  entities  it  controls. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards.\n\nThe Group provides a range of retail banking services and related financial services wholly within the UK.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified for the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) held at fair value through profit and loss and fair value through other comprehensive income. The principal accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year.\n\nThe Group has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the  Companies  Act  2006  and  therefore  does  not  present  the Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income of the Bank on a standalone basis.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. This is discussed in the Directors' report, under the heading 'Going Concern'. The Directors have considered the appropriateness of the going concern basis of preparation of the financial statements taking into account the Group's current and projected performance. The Directors are satisfied that the Group has  adequate  resources  to  continue  in  business  for  the foreseeable  future  taking  into  account  a  range  of  possible operational,  economic  and  legal  scenarios.  Consequently,  the going concern basis continues to be appropriate in preparing the financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with the requirements  of  the  Companies  Act  2006  requires  the  use  of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the  Group's  accounting  policies.  The  areas  involving  a  higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and  estimates  are  significant  to  the  financial  statements  are disclosed in note 2.\n\nThe risk management framework as described in the strategic report on page 21 is considered adequate in managing liquidity and  other  key  risks  in  the  current  environment.  The  Group continues to maintain its strong capital and liquidity position and has also been subject to review and challenge by the PRA as part of its remit as lead regulator of the Group. Further information on the key financial risks of the business can be found in note 33.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe Bank and Consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling  which  is  the  Group's  functional  and  presentation currency.  Foreign  currency  transactions  are  translated  into sterling  at  the  exchange  rate  prevailing  at  the  date  of  the transaction.  Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  at balance sheet date exchange rates. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial instruments\n\nThe  Group  classifies  all  of  its  financial  assets  based  on  the business  model  for  managing  the  assets  and  the  assets' contractual terms, measured at either:\n\n- -Amortised cost,\n- -Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or\n- -Fair value through profit and loss (FVPL)\n\nTo  determine  their  classification  and  measurement  category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments and derivatives, to be assessed based on a combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics.\n\nThe business model assessment reflects how the Group manages the risks relating to the underlying financial assets, including whether  the  Group's  principal  objective  is  to  collect  the contractual cashflows arising from the instruments (amortised cost), to sell the financial instruments (FVPL) or a combination thereof (FVOCI).\n\nThe Group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-byinstrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as how performance is reported to the entity's key management personnel, the way that risks are managed,  how  managers  of  the  business  are compensated and the expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Group's assessment.\n\nThe business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group's original expectations, the Group  does  not  change  the  classification  of  the  remaining financial  assets  held  in  that  business  model  but  incorporates such  information  when  assessing  newly  originated  or  newly purchased financial assets going forward.\n\nAs a second step of its classification process, where the business model involves the collection of contractual cashflows, the Group assesses  the  contractual  cashflow  characteristics  of  financial assets  to  identify  whether  they  can  be  considered  solely payments of principal and interest (the SPPI test).\n\nThe Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of J Sainsbury plc and the Group  results  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements of J Sainsbury plc which are publicly available.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Basis of Preparation (continued)\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nFinancial  assets  that  are  principally  held  for  the  collection  of contractual cashflows which pass the SPPI test are classified as amortised cost. Initial recognition is at fair value and subsequent measurement is at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate  method, less provision for impairment as described in the impairment section below.\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets that are held for both the purpose of collecting contractual cashflows and to sell are classified as FVOCI. Initial recognition and subsequent measurement is at fair value, with movements in fair value being recognised through OCI. Interest income is measured using the effective interest rate method and impairment  gains  and  losses  are  recognised  in  the  income statement.\n\n## Fair value through profit and loss\n\nFinancial assets that do not meet amortised cost or FVOCI criteria are classified as FVPL.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Group occasionally elects to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI when they meet the definition of Equity under IAS 32 Financial instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. Such classification is determined  on  an  instrument-byinstrument basis. Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised in profit or loss as other operating income.\n\nWhere  this  election  is  not  applied  equity  instruments  are measured at FVPL.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nOther  than  derivative  financial  liabilities,  all  of  the  Group's financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost. Derivatives are classified as FVPL.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Bank  and  all consolidated subsidiaries.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities, including special purpose entities, over  which  the  Group  has  control.  This  is  when  the  Group  is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The results of subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition or, in the case of disposals, up to the effective date\n\nof disposal. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated upon consolidation.\n\nThe consolidated subsidiaries of the Bank are as follows:\n\n- - Home Retail Group Card Services Ltd\n- - Home Retail Group Insurance Services Ltd\n- - ARG Personal Loans Ltd\n- - Drury Lane Funding 2020-1 plc\n\n## Standards and interpretations effective for the Company in these financial statements:\n\nNo  new  standards  or  interpretations  became  effective  in  the period  or in the prior year  that have a material impact on the Group.\n\n## Standards and interpretations effective for the Company in future periods:\n\nNone of the following standards issued by the IASB but not yet effective, are expected to have a material impact on the Group or Bank's financial statements in future periods:\n\n- - IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nNo other interpretation or amendment effective in a future period has a material impact on the Company or Group\n\n## 2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, most critically in respect of impairment losses on loans and advances, capitalisation of intangible assets and effective yield.\n\nEstimates  and  judgements  are  continually  evaluated  and  are based  on  historical  experience  and  other  factors,  including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\n## Impairment of loans and advances\n\nImpairment loss models involve the estimation of future cash flows of financial assets, based on observable data at the balance sheet date and historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. This will typically take into account the level of arrears, security, past loss experience and default levels. These  calculations  are  undertaken  on  a  portfolio  basis  using various statistical modelling techniques. Impairment models are continually  reviewed  to  ensure  data  and  assumptions  are appropriate with the most material assumption being around expected loss rates.",

Critical  accounting  estimates  and  judgements (continued)\n\nThe  Group  has an Independent Model Oversight function who periodically validate the performance of IFRS 9 models including methodology and predictive accuracy. Monitoring is undertaken at Model Risk Committee (MRC) on a monthly basis with actions put in place to remediate any deficiencies.\n\nDepending on their materiality, model changes are approved at either MRC or Retail Credit Risk Committee (RCRC) for approval by either the Senior Managers or Head of Credit Risk and Chief Risk Officer.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\nThe  Group  determines  whether  there  has  been  a  significant increase in credit risk by reference to quantitative thresholds, qualitative indicators and has also chosen to adopt the rebuttable backstop presumption that credit risk has significantly increased if contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.\n\nQuantitative thresholds have been determined that when the PD of an instrument as at the reporting date has increased to greater than  a  specified  multiple  of  the  origination  PD,  a  significant increase in credit risk is deemed to have occurred. Qualitative tests are based around selective credit origination policy rules. In addition  to  variable  risk  appetite  metrics,  certain  rules  are  in place at account origination for Loans and Credit Cards in order to decline accounts that may demonstrate factors outside of risk appetite that are not yet reflected in PD. At the reporting date, if an account satisfies any of these policy decline rules that it had not  at  the  point  of  origination,  it  will  be  considered  to  have significantly increased in credit risk.\n\nThere is no probationary period applied in respect of accounts that cure from stage 2 to stage 1.  Transfer criteria have been subject to extensive analysis to ensure that they appropriately reflect the flow of accounts from origination to default so as to maximise the number of accounts that flow through the stages and minimise accounts that jump directly from stage 1 to stage 3, or that fail to enter stage 3 from stage 2.\n\nThe Group has applied the low credit risk exemption in respect of its high quality treasury portfolio held for liquidity purposes. This exemption permits low credit risk loans (i.e. those considered investment grade) to remain in stage 1 without an assessment of significant increase in credit risk.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe  Group's definition of default is used in determining those accounts classified as stage 3 (i.e. credit impaired). The Group has\n\nchosen not to rebut the backstop presumption prescribed by IFRS 9 that where an account is 90 days or more past its due date then default has occurred.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  defined  a  number  of  unlikeliness  to  pay criteria that result in an account being deemed to have defaulted. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Where operational collections activities have been exhausted on accounts that are less than 90 days past due and the account is subject to recoveries processes\n- \u00b7 If any forbearance has been granted on the account\n- \u00b7 Where the customer is subject to insolvency proceedings\n- \u00b7 Where the customer is deceased\n\nWhere an account no longer meets any of the default criteria, such as by bringing  payments back up to date, the Group will continue  to  consider  the  account  as  being  in  default  for  the probation period (24 months for Loans and Cards, and 12 months for Storecards) from the date when it last met the definition of default.\n\n## IFRS 9 staging and management of credit risk\n\nThe Group's staging criteria as outlined above is used to monitor credit  risk  performance  at  various  management  forums,  and Board level governance including Audit Committee and Board Risk  Committee.  Key  metrics  such  as  coverage  ratio  and proportion of balances in each stage are monitored for directional movements, albeit there are no explicit risk appetite thresholds in this area. At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic our appetite for credit  risk  was  reduced  to  protect  the  Group  from  losses, including the financial impacts of balances moving from stage 1 to stages 2 and 3, however we have since reversed our tightening strategy.\n\n## Write off\n\nLoans and advances to customers are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to write off. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off result in impairment gains recorded in the income statement.\n\n## Expected lifetime\n\nFor the purposes of considering the lifetime probability of default, the expected lifetime of a financial asset is the contractual term where this is fixed within the contract, or in the case of revolving products such as credit cards a behavioural life is determined by reference to historic trends.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Critical  accounting  estimates  and  judgements (continued)\n\n## Portfolios\n\nThe  Group  calculates  its  ECL  on  a  portfolio  based  approach (collective assessment). The different portfolios the Group has are Loans, Credit Cards, Mortgages AFS Storecards and AFS Monthly Payment Plan (MPP). The products within the different portfolios share key characteristics such as term, interest rate, repayment expectations  and  operational  processes  which  drive  related assumptions within ECL models.\n\n## Modified financial assets\n\nWhen the contractual cash flows of a financial asset have been renegotiated  or  modified  and  the  financial  asset  was  not derecognised, its gross carrying amount is recalculated as the present value of the modified contractual cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate with a gain or loss recognised in the income statement. In practice the renegotiation of lending is linked to an impairment event (forbearance) and any related gains or losses are reflected in the impairment charge recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Overlays and Post model adjustments (PMAs)\n\nOverlays and PMAs are short-term increases or decreases to the ECL at either a customer or portfolio level to account for items that  have  not  been  fully  reflected  in  the  existing  models. Consistent  with  the  most  recent  recommendations  of  the Taskforce on Disclosures about Expected Credit Losses (DECL), the Group has defined overlays as adjustments made outside of the granular  account  level  ECL  calculation  and  PMAs  as  being calculated at granular account level, most often in respect of known data or model limitations.\n\nInternal governance is in place to approve and monitor overlays and PMAs regularly and to reduce the reliance on them through model recalibration or redevelopment, as appropriate.\n\nOverlays and PMAs applied in estimating the reported ECL at 28 February 2023 are set out in the following table. The table includes adjustments in relation to data and model limitations. It shows the  adjustments  applicable  to  the  scenario-weighted  ECL numbers.\n\n2\n\n9\n\n|                   | The Group   | The Group   | The Bank   | The Bank   |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n|                   | 2023  \u00a3m    | 2022  \u00a3m    | 2023  \u00a3m   | 2022  \u00a3m   |\n| Economic overlays | 1           | 5           | 2          |            |\n| Operational PMAs  | (4)         | 10          | (16)       |            |\n| Total             | (3)         | 15          | (14)       | 11         |\n\nThe proportion of net overlays and PMAs for the Group is -1% of the total ECL provision as at 28 February 2023 (2022: 7%).\n\nEconomic overlays are included where management judge the underlying models do not respond adequately to the economic scenarios. In the year, the Group introduced a new economic\n\noverlay of \u00a35m (2022: \u00a3nil) in response to the cost of living crisis and the potential impact of inflation on customers' ability to repay  debts.  As  current  levels  of  inflations  are  the  highest experienced  in  over  40  years,  certain  models  have  not  been calibrated on such extreme values  whilst others don't include inflation  as  an  economic  variable.  Where  appropriate,  the modelled  impact  of  inflation  has  been  removed  and  overlays have been included to ensure the expected impacts of inflation are reflected in the provisions. Additionally, a \u00a33m overlay was recognised in respect of interest rates as the models have been built using data from the recent historic low period for interest rates and do not adequately respond to the current economic forecasts in a higher rate environment. Finally, a \u00a36m reduction in ECL was recognised via overlay in acknowledgement that the Group's economic scenarios of unemployment and GDP , taken at  December 2022 in order to be incorporated into the models, were  overly  pessimistic  comparted  to  consensus  views  of  the economic outlook as at 28 February 2023. As at February 2023 our base scenario  showed  peak unemployment of 5.7% in Q1 2025 whereas the Bank of England forecast predicted 5.2% at that time. Similarly, our GDP view of -1% in early 2023 was more pessimistic than the Bank of England's -0.5%.\n\nIn the year, the Group released the economic overlay relating to Covid-19 uncertainties (2022: \u00a310m overlay recognised) as the residual  risks  associated  with  the  pandemic  are  no  longer considered likely.\n\nThe majority of the operational overlays relate to specific model limitations  that  have  been  manually  corrected  whilst  a permanent fix is being developed.\n\nFor all PMAs there will always be an attempt to use existing IFRS 9 models as a base and amend assumptions and methodology as required to determine the level of impact a specific change would make. This change in ECL is recognised as a PMA until such time as those changes are implemented into production and the PMA can be removed.\n\n## Management use of ECL information\n\nECL forecasts and sensitivities are used in assessing the expected returns  on  different  forms  of  lending  and  forms  part  of  the assessment of whether or not lending should be offered. Default rates for certain subgroups within a portfolio drive forecasts and estimates when investigating the risks of lending changes within that portfolio.\n\nECL information is a key driver of financial performance and key performance drivers are regularly included in internal financial reporting. Where relevant, plausible alternative scenarios and assumptions will be presented as sensitivities to the current position or forecast to enable informed decisions on lending and provisioning to be made.",

The Group has engaged an external supplier to provide economic forecasts which are subject to review, challenge and approval through the Group's governance processes.\n\nFor the year ended 28 February 2023, the Group commissioned economic  scenarios  which considered a range of plausible but alternative economic conditions that could arise in relation to the ongoing impacts of the cost of living crisis and current economic uncertainty.\n\nThe ECL models utilise 4 scenarios (2022: 4 scenarios) including a 'base case' scenario considered to be the most likely outcome together with an upside, downside and severe downside scenario. The base case has been assigned a probability weighting of 40% with  the  upside,  downside  and  severe  downside  scenarios weighted  30%,  25%,  5% respectively (2022: base scenario 45%, upside, downside and severe downside scenarios were 35%, 15% and 5% respectively).\n\nEach  portfolio,  when  modelled  for  IFRS9,  showed  different characteristics  with  predictive  tendencies  and  this  is  the  key driver for using different economic variables across portfolios. Unsecured products place greater weighting on unemployment rates, GDP and inflation, whereas our secured portfolio includes reference to house prices and levels of mortgage debt.\n\nApproval and governance of the Group scenarios is via RCRC & ALCo, with ALCo approving the appropriate scenario weightings to be applied to ensure the most appropriate reflection of our views on future variables, such as unemployment and CPI rates.\n\nBeyond the 5 year forecast period, forecast economic variables are assumed to revert to long term averages, with the exception of  unemployment  which  is  expected  to  experience  a  gradual return to 4%  by 2034. They are applied in ECL models for the remaining  residual  behavioural  life  of  the  related  financial instruments, which can also exceed 5 years.",

Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)\n\n## Capitalisation and carrying value of intangible assets\n\nCapitalisation of intangible assets involves an assessment as to  the  appropriateness  of  costs  that  meet  the  qualifying criteria of IAS 38.\n\nIntangible assets are assessed to ensure they continue to meet the criteria of IAS 38, and for indicators of impairment, at each balance  sheet  date  or  more  frequently  where  required  by changes in circumstances.\n\nWhere impairments are indicated, the carrying values of fixed assets are written down by the amount of the impairment and the charge is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it occurs. A previously recognised impairment charge on an intangible  asset may be reversed in full or in part where a change in circumstances leads to a change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount. The carrying value of the asset will only be increased to the carrying value at which it would have been held had the impairment not been recognised.\n\nDetails  of  any  impairments  recognised  in  the  period  are disclosed in notes 19 & 20.\n\n## Effective interest rate\n\nIn  calculating  the  effective  interest  rate  of  a  financial instrument, the Group takes into account all amounts that are integral  to  the  yield  of  a  financial  instrument  as  well  as incremental  transaction  costs.  In  the  case  of  loans  and advances  to  customers  significant  judgement  is  applied  in estimating  the  effect  of  various  factors,  including  future customer transactional and repayment behaviours, on future cash flows. As at 28 February 2023 the carrying value of the EIR asset was \u00a3108m (2022: \u00a3112m).\n\nEstimates  are  based  on  historical  experience  from  similar product types. Management considers that the most material judgements are the post promotional yield and the repayment rate on the Bank's credit card portfolio.\n\nTo the extent that post promotional yield were to shift by +/100bps, the value of EIR asset would change by +/- \u00a35m. To the extent that the repayment rate were to increase by +/-5% the value of the EIR asset would change by +/- \u00a32.5m.",

This calculation takes into account all amounts that are integral to the yield as well as incremental transaction costs. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the expected future cash flows over the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition.\n\nThe effective interest rate of a financial asset is calculated on initial recognition and is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset. For financial assets that have subsequently  become credit-impaired, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset net of any provision for expected credit losses. If the asset is no longer credit impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\n\nInterest income calculated using the effective interest method presented in the  income  statement includes interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost,  at  fair value through other comprehensive income and the effective portion of hedge accounting instruments. Interest expense presented in the statement of profit or loss includes financial liabilities measured at amortised cost and the effective portion of hedge accounting instruments for derivatives in a hedge accounting relationship.\n\nInterest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVPL are presented in fair value gains on financial instruments (see note 7).\n\nInterest expense on lease liabilities is included within Interest expense on customer accounts, deposits and borrowings.\n\n| The Group                                                            | 2023  \u00a3m   | 2022  \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method: |            |            |\n| Interest income on financial assets measured at amortised cost       | 366        | 319        |\n| Interest income on financial assets measured at FVOCI                | 13         | 2          |\n| Interest income on derivatives                                       | 15         | -          |\n| Other interest income                                                | -          | 1          |\n| Interest receivable                                                  | 394        | 322        |\n| Interest expense on customer accounts, deposits and borrowings       | (62)       | (16)       |\n| Interest expense on subordinated liabilities                         | (12)       | (11)       |\n| Interest expense on derivatives                                      | -          | (16)       |\n| Interest payable                                                     | (74)       | (43)       |\n| Net interest income                                                  | 320        | 279        |",

Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Taxation is determined using tax rates (and laws) enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences  between  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the amounts used for taxation purposes.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current taxation assets against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.\n\n| The Group                                         | 2023  \u00a3m   | 2022  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| UK corporation tax on profit for the year         | 7          | 3          |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years             | (2)        | -          |\n| Current tax                                       | 5          | 3          |\n| Deferred tax charge                               |            |            |\n| Change in tax rate                                | -          | (3)        |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences | 2          | 1          |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years             | 4          | 2          |\n| Deferred tax                                      | 6          | -          |\n| Total tax charge                                  | 11         | 3          |\n\nDifferences between profit before tax multiplied by the UK corporation tax rate for the year of 19% and the income tax expense recognised in the income statement are explained below:\n\n| The Group                                                    | 2023  \u00a3m   | 2022  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Profit/(Loss) before taxation                                | 44         | 21         |\n| Tax on ordinary activities at 19% (2022: 19%)                | 8          | 4          |\n| Effects:                                                     |            |            |\n| Change in Corporation Tax rate                               | -          | (3)        |\n| Non-deductible expenses                                      | 1          | -          |\n| Adjustment in respect of prior years                         | 2          | 2          |\n| Total income tax (credit) recognised in the income statement | 11         | 3          |\n\nIn the current period, the substantively enacted UK Corporation tax rate applicable to the company was 19% (2022: 19%).\n\nDeferred income tax assets have been recognised in respect of all income tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred income tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered.\n\nIt was announced in the UK Government's Budget on 3 March 2021 that the main UK corporation tax rate will increase to 25% from 1 April 2023. This change was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021. Closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have therefore been recalculated taking into account this change of rate and the applicable period when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to crystallise.\n\nIt was announced on 27 October 2021 that the UK banking surcharge will decrease from 8% to 3% from 1 April 2023 and that the surcharge allowance available to banking groups would increase from \u00a325m to \u00a3100m.

Loans and advances to customers\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nLoans and advances are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost, using the effective  interest  method,  less  provision  for  impairment  and  recognised  on  the  balance  sheet  when  cash  is advanced.\n\nThe accounting policies for classification and measurement under IFRS are detailed in note 1.\n\n## ECL impairment model\n\nIFRS 9 uses a 3 stage forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. IFRS 9 requires the Group to record an allowance for ECL for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The allowance is calculated by reference to the estimated probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD).\n\nThe probability of default represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting either within 12 months from the balance sheet date or within the expected lifetime of the instrument.\n\nExposure at default represents the expected amount due from the borrower at the point of default by reference to exposure at the balance sheet date adjusted for expected future changes including repayments and utilisation of undrawn facilities.\n\nLoss given default represents the expected percentage loss at the point of default relative to the EAD. The estimate takes into account utilisation of any expected collections and recoveries strategies, debt sale arrangements and collateral.\n\nThe 3 stage model to determine impairment allowance is summarised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1 - Impairment allowance on financial assets that have not significantly increased in credit risk since origination, nor are credit impaired, is calculated using the probability that a borrower will default within 12 months from the balance sheet date. Interest income is recognised on the gross carrying value of the financial asset.\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 -  Where a financial asset exhibits a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) but is not yet considered to be credit impaired, the probability of default considered in the impairment allowance is based  upon  the  lifetime  probability  of  the  borrower  defaulting.  Interest  income  continues  to  be recognised on the gross carrying value of the financial asset.\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 - Assets considered to be credit impaired. One or more events has occurred that has resulted in a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. Stage 3 assets will continue to recognise lifetime expected impairment losses (with a 100% probability of default) and interest income will be recognised on the net carrying amount (i.e., gross amount less impairment allowance).\n\nIn determining ECL allowances, expected future recoveries are discounted to the reporting date at the original effective interest rate of the relevant instrument.\n\nA number of inputs and variables used in the ECL calculation are not defined within IFRS 9 and involve complex modelling and application of judgement as discussed in the remainder of this section. Further details on these critical accounting judgements can be found in note 2.\n\n## Undrawn commitments\n\nUndrawn loan, credit card and store-card commitments are commitments under which the Group is required to provide a loan with pre-specified terms to the customer. Under IFRS 9 these contracts are in scope of the ECL requirements.\n\nThe Group is required to estimate the extent to which undrawn commitments and facilities will be utilised by borrowers.\n\nThe nominal contractual value of these commitments, where the lending agreed to be provided is on market terms, are not recorded in the Balance Sheet. The ECLs in relation to undrawn commitments are disclosed in note 32. The impairment allowance in respect of these instruments is included within provisions for liabilities and charges as there is no related asset on balance sheet against which to offset the related impairment allowance",

These drawings were further supported by the indirect pledging of personal loans collateral via our securitisation facilities as outlined in the following paragraph.\n\nThe Bank has also securitised and sold personal loans to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) as part of a securitisation. The SPV has issued a \u00a3500m Senior class A note and \u00a3121m Junior class Z note to the bank. As at 28 February 2023, the Bank had pledged \u00a3621m (2022: \u00a3621m) of personal loans to the SPV. Of the A notes held by the Bank \u00a3200m (2022: \u00a3200m) have been pre-positioned with the Bank of England to support the funding facilities outlined in the previous paragraph of which \u00a380m (2022: \u00a380m) was encumbered.\n\nAs at the 28 February 2023, the Bank had also pledged \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a328m) of the A note as collateral in a repurchase agreement and \u00a3111m (2022: \u00a328m) in a collateral swap.

Derivative financial instruments\n\n## Accounting\n\n## policy\n\nAll derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the contract date and are re-measured to their fair value at each subsequent reporting date. Changes in fair value of all derivative instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement. Fair values are obtained from observable market data before the application of appropriate discounting factors.\n\nWhere the overall carrying value of a derivative is positive it is held and classified on the balance sheet as an asset. Alternatively, when the overall carrying value of a derivative is negative it is held and classified as a liability.\n\nThe Group intends to use derivatives for economic purposes only, and not for trading. Where possible it will elect to  designate  the  derivative  into  an  effective  hedge  accounting  relationship,  where  the  gains  and  losses  on derivatives are offset by effective hedged item adjustments within the income statement.\n\n## Fair value hedging\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges where the derivative financial instrument hedges the change in fair value of the particular risks inherent in recognised assets or liabilities (fair value hedges).\n\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements for fair value hedges of investment securities and its Fixed Rate Debt issuance. These instruments are hedged via plain vanilla interest rate swaps, with the critical",

The notional amount, fixed interest legs and maturity dates are economically matched. The main source of ineffectiveness within the micro hedge relationships relates to the floating leg valuation changes inherent within the hedging instrument that do not exist within the hedged item.\n\nThe Group continues to adopt IAS 39 for its macro portfolio fair value hedges of fixed rate personal loans and residential mortgages, as it is permitted to do so under IFRS 9 and until the point that the new Dynamic Risk Management hedge accounting standard is finalised and adopted.\n\nPortfolio fair value hedging allows the designation of the whole or part of a portfolio of assets or liabilities with similar risk exposures. The hedged item can be designated based on expected maturities to match the hedging derivative maturity. Hedge effectiveness is considered to have been met where the change in fair value of the hedged item offsets the change in fair value of hedging instruments, within the 80% to 125% ratio corridor. Ineffectiveness on portfolio hedges can arise as a result of several factors, including floating leg valuation changes inherent within the hedging instrument that do not exist within the hedged item, mismatch in cash flow maturities between the hedged item and hedging instrument and basis risk between cash flows discounted using different benchmark rates.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting the Group documents at the inception of the hedge, the hedging risk management strategy, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction and the nature of the risks being hedged. The Group also documents the assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging relationship, to show that the hedge is expected to be (prospectively) and, subsequently, has been (retrospectively) effective.\n\n## Derivatives not in a hedge accounting relationship\n\nThe Group's entire derivative portfolio is executed for economic purposes. Under IAS 39 rules, for macro portfolio hedging, some of the Group's hedging derivatives do not qualify, or prove too onerous, to be designated into an effective hedged relationship. In those instances, the interest rate swaps are viewed as trading derivatives under IFRS 9 with any movements in fair value recognised in the income statement, without offset. In October 2022, the Bank entered a \u00a3200m short term (<12 month) interest rate swap (2022: \u00a3nil) in order to manage the additional volatility experienced in the interest rate environment in late 2022.This swap was not designated into a hedge accounting relationship and therefore movements in fair value are recognised in the income statement without offset.\n\n## Foreign currency derivative contracts\n\nForeign currency exposure arises from currency holdings within the Group's travel money business.\n\nThe  Group  entered  into  foreign  exchange  derivative  contracts  to  hedge  foreign  currency  exposure.  Foreign exchange derivative instruments included FX spot, FX forwards and FX swaps. As at 28 February 2023, the Group reported a FX derivative asset of \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a31m) and a FX derivative liability of \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a31m).\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe amounts relating to items designated as hedging instruments and hedge ineffectiveness were as follows.\n\n-\n\n2\n\n|                                                   | The Group   | The Group       | The Group       | The Group                  |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                   |             | Carrying Amount | Carrying Amount |                            |\n|                                                   | Notional    |                 |                 | Ineffectiveness recognised |\n|                                                   | amount      | Assets          | Liabilities     | in income statement        |\n|                                                   | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m              | \u00a3m              | \u00a3m                         |\n| Interest rate swaps - Hedge of loans and advances |             |                 |                 |                            |\n| At 28 February 2023                               | 2,824       | 98              | (53)            |                            |\n| At 28 February 2022                               | 3,226       | 34              | (18)            |                            |\n\nFurther detail on the fair value of hedged item can be found in Notes 13 and 25.",

IFRS 9 requires the Group to record an allowance for ECL for all  loans  and  other  debt  financial  assets  not  held  at  FVPL,  together  with  loan  commitments  and  financial guarantee contracts. The allowance is calculated by reference to the estimated probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD)\n\n1\n\n-\n\n1\n\n|                                               | The Group and Bank 2023  \u00a3m   | 2022  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|\n| Investment securities comprise the following: |                               |            |\n| Equity investments                            | 2                             |            |\n| Gilts                                         | 0                             | 98         |\n| Government backed investment securities       | 71                            | 67         |\n| T-Bills                                       | 25                            |            |\n| Covered bonds                                 | 418                           | 169        |\n| Supranational investment securities           | 13                            | 55         |\n| Asset backed securities                       | 162                           | 28         |\n| Commercial paper                              | 50                            | 25         |\n|                                               | 741                           | 443        |\n| Of which:                                     |                               |            |\n| Equity investments                            | 2                             |            |\n| Maturing in three months or less              | 115                           | 25         |\n| Maturing between three months and one year    | 128                           | 196        |\n| Maturing between 1 and 5 years                | 496                           | 199        |\n| Maturing in more than 5 years                 | -                             | 22         |\n|                                               | 741                           | 443        |\n\nInvestment securities include \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a350m) pledged as collateral under sale and repurchase agreements or derivative contracts.

Intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nComputer Software\n\nComputer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. Externally acquired software and licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives. Costs relating to development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once the recognition criteria of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets' are met. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives being:\n\n- \u00b7 Core banking software - fifteen years\n- \u00b7 Other software - three to ten years",

Such assets are assessed for impairment where there is an indication of impairment or, in the case of assets which are not yet available for use, at least annually. Where impairment exists, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised in the income statement. The amortisation charge for the asset is then adjusted to reflect the asset's revised carrying amount.\n\nCost includes the purchase price after deducting discounts and rebates, and other directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for its intended use.\n\nSubsequent expenditure is only capitalised when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.\n\n-\n\n7\n\n|                                  | The Group   | The Group   | The Bank   | The Bank   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| The Group                        | 2023  \u00a3m    | 2022  \u00a3m    | 2023 \u00a3m    | 2022  \u00a3m   |\n| Cost                             |             |             |            |            |\n| At 1 March                       | 361         | 317         | 330        | 310        |\n| Additions                        | 19          | 51          | 11         | 27         |\n| Disposals                        | (2)         | (7)         | (2)        | (7)        |\n| As at 28 February                | 378         | 361         | 339        | 330        |\n| Accumulated amortisation         |             |             |            |            |\n| At 1 March                       | (170)       | (156)       | (168)      | (155)      |\n| Charge for the year              | (31)        | (21)        | (26)       | (20)       |\n| Impairment                       | -           | -           | -          |            |\n| Disposals                        | 2           | 7           | 2          |            |\n| As at 28 February                | (199)       | (170)       | (192)      | (168)      |\n| Net book value as at 28 February | 179         | 191         | 147        | 162        |\n\n## 20.

Provisions for liabilities and charges\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group recognises a provision if there is a present obligation as a consequence of either a legal or a constructive obligation resulting from a past event. To recognise this it should be probable that an outflow of economic resources, that can be reliably measured, will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured as the discounted expected future cash flows taking account of the risks and uncertainties associated with the specific liability where appropriate.\n\n|                                      | The Group  2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   | The Bank 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------|--------------------|------------|\n| Provision on loan commitments issued | 20                   | 18        | 8                  | 8          |\n| Other provisions                     |                      |           |                    |            |\n| PPI customer remediation             | 6                    | 9         | -                  |            |\n| Other                                | 5                    | 1         | 4                  |            |\n| Other provisions total               | 11                   | 10        | 4                  |            |\n|                                      | 31                   | 28        | 12                 | 9          |\n\n-\n\n1\n\n1\n\nProvision on loan commitments issued is included in the movement analysis in note 13.

Provisions for liabilities and charges (continued)\n\nThe PPI customer remediation provision relates to the costs associated with potential redress from customers in respect of past sales of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) policies. This liability sits with the Bank's subsidiary Home Retail Group Insurance Services Limited.\n\nThe FCA deadline for customers PPI claims through the complaints procedure passed on 29 th August 2019. However, customers can continue to bring claims against firms through a legal route, claiming an Unfair Relationship under the Consumer Credit Act. The closing PPI provision of \u00a36m (2022: \u00a38m) represents the cost of future litigation claims and the associated costs, including solicitors' fees and the operational costs of processing claims. The provision represents management's best estimate of future costs and will remain under review. The eventual cost is dependent upon claim volumes, claim values and claim handling costs. These assumptions are inherently uncertain, and the ultimate financial impact may be different than the amount provided. The Group will continue to monitor the position and update its assumptions as more information becomes available.\n\nOther provisions relate to liabilities arising from our historic New Bank Programme transition, dilapidations and onerous cost provisions associated with the Bank's head office property. \u00a33m was charged to the income statement during the year ended 28 February 2023 in respect of the New Bank Programme transition (2022: \u00a31m charged to income statement upon the decision of the Bank to exit and make part of the head office available for sub-let).\n\nWhere charges on  provisions are material and relate to a historic time period they are recognised outside of underlying profit in order to provide a clear and consistent view of the Group's underlying performance.\n\n## 28.

The above table does not include undrawn limits on credit cards or AFS Storecards. These are not considered a contractual commitment but because in practice the Group does not expect to withdraw these credit limits from customers, they are within the scope of impairment provisioning as found in Note 13.\n\nThe loss allowance on loan commitments are recognised as part of provisions for liabilities (see note 27).\n\n## 33. Risk management\n\nThe Group encounters a range of different risks and uncertainties as it undertakes its day-to-day activities and seeks to achieve its strategic objectives. Our approach to risk management and an overview of the primary risk types are described in the Risk Overview section on page 21. Further detail on credit and liquidity risk exposures are shown below, with capital adequacy discussed further in note 34.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is central to the Group's day to day activities and is managed in line with the Board approved risk appetite as detailed within the Principal Risks section (page 25).\n\n## Retail credit risk\n\nRetail Credit Risk is the possibility of losses arising from a retail customer failing to meet their agreed repayment terms as they fall due. Retail Credit utilise automated scorecards to assess the credit worthiness and affordability criteria of new applicants and ongoing behavioural characteristics of existing customers. The outcome from all scorecard models is monitored utilising a set of credit quality metrics to ensure actual performance is in line with agreed expectations. Additional expert underwriting of credit applications is undertaken by a specialist operational team where further consideration is appropriate.\n\nThe Retail Credit Risk Committee provide portfolio oversight control over credit risk strategy to maintain lending in line with the Board approved risk appetite, with additional oversight and control provided by the Executive Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee. Internal Audit provide additional assurance by undertaking regular reviews on the adequacy of credit risk policies and procedures.\n\n## Wholesale and derivative credit risk\n\nThe Group's treasury assets portfolio is held primarily for liquidity management purposes and in the case of derivatives, for the purpose of managing market risk. The treasury assets portfolio is invested in eligible investment securities that qualify for the regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and internal Operational Liquidity Pool (OLP). These investments include the Bank of England's (BoE) reserve account, UK government securities (gilts or Treasury bills), multilateral development bank securities, government guaranteed agency securities, covered bonds and asset backed securities.",

Risk management (continued)\n\nLimits are established for all counterparty and asset class exposures based on their respective credit quality and market liquidity. Consideration is also given to geographical region and the strength of relevant sovereign credit ratings.\n\nDerivatives are subject to the same credit risk control procedures as are applied to other wholesale market instruments and the credit risk arising from mark-to-market derivative valuations is mitigated by daily margin calls, posting cash collateral to cover exposures. Daily monitoring is undertaken by the Group's Treasury and Financial Risk teams, including early warning indicators with appropriate triggers for escalation . Oversight of the Group's Wholesale credit risk positions included as part of ALCo.\n\nAt 28 February 2023, the maximum credit exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is equal to the sum of loans and advances to customers, loans and advances to banks, investment securities and credit lines and other commitments to lend. These are set out in notes 13, 16, 18 and 33 respectively.

Concentrations  indicate  the  relative  sensitivity  of  the  Group's performance to developments affecting a particular industry, counterparty or geographical location.\n\nThe Group is a retail-focused financial institution operating solely in the UK. In line with its risk principles, the Group seeks to actively identify and manage risk concentrations across its business areas and activities. It has set clear targets for diversification within its asset and liability portfolios and sources of income. These are supported by a range of portfolio limits and a focus on key processes and controls across its activities, systems and supply chain.",

Retail credit risks are managed in accordance with limits set out within Board Risk appetite which is documented in detailed policies and policy standards. There were no significant changes noted in appetite over the period albeit credit risk strategies were reviewed. Most notably, affordability calculations were updated and reinforced to reflect the rising cost of living. Reviews of credit risk appetite levels are subject to annual review and more frequently if required. Credit strategy is updated within appetite, to reflect emerging trends and/or changes to appetite.\n\nWe have considered whether any new or emerging risks (as detailed in the Strategic report on page 22) result in an impact on our ECL provisions. The immediate impacts on inflation are considered as part of our provisions adequacy and have resulted in us holding an economic uncertainty overlay as outlined in note 2. To date climate risk has not resulted in any significant impact on our observed expected credit losses. We continue to evolve our thinking in relation to this issue as described in the climate strategy on page 8.",

The market value of collateral held for impaired loans and loans past due but not impaired was \u00a317m (2022: \u00a323m).\n\nIf a customer falls into arrears, the customer will be held in 'collections' where the Group will work with the customer to try to regularise the  position  over  a  period  of  time.  Where  the  arrears  status  of  a  customer  deteriorates  and  there  is  a  failure  to  respond  to correspondence or agree an acceptable repayment proposal, including notice of default, the customer balance will fall into 'recoveries'. A specialist debt recovery team will take steps to recover the debt, using their expertise to determine the optimal recovery strategy.\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe Group holds collateral against loans and advances to customers in the form of mortgages over residential property and second charges over business assets, including commercial and residential property.\n\n## Credit quality\n\nThe  Group  defines  the  following  classifications  for  all  credit  exposures:  High,  Satisfactory,  Low  and  Credit  impaired.  These  are segmented by 12 month probability of default (PD) under IFRS 9. Unsecured lending represents credit cards, personal loans, AFS storecards and AFS MPP lending at 28 February 2023. Secured lending represents mortgage lending.",

Forbearance is relief granted by a lender to assist customers in financial difficulty, through arrangements which temporarily allow the customer to pay an amount other than the contractual amounts due. These temporary arrangements may be initiated by the customer or the Group where financial difficulty would prevent repayment within the original terms and conditions of the contract. The main aim of forbearance is to support customers in returning to a position where they are able to meet their contractual obligations.\n\nThe Group has well defined forbearance policies and processes. A number of forbearance options are made available to customers. These include arrangements to repay arrears over a period of time, by making payments above the contractual amount, that ensure the loan is repaid within the original repayment term and short-term concessions, where the borrower is allowed to make reduced repayments (or in exceptional circumstances, no repayments) on a temporary basis to assist with short-term financial hardship.\n\nThe table below details the values of secured and unsecured advances that are subject to forbearance programmes.",

To date we have not seen and do not actively monitor any changes to the probability of default or loss given default that arise as a result of physical or transitional climate risk. Due to our predominantly unsecured portfolios, we do not anticipate material exposure to credit risks as a result of climate change over the next 5 years, however we continually monitor this assumption.\n\nGovernmental  and  societal  responses  to  climate  change  risks  are  still  developing,  and  are  interdependent  upon  each  other, consequently financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known.\n\n## Debt securities, balances with central banks and other eligible investment securities\n\nThe total gross amount of individually impaired debt securities, cash and balances with central banks, UK government securities (Gilts and Treasury bills) and other eligible investment securities as at 28 February 2023 was \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a3nil).

The Group's exposures are held with a central clearing counterparty, the London Clearing House (LCH), the terms of which also required an initial margin to be provided. At 28 February 2023, the Group had posted cash collateral of \u00a349m (2022: \u00a320m) and received cash collateral of \u00a352m (2022: \u00a320m) against its derivative positions, and \u00a321m of initial margin collateralised by encumbered Gilts (2022: \u00a322m of initial margin collateralised by encumbered Gilts). Following the Bank's award of a credit rating in the year, the Group is no longer required to pledge cash collateral with Mastercard for the risk of issuing merchant spend credit and therefore the value pledged is USD nil (2022: USD 58.5m).\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its payment obligations as they fall due or can only do so at excessive cost. The Group seeks to ensure that financial obligations can be met at all times, even under liquidity stress conditions.\n\nThe annual ILAAP enables the Group to:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess its most relevant liquidity risk drivers\n- \u00b7 Quantify its liquidity needs under various stress scenarios and\n- \u00b7 Put in place appropriate limits and controls to mitigate liquidity risks.\n\nIn meeting its internal limits as well as PRA requirements, the Group maintains a stock of high-quality liquid assets that can be readily monetised by outright sale or repurchase agreement to meet the Group's obligations to depositors and other creditors.\n\nThe Group's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) are regularly monitored and forecast alongside net cash flows and key funding ratios. Treasury prepare long term and short term forecasts to assess liquidity requirements, taking into account factors such as ATM cash management, contractual maturities and customer deposit patterns (stable or less stable deposits) as well as outflows regarding undrawn commitments. These reports support daily liquidity risk management, with early warning indicators reviewed on a daily basis and appropriate triggers for escalation and action in line with risk appetite, Liquidity and Funding Risk Policy and Liquidity Contingency Plan. Asset encumbrance ratios and key risk indicators for wholesale funding are also regularly monitored and reported to ALCO.\n\nThe table below shows the undiscounted cash flows on the Group's financial assets, liabilities and unrecognised loan commitments on the basis of their earliest possible contractual maturity. The expected (behavioural) cash flows on these instruments vary significantly from this analysis and as such are regularly modelled to ensure operational net cash flows are managed. The disclosure for derivatives shows a gross inflow and outflow amount. As derivatives have a simultaneous net settlement it is not considered representative to show only the outflow amount.\n\nRepayments which are subject to notice are treated as if notice were to be given immediately. However, the Group expects that many customers will not request repayment on the earliest date the Group could be required to pay and the table does not reflect the expected cash flows indicated by the Group's deposit retention history.",

The encumbrance levels of assets and related recognised or off balance sheet liabilities are shown in the following tables.\n\n|                                                                    | The Group      | The Group        | The Group   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|\n| At 28 February 2023                                                | Encumbered  \u00a3m | Unencumbered  \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m   |\n| Loans and advances to customers                                    | 1,116          | 4,177            | 5,293       |\n| Debt securities                                                    | -              | 741              | 741         |\n| Other assets                                                       | 64             | 465              | 529         |\n| Cash, balances with central banks and loans and advances  to Banks | 15             | 631              | 646         |\n|                                                                    | 1,195          | 6,014            | 7,209       |",

Cash collateral is advanced and received as variation margin on derivatives transactions, whilst eligible treasury assets are pledged as collateral for initial margin requirements on derivatives which are centrally cleared. Eligible personal and mortgage loans with applicable haircuts are used as collateral for the securitisation facility and the Bank of England's Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME) and Indexed Long-term Repo (ILTR). The personal loans and mortgages used to secure the funding are held within Loans and advances to customers. There are assets which would not normally be considered available for encumbrance in the normal course of the Group's business including intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, prepayments and accruals and deferred tax assets. These are included within the carrying value of unencumbered assets.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss as a result of the value of the Group's assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet instruments being adversely affected by movements in market prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates which leads to a reduction in either earnings or economic value. The key market risks are Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) and Foreign Exchange risk. The Bank does not have a trading book.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\n\nIRRBB is the current or prospective risk to both earnings and economic value from movements in interest rates. The main sub-types of IRBBB include\n\n- -Re-pricing risk (or gap risk): the risk arising from timing differences in the interest rate changes of bank assets and liabilities (e.g. fixed rate personal loans and instant access savings accounts).\n- -Yield curve risk: the risk arising from changes in the slope and shape of the yield curve.\n- -Basis risk: risk arising from imperfect correlation between different interest rate indices (e.g. administered rate on savings products and treasury assets linked to SONIA).\n- -Prepayment risk: the risk arising from the timing of customer prepayments which differ from planning and hedging assumptions.\n- -Credit Spread Risk: the risk of adverse effects resulting from a change in credit spreads, arising via the Group's treasury assets portfolio.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to FX risk through its holding of cash denominated in foreign currencies, primarily Euro and US Dollar, within its travel money bureaux in J Sainsbury plc stores and its currency dispensing ATM machines. Foreign exchange risk is currently mitigated through forward rate transactions. Further details of the hedging arrangements in place at year end are disclosed in note 17.\n\n## Risk Appetite Measures\n\nThe Bank's market risk appetite statements defines limits for the following market risk measures:\n\n- -Capital at Risk: an aggregate measure based on assessing each of the IRRBB risks and allocating a capital charge against each risk driver using a series of plausible but severe interest rate stresses. This includes parallel and nonparallel movements of the yield curve. Where applicable a customer behavioural repayment profile is applied.",

Risk Management ( continued )\n\n- -Annual Earnings at Risk : measures the sensitivity of the Bank's earnings over the next 12 months, in response to adverse movements in interest rates.\n- -Net Open Currency Position: measures the Bank's net open currency position aggregated across all currencies.\n\n## Controls and Mitigants\n\nThe Market Risk Policy defines the approach the Bank must apply to measure, monitor and control market risk which includes the Board approved market risk appetite statement and specific limits. The Treasury function undertakes the day to day management of market risk, using systems and models to assess risk exposure against limits. Oversight is provided by 2nd line.\n\nThe main hedging instruments used to hedge IRRBB exposures are interest swaps as well as taking into account natural hedges between assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics in the first instance. Any residual exposures are then assessed against Board approved limits.\n\nHedging strategies are implemented and reviewed on a regular basis at ALCo to ensure the Bank remains within limits.\n\nAs at 28 February 2023 earnings at risk (change in net interest income) for changes in interest rates of +/-100 basis points movements in rates are as follows:\n\n|                      | The Group   | The Group   | The Bank   | The Bank   |\n|----------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n|                      | 2023        | 2022        | 2023       | 2022       |\n|                      | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m         |\n| +/- 100 basis points | (1)/4       | (5)/(9)     | 7/(7)      | 1/(15)     |\n\nThe above analysis assumes that interest rates would floor at 0% and would not result in negative rates becoming applicable.\n\n## 34. Capital resources (unaudited)\n\nFrom a prudential perspective, the Bank is monitored and supervised on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary, Home Retail Group Card Services Limited. The Bank has obtained an individual consolidation waiver from the PRA, which allows the Bank to monitor its capital position on a consolidated basis only. Therefore, the capital position shown below is on a regulatory consolidated basis.

The denominator represents the total non-risk weighted assets of the regulatory group adjusted for certain off balance sheet exposures assets and regulatory deductions and provides a non-risk-weighted 'backstop' capital measure. The leverage ratio is calculated below as at 28 February 2023 on the UK basis which allows central bank assets to be excluded from the leverage exposures. The Bank's leverage ratio of 9.6% (2022: 9.7%) exceeds the minimum Basel leverage ratio of 3%.",

Capital adequacy is monitored on an on-going basis by senior management, the ALCo, the Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee. Our submissions to the PRA in the year have shown that the Group has complied with all externally imposed capital requirements.\n\nThe Group will disclose Pillar 3 information as required by the Capital Requirements Regulations and PRA prudential sourcebook on the J Sainsbury plc external website.\n\n## 35. Fair value of financial instruments\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nIFRS 13 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources; unobservable inputs reflect the Group's market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:\n\n## Level 1\n\nQuoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This level includes listed equity securities and debt instruments on exchanges (for example, London Stock Exchange, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange) and exchange traded derivatives like futures.\n\n## Level 2\n\nInputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). The sources of input parameters like SONIA  yield curve or counterparty credit risk are Bloomberg and Reuters.\n\n## Level 3\n\nInputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). This level includes equity investments and debt instruments with significant unobservable components.\n\nThis hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The Group considers relevant and observable market prices in its valuations where possible.",

The fair values of financial instruments are based on market prices where available, or are estimated using other valuation techniques. Where they are short term in nature or re-price frequently, fair value approximates to carrying value.

Savings Related Share Option Scheme ('SAYE')\n\nThe Sainsbury's Group operates a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months' continuous service. This is an approved HMRC Scheme and was established in 1980. Under the SAYE scheme, participants remaining in the Sainsbury's Group's employment at the end of the three-year (and historically also five-year) savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in J Sainsbury plc at a pre-stated exercise price. Employees leaving for certain reasons can use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.\n\n|                            | 2023   Number of  options  million   | 2023   Weighted  average  exercise price  pence   | 2022   Number of  options  million   | 2022   Weighted  average  exercise price  pence   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Outstanding at end of year | 1.5                                  | 176.2                                             | 1.3                                  | 193.4                                             |\n| Exercisable at end of year | 0.2                                  | 164.9                                             | 0.1                                  | 245.2                                             |\n| Exercisable price range    |                                      | 161 to 260                                        |                                      | 161 to 260                                        |\n\nThe weighted average share price of J Sainsbury plc during the period for options exercised over the year was 259 pence (2022: 260 pence). The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options outstanding at 28 February 2023 was 2.8 years (2022: 2.7 years). Options granted during the year were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\n\n## b. Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nUnder the Long-Term Incentive Plan, shares in J Sainsbury plc are conditionally awarded to the senior managers in the Company. The core awards are calculated as a percentage of the participants' salaries and scaled according to grades.\n\nPerformance is measured at the end of the three-year performance period. If the required performance conditions, which are financial and non-financial non-market conditions, have been met, the awards vest and the participants are able to exercise 100% of the awards received. For 2020 awards and prior, recipients were only able to receive 50% of their awards after 3 years and 50% of their awards after 4 years. Options granted will expire five years from the grant date.\n\nThe core award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance. Straight-line vesting will apply if performance falls between two points. Awards are structured as nil cost options.",
