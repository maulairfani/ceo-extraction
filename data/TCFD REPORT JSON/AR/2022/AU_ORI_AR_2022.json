This includes the Operating and Financial Review (OFR) which is presented on pages 04 to 87. Specific commentary on Orica's financial performance is contained on pages 48 to 57.\n\nThis report covers Orica operations worldwide over which we had control for the financial year ending 30 September 2022, unless otherwise stated (collectively 'the Orica Group', or 'the Group'). All monetary amounts are subject to rounding and are reported in Australian dollars, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## INTEGRATED REPORTING\n\nThis report is designed to be read in its entirety and discloses both financial and non-financial performance. Building on FY2021 progress, it has been prepared in accordance with the Content Elements of the 2021 International Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework. An index is provided on page 205. We have used the framework to demonstrate how our purpose and values, and consideration of risks and opportunities, drive our strategy. We have also articulated how we create and measure value beyond financial performance. An overview of our value creation process is provided on page 20.\n\nThe Orica Board has provided strategic oversight and governance throughout the report drafting and review process. The FY2022 Annual Report was approved at the November 2022 Board meeting.\n\n## VERIFICATION AND ASSURANCE\n\nThe Remuneration Report (pages 99 to 123) and Financial Statements (pages 125 to 190) have been audited by KPMG. KPMG was also engaged to provide limited assurance as to whether the Content Elements of the 2021 International <IR> Framework have been addressed in this report. This assurance considers whether the Content Elements have been included but does not extend to assessing the accuracy or validity of any statement made throughout this report.\n\nErnst & Young (EY) have provided limited assurance over a selection of material non-financial metrics including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, gender diversity and potable water. The Limited Assurance Statement will be published on our website together with Orica's Reporting Suite by the end of November 2022. We are progressively extending external assurance over key metrics linked to our non-financial performance and public improvement targets.\n\nMaterial statements and other relevant information contained in this report have been subject to an internal review and approval process defined by our Corporate Reporting Verification Framework.\n\n## Reporting suite\n\nWe produce a suite of reports to meet the needs of a wide range of stakeholders.\n\n## FY2022 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT\n\nIn accordance with the ASX Council's Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4th Edition).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FY2022 MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT\n\nIn accordance with the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) and the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY2022 CLIMATE ACTION REPORTClimate-related information aligned to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FY2022 TAX TRANSPARENCY REPORT\n\nOverview of our approach to tax, governance structure, and tax position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe following documents are available at orica.com/Investors\n\n- - Full Year Results Investor Presentation\n- - Full Year Results ASX Announcement\n- - Appendix 4E\n\nDISCLAIMER: This report contains information that is based on projected and/or estimated expectations, assumptions or outcomes.

        "page_content": "## LETTER FROM OUR CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR\n\nThe strength and resilience of our team, and a commitment to our refreshed strategy have resulted in improved financial performance and growth across our business. We faced risks and challenges, many outside of our control, however, our team has remained focused on our competitive advantages and opportunities to capitalise on current market conditions. While we have made progress this year, we are deeply committed to continually improving performance across all areas of our business.\n\nBeyond blasting, we are accelerating customer adoption of our new technologies and demonstrating our unique strengths and capabilities in providing digital workflows and solutions, from mine-to-mill. ' '\n\n|\n\n## SAFETY AND WELL/hyphen.caseBEING\n\nSafety is our most important priority, always. Tragically, we are reporting two fatalities, one relating to an incident at a customer site in far-east Russia this year, and an event in 2021 at a site in Kazakhstan.\n\nAny workplace fatality has a devastating and profound impact on us. Our thoughts and sympathies are with the affected families, friends, and colleagues. We continue to support those affected and ensure we learn from the events and reinforce the critical safety measures in place to keep our people, customers, and communities safe.\n\nPositively, this year we achieved a reduction in our Serious Injury Case Rate (SICR) compared to FY2021. A critical review of our key controls of the Major Hazard Management (MHM) program is underway and will remain our priority for the year ahead to improve our safety performance.\n\n## OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nThis year has presented both challenges and opportunities for our business, including geopolitical tensions, trade sanctions, strong global commodity prices, and security of supply risks.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict caused significant pressure on global supply chains and input costs. The strength and flexibility of our global manufacturing and supply network remain a key competitive advantage for us and allowed Orica to respond quickly to a changing environment and focus on delivering the needs of our customers.\n\nElevated commodity prices have grown demand for copper, nickel, and other future-facing commodities, and the disruption of energy markets has increased demand for coal. With these being key commodity markets for Orica, this has driven demand for Orica's products and services around the world.\n\nThe escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and imposed sanctions and export restrictions, led to a responsible and structured exit from our Russian operations in FY2022. Our focus during this transition, was on the well-being of our employees, engaging regulators to ensure sanctions compliance, managing supply interruptions, and ensuring the safe and secure supply of our products across our global network.\n\nEnvironmental Social and Governance (ESG) performance and climate change continue to gain momentum across our industry including changes to policy and growing societal expectations. Orica is committed to increasing our accountability and continuing to take tangible action to achieve our ambition of net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nInflation has emerged as a key driver of volatility and uncertainty for the global economy. While Orica is experiencing rising costs including salaries and raw material inputs, our increased commercial discipline and collaborative culture, and continued focus on sustainable cost reduction are providing a level of mitigation.\n\n## OUR PERFORMANCE\n\nIn November 2021, we refreshed our strategy centred on optimising our operations, delivering smarter solutions, and partnering for progress across our four business verticals of mining, quarry and construction, digital solutions, and mining chemicals.",

We identified and capitalised on further opportunities for growth in quarry and construction, and by expanding Orica's presence across future-facing commodities.\n\nBeyond blasting, we are accelerating customer adoption of our new technologies and demonstrating our unique strengths and capabilities in providing digital workflows and solutions from mine-to-mill. Mining Chemicals also continues to present growth opportunities for our business.\n\nImportantly, we are continuing to progress with our strategic priorities for climate change and understand the opportunities ahead of us to harness our technologies and support a lower-carbon future.\n\n## Business performance\n\nOur financial results in FY2022 are strong. Underlying earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) were $579 million, an increase of 36 per cent on the previous year. Statutory net profit after tax (NPAT) in FY2022 was $60 million\n\nincluding a $257 million significant items expense after tax.\n\nThis positive performance reflects the exceptional efforts of our team to deliver in line with our refreshed strategy. Our commercial discipline, combined with the strength of our global network has positioned us well to capitalise on the current market conditions and opportunities presented by a growing commodities market.\n\nIn a difficult operating environment, we strengthened our position as an independent and consistent source of supply with the ability to meet the rising demands of customers across the globe.\n\nIt was pleasing to see improved performance across all regions, with volume growth in Indonesia, and Latin America, and a greater demand for premium products across the globe, in particular Australia, Latin America, North America, Africa, and the Nordics.\n\nIn August 2022, we announced the acquisition of Axis Mining Technology to position Orica as a leading orebody intelligence provider and broaden our customer offering, from mine-to-mill. We also took\n\nthe opportunity to strengthen our balance sheet with an equity raise, which included funds towards incremental trade working capital requirements to manage volatility and capitalise on opportunities in our operating environment.\n\nWe continued our disciplined approach to the balance sheet and capital management, and we are focused on improving our operating cash generation.\n\nWe accelerated our customer adoption of premium products, blasting technologies and digital solutions, increasing our digital solutions adoption rate across the globe by 63 per cent on the previous year, well above target. In addition, our technology portfolio increased, with 17 new products and services introduced to the market, including our second generation WebGen \u2122 200, 4D \u2122 bulk explosives technology, and Avatel \u2122 in partnership with Epiroc.\n\nThis year we achieved a return on net assets (RONA) of 11.4 per cent which is within our target range of 10-12 per cent. The increase from the prior year was driven by our improved earnings performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## LETTER FROM OUR CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR\n\nThe final ordinary dividend of 22.0 cents per share unfranked, brings the total dividend to 35.0 cents per share, reflecting a payout ratio of 48 per cent of underlying earnings, which is in line with our target range of paying out 40 to 70 per cent of underlying earnings.\n\n## People and culture\n\nTo support our future growth, our people strategy focused on building our talent and capabilities.\n\nIn FY2022, we implemented our global culture and engagement survey Our Say to understand how we are tracking, and opportunities to enhance the employee experience. With a participation rate of 65 per cent, we achieved an overall engagement score of 88 per cent, outperforming global industry benchmarks.\n\nWhile this is a good result, there is always work to do. The results of the Our Say survey identified opportunities for greater support in learning and development, increased recognition of performance, and flexibility and clarity of roles.\n\nIn response, we implemented a series of programs and actions designed to enhance the way we work and support new learning and development initiatives for our people. We also commenced the design of a new global reward and recognition program to strengthen our highperformance culture at Orica.\n\n## Sustainability performance\n\nSustainability is at the heart of our purpose - to sustainably mobilise the earth's resources.\n\nBy accelerating our approach to decarbonisation through low-emissions technology and creating innovative and sustainable solutions, we are playing our role to advance a safer and more sustainable industry and society.\n\n|\n\nTo reach our target and reduce operational emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030 and achieve our ambition of net zero emissions by 2050, we are prioritising the decarbonisation of manufacturing processes, sourcing renewable energy and deepening engagement with suppliers across our value chain.\n\nOur net Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 1,883 ktCO2-e, a one per cent decrease on the previous year. We remain on track to meet our targets with net Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) 14 per cent below 2019 baseline levels.\n\nIn FY2022, we installed tertiary abatement technology in one of our nitric acid plants at our Carseland manufacturing site in Canada, which is now delivering 95 per cent abatement efficiency from unabated levels and enabling the production of a lower-carbon intensity ammonium nitrate (AN) for customers.\n\nWe continue to leverage our expertise in technology to respond to a growing interest in renewables, recycled, lower-carbon and circular solutions such as Cyclo \u2122 and Fortis \u2122 Protect.\n\nWe commenced the construction and installation of low-emissions technology at Kooragang Island, Australia and formed Hydrogen Hub partnerships with Origin Energy and The Hydrogen Utility \u2122 to develop future green hydrogen and ammonia opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, we announced our commitment to source 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2040 and signed our first Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Lightsource bp for renewable electricity. We also converted $1.3 billion of existing bank debt facilities into sustainabilitylinked loans, aligning our financing strategy with our ESG goals.\n\nOur Orica Impact Fund supports our communities with the aim to improve social equity and well-being, education, and environmental outcomes, and foster community togetherness. We increased our global contribution by 54 per cent this year to $3.7 million helping build safe, resilient, and thriving communities.\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nIn FY2022, we welcomed Gordon Naylor to the Orica Board as an independent, Non-executive Director. Gordon brings over 30 years of experience in operational and financial leadership roles and deep expertise in engineering, global supply chain, and information systems strategy and implementation.\n\nIn October 2022, we announced a change to our Executive Committee with Christopher Davis, Chief Financial Officer, leaving Orica and Kim Kerr appointed to the position. Kim joined Orica in September 2022 in the position of Vice President of Group Finance and brings over 16 years of experience in finance, treasury, investor relations, and commercial leadership.\n\nWe updated Orica's Whistleblower Policy and implemented important updates to our Code of Business Conduct to reflect changing societal expectations, support our culture of safety, and emphasise our strong position on respect for First Nations Peoples, human rights, modern slavery, and workplace sexual harassment.\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\nSafety remains our number one priority. We are committed to improving our safety performance, living up to our values and keeping our people, customers and communities safe.\n\nOur customers' appetite for new technology and our refreshed strategy sets us on a clear pathway to drive growth from blasting technology and accelerate the adoption of our new technologies and digital solutions from mine-tomill, growing beyond blasting.\n\nBy maintaining our disciplined approach to commercial management, we will continue to capitalise on opportunities presented by market conditions and diversify our portfolio in future-facing commodities and quarry and construction markets.",

Underlying earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) increased by 36 per cent to $579 million.\n\nThe growth in earnings was driven by improved commercial discipline in both customer and supply contracts, solid volume growth from strong commodity market conditions, and customers moving to more premium products. We also increased our utilisation rates at our manufacturing plants to support increased demand, improving our returns from those assets and continued to grow earnings from our digital solutions.\n\nStatutory net profit after tax (attributable to shareholders of Orica Limited) was $60 million, which included $257 million after tax of net unfavourable significant items. The charges reflect our decision to exit our operations in Russia given the difficult operating environment, the significant decline in the local economy in Turkey, and the flow on impacts across our EMEA region. It also includes the accounting implications of the sale of non-core businesses Nitro Consult AB and Minova. For further details of the significant items, refer to note 1(e) of the financial statements on page 137.\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continue to implement cost reduction initiatives across the business, in supply chain, manufacturing and overheads to address continued inflationary pressures, high energy costs, and supply chain dislocations, which will remain an ongoing challenge next year.\n\nNow that we have stabilised the ERP system (SAP), we are using it to provide critical insights into customers and contracts to ensure pass-through mechanisms are operating effectively, debtors are being collected in a timely matter and we are prioritising quality contracts in a constrained supply environment. This will contribute to our focused effort on improving our cash generation.\n\nReturn on net assets (RONA) is a key measure of how efficiently we use our assets. This year we achieved 11.4 per cent which is within our target range of 10-12 per cent. The increase from prior year was driven by our improved earnings performance.\n\nWe continue to deliver on our strategic objective to monetise non-core asset sales. We completed the sale of Minova, and Nitro Consult AB, as well as the Nowra and Tappen land sales this year. Additionally, in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we sold and exited our operations in Russia.\n\n## INVESTING FOR GROWTH IN DIGITAL SOLUTIONS\n\nDuring the year we entered into a binding agreement to acquire 100 per cent of Axis Mining Technology (Axis). The transaction was completed on 3 October 2022, when payment of the upfront acquisition purchase price of $258 million was made. A deferred earn-out payment up to a maximum of $90 million, contingent on financial performance and other conditions being met, was also agreed.",

        "page_content": "The transaction was funded by a fully underwritten share placement and a share purchase plan, which together raised $691 million in gross proceeds. After providing for the upfront and deferred cost of the Axis acquisition and associated transaction and funding fees, the remaining proceeds are being used to fund incremental trade working capital requirements and provide balance sheet capacity.\n\nThe increase in trade working capital requirements was predominantly due to management's decision to increase inventory holdings in order to ensure security of supply for our customers, as well as the impact of higher input prices, both impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nI would like to thank our shareholders for their support as we invest in growth whilst ensuring we maintain a strengthened balance sheet.\n\n## OUR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK REMAINS UNCHANGED\n\nOur capital management framework is based on three key objectives:\n\n- -  maintaining our investment grade credit rating;\n- -  preserving the flexibility for growth investment and to respond to changes in the external operating environment; and\n- -  maximising returns to shareholders.\n\nPost completion of the successful equity raising, Standard & Poor's revised our BBB investment grade credit rating from 'negative watch' to 'stable'.\n\nWe continued to apply our disciplined approach to capital expenditure to support the base business and pursue growth opportunities. Total capital expenditure for the year was $349 million, which was within the guidance range of $340 million to $360 million.\n\n## OUR STRENGTHENED BALANCE SHEET PROVIDES RESILIENCE DURING VOLATILE TIMES\n\nAt year end, our net debt balance was $912 million, our gearing of 19.7 per cent was below our target range of 30 to 40 per cent, and we had $2,678 million liquidity available in cash and undrawn committed bank debt facilities. Note that these measures are before the $258 million payment made in October 2022 for the acquisition of Axis.\n\nWe refinanced $299 million of committed bank debt facilities during the year, and our average drawn debt maturity is now 4.3 years. We absorbed the redemption of a bond maturity in October via the utilisation of existing bank committed debt facilities and our next material bond maturity occurs in September 2023 which we are well placed to manage.\n\nWe recently converted $1.3 billion of existing committed bank debt facilities into sustainability-linked loans. Our financiers have joined Orica in recognising and supporting our commitment to improving our sustainability performance.\n\nThe dividend for the first half of the year was 13.0 cents per share. The final dividend of 22.0 cents per share brings the full year dividend to 35.0 cents per share. This equates to a full year payout ratio of 48 per cent, which is in line with our range of paying out 40 to 70 per cent of underlying earnings.\n\n## OUR PATHWAY TOWARDS PROFITABLE GROWTH AND VALUE CREATION\n\nOur financial position is prudent in the current volatile external environment.\n\nWe remain focused on improving our operating cash generation and we will continue to apply our capital management framework to guide our investment decisions.\n\nAnd as we continue to successfully progress against our strategic priorities, I am confident in our ability to create value for all our stakeholders.\n\nI would also like to acknowledge and thank the Orica finance community for their support, and everyone across the business for their contribution to our improved results in FY2022.\n\nKim Kerr Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

We use the results to inform our strategy, prioritise resources, establish sustainability targets and shape external reporting.\n\nOur materiality assessment was refreshed this year in line with the International <IR> Framework. Integrated Reporting methodologies prioritise topics which can substantively affect Orica's ability to create enterprise value and are most relevant to stakeholders making economic decisions.\n\nDuring FY2022 we confirmed existing topics remained relevant and considered major global and industry developments as well as Orica's sustainability commitments and strategies. Internal and external stakeholder insights and employee engagement surveys supported the validation of our material topics.\n\n## Material topics in FY2022\n\nOver 30 material topics have been identified and prioritised with our most material topics outlined in the table below. A full summary of material topics and our FY2022 assessment is available on our website.\n\n## TOP 10 MATERIAL TOPICS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n## SDG LINK\n\nBusiness resilience: The ability to quickly adapt to disruptions while maintaining continuous business operations, security of supply and safeguarding people and assets.\n\nEconomic performance: Orica's financial performance, operational performance, and organisational effectiveness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransition to a lower-carbon economy: Resilience to climate-related impacts and risks, adapting the business to enhance competitiveness across the value chain.\n\nProduct safety and security: Transparent processes and systems for ensuring products are used for their intended purpose.\n\nProduct quality and performance: Product conformance to regulatory and industry standards to satisfy customer needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSafety: Worker health, safety and well-being throughout the supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEthical business conduct: Ensuring our business activities and culture are responsible, transparent and compliant with our legal and ethical obligations (e.g., anti-bribery, trade sanctions, corruption, tax transparency).\n\nCorporate governance: Oversight and accountability corporate governance; managing ESG risk; compliance with government sanctions and public disclosure requirements.\n\nEnvironmental risk and compliance: Managing environmental risks and impacts and managing the environmental\n\ncompliance of our operations and supply chain.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions: Arising in our operations and supply chain from material sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, workplaces and other business activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur most material topics have remained largely unchanged however some changes were made to other topics outside our top 10, reflecting changing global and business circumstances.\n\n- -  We changed the topic name supply chain sustainability to responsible sourcing for improved clarity. Supply chain and security of supply issues are covered in our business resilience topic, which has attracted greater focus this year due to the disruption of global AN supply.\n- -Human rights, corporate culture and Indigenous/First Nations Peoples engagement topics are a key priority reflecting growing scrutiny in our industry and greater focus on improving social outcomes in our communities.\n- -  The focus on biodiversity has increased significantly as our stakeholders raise their expectations for companies to protect and enhance nature.\n\n## FUTURE SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS\n\nVarious standard setters and regulatory bodies 1 have begun to refine the concept of sustainability materiality with the introduction of double and dynamic materiality.\n\nDouble materiality acknowledges that businesses should assess both the risks and opportunities linked to ESG topics that can influence enterprise value creation (inward impacts) and the ESG impacts that a company can have on the planet and society (outward impacts). The concept of dynamic materiality recognises that the financial materiality of an ESG impact can evolve over time and what appears immaterial today, can become critical tomorrow and into the future. In response we have adjusted our approach and are increasingly embedding material financialrelated ESG topics into our strategic and financial planning to better navigate the evolving ESG landscape and enhance our oversight of emerging risks and issues.\n\nWe continue to monitor and respond to evolving reporting standards and approaches to materiality.\n\n- (1) European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).",

While the blast at Kiruna was one of many for Orica - WebGen \u2122 has fired more than 125,000 units in over 4,000 blasts globally across our sites - it was also a unique milestone.\n\nWebGen \u2122 wireless technology delivers benefits in safety and productivity, with no need for downlines or connecting wires, and the ability to initiate blasts on-demand, reliably and safely, removing people from harm's way. As part of our early engagement with LKAB, our team\n\nconducted surveys and testing at the Kiruna iron ore mine in 2018 to discover the wireless signal could not penetrate the magnetite ore. While WebGen \u2122 wireless technology initiates groups of blastholes using communication through rock and water, the highly magnetic qualities of the magnetite ore created challenges for our system to achieve a communication signal and initiate blasts in this environment. This was the first time this challenge had been encountered. We engaged our global team of WebGen \u2122 experts and worked in collaboration with LKAB to better understand the magnetite orebody properties and used advanced diagnostic tools to understand the surrounding environment.\n\nThe first blast using WebGen \u2122 at Kiruna was successfully initiated in June 2022. This was an outstanding result in support of our customer's safety and productivity goals.\n\n|",

To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, production of these commodities will need to continue to increase at pace, despite price fluctuations in several commodities.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict has created a global energy crisis. Energy flows and markets has been disrupted, leading many countries to continue to rely on thermal coal as a key part of their energy mix. While thermal coal production is still expected to decline, shorter term production remains strong, particularly in the United States (US) and Australia. We will continue to supply and service our coal customers throughout the energy transition.\n\nWe are continuing to actively grow our presence in future-facing commodities, which form a considerable proportion of Australia Pacific and Latin America's mining pipeline. This provides growth opportunities for our blasting business as well as digital solutions, particularly in exploration and resource definition activities, and processing phases of the mining value chain.\n\n## EXPECTATIONS IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE /parenleft.caseE SG/parenright.case AC TIONS\n\nLink to key value drivers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChanging societal expectations for delivering positive ESG performance is impacting the global resources sector with market and policy momentum continuing to gather pace, particularly on climate change.

As countries prioritise their domestic chemical requirements over export and impose sanctions on many Russian chemical producers, security of supply of key production inputs has never been more important.\n\nDespite the difficult operating conditions, the strength of our global manufacturing and supply network means we have been able to maintain security of supply for our customers. Our AN plants in Australia, Indonesia and Canada continue to provide an independent and consistent source of supply. Our ability to purchase third-party explosive grade AN at scale has enabled us to maintain continuity of supply in other regions, including Latin America and Africa. With global AN supply expected to remain constrained in the near term, our manufacturing and supply networks will continue to be a source of competitive advantage to Orica.\n\n## TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE\n\nLink to key value drivers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe pace of technological change is accelerating across the mining and infrastructure industries, including higher customer adoption rates for solutions that improve safety, sustainability and productivity. Competition is also increasing from businesses focused on blasting related technologies, and other players who are bringing digital technology to our customers from other industries. However, with our industry leading digital solutions and blasting technologies, we are uniquely positioned to service the industry as it evolves.\n\nWe continue to build our mine-to-mill portfolio of digital solutions. The acquisition of Axis Mining Technology strengthens our position in orebody intelligence and increases our exposure to the exploration and resource definition phase of the mining value chain. Building on established solutions, like BlastIQ \u2122 and FRAGTrack \u2122 , our digital growth strategy seeks to expand our portfolio beyond blasting, through acquisition and product development.\n\nAdoption rates for WebGen \u2122 are increasing with the forthcoming commercial release of WebGen \u2122 200 expected to create opportunities in large-scale surface mines. Customer trials of 4D \u2122 are proving successful and our first commercial trials of Avatel \u2122 are scheduled to occur in late 2022.\n\nWith mineral conditions becoming more complex as miners develop new projects and prices fluctuate, we expect demand for digital and technological solutions that improve the understanding of orebodies and deliver efficiencies across the mining value chain to increase. Our digital solutions and other technology offerings are well placed to deliver value in this environment.\n\n## INFLATION AND THE RISK OF RECESSION\n\nLink to key value drivers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInflation has emerged as a key driver of volatility and uncertainty for the global economy.\n\nOrica is not immune to inflationary impacts as we experience rising costs including salaries and raw material inputs.

The strength of our global manufacturing and supply network, our ability to leverage our purchasing scale, logistics capabilities, commercial agility, and a commitment to excellence by our teams, has enabled us to continue to meet customer needs as we navigate difficult operating conditions, particularly the global AN market disruption arising from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and elevated energy prices in Europe.\n\n## ENABLING ENDURING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE THROUGH SUSTAINABILITY\n\nAs one of the world's leading mining and infrastructure solutions provider with global manufacturing capability, responsibly managing our impacts to society and supporting a transition to a net zero economy is fundamental to creating sustainable value for our stakeholders.\n\nWe recognise the responsibility we are entrusted with, and the unique opportunity to harness our technology and digital solutions to advance and champion for a safer and more sustainable industry. In FY2021, we developed our comprehensive sustainability strategy and roadmap. A core pillar of the strategy is our stated ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 1 .\n\nWe have developed a range of measurable environment and social actions and targets to deliver our strategy, against which we will continue to transparently disclose progress. We are growing our in-house sustainability capabilities and progressively improving our own sustainability performance however, there is much more to do.\n\nTo support the global transition to a lower-carbon economy, ammonia and AN need to be decarbonised.\n\nToday ammonia is made from natural gas, with carbon dioxide produced as a by-product. Green ammonia can, however, be made from hydrogen produced from renewable energy and sustainably sourced water.\n\nOur industrial manufacturing facilities have long lifespans. This means the investment decisions we make in coming years will influence our efforts to decarbonise as we consider lower emissions technology options.\n\nDemand for critical energy minerals is expected to grow dramatically. Major economic opportunities exist in mining and minerals extraction for copper, lithium, cobalt, nickel and other future-facing commodities.\n\nWe are actively partnering with our stakeholders to capitalise on these opportunities and drive sustainable growth.\n\n- (1)  Our net zero emissions ambition covers our global Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions under our direct control, and material Scope 3 emission sources. Achieving this ambition will require effective government policy frameworks, supportive regulation and financial incentives, and access to new lower-carbon technologies operating at commercial scale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrica\n\n|",

The decisions we make at work can have far reaching impacts on our business, our colleagues, our customers, our communities and the world we live in.\n\nOrica has an unwavering commitment to health and safety. This year we fell short of our promise to keep people out of harm's way. We are reporting two tragic fatalities. We are committed to doing better, upgrading critical controls and learning from the past.\n\n## Workplace safety\n\nTragically, we are reporting two fatalities this year relating to an event in FY2022 and a previously unreported event in FY2021. In response to the incidents, we conducted a detailed review of key controls in our Major Hazard Management (MHM) program relating to flyrock and elevated work platform (EWP) risks. We have taken disciplinary action in response to the unreported fatality in FY2021, which breached our Code of Business Conduct (Our Code).\n\nWe are deeply disappointed with this performance and know we must do better. We are committed to re-establishing the trust of our stakeholders and living up to our values to keep people safe, always.\n\n## FY2022 AND FY2021 FATALITIES\n\n## Flyrock fatality, Russia\n\nIn July 2022, an Orica blasting crew were performing a trial blast at a customer site in far-east Russia when flyrock was ejected outside the designated blast exclusion zone. Two Orica employees were struck and tragically, an Orica bench assistant was fatally injured. The second employee was seriously injured requiring medical treatment.\n\nWe activated emergency services and initiated support for family and colleagues. We immediately ceased all blasting operations, including a safety stand-down across all sites in Russia. A full internal investigation was conducted, supported by Orica's Surface Expert Panel.\n\nThe investigation found a number of factors contributed to the tragedy. We are working to apply these learnings within our MHM program and reinforce critical safety measures.\n\n- (1) Serious injury case rate (unit of measure: per 200,000 hours worked).\n- (2)  Serious life-changing injury case rate (unit of measure: per 200,000 hours worked).\n\n2\n\n0.017 2 SLICR FATALITIES 0.157 1 SICR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Elevated Work Platform (EWP) fatality, Kazakhstan\n\nWe are also reporting a contractor fatality in Kazakhstan from FY2021. The incident - a fall from an EWP - was reported through our Whistleblowing channels and was subject to a thorough investigation.\n\nIn response, we are updating our procedures for working from heights to provide additional guidance around work from EWPs. We are reviewing contractor management processes and requirements around monitoring contractor work on site.\n\nDisciplinary action has been taken against site management personnel who were aware of the event and did not report it. These actions are not reflective of Orica's values and are in breach of Our Code.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Our Serious Injury Case Rate (SICR) was 0.157, which is a 25 per cent improvement on our FY2021 performance, but above our target of 0.138 serious injuries per 200,000 hours worked.\n\n## Serious Injury Case Rate\n\n## Serious Life-Changing Injury Case Rate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Orica's smarter solutions to remove people from harm's way\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n## WEBGEN \u2122 200\n\nWebGen \u2122 is the world's first fully wireless initiation system which can communicate through hundreds of metres of rock, air and water to initiate blasts. By eliminating the need for downlines and surface connecting wires, WebGen \u2122 allows mine personnel to spend less time in the dangerous zones of the mine compared to traditional blasting systems. This year we commercialised the second generation of WebGen \u2122 .\n\nWebGen \u2122 200 has enhanced safety and security capabilities including a beacon system and LockSafe. The beacon improves procedural controls to ensure the correct blast is fired, which is a unique hazard of wireless blasting. Each beacon is encoded to a specific blast and must be present for the blast to fire. LockSafe uses Inertial Movement Units and an algorithm to detect if the primer has moved from the hole and sends a disarm signal to the unit to prevent the unit from receiving the firing signal, which helps customers avoid potentially unsafe blasting outcomes. LockSafe is progressing toward commercialisation.\n\n## i-kon \u2122 DETONATORS\n\nThe i-kon \u2122 III electronic detonator is our most sophisticated EBS, designed to perform safely and reliably under extreme conditions. The detonators have multiple safety features enabling protection against the high voltage electrostatic discharge which occurs in lightning strikes. Work continues on incorporating GPS tracking capability into our next generation i-kon \u2122 detonators, which would make it impossible to initiate a blast from within a digital exclusion zone.\n\n## AVATEL \u2122\n\nOur partnership with Epiroc is progressing toward commercialisation of our Avatel \u2122 system, the world's first mechanised development charging system. The technology allows a single operator to locate, clean, prime and load our bulk explosives and wireless initiating systems from the safety of an enclosed cabin, several metres from the face and out of harm's way.",

The trial tested a 'virtual co-pilot' to provide real-time information on the risks and hazards of the defined route to drivers. We are also working with our contractors to provide training and awareness sessions on our requirements and fundamentals of vehicle stability and encourage immediate feedback about driver behaviour and performance.\n\n## STRENGTHENING AND EXPANDING OUR MHM PROGRAM\n\nOur MHM program is integral to our strategic safety focus areas, defining key safety controls and establishing rigorous verification protocols. This year, our leaders completed over 18,500 independent verifications of our key hazard controls.\n\nFollowing the fatality in Russia this year, our Surface Expert Panel commenced a review of key controls for Major Hazard 'Struck by Flyrock'. Recommendations from the review will be implemented, upgrading our controls as appropriate to keep people safe.\n\nMHM is reinforced in everyday work through our Safety Leadership Interaction program. This program leverages the relationship between supervisor and worker to enhance communication around safety controls. In FY2022, we completed over 83,000 safety interactions up 4/uni00A0per cent on last year's performance.\n\nCreating a culture of safety in which all employees are empowered and expected to call an immediate stop to work if they observe a potentially hazardous situation is core to our MHM program and reinforced by the recent updates to Our Code and Whistleblower Policy. We regularly communicate MHM stops internally to encourage our people to speak-up and call a stop if they feel unsafe.\n\nIn FY2022, the number of stops called increased to over 2,700, up from approximately 1,700 in FY2021, signalling our employees are aware they have this option and feel empowered to exercise it.\n\nOur MHM program was expanded during the reporting period to include contractors, with MHM elements included in contractor site inductions. A trial pre-qualification approach for contractors was conducted, based on a tiered risk approach using MHM and will lead to further refinements.\n\n## MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE\n\nWith mental and physical well-being critical for our people to thrive, our employee engagement survey was updated to include leading indicators on mental health and well-being. A review of risk assessment tools has also been undertaken to identify and assess psychosocial factors in the workplace and will be deployed in key business areas where increased risk is prevalent.\n\nIn FY2022, we:\n\n- -  reviewed and updated our Orica Assignee Deployment Medicals to ensure people are medically fit to undertake international assignments;\n- -  published a standardised Occupational Exposure Limit and Biological Exposure Indices Listing in the Group Standard for Health; and\n- -  developed a respiratory Health Surveillance Guideline to establish the minimum requirements and frequency of testing for respiratory health surveillance. This is currently being reviewed by the regions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS\n\n## PRODUCT SECURITY\n\nAs a manufacturer of commercial explosives and blasting initiating systems, we have specific responsibilities to ensure we partner with and sell to organisations that will use our products for their intended purpose. We also have a responsibility to eliminate or minimise any risks to safety, health or the environment across the lifecycle of our products and services.\n\nWe take our product security responsibilities seriously and strive to be champions of a safe and secure value chain. We select our partners following detailed due diligence covering security across the product lifecycle, from transport to storage and final end-use. No product security incidents categorised as a Severity/uni00A03 (1) or higher were recorded in FY2022. Through deep engagement with our carriers and increasing the security posture during transport, we have observed reduced product security events related to transport this year. Of the six Severity 2 (2) product security events that occurred, one was related to transport, compared to four out of six in FY2021.\n\nTrack and Trace is being implemented in line with our product stewardship. This technology, while enabling higher accuracy inventory control, will enable us to provide detailed information to authorities in the event of lost or stolen product, or product recovered in the hands of unauthorised persons.\n\nWe participate in global discussions and organisations to contribute to industry security standards and approaches. Orica is a member of the Global Congress on Chemical Security and Emerging Threats Industry Advisory Group, which is focused on preventing access of explosives precursor chemicals. The Global Congress is co-sponsored by INTERPOL, the US Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and US Defence Threat Reduction Agency.\n\n## CYBER SECURITY\n\nCyber security is key to protecting Orica's people, products, sites and sensitive information. Orica's cyber strategy is focused on three key outcomes:\n\n- -  appropriate cyber controls across Business, Customer and Manufacturing systems;\n- -  detect and respond rapidly to malicious software or intruders in our network; and\n- -  improved data security, safeguarding our own and our customers data.\n\nIn FY2022, we strengthened our cyber controls, including priority controls at our key sites to protect against cyber-attacks. Our Cyber Security Management team has doubled in size in the last 12 months, and we have embedded additional dedicated cyber experts with manufacturing expertise into the manufacturing team to improve capabilities.\n\nWe have matured our cyber awareness program with regular training and phishing email simulations that build company-wide capability. We also provide bespoke training for higher risk roles, so our people are well equipped to raise and address cyber security concerns and prevent potential cyber-attacks.\n\nProgress against our internal cyber security roadmap and cyber key risk indicators is reported to the Board quarterly and we obtain external independent assessments to gauge the effectiveness of our cyber security measures.\n\n## Vendor cyber controls\n\nWe have commenced work to assess the cyber controls of our top 260 vendors - representing around 80 per cent of our vendor spend to understand how they manage confidential data and if their cyber controls meet Orica's standards.\n\n## Crisis Response Preparedness\n\nOur cyber security posture is tested with crisis simulations, penetration testing and by using external cyber professionals to perform ethical hacking exercises. To prepare for malicious cyber events and ensure our corporate crisis management processes and procedures have been adopted correctly, we have performed simulations of a cyber-attack at one of our manufacturing sites. The response to the simulation was positive.\n\n## ETHICAL BUSINESS CONDUCT\n\n## Our Code of Business Conduct (Our Code)\n\nOur Code is our guide to doing the right thing. It establishes how we will conduct ourselves to deliver on Orica's purpose, vision, strategy and values as outlined in Our Charter.\n\nAs our company evolves, so too does Our Code. We updated Our Code in July 2022 to reflect changing societal expectations, strengthen our culture of safety and emphasise our strong position on respect for First Nations Peoples and cultural heritage, human rights, modern slavery and workplace sexual harassment. The updates highlighted everyone's authority and obligation to stop work to protect our people, the environment and Indigenous cultural heritage.\n\nThe update reinforces the importance of speaking up and we are committed to ensuring everyone can raise concerns freely and without fear. Concerns are dealt with swiftly, fairly and confidentially using our Speak-Up service (operated by third-party provider Navex) and authorised internal and external recipients as per the Whistleblowing Policy.\n\nOur Code is publicly available at orica.com .\n\n|",

In August 2022, we released updates to our Respect@Work approach which applies to Orica Australia, including:\n\n- -  a revised 'Respectful Behaviours At Work' policy;\n- -  end-to-end approach in place to investigate, and support individuals who make a claim regarding behaviours that are inconsistent with our values; and\n- -  mandatory leader and employee learning modules to understand the expectations and obligations of our Orica team.\n\nOur policy is in line with the Minerals Council of Australia's Industry Code on Eliminating Sexual Harassment .\n\n## Reporting issues and grievances\n\nIn FY2022, we updated our Whistleblower Policy in line with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's (ASIC) recommendations. This included revising our language to provide clarity on what should be reported, key steps involved in handling and investigating reports, what protections are afforded to whistleblowers, and how Orica enforces these protections. We also translated the updated Whistleblower Policy into 13 languages to increase accessibility. Following the communication of our revised Whistleblower Policy, reports were received regarding the unreported fatality incident in Kazakhstan.\n\nOur Whistleblower Policy is in place to support people, including all employees, their families and other Orica stakeholders (including customers, suppliers, contractors and visitors) to report misconduct via our external and confidential Speak-Up Service. Employees can also raise misconduct concerns with Authorised Recipients, who are identified in the policy. Externally, reporters can also raise concerns with ASIC, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), and the Commissioner of Taxation for reports that relate to Orica's tax affairs.\n\nA breach of our Whistleblower Policy is considered a breach of Our Code and may have serious consequences. Retaliatory behaviour against reporters is not tolerated and will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nDuring the reporting period we received 107 whistleblowing reports, equivalent to 0.9 reports per 100 employees. Based on benchmarking supplied by our Speak-Up service provider Navex, 1.3 reports per 100 employees represents an optimal rate that is high enough to demonstrate broad employee awareness of whistleblowing processes but low enough to indicate there are not excessive issues and grievances.\n\nIn FY2022, 66 per cent of whistleblower reports related to workplace and personal grievances. Quarterly whistleblowing reports are provided to the Board Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Report by Outcome\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen concerns are raised through available mechanisms, a review process is undertaken, and a response determined according to the framework in our Group procedure. In FY2022, 35 per cent of reports were substantiated. Where allegations were substantiated, appropriate action was taken to remedy and prevent re-occurrence, including termination of contract.\n\n## Report by Category\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrica\n\n|",

Our approach is embedded within Our Charter, Our Code, risk management approach and organisational policies.\n\n## First Nations engagement and cultural heritage protection\n\nIn FY2021, we developed our First Nations Engagement and Cultural Heritage Protection Roadmap. This followed a third-party assessment of our First Nations engagement and cultural heritage management, benchmarked against the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and external stakeholder expectations.\n\nThe roadmap includes commitments to strengthening our policies and governance, risk management and stakeholder engagement systems, and maps opportunities for improving Indigenous relationships and increasing participation in employment, procurement, community investment, as well as building Orica's cultural competency.\n\nIn FY2022 we:\n\n- -  strengthened our position on respect for First Nations Peoples and their cultural heritage in the refresh of Our Code, by embedding a 'stop work' directive to empower our people to cease work if they identify a risk to Indigenous cultural heritage;\n- -  drafted a Human Rights Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) which includes monitoring of cultural heritage protection across our operations. This will be finalised and included in our risk management framework in FY2023; and\n- -  laid the groundwork for improving our engagement approach with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stakeholders in Australia, including drafting our first Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in association with Reconciliation Australia.\n\nOur Australian Reflect RAP will be launched in early FY2023. A Reflect RAP is the first stage in an organisation's reconciliation journey and allows us to scope and develop relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stakeholders, outlining our vision for reconciliation, exploring our spheres of influence and establishing meaningful actions for participation around the pillars of Respect, Relationships and Opportunities. We will review and report on progress made against the goals outlined in our RAP and work with Reconciliation Australia to renew our plan.",

To help protect the structures and minimise impact from blasting, Orica was engaged by a customer to conduct trial blasting to capture ground vibration transmission characteristics and the vibration frequency response of the rock structures.\n\nUsing customised accelerometers and GroundProbe Geotech Monitoring LiDAR, we provided our customer with an accurate vibration prediction model to support the development of initial blast timing sequences and instantaneous charge weights to avoid generating disruptive frequencies that would damage the rock structures. This indicated no permanent displacement or deformation of the rock structures would occur and provided confidence to the Yulluna people, the community and the customer that blasting could be executed safely without compromising this cultural heritage site.\n\n## Modern slavery\n\nAddressing modern slavery requires ongoing, dedicated and collaborative effort from many stakeholders including governments, nongovernment organisations and business. We continue to strengthen our approach to managing our modern slavery risk across our operations and supply chain but recognise there is much more to do.\n\nIn FY2022, we made progress against our commitments, deepened our understanding of incoming\n\nglobal legislative changes and trends and their implications for our business, and worked to enhance the human rights (including modern slavery) due diligence approach in our operational activity.\n\nThis included a third-party review of our current approach, identification of gaps and opportunities, and delivery of a process and tools to support broader organisational understanding and human rights due diligence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY2022 Modern Slavery Statement\n\n## FY2023 Priorities:\n\n- -  Publish our first Australian RAP.\n- -  Continued development of our Major Hazard Management (MHM) program to integrate fatality lessons.\n- -  Roll-out of a Safety Leadership program for Supervisors in key areas.\n- -  Completion of a psychosocial risk profiling program to understand potential mental well-being challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

EBS accounted for 38 per cent of the volume uplift contribution in EBIT.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing performance improved as a result of increased volumes at the large continuous plants in Australia and Indonesia, partially offset by higher costs for alternate sourcing of AN during the Carseland plant turnarounds in North America.\n\nThe pcp result included costs incurred from an incident at the La Portada manufacturing plant in Latin America which have not been repeated in the 2022 financial year.\n\n## Mix and margin\n\nMargin growth was led by commercial discipline and emphasis on quality of earnings across the regions.\n\nRise and fall mechanisms worked effectively to pass through volatile ammonia and gas prices.\n\nProduct mix improved as customers adopted more technology and shifted to premium products as strong commodity prices increased focus on productivity gains.\n\n## Mining Chemicals\n\nCyanide volumes were 10 per cent up on the pcp from new business and higher demand from existing customers in Australia and Asia. Higher utilisation of the cyanide plant also led to lower conversion cost.\n\n## Orica Monitor\n\nStrengthened radar sales and growth in recurring contracts, couple with improved pricing led to growth in EBIT contribution from Monitor.\n\nThe pcp result included full year earnings for Nitro Consult AB which was sold in February 2022.\n\n## Discontinued operations\n\nThe Minova business sale completed in the first half of 2022, resulting in only five months of earnings contribution versus a full 12 months in the pcp.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

This increased demand, coupled with commercial discipline enabled contract improvements. Market conditions are also increasing customers interest in productivity gains from technology.\n\nAcross the region there was growth in the metals sector, primarily driven by increased activity in gold and copper markets in Australia and copper in Indonesia. Demand in the thermal coal sector in Indonesia and south-east Asia increased, however, has reduced in Australia due to wet weather on the east coast and lower domestic consumption.\n\n|\n\nTight global supply of ammonia has led to a significant increase in AN prices and cost inflation continued to rise sharply.\n\nCOVID-19 absenteeism and labour shortages continue to impact mining activity and supply chains.\n\n## Segment performance\n\nThe 31 per cent increase in EBIT on the pcp was largely driven by contract improvements, increased AN, EBS and cyanide volumes, a shift to premium products, and improved fixed cost recovery from higher utilisation of manufacturing plants.\n\nSustainable growth has been achieved through commercial discipline on new and renewed contracts including improved rise and fall terms, investments in the resilience and flexibility of plants and supply chains, and security of supply provided to customers.\n\nThe region saw strong revenue growth across all commodities and products. While wet weather conditions in Eastern Australia constrained AN volume growth, it led to a shift towards more premium products.\n\nRecord production was achieved at Yarwun and Bontang continuous plants. The Yarwun turnaround was completed in November 2021 and the Kooragang Island turnaround for installation of tertiary abatement technology commenced in September 2022.\n\nA new sparge site was commissioned in Malaysia, enabling the sale of safer cyanide across our Asian markets.",

Gold and copper mining activity across the region increased, driving higher demand for Orica products and services.\n\nAll commodity sectors were impacted by global supply chain challenges including increased freight costs and some raw material and product shortages. Industrial action in Mexico towards the end of the last quarter further tightened supply in the region.\n\n## Segment performance\n\nThe 23 per cent EBIT increase on the pcp was largely driven by new contract wins in Canada, higher services contribution, improved contract terms negotiated and favourable foreign exchange.\n\nRevenue from all commodities and product types increased due to higher demand and increased customer activity, which coupled with commercial discipline, enabled contract improvements.\n\nDiscrete network optimisation, supply chain initiatives and pass-through mechanisms were effective in reducing the impacts of supply chain challenges from raw material shortages, inflationary pressure and increased gas and freight costs.\n\nMajor planned maintenance turnarounds were completed at the Carseland AN manufacturing plant. Tertiary catalyst abatement technology installed is performing above expectations.\n\nThe US dollar appreciated against the Australian dollar, resulting in a favourable impact to EBIT on translation of foreign denominated earnings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Improved commercial discipline and changes to rise and fall clauses were implemented.\n\nSecurity of supply for customers was paramount as AN trade flows into Latin America from Russia were constrained due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Alternative AN sourcing options were used to continue servicing customers.\n\n## Segment performance\n\nThe significant increase in EBIT on the pcp was largely driven by commercial discipline on both customer and supply contracts, improved product mix and technology penetration.\n\nDemand for premium products and electronic blasting systems increased on the pcp. Technology adoption in the region is growing at pace with Orica leading the mining digital transformation in Latin America.\n\n|\n\nSupply initiatives including negotiating improved supplier terms, and changes to shipment loadings and movements also contributed to the region's improved performance.\n\nAN previously supplied from Russia was largely replaced with product from alternative sources, albeit at higher costs and shorter payment terms.\n\nRise and fall pass through mechanisms have been shortened and are working effectively to fully pass through higher costs. Terms in many customer contracts were updated to include clauses for the pass through of freight costs.\n\nGlobal manufacturing optimisation plans, including the rationalisation of initiating systems manufacturing, are on track in the region.

This type of optimisation is usually not possible with conventional blasting methods or wired initiation systems.\n\nOur WebGen \u2122 specialists, together with the team at Agnico Eagle, reviewed the uphole stope design at the underground gold mine and implemented improvements to optimise the void for each blast. The team also changed the drill pattern and hole angles for the first initial blast by 25 per cent. Following the success of the first uphole stope, several upper stopes were mined using WebGen \u2122 100.\n\nAgnico Eagle's Mining Engineer, Vincent Bouillon said the implementation of WebGen \u2122 100 greatly improved recovery in their upper stopes, allowing them to perform several blasts and have an adequate void volume.\n\n'The success of our WebGen trials allow us to believe in the possibility of applying this technology to perform mining in sectors previously not possible.

Operated by Stevenson Aggregates, the quarry has been in operation since 1939 and is committed to sustainability and operational efficiencies using technologies and innovation.\n\nStevenson Aggregates had identified challenges in gaining valuable data from post-blast fragmentation analysis conducted in-pit using manual sampling. This was time-consuming and not a sustainable process for the long-term. Orica proposed FRAGTrack \u2122 Crusher, an automated pre-crusher fragmentation measurement tool delivering operational continuity in a safe and reliable way. The technology leverages the latest deep neural network artificial intelligence (AI) framework along with the industry-proven hybrid 2D and 3D particle size distribution (PSD) processing methods to deliver a fully autonomous adaptive fragmentation monitoring solution at the crusher dump pocket and enabling customers to measure material on the truck during tipping operations. The smart trigger settings ensure only true samples are recorded and every image is processed and uploaded to the FRAGTrack \u2122 website to view at any time. This allows managers and engineers to assess the blast fragmentation performance on a continuous loop.\n\nStevenson Aggregates Performance Manager, Daniel Topp said: 'FRAGTrack is allowing us to obtain\n\ninformation that we've never typically had. What we're getting is information to better understand our rock and resource. This is data we can feedback and analyse and that's pretty revolutionary.'\n\nThe data can also be correlated to the crusher throughput analytics to measure production rates, blockages and amount of primary crushing versus secondary crushing. This helps the customer assess the wear and tear on components in the crusher at various stages throughout the process.\n\nStevenson Aggregates General Manager, Kurt Hine said: 'Having a partner like Orica is great for us. We love our supply partners coming to us so that we can continue to innovate, improving our processes and deliver a quality product to our customers in a more sustainable way.'\n\nFRAGTrack has saved Stevenson Aggregate over 800 hours of manual processing and provided access to more than 5,000 fragmentation images, delivering an accurate and unbiased PSD baseline for optimum sizes, maximising crusher performance and reducing scalp yield.\n\nFRAGTrack Crusher has been adopted by Drury Quarry to reduce overall cost per ton of aggregate, provide critical data for specific Drill and Blast optimisation, and help reduce carbon footprint as the demand for aggregate production in the region continues to rise.\n\n|",

In FY2022, our focus was on continuing the progress made against our people strategy, amidst the ongoing global disruption caused by geopolitical events and the COVID-19 pandemic. This was compounded by shifting employee expectations, a highly competitive talent market and our ongoing work to mitigate inflationary pressures. Safeguarding the health, safety and well-being of our people, ensuring our team are resilient and adaptable, and that we have the right team in the right place at the right time, remains our priority despite the challenges faced.\n\nSeveral key initiatives have focused on strengthening the quality and diversity of our internal talent pipeline. This includes our flagship Frontline Leadership Development program, Enterprise Executive Mentoring program and targeted regional and functional initiatives to support the delivery of our global people strategy.\n\n## EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT: GAINING EMPLOYEE INSIGHTS THROUGH ORGANISATIONAL/hyphen.case WIDE LISTENING\n\nIn FY2022 our global culture and engagement survey, 'Our Say', was deployed across the organisation, with a participation rate of 65 per cent. Despite internal and external pressures, the results showed our people are engaged, energised and enabled with a score of 88 per cent outperforming global industry benchmarks. Safety results continue to be an area of key strength, demonstrating that our people feel safe coming to work every day.\n\nOverall, the results were similar to the results of our 2019 Organisational Health survey.\n\n- -  Our people are proud to be associated with Orica (92 per cent), and willing to recommend Orica as a great place to work (85 per cent).\n- -  Our frontline workforce is one of the most engaged groups, leading the way with motivation, satisfaction and intent to stay. In comparison, our senior leaders and middle managers remain engaged but scored lower across the overall engagement category (82 per cent).\n- -  The categories of role clarity and development (76 per cent) and work environment and well-being (80 per cent) were among the lowest scoring.\n\nThe feedback received from the 'Our Say' survey has shaped three global programs of work:\n\n- -  leadership and career development;\n- -  recognition and reward program; and\n- -  new ways of working.\n\nWe have moved away from a 'one size fits all' action planning approach to a more personalised employee experience, recognising that engaging the workforce is a shared responsibility. Our regions and functions are empowered to take ownership of their own focus areas, each rolling back up to the enterprise plan, with progress and impact to be measured by ongoing pulse listening strategies throughout FY2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nENGAGEMENT\n\n## REFINING AND REFOCUSING OUR PEOPLE PRIORITIES\n\nTo align with the results of the 'Our Say' survey, our people strategy was refreshed with a renewed focus on attraction and retention. Four key priority pillars support an improved employee experience to help build the distinctive capabilities we need to deliver on our business imperatives.\n\n- -Engaging our people and enhancing a performance culture : Empowering our people to achieve their potential and fulfil their passion means a continued focus on a culture of empowerment, inclusive leadership and a clearly defined employee value proposition.\n- -  To strengthen the alignment between our values and culture, Our Code was revised in FY2022, strengthening our positions on modern slavery, sexual harassment and the protection of Indigenous cultural heritage sites. Our Code applies to anyone who works for us or on our behalf and sets out clear expectations for the way we work.\n- -Developing capabilities to drive our competitive advantage : Our targeted capability strategy continues to focus on developing and deploying leadership development programs which address the unique challenges faced by our management teams.\n\n:\n\n- -Talent and career management Career development will be supported through enterprise and regional mentoring programs, talent assessment and high performing teams. In addition to pro-actively sourcing, accelerated pathways for early and emerging talent will be enabled.\n- -Standardising and automating employee self-service : Digitizing the employee experience helps streamline, standardise and improve employee self-service, transform our workforce footprint and build the skills we need for the future.",

Our Diversity and Inclusion Policy outlines our continued vision, commitment and approach and is available in the Governance section of our website.\n\n## Inclusion index\n\nIn FY2022, an Inclusion Index measuring our people's sense of opportunity, belonging and impartiality was introduced. Overall, our workforce has a positive outlook on inclusion (86 per cent) reflective of high-performing organisations. However, differences exist among self-reported demographics in selected areas of the business. Meaningful action at a local level remains the most impactful to driving change and ensuring all employees have confidence they can be their best selves at work.\n\n## Cultural diversity\n\nWith a global workforce across four regions, employees representing over 80 nationalities collaborate to deliver on Orica's immediate, medium and long-term goals.\n\nOur employees are led by a senior leadership team comprised of 16 different nationalities, helping to foster diversity of thought and a culture of innovation. A greater focus on global career mobility will enable more diverse teams and different perspectives to flourish in an inclusive environment.\n\n## Women in our workforce\n\nThe representation of women in our workforce, 18.6 per cent, is aligned to industry norms. The percentage of women in our senior leadership population marginally increased from 28.0 per cent in FY2021 to 28.9 per cent in FY2022, reflecting voluntary attrition in an extremely competitive talent market and a reduction in the senior leadership population (due to restructures and lateral movements).

We remain on track to meet our targets with net Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 14 per cent below 2019 base year levels.\n\nThis year, we increased our accountability for reducing operational Scope 2 GHG emissions by committing to source 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2040.\n\nWe have signed a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) securing renewable electricity from the Wellington North Solar Farm Australia which will supply around 50 per cent of Orica's Australian electricity needs from 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Wellington North solar farm case study on page 73\n\n## Global GHG emissions by source (Scope 1 and Scope 2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IMPACT OF GEOPOLITICS AND CONFLICT IN UKRAINE\n\nIn FY2022, the ongoing RussiaUkraine conflict disrupted global AN supply chains and trade conditions, impacting how we do business. Global demand for AN increased as commodity prices spiked while supply decreased due to trade sanctions imposed on Russia and rising energy prices curtailing European production. We responded by increasing manufacturing output to compensate for reduced purchase volumes and to ensure security of supply for our customers.\n\nThis has caused a shift in the distribution of our GHG emissions from Scope 3 (purchased AN) to Scope 1 and 2 (manufactured AN).\n\nMost notably, production volumes and emissions increased from our manufacturing facilities at Bontang, Indonesia and Yarwun, Australia. Both sites produced record product volumes this year. Yarwun is one of our higher product emissionsintensity continuous manufacturing plants. This reinforced our efforts to complete pre-feasibility for the Yarwun Nitrates Decarbonisation Project in 2023, which commenced in January 2022.\n\nNet Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions compared to FY2021 remained relatively stable despite increased AN production volumes through the continued implementation of our decarbonisation strategy.\n\nWe surrendered 60,000 ACCUs to meet our forecast compliance obligations at Yarwun, Australia under the Safeguard Mechanism.\n\n## Our FY2022 Climate Action Report\n\nprovides details on the eligible ACCUs surrendered this year and our approach to managing and accounting for carbon credits.\n\n## FUTURE/hyphen.caseFACING COMMODITIES FOR A LOWER/hyphen.caseCARBON ECONOMY\n\nThe mining, metals and raw material sectors are enabling the energy transition and decarbonisation technologies. Vast quantities of metals and minerals such as lithium, copper and rare earth elements are needed to drive the massive technological transition ahead. This represents a significant opportunity for the industry and Orica.\n\nWe continue to diversify our commodity exposure and position our portfolio towards higher growth commodities, including future-facing resources. We have a strong global presence in copper and are serving future-facing mines, particularly nickel and lithium in Australia.\n\nOur commodity mix reflects a diversified portfolio across coal and metals markets. Gold and copper markets remain the largest commodity exposure, collectively representing 46 per cent of FY2022 revenue with copper growing this year across all operating regions. Copper as a proportion of total revenue grew by 6 per cent in FY2022. Thermal coal revenue exposure was 16 per cent in FY2022.\n\nIn Latin America, the ongoing shift in the region's commodity exposure reflects strong recovery in copper customer demand and the large proportion of our customers' mining pipelines focused on futurefacing commodities.\n\nTo increase revenue exposure to the growing battery technology market, we advanced our partnership with Alpha HPA in Gladstone, Australia. We also established two new partnerships along the east coast of Australia, the Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub and H2-Hub \u2122 Gladstone, offering new product and market opportunities in green hydrogen and green ammonia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

Nitrous oxide currently accounts for 50 per cent of our operational emissions. Over the fiscal year, we invested $21 million in lowemissions technology and emissions reduction initiatives. This year, we realised NAP emission intensity reductions following the commissioning of tertiary catalyst abatement at one of two NAPs at Carseland, Canada.\n\nIn the first year of operation, the Carseland project reduced nitrous oxide emissions on one plant by 95 per cent from unabated levels, and reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity per tonne of AN produced by 46 per cent.\n\nImportant milestones were achieved towards the Kooragang Island Decarbonisation Project. Three tertiary abatement reactors were delivered in August 2022, with installation proceeding at NAP No. 1 in September 2022, and commissioning to occur during October and November 2022.",

In FY2022, we took several actions to improve our approach to managing environmental risks including adopting the MHM framework that underpins our safety approach. The framework defines key controls and ensures verification protocols are in place to systematically mitigate adverse environmental impacts.\n\nOur focus on spill prevention and response has seen a continued decline in loss of containment events across the business. In FY2022, we recorded 23 events equal to or greater than severity 1 2 against a target of 29. This was a decrease of 18 per cent compared to FY2021 and achieved our target of zero severity 3 2 or greater significant environmental events.\n\n## OPTIMISING RESOURCE USE\n\n## Water\n\nThe management of freshwater resources is an issue that directly impacts the communities and ecosystems in which we operate. With competition for water resources increasing globally due to multiple pressures, particularly climate change, population growth and pollution, we are increasing our focus on optimising our water use.\n\nWe are working towards reducing our dependency on potable water by increasing the efficiency with which we use water and maximising our use of recycled water, wherever possible. Our aim is to limit the impact on our host communities and ecosystems and increase resilience to water stress.\n\nGross water consumption fell one per cent to 8.5 million kL. While recycled water increased to a record 31 per cent of total consumption, potable water consumption also increased five per cent to 2.6 million kL. This was due to a 13 per cent decrease in water obtained from groundwater sources with the shortfall made up by surface and potable water sources.\n\nWe have changed our potable water intensity metric from kL per tonne of AN sold to kL per tonne of AN manufactured 1 . This will allow us to better track our progress as we seek to improve the water efficiency of our manufacturing processes. In FY2022, we used 1.72 kL per tonne of AN manufactured.\n\nWe achieved our existing potable water intensity target consuming 0.61 kL of water per tonne of AN sold against our target of <0.67 kL per tonne AN sold.\n\n## Potable water consumption and intensity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: material sites include Kooragang Island, Yarwun, Bontang, Carseland, Brownsburg and Congata only.\n\n## Gross water consumption by source (million kL)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Metric boundary covers our top 6 consuming manufacturing plants representing 96% of global potable water use.\n- (2)  Severity 1 events are minor, reversible environmental effects.

The Nitrate Risk Reduction framework is a three-pronged approach that investigates the fundamental mechanisms for nitrate loss at a customer site, benchmarks existing approaches to best practices, and recommends solutions to improve nitrate risk management.\n\nCentral to the Nitrate Risk Reduction Framework are our Fortis \u2122 Protect bulk explosives products, which were developed to minimise nitrate leaching arising from blasting operations. Using our emulsification technology, the products deliver optimal stability and emulsion refinement characteristics into blast holes and minimise nitrate contribution to groundwater and post-blast nitrate/nitrite fumes.\n\n## WASTE\n\nIn FY2022, we completed the sale of our Minova business which materially changed the volume and profile of our waste generation. Historic waste data has been restated to exclude Minova and allow for meaningful comparisons with current performance.\n\nTotal waste generated in FY2022 was 12.5 kt, down 19 per cent from FY2021.

Through this process, contaminants are either degraded into harmless substances or accumulated and removed when the plants are harvested. Phytoremediation can also be used to immobilise contaminants in the soil to the root zones and to control or reduce the flow of surface water and ground water.\n\nThree rounds of harvest have now been completed in Gomia with initial testing indicating good uptake of contaminants.

Enhanced in-situ bioremediation is an engineered technology that introduces physical, chemical and biological changes to the groundwater to create the conditions necessary for micro-organisms to degrade the cyanide. This is a novel approach to cyanide remediation requiring the installation of 13 injection wells with Waterloo Emitters \u2122 to act as a bio-barrier of enhanced biological activity stimulated by oxygen delivery to the groundwater.\n\nIn line with commitments made to the regulator, detailed design of the pilot trial was completed in April 2022 and the pilot plant was constructed and commenced operation in July 2022. At the completion of the six-month trial, the effectiveness of the technology will be evaluated and, based on cyanide concentrations in groundwater and associated risk at that time, consideration will be given to whether any ongoing remediation is required.\n\n## FY2023 priorities:\n\n- -  Commission tertiary catalyst abatement technology at Kooragang Island.\n- -  Reconsider final investment decision for Yarwun Nitrates Decarbonisation Project.\n- -  Advance commercial partnerships for green hydrogen and green ammonia technologies, and progress sourcing for future renewable electricity supply.\n- -  Develop water stewardship strategy and establish new potable water targets backed by planned actions.\n- -  Internal assessment to assess our biodiversity performance and disclosures and understand commitments we can make to support biodiversity and nature positive initiatives.",

The innovative program is designed to build skills and inspire women and girls to pursue careers in STEM. Students involved in the program have an opportunity to apply their training through internship programs at Orica. The program also includes training for 100 high school teachers in STEM topics.\n\n## Wonder of Science program, Australia\n\nOrica and GroundProbe have partnered with the Wonder of Science program to help teach STEM subjects to schools in regional Australia. The program is targeted at students aged nine to fifteen and connects problem-solving skills, critical, creative, collaborative and ethical thinking to real-world applications of STEM. The $300,000 investment is helping Orica build long-term partnerships with senior education providers, government and industry. By supporting the STEM program, we are also building a potential future workforce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NATURE AND BIODIVERSITY\n\n## Kottaberget, Sweden\n\nThrough the Fund, we partnered with BikeinBergslaen and Makr Konsult AB to create flowtrails for cyclists on Kottaberget mountain, located near our factory in Gyttorp, Sweden. The project launched in FY2021 and has generated approximately 450 metres of flowtrails. Together with funding from other financiers, Kottaberget has a 1.3 km downhill and uphill trail. The partnership has helped transform deforested land into a fun mountain biking trail, encouraging tourism and local economic development. In September 2022, a 'try on' event was held for our employees in Sweden to learn more about the trails.\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Birdlife's Woodland Birds for Biodiversity, Australia\n\nWe work with experts to study and protect animals and the natural environment. As birds are a key indicator to monitor biodiversity, and with the critically endangered Swift Parrot believed to number only 750 in the wild, we collaborated with Birdlife Australia and our Kurri teams to carry out surveys in the Kurri Kurri region, an area with historical sightings of the parrot.\n\nThe Kurri Kurri Technical Centre (KTC) adjoins some areas where Swift Parrots have been spotted and has some undisturbed habitat suitable for the birds. Identifying Swift Parrots in the area will help enhance conservation, protect high biodiversity value areas and encourage the recovery of the species. In collaboration with Birdlife Australia, our Kurri teams carried out surveys to track the birds during the migration season. The Research and Innovation team and other groups worked together across the site to develop planning and safety protocols and provide chaperoned access to surveyors. In July 2022, Birdlife surveyors identified seven Swift Parrots, equivalent to ~one per cent of Australia's Swift Parrot population, as well as two vulnerable Glossy-black Cockatoos.\n\nIn FY2023, we will continue to support Birdlife's Regent Honeyeaters and Swift Parrot surveys to collect crucial data on bird population, distribution and environmental trends. By tracking these birds, Birdlife Australia gains insights into how the environment is changing and how to support the local wildlife.",

While homecooked meals could not be provided under COVID-19 restrictions, the Graduate Sustainability Committee funded three pizza nights over three weeks with site management\n\ncontributing for desserts. The Kurri team also funded a pizza night every six weeks until they could resume providing meals in person. We are proud of the relationships we have built through this engagement and the positivity and relief our teams can bring to families during challenging periods.\n\n## SUPPLIERS\n\nThe strength of our global supply network is a key differentiator that allows us to be a trusted partner for our customers. As security of supply is critical to our customers' operations, we build strong supplier relationships to ensure we can continue to deliver. In FY2022, we procured products and services from 13,800 1 suppliers in over 45 countries around the world. Around 85 per cent of our third-party spend originated from 10 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Russia, Singapore and the United States of America). Of the remaining 15 per cent, the majority originated from 10 countries (Argentina, Ghana, India, Kazakhstan, Norway, the Philippines, Sweden, Tanzania, United Kingdom and Zambia).\n\nSuppliers are critical to our business. We seek to work with suppliers that share our commitment to excellence, are aligned to our values, committed to acting ethically and to improving their environmental and social impact. We strive to work collaboratively with these suppliers to meet sustainability challenges together and implement improvement plans where gaps or risks are identified.\n\n## Maintaining security of supply amid global challenges\n\nThe strength of our global manufacturing and supply network has been critical this year as we navigated difficult operating conditions. Geopolitical tensions and rising commodity prices have increased global demand for AN and constrained supply.\n\nWe leveraged established global relationships with nitrogen producers to negotiate and secure alternative supply. While some deals were short term, others have now been converted to long-term contracts. Through these measures, and by ramping up our own manufacturing capacity, we have maintained deliveries to our customers through this major disruption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate and the natural environment page 68\n\n## Responsible sourcing\n\nWe work with our suppliers to mitigate sustainability impacts and promote sustainable practices across our value chain. As part of our commitment to creating a more sustainable, inclusive and resilient value chain, we developed our first Responsible Sourcing Statement in FY2022. The Statement enhances the principles outlined in Our Code and details our expectations of suppliers on ethical business practices, human and labour rights, and social and environmental impacts.\n\n## Modern slavery in supply chain response\n\nWe have a responsibility to understand and address modern slavery risks in our supply chain as well as our operations.\n\nOur Supply Chain Modern Slavery Risk Management Plan (MS Risk Plan) details an identification and management process, training program and related tools which includes self-assessment questionnaires. In FY2022, we engaged more broadly, sending selfassessment questionnaires to 55 of our high-risk suppliers and building on our MS Risk Plan Pilot in FY2021. These questionnaires enable us to better understand the supplier's context and specific gaps or areas of risk within a supplier's operations and supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY2022 Modern Slavery Statement\n\n## Addressing Scope 3 emissions and working towards a decarbonised supply chain\n\nWe engage suppliers on decarbonisation to support our ambition to achieve net zero emission by 2050.\n\nAs new and emerging technologies scale and become commercial, we will partner with suppliers to source lower emissions intensity AN and ammonia products. The purchase of these products currently accounts for approximately two thirds of our total Scope 3 emissions.\n\nWe are engaging directly with our strategic suppliers to better understand their activities in managing emissions, identify pathways for future collaboration, and work together towards technological solutions for decarbonisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY2022 Climate Action Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

MCi has developed a scalable carbon capture technology that reacts waste CO2 with alkaline materials to produce carbonate products for use in construction, manufacturing and consumer markets. A demonstration plant is under construction at our Kooragang Island site in Australia, expected for completion in FY2024.\n\n## Reagent and offtake agreement\n\nOrica and Alpha HPA entered an agreement relating to the supply and offtake of reagents and process by-products at their adjacent facilities in Yarwun, Australia. This leverages process synergies that exist between the two companies. Alpha HPA's proprietary technology requires reagents manufactured by Orica, producing a waste by-product that is highly complementary to our existing processes at Yarwun.\n\n## Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub\n\nWe signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Origin Energy to conduct a feasibility study into the viability of a green hydrogen production facility and downstream value chain opportunities. The partnership will assess opportunities to collaborate on the development of a green hydrogen production facility and associated value chain in the Hunter Valley, Australia.\n\n## Kooragang Island Decarbonisation Project\n\nThis $37 million public-private partnership is installing nitrous oxide abatement technology at our Kooragang Island (KI) site in Australia. The project will reduce KI's emissions by close to 50 per cent and contribute to a government target to reduce NSW emissions by 50 per cent by 2030. The project is made possible through co-investment from the NSW Government and financing from the CEFC.\n\n## H2-Hub\u2122 Gladstone\n\nOrica has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with H2U - Hydrogen Utility \u00ae on a master plan study where both parties will explore opportunities for an exclusive domestic green ammonia offtake and supply agreement. The potential agreement would see green ammonia supplied directly to Orica's Yarwun manufacturing plant from H2U's proposed Yarwun green ammonia production plant in Australia.\n\n|",

The purchase price comprises $258/uni00A0million paid on completion and potential earn out payments of up to $90/uni00A0million based on the achievement of cumulative EBITDA generated from 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02022 to 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02024, and contingent on certain key management remaining employed by Orica during the earn-out period.

Where instances of non-compliance occur, Orica's procedures require that relevant governmental authorities are notified in accordance with statutory requirements and internal investigations are conducted to determine the cause of the non-compliance to ensure the risk of recurrence is minimised.\n\nThe Company has committed major investments, both in terms of capital and resources, to improve its environmental performance at key sites in addition to its general maintenance program. The Company is working closely and co-operatively with regulators and government agencies in relation to these initiatives, as well as enhancing community engagement and consultation.\n\nMore specific details about Orica's sustainability initiatives and performance, including safety, health and environment, can be found on the Orica website www.orica.com/sustainability.\n\n## INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS\n\nThe Company's Constitution requires the Company to indemnify any person who is, or has been, an officer of the Company, including the Directors, the Secretaries and other Executive officers, against liabilities incurred whilst acting in good faith as such officers to the extent permitted by law.\n\nIn accordance with the Company's Constitution, the Company has entered into a Deed of Access, Indemnity and Insurance with each of the Company's Directors and, in certain instances, specific indemnities have been provided. No Director or officer of the Company has received benefits under an indemnity from the Company during or since the end of the year.\n\nThe Company has paid a premium in respect of a contract insuring officers of the Company and of its controlled entities, against a liability for costs and expenses incurred by them in defending civil or criminal proceedings involving them as such officers, with some exceptions. The insurance contract prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium paid.\n\n## NON/hyphen.caseAUDIT SERVICES\n\nDuring the year, KPMG, the Company's auditor, performed certain other services in addition to its audit responsibilities.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the year by the auditor is compatible with, and did not compromise, the auditor's independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:\n\n- -  all non-audit services were subject to the corporate governance procedures adopted by the Company and have been reviewed by the Board Audit and Risk Committee to ensure they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and\n- -  the non-audit services provided do not undermine the general principles relating to auditor's independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Including Independence Standards) , as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision-making capacity for the Company, acting as an advocate for the Company or jointly sharing risks and rewards.\n\nA copy of the lead auditor's independence declaration as required under Section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 is contained on page 124 of the Annual Report and forms part of this Directors' Report.\n\nDetails of the amounts paid to the auditor of the Company, KPMG, and its related practices for audit and non-audit services provided during the year are disclosed in note 21 to the Annual Report.\n\n|",

The dislocation of AN supply due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict required a decisive change, leading to a significant ramp up in production and expansion in our inventory levels to ensure we could maintain security of supply at all times for our customers.\n\nIt also led to the structured exit by Orica in mid-September 2022, of our operations in Russia with a sale of the business to local management. Our focus during this transition was on the well-being of our employees, engaging regulators to ensure compliance with sanctions, managing supply interruptions and ensuring the safe and secure supply of our products across our global network.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, management and our people delivered financial outcomes that well exceeded the set targets. At the same time, we also strengthened our key customer relationships by ensuring continuity of product supply, and increasing our production and inventory levels, within a disrupted market. These achievements were enabled by the strength and resilience of our global manufacturing footprint and supply network, together with the efforts of\n\nour Executives and all employees who adapted as needed and worked collectively across regions and functions to deliver strong performance outcomes for the Group.\n\nSignificant strides were also made in the execution of our refreshed corporate strategy which was designed and rolled-out at the start of FY2022 to ensure a long-term sustainable future for the business. Key milestones included the introduction of new products and services as part of the continued evolution of our industry leading suite of blasting technology and solutions; increasing our exposure to future-facing commodities and emerging growth areas; and the successful operation of emissions abatement technology at Carseland as just one of many positive steps taken during FY2022 to meet our sustainability commitments (refer to page 68 of the Annual Report for further detail).\n\nTragically, we are reporting two fatalities this year, one relating to an incident at a customer site in remote far east Russia that occurred during the transition of the Russian business and an event in 2021 at a site in Kazakhstan. Our focus has been on ensuring that we learn from these events and make improvements where we can, to ensure our people return home safely. It is also important to us that all Executives are accountable for safety, so the Board, supported by management agreed there should be a downward adjustment to all Executives' FY2022 STI outcomes.\n\n## FY2022 Short-Term Incentive\n\nLast year, the Board exercised its discretion to zero out STI payments to the CEO and all other Executives (despite a positive scorecard outcome for some metrics) to align with the shareholder experience. Given the strength of our performance this year, it is pleasing to report that the outcomes in relation to our two key financial metrics, EBIT and RONA, were well above set targets. To/uni00A0drive those outcomes, management, with the support of the Board, made two key decisions. First, to rapidly increase production at our Yarwun and Bontang manufacturing sites and second, to significantly increase our levels of inventory. These two decisions enabled us to offset the supply impact of\n\nrestrictions on the sale of Russian AN and ensure security of supply to our customers. Without the need to hold significantly higher AN inventory from December 2021 onwards, our Cash Generation Efficiency (CGE) outcome would have been well ahead of target. Similarly, without increasing production, we would have exceeded our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction target.\n\nAs our CGE metric outcome changed as a direct result of the Board endorsed inventory decision, the Board has exercised its discretion to calculate CGE after removing the impact of higher AN inventory volumes that were held as a result of the disruption in Russian AN supply from December 2021. While our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction metric outcome was impacted by the same exogenous factors and Board endorsed decision to increase production, the Board, with the support of management, chose not to adjust this outcome as we wanted to demonstrate our strong commitment to our sustainability objectives so early on in our journey.\n\nAs safety is core to who we are and what we do, there will be a downward adjustment of 10% of total STI for all Executives in acknowledgment of the two fatalities. This will result in the CEO's final STI being 124.4% of his target opportunity (82.9% of maximum). Outcomes for other Executives were mixed, reflecting individual performance throughout the year. STI scorecard outcomes and commentary are provided in Section 3.2 of this report.\n\n## FY2019-21 Long-Term Incentive\n\nThe FY2019-21 LTI award (with a performance period from 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02018 to 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02021) did not vest following testing in November 2021, with average RONA performance under the required threshold due to a COVID-19-impacted FY2020 and FY2021 EBIT that was well below our expectations. Vesting outcomes under the FY2020-22 LTI award will be determined following the release of FY2022 full-year results; however, with a three-year average RONA target from 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02019 to 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02022, no vesting is anticipated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## REMUNERATION REPORT /parenleft.caseCONTINUED/parenright.case\n\n## EXECUTIVE KMP CHANGES DURING FY2022\n\nFollowing a strategic review of Orica's operating model, a decision was made to regionalise the business units from 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02021, with stronger accountability for regional P&L ownership, customers and continuous manufacturing, where applicable. At the same time, strategy development and resource allocation were centralised to improve the efficiency and consistency of operations across the regions. As part of this change, there was a centralisation of decision-making authority such that significant Group-wide commercial decisions are now made primarily by the CEO alongside the relevant functional Group Executive. Effective 1/uni00A0July/uni00A02022, Leah Barlow also took on full accountability for Group Safety, Health Environment and Security (SHES), and as a result was promoted to President SHES, Discrete Manufacturing & Supply. The outcome of these operational and role movements is a change in our key management personnel (KMP) for FY2022 to include the CEO, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer and from her promotion, the President - SHES, Discrete Manufacturing & Supply.\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD TO FY2023\n\nAs noted in the FY2021 Remuneration Report, several changes were made to the Executive STI and LTI plan designs for FY2022 including a reduction in both the STI maximum opportunity and LTI grant for the CEO, the introduction of a Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction metric in the FY2022 STI and relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR) as a second metric within the LTI.\n\nFollowing the Board's annual review of executive incentives, a decision was made to focus on embedding the operational and remuneration changes made in FY2022. The existing executive remuneration structure will therefore be retained for FY2023.\n\nWe are however, in the midst of an extremely challenging global talent market, with skills shortages across the globe. With over 12,000 employees in over 45 countries, including Executives based in each of our key regions, Orica is not immune to this challenge. Alongside empowering our people and providing them with opportunities to fulfill their potential and shape Orica's future, we therefore need to ensure our remuneration arrangements continue to attract, retain and motivate the talent we need. During FY2023, the Board intends to commence a full review of the Executive remuneration framework to test whether it remains appropriate in supporting our long-term objectives under the refreshed strategy and delivers outcomes aligned with shareholder returns, whilst also ensuring we are rewarding people competitively As in prior years, we welcome feedback from our shareholders as we undertake this review.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaxine Brenner\n\nChairman, Human Resources and Compensation Committee",

At the same time, the CEO's minimum shareholding requirement was also increased from 100% to 150% of FAR and the time period allowed to reach this holding reduced from six to five years from appointment.\n\nThe fixed equity component of Mr Gandhi's FY2022 FAR was again equal to 17.6% of his total FAR, granted in the form of restricted rights which vest monthly in alignment with the payment of fixed cash. The allocation value for the FY2022 Fixed Equity grant made in December 2021 was based on the five-day VWAP following FY2021 full-year financial results, consistent with the FY2022-24 LTI plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVested Rights are exercisable for a five-year period from grant, with the underlying shares subject to a holding lock until the CEO exceeds his minimum shareholding requirement, except where the sale of shares is required to meet tax obligations.\n\nFurther information on the CEO's fixed equity is detailed in Section 3.1.\n\n## 2.3  When is remuneration earned and received?\n\nRemuneration is structured to reward Executives progressively across different timeframes with an emphasis on alignment with shareholders through extended holding locks and a five-year effective holding period. The diagram below illustrates the period over which FY2022 remuneration is earned and delivered, and when holding locks are lifted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n105",

The focus of this review will be to ensure the appropriateness of the framework in supporting our strategic objectives, delivering outcomes aligned with long-term shareholder returns, and supporting with the motivation and retention of our critical talent. A/uni00A0consultation process will occur with shareholders as we progress with the review.",

Key drivers of performance within each STI scorecard component are outlined below.\n\nSafety continues to be our most important priority and while we saw an improvement in Group and Regional SICR throughout the year. Tragically in FY2022, we are reporting two fatalities, one relating to an incident at a customer site in far-east Russia and the other, an event in 2021 at a site in Kazakhstan. Detailed investigations into both incidents have been conducted with learnings implemented across the business including reinforcement of the critical safety measures in place to keep our people, customers and communities safe. In determining overall STI outcomes, the Board considered the impact of these fatalities, and with the support of management has exercised its discretion to reduce the STI outcomes for all Executives by 10%. This adjustment reflects Orica's long-held view that all Executives have a responsibility to ensure our people return home safely.\n\nIn relation to Loss of Containment, we are pleased that both the number and time to resolve spills have improved, with the majority of events attracting a Severity 0 classification (the lowest severity rating). Strong progress has also been made towards our stated greenhouse gas emissions target of at least a 40% reduction in net Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions by 2030, with tertiary abatement technology successfully operating at Carseland and installation of this technology expected to begin at Kooragang Island early into FY2023. However, during FY2022, the Board endorsed decision to rapidly increase production at our Yarwun and Bontang manufacturing sites to offset the impact of restrictions on the sale of Russian AN resulted in a below target Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction metric outcome. Despite this outcome being the result of external factors and the Board endorsed production decision, no adjustment has been made by the Board, reinforcing our strong commitment to our sustainability targets so early in our journey.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of global uncertainty, extensive supply chain disruption and high inflation, the business delivered improved financial results across all regions, with Group EBIT and RONA well above stretch targets set by the Board. Our financial performance reflects solid volume growth, a greater demand for premium products across the regions and improved commercial discipline in both customer and supply contracts. In response to changing external conditions and in accordance with a Board endorsed decision to maintain higher levels of inventory from December 2021 to ensure security of supply to our customers, trade working capital was higher than originally planned. Given this, the Board considered it appropriate to exercise its discretion to calculate CGE after removing the impact of higher AN inventory volumes that were held as a result of the disruption in Russian AN supply from December 2021.\n\nThe CEO's FY2022 STI outcome was 82.9% of his maximum STI opportunity. Outcomes against each STI scorecard metric are summarised below.\n\n2022 performance\n\n|                                                     |

The current face value (and the estimate of the maximum possible total value) of LTI Plan awards granted during FY2022 that are yet to vest, can be determined by multiplying the number of awards shown in Section 6.2 by the current share price of the Company. The minimum possible total value of the awards is nil. The actual value that may ultimately be received by Executives cannot be determined as it is dependent on and therefore fluctuates with movements in the Company's share price.\n\n| Plan   | Grant   | Performance period   | Performance measures  applicable to award   | Outcome        |\n|--------|---------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| LTIP   | FY2019  | FY2019 - FY2021      | RONA (100%)                                 | No vesting     |\n| LTIP   | FY2020  | FY2020 - FY2022      | RONA (100%)                                 | Not yet tested |\n| LTIP   | FY2021  | FY2021 - FY2023      | RONA (100%)                                 | Not yet tested |\n| LTIP   | FY2022  | FY2022 - FY2024      | RONA (50%), rTSR (50%)                      | Not yet tested |\n\nThe FY2019 grant was tested in November 2021 but did not vest as the three-year average RONA was below the required threshold. In determining the average RONA outcome, the Board applied discretion to adjust EBIT and Net Operating Assets (being the inputs used to calculate RONA) to remove the acquisition year impact of the Exsa (FY2020) transaction, and the impact of the IRFS-16 leasing standards and recent SaaS accounting changes. Net Operating Assets was also adjusted to ensure management were not advantaged from impairments to IT and other assets, the write down of defective assets at Burrup and other business impairments that occurred during FY2021. Overall, management were neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the adjustments made and they did not change the vesting outcome.\n\n|                       | Final outcome   | Vesting position         | % Rights vesting   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| RONA (3-year average) | 10.7%           | Below threshold of 13.7% | 0%                 |",

REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE\n\n## 5.1  Responsibility for setting remuneration\n\nThe HR&CC (the Committee) is delegated responsibility by the Board for reviewing and making recommendations on our remuneration policies, including policies governing the remuneration of Executives.\n\nActivities of the Committee are governed by its Terms of Reference, which is available on our website at www.orica.com. Among other responsibilities, the Committee assists the Board in its oversight of:\n\n- -  remuneration policy for Executives\n- -  level and structure of remuneration for Senior Executives, including STI and LTI plans\n- -  the Company's compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in respect of remuneration matters; and\n- -  approval of the allocation of shares and awards under Orica's equity programs.\n\n## 5.2  Use of remuneration advisors during the year\n\nNo remuneration recommendations were received from remuneration advisors as defined under the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## 5.3  Securities dealing policy and Malus\n\n## Securities dealing\n\nAll Executives are required to comply with our Securities' Dealing Policy at all times and in respect of all Orica shares held, including any defined employee share plans. Trading is subject to pre-clearance and is not permitted during designated blackout periods unless there are exceptional circumstances. Executives are prohibited from using any Orica shares as collateral in any margin loan or derivative arrangement.\n\n## Malus\n\nOrica's Malus Standard allows the Board to require any Executive to forfeit in full or in part, any unvested LTIP or deferred STI award as a result of:\n\n- -  a material misstatement in financial results\n- -  behaviour that brings Orica into disrepute or has the potential to do so\n- -  serious misconduct\n- -  any other circumstance, which the Board has determined in good faith.\n\nIn considering whether any adjustment is necessary in respect of any or all participants, the Board may take into account the individual's level of responsibility, accountability or influence over the action or inaction, the quantum of the actual loss or damage, any impact on our financial soundness or reputational standing, the extent to which any internal policies, external regulations and/ or risk management requirements were breached, and any other relevant matters.",

The requirement is 150% of FAR over five years from appointment for the CEO and 50% of FAR over six years from appointment (by 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02022 for individuals in their Executive role prior to introduction of the guideline) for other Executives.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors\n\nTo create alignment between Directors and shareholders, Directors are required to hold (or have a benefit in) shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least one year's base fees. Such holdings must be acquired over a reasonable time using personal funds.\n\nThe table below sets out the number of shares held directly and indirectly by Directors and Executive KMP employed as at 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02022:\n\nDate Minimum\n\n|                    | Balance at  1/uni00A0October  2021   | Acquired (1)   | Disposed   | Balance at  30/uni00A0September  2022   | Minimum  Shareholding  Required (2)   | Shareholding  Required to be  met (3)   |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Executive KMP      |                                      |                |            |                                         |                                       |                                         |\n| Sanjeev Gandhi (4) | 40,735                               | 36,836         | -          | 77,571                                  | 192,890                               | 31/uni00A0March/uni00A02026             |\n| Christopher Davis  | 44,506                               | 11,695         | -          | 56,201                                  | 35,930                                | 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02024         |\n| Angus Melbourne    | 55,896                               | 6,395          | -          | 62,291                                  | 34,788                                | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02022          |\n| Leah Barlow (5)    | 3,810                                | -              | -          | 3,810                                   | 28,366                                | 31/uni00A0March/uni00A02027             |\n| Directors          |                                      |                |            |                                         |                                       |                                         |\n| Malcolm Broomhead  | 37,984                               | 1,963          | -          | 39,847                                  | 38,578                                |                                         |\n| John Beevers       | 14,800                               | -              | -          | 14,800                                  | 13,389                                |                                         |\n| Maxine Brenner     | 9,539                                | -              | -          | 9,539                                   | 13,389                                |                                         |\n| Boon Swan Foo      | -                                    | 16,000         | -          | 16,000                                  | 13,389                                |                                         |\n| Denise Gibson      | 13,000                               | -              | -          | 13,000                                  | 13,389                                |                                         |\n| Karen Moses        | 11,000                               | 3,348          | -          | 14,348                                  | 13,389                                |                                         |\n| Gordon Naylor (5)  | -                                    | 11,500         | -          | 11,500                                  | 13,389                                |                                         |\n| Gene Tilbrook      | 14,070                               | 1,963          | -          | 16,033                                  | 13,389                                |                                         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Where appropriate, comparative information has been reclassified to conform to changes in presentation and to enhance comparability.\n\nDisclosure may be considered material and relevant if the dollar amount is significant due to size or nature, or the information is important to understand the:\n\n- -  Group's current year results;\n- -  impact of significant changes in Orica's business; or\n- -  aspects of the Group's operations that are important to future performance.\n\nExcept as described in note 24, the financial statements have been prepared using consistent accounting policies in line with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period.\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to the overall financial statements\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\n## Functional and Presentation Currency\n\nThe Company's functional and presentation currency is Australian dollars. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.\n\n## Transactions and Balances\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or entity concerned are recorded using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies at the balance date are retranslated at closing exchange rates. Non-monetary assets are not retranslated unless they are carried at fair value. Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are included in the income statement, except where the application of hedge accounting requires inclusion in other comprehensive income (refer to note 10).\n\n## Consolidation of Group Entities\n\nOn consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars at the closing rate at balance date. The results of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars at average exchange rates for the period where these do not materially differ from rates applicable on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign operations are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nApplication of the Group accounting policies requires management to make judgements, and to apply estimates and assumptions to future events. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and which are material to the report, are highlighted in the following notes:\n\nNote 3 Net debt and net financing costs\n\nNote 5\n\nWorking capital\n\nNote 6\n\nProvisions\n\nNote 7\n\nProperty, plant and equipment\n\nNote 8\n\nIntangible assets\n\nNote 9\n\nImpairment testing of assets\n\nNote 11  Taxation\n\nNote 19  Defined benefit obligations\n\nNote 20  Contingent liabilities",

If the consideration includes a variable amount (net of trade discounts and volume rebates), the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled. The majority of the Group's operations are conducted under Master Service Agreements which require customers to place orders for goods or services on a periodic basis. The performance obligations are identified at the point that the customer places the order.\n\n## Supply of products and provision of services\n\nRevenue is derived from contractual agreements for either:\n\n- -  the supply of products; or\n- -  the supply of products and the provision of services.\n\nContracts for the supply of products are one performance obligation; and contracts for the supply of products and services include one or two separate performance obligations depending on whether the customer can benefit from the products independently of the services.\n\nProduct revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered to the contracted point of delivery as this is the point at which the customer gains control of the product and the performance obligation is satisfied by the Group.\n\nService revenue is recognised over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Group's performance. Where products and services are combined into one single performance obligation, revenue is recognised over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance.\n\n## Contracts to provide a designated output\n\nThe provision of goods and services in contracts that provide a designated quantity of output results in the identification of a single performance obligation to deliver an integrated service to the customer. Revenue from this performance obligation is recognised over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Group's performance.",

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nOrica's objectives when managing capital (net debt and total equity) are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and to ensure that the capital structure enhances, protects and balances financial flexibility against minimising the cost of capital. This section outlines the principal capital management initiatives that have been undertaken, current year drivers of the Group's cash flows, as well as the key operating assets used and liabilities incurred to support financial performance.\n\n## 3.  NET DEBT AND NET FINANCING COSTS\n\nIn order to maintain an appropriate capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, utilise a dividend reinvestment plan, return capital to shareholders such as a share buy-back or issue new equity, in addition to incurring an appropriate level of borrowings. Currently, Orica maintains a dividend payout ratio policy and expects the total payout ratio to be in the range of 40%-70% of underlying earnings. It is also expected that the total dividend paid each year will be weighted towards the final dividend.\n\nOrica monitors debt capacity against a number of key credit metrics aligned to debt covenants, principally the gearing ratio (net debt excluding lease liabilities divided by net debt excluding lease liabilities plus equity) and the interest cover ratio (EBIT excluding individually significant items, divided by net financing costs excluding lease interest). These ratios, together with performance measure criteria determined by Standard & Poor's, are targeted in support of the maintenance of an investment grade credit rating, which enables access to borrowings from a range of sources. Standard & Poor's key measures include Funds from Operations (FFO)/Debt and Debt/EBITDA. Of note, Standard & Poor's rating methodology adjusts Orica's net debt to incorporate post-retirement benefit obligations, asset retirement obligations (i.e. environmental and decommissioning provisions) and leases. Orica's debt covenants are exclusive of these items.\n\nThe Group's current target for gearing is 30%-40% and interest cover is 5 times or greater. Ratios may move outside of these target ranges for relatively short periods of time after major acquisitions or other significant transactions.\n\nIn addition, the gearing and interest cover ratios are monitored to ensure an adequate buffer against covenant levels applicable to the various financing facilities.\n\n|                                                                                                     | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                                                                     | 2022   $m      | 2021   $m      |\n| The gearing ratio is calculated as follows:                                                         |                |                |\n| Interest bearing liabilities excluding lease liabilities - continuing operations (refer to note 3a) | 2,167.5        | 2,072.4        |\n| Interest bearing liabilities excluding lease liabilities - held-for-sale                            | -              | 0.3            |\n| less cash and cash equivalents - continuing operations                                              | (1,255.3)      | (551.0)        |\n| less cash and cash equivalents - held-for-sale                                                      | -              | (42.7)         |\n| Total net debt                                                                                      | 912.2          | 1,479.0        |\n| Total equity                                                                                        | 3,729.2        | 2,792.4        |\n| Total net debt and equity                                                                           | 4,641.4        | 4,271.4        |\n| Gearing ratio (%)                                                                                   | 19.7%          | 34.6%          |\n| The interest ratio is calculated as follows:                                                        |                |                |\n| EBIT (excluding individually significant items - refer to note 1b)                                  | 578.5          | 426.6          |\n| Net financing costs excluding lease interest (note 3b)                                              | 88.5           | 93.3           |\n| Interest cover ratio (times)                                                                        | 6.5            | 4.6            |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the liabilities on an effective interest basis, unless they are liabilities designated in a fair value relationship in which case they continue to be measured at fair value (refer to note 10).\n\n## Financing costs\n\nBorrowing costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate to qualifying assets where interest on funds are capitalised. Interest income and interest expense relating to interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps are presented on a net basis.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nThe Group recognises all lease liabilities and corresponding right of use assets, with the exception of short-term (12 months or less) and low-value leases, on the balance sheet. Lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of fixed payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, amounts payable under residual value guarantees and extension options expected to be exercised. Where a lease contains an extension option which the Group can exercise without negotiation, lease payments for the extension period are included in the liability if the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from the liability. Lease payments are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee unless the rate implicit in the lease can be readily determined.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

NET DEBT AND NET FINANCING COSTS /parenleft.caseCONTINUED/parenright.case\n\nLease liabilities are remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate, or a change in the assessed lease term. A corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right of use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount has been reduced to zero.\n\nThe Group applied judgement to determine the incremental borrowing rates as well as the lease term for some lease contracts that include extension or termination options. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right of use assets recognised.\n\nThe Group recognises depreciation of the right of use assets and interest on the lease liabilities in the income statement over the lease term. Repayments of lease liabilities are separated into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and interest portion (presented within operating activities) in the cash flow statement.\n\nExpenses relating to short-term and low-value leases of $53.8/uni00A0million (2021 $38.2/uni00A0million) and variable lease payments not included in lease liabilities of $132.2/uni00A0million (2021 $98.8/uni00A0million) have been recognised in the income statement. Total cash outflow for leases was $259.3/uni00A0million (2021 $210.1/uni00A0million).\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\n- -  Determination of the discount rate to use; and\n- -  Determination of whether it is reasonably certain that an extension or termination option will be exercised.\n\n## 4.

Cost is based on a first-in first-out or weighted average basis. For manufactured goods, cost includes direct material and fixed overheads based on normal operating capacity. Inventories have been shown net of provision for impairment of $51.1/uni00A0million (2021 $38.3/uni00A0million).\n\n## (ii)  Trade receivables\n\nThe ageing of trade receivables and allowance for impairment is detailed below:\n\n|                        | Consolidated      | Consolidated         | Consolidated      | Consolidated         |\n|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n|                        | 2022   Gross   $m | 2022  Allowance   $m | 2021   Gross   $m | 2021  Allowance   $m |\n| Not past due           | 851.8             | -                    | 611.9             | -                    |\n| Past due 0 - 30 days   | 52.0              | (0.7)                | 65.6              | -                    |\n| Past due 31 - 120 days | 20.4              | (20.4)               | 20.6              | (19.9)               |\n| Past 120 days          | 43.1              | (43.1)               | 48.7              | (48.7)               |\n|                        | 967.3             | (64.2)               | 746.8             | (68.6)               |",

WORKING CAPITAL /parenleft.caseCONTINUED/parenright.case\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nThe collectability of trade and other receivables is assessed continuously, specific allowances are made for any doubtful trade and other receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts at year end. The expected impairment loss calculation for trade receivables considers both quantitative information from historic credit losses as well as qualitative information on different customer/debtor profiles and segments. The net carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values. A risk assessment process is used for all accounts, with a stop credit process in place for most long overdue accounts.\n\n## (iii)  Trade payables\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nTrade and other payables are recognised when the Group is required to make future payments as a result of the purchase of goods or as services provided prior to the end of the reporting period. The carrying amount of trade payables approximates their fair values due to their short-term nature.\n\n## (b)  Non-trade working capital\n\nNon-trade working capital includes all other receivables and payables not related to the purchase of goods and is recognised net of provisions for impairment of $18.5/uni00A0million (2021 $28.0/uni00A0million).\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nIn the course of normal trading activities, management uses its judgement in establishing the carrying value of various elements of working capital - principally inventory and accounts receivable. Provisions are established for obsolete or slow moving inventories. Actual expenses in future periods may be different from the provisions established and any such differences would impact future earnings of the Group.\n\n## 6.

The present value of the estimated costs of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site on which it is located are recognised as a depreciable asset with a corresponding provision being raised where a legal or constructive obligation exists.\n\nAt each reporting date, the liability is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates, timing and estimated cash flows. Any changes in the liability are added to or deducted from the related asset, other than the unwinding of the discount which is recognised as a finance cost.\n\n## Environmental\n\nAs a result of historical and current operations, certain sites owned or used by the Group will require future remediation activities to address environmental contamination. Estimated costs for the remediation of soil, groundwater and untreated waste are recognised as a provision when:\n\n- -  there is a present legal or constructive obligation to remediate;\n- -  a probable outflow of economic resources will occur to undertake the remediation; and\n- -  the associated costs can be reliably estimated.\n\nWhere future expenditure is expected to meet the recognition and measurement criteria of an asset (as described in Note 7), a provision is recognised only to the extent of the performance of the obligation (i.e. when costs are incurred by the Group).\n\nWhere the cost relates to the enhancement of land which is expected to be sold (e.g. where the Group no longer has ongoing operations), then the costs are assessed for recognition as an asset taking into consideration the nature and extent of the activities and also the expected sales proceeds compared to the sum of the current book value of the land and the estimated total costs. Any costs which result in the total carrying value exceeding the expected proceeds on sale are expensed.\n\nThe amount of each provision reflects the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle each respective obligation having regard to a range of potential scenarios, input from subject matter experts on appropriate remediation techniques and relevant technological advances.",

PROVISIONS /parenleft.caseCONTINUED/parenright.case\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\n## Environmental provisions for other sites\n\nJudgement is required in determining whether a constructive obligation to remediate environmental contamination exists. The Group considers that a constructive obligation exists where there is a current risk to human health or the environment arising from environmental contamination; or where an expectation has been established with a third party (including regulators, employees, neighbours or other stakeholders) that remediation activities will be undertaken.\n\nWhere an obligation (legal or constructive) exists, further judgement is necessary to determine the future expenditure required to settle the obligation. This is due to uncertainties in assumptions regarding the nature or extent of the contamination, the nature of the remedial solution deployed and its effectiveness, the application of relevant laws or regulations and the information available at certain locations where Orica no longer controls the site. Changes in these assumptions may impact future reported provisions. Subject to those factors and taking into consideration experience gained to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature, Orica considers that the provision balances are appropriate based on currently available information. Changes in the assumptions noted above may result in costs incurred in future periods being greater than or less than amounts provided.\n\nEnvironmental provisions are reviewed bi-annually taking into account any material changes to facts or circumstances which would be expected to impact the valuation of the provision.\n\n## Botany groundwater remediation\n\nOrica's historical operations at the Botany Industrial Park resulted in contamination of the soil and groundwater. Due to the complex nature of the chemicals involved and its distribution e.g. Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL), the lack of known practical remediation approaches and the unknown scale of the contamination, a practical solution to completely remediate the contamination has not been found. Orica continues to work in close cooperation with the New South Wales (NSW) Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) to address the contamination.\n\nOrica has a current obligation to contain and mitigate the effects of the contamination on the groundwater at the site. Orica and the NSW EPA entered into a Voluntary Management Proposal to contain groundwater contamination while an effective remediation approach to the DNAPL source contamination is identified (refer to contingent environmental liabilities section below).\n\nThe findings from the 2018 review of costs and operational duration of the Groundwater Treatment Plant (GTP) indicated that the cessation of groundwater extraction using the GTP is possible within an 18-year timeframe. After this period, Orica anticipates that the contamination levels will be materially below current levels and will be able to be managed through natural attenuation or less intensive technologies.\n\n## Contingent environmental liabilities\n\nIn addition to the obligations for which an environmental provision have been recognised, certain sites may require future remediation activities to address environmental contamination.\n\nWhere the criteria for recognition of a provision are not met, a contingent liability may exist in the following circumstances:\n\n- -  sites where known contamination exists but does not pose a current threat to human health or the environment and there is no current legal or regulatory requirement to remediate. Orica has a possible obligation for remediation which may be confirmed by future events and the likelihood of a future outflow of resources is not remote; or\n- -  sites where contamination is known or likely to exist and it is probable that a future outflow of resources will occur, however the impact cannot be reliably measured due to uncertainties related to the extent of Orica's remediation obligations or the remediation techniques that may be utilised.\n\nAny costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred. Information regarding each class of contingent liability is set out below.\n\n## Botany - remediation of source contamination\n\nSpecifically related to the remediation of DNAPL source contamination a reliable estimate of the costs to complete remediation is not possible given the lack of proven remediation techniques that can be effectively deployed at the site and uncertainty of the scale of the DNAPL contamination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

PROVISIONS /parenleft.caseCONTINUED/parenright.case\n\n## Other sites\n\nContingent liabilities exist with respect to a number of other sites owned or used by Orica where future remediation may be required and possible obligations exist. Orica's obligations with respect to these sites will be confirmed by future events and are subject to the following uncertainties regarding the amount and timing of future outflows:\n\n- -  Orica's future decisions regarding the use of the site including the timing of any changes to the current use;\n- -  the requirements of laws and regulations at an unknown future point in time and the outcome of discussions with regulators at that time;\n- -  the nature and extent of environmental remediation required at a future point in time; and\n- -  the availability and determination of solutions to address identified environmental issues and the cost and duration of the method selected.\n\nDepending on the outcome of these factors, Orica may be required to incur expenditure to prevent or remediate environmental contamination. Due to the uncertainties described above, it is not practicable to estimate the financial effect of the possible future outflows.\n\n## 7.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item and includes capitalised interest. Subsequent costs are capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nThe right of use asset at initial recognition reflects the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made before the commencement date plus any make good obligations and initial direct costs incurred (refer to note 3). The leases recognised by the Group under AASB/uni00A016 predominantly relate to property leases including offices and storage as well as plant & equipment leases including vehicles and rail cars.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Subsequent to initial recognition, development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Identifiable intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful life to the Group, being up to thirty years. Expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits of the specific asset to which it relates and which the Group controls (therefore excluding Software as a Service). All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nManagement reviews the appropriateness of useful lives of assets at least annually, any changes to useful lives may affect prospective amortisation rates and asset carry values.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ASSETS\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\n## Methodology\n\nFormal impairment tests are carried out annually for goodwill. In addition, formal impairment tests for all assets are performed when there is an indication of impairment. The Group conducts an internal review of asset values at each reporting period, which is used as a source of information to assess for any indications of impairment. External factors, such as changes in expected future prices, costs and other market factors, are also monitored to assess for indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount is calculated.\n\nIf the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired, and an impairment loss is charged to the income statement to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined using the higher of value in use or fair value less costs to dispose. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and its eventual disposal. Value in use is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group's continued use and does not consider future development. The value in use calculations use cash flow projections which do not exceed 5 years based on actual operating results and the operating budgets approved by the Board of Directors. Fair value less costs to dispose is the value that would be received in exchange for an asset in an orderly transaction.\n\nThe discount rates applied to the post-tax cash flows are derived using the weighted average cost of capital methodology. Adjustments to the rates are made for any risks that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows, including country risk. The terminal growth rate was determined based on management's estimate of the long-term compound annual EBIT growth rate.\n\nIn testing for indications of impairment and performing impairment calculations, assets are considered as collective groups and referred to as cash-generating units (CGU). Cash-generating units are the smallest identifiable group of assets, liabilities and associated goodwill that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets with each CGU being no larger than a segment. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. The test of goodwill and its impairment is undertaken at the segment level, except for the Pilbara CGU which contains the joint operation with Yara International ASA Group.\n\nAs part of the Group's ongoing integration of climate risk considerations into financial analysis and forward planning, we again incorporated the allocated capital to our decarbonisation activities into asset impairment testing, as forecasted capital expenditure and costs. These are the capital outflows required to meet the Group's commitment to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by at least 40% by 2030. Testing was informed by our strategic scenario analysis process but did not identify the requirement for adjustments to future cash flows at this time. As the Group continues to strengthen the integration of climate risk considerations into financial analysis and forward planning, financial implications stemming from climate change will continue to be considered and built into future cash flow assumptions.",

The total impairment charge is $32.7/uni00A0million of which $18.3/uni00A0million is attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\nAs at 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02022, there was a foreign currency translation reserve balance of $92.4/uni00A0million debit (of which $45.5/uni00A0million is attributable to non-controlling interests) which would be released on sale, liquidation, repayment of share capital or abandonment of the entity.\n\n## Russia\n\nThe escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and imposed sanctions and export restrictions, led to our decision to exit the Russian operations.\n\nOn 9/uni00A0September/uni00A02022, the Group executed a contract to sell JSC 'Orica CIS' Joint-Stock Company for cash consideration of $13.1/uni00A0million. Orica has risk adjusted the proceeds given the trade sanctions imposed on Russia.\n\nThe Group has recognised a gross impairment expense of $89.9/uni00A0million ($1.8/uni00A0million was booked as a debit to tax expense), reducing the value of the Russian business to nil. In addition, there was a loss on disposal of $40.6/uni00A0million ($9.3/uni00A0million was booked as a credit to tax expense), relating to the release of foreign currency translation reserve as required by Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ASSETS /parenleft.caseCONTINUED/parenright.case\n\n## EMEA\n\nDue to the issues outlined above impairment testing was performed on the EMEA region. The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculations are as follows:\n\n- -  no future cashflows for the Turkey or Russian businesses;\n- -  growth in post-tax cashflows for the region of $17.5/uni00A0million between FY23 and FY27;\n- -  a weighted average terminal growth rate in line with local country economic forecasts of 4.2%; and\n- -  a weighted average post-tax discount rate of 12.3%.\n\nThe present value of cashflows in EMEA no longer support the carrying value of goodwill. Therefore, the remaining balance of $45.3/uni00A0million has been impaired.\n\nAny variation in the key assumptions of the cash flows would result in a change in the assessed value in use. If the impact of the change had a negative impact, it could, in the absence of other factors require a further impairment of other assets.\n\n## LATAM\n\nBased on the latest projected cash flows of the Group, the carrying value of the Latin America segment is approximately equal to its value in use. The value in use calculations are sensitive to earnings forecasts, changes in discount rates and terminal growth rates.\n\nAny variation in the key assumptions of the cash flows would result in a change in the assessed value in use. If the impact of the change had a negative impact, it could, in the absence of other factors require an impairment of assets. The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculations are as follows:\n\n- -  growth in post-tax cashflows for the region of $33.4/uni00A0million between FY23 and FY27. This is reliant on achieving future growth in earnings primarily due to securing new or expanded contracts and delivery of value-added services;\n- -  a weighted average terminal growth rate in line with local country economic forecasts of 3.0%; and\n- -  a weighted average post-tax rate of 9.9%.\n\n## Pilbara\n\nBased on the latest projected cash flows of the Group, the carrying value Pilbara is approximately equal to its value in use. The value in use calculations are sensitive to earnings forecasts, changes in discount rates and terminal growth rates.\n\nAny variation in the key assumptions of the cash flows would result in a change in the assessed value in use. If the impact of the change had a negative impact, it could, in the absence of other factors require a further impairment to property, plant and equipment. The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculations are as follows:\n\n- -  growth in post-tax cashflows for the region of $16/uni00A0million between FY23 and FY27;\n- -  a weighted average terminal growth rate in line with local country economic forecasts of 2.6%; and\n- -  a weighted average post-tax rate of 8.8%.",

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ASSETS /parenleft.caseCONTINUED/parenright.case\n\n## 2021\n\n## Pilbara\n\nThe Group owns a 50% interest of Yara Pilbara Nitrates Pty Ltd (YPN), with the remaining shares being held by subsidiaries in the Yara International ASA group. YPN owns and operates a 330,000 tonnes per annum industrial grade technical ammonium nitrate plant on the Burrup Peninsula (Western Australia). For accounting purposes YPN is a joint operation and Orica recognises its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses in the consolidated financial statements along with goodwill related to the establishment of the joint operation and capitalised interest.\n\nThe Group's asset base in the Pilbara consists of the TAN plant, the equity accounted investee Orica Mining Services Pilbara Pty Ltd and the Pippingarra emulsion plant. Following a review of product movement and cashflows post the commissioning of the TAN plant on 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02020, management have concluded that the Pilbara is a separate CGU. The recoverable amount for the plant and other assets in the region is below their carrying value and therefore an impairment has been recognised against goodwill of $158.0/uni00A0million and property, plant and equipment of $159.6/uni00A0million.\n\nAny variation in the key assumptions of the cash flows would result in a change in the assessed value in use. If the impact of the change had a negative impact, it could, in the absence of other factors, require a further impairment to property, plant & equipment. The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculations are as follows:\n\n- -  EBIT growth of $24/uni00A0million within five years primarily due to volume and price growth;\n- -  a terminal growth rate of 1.2%; and\n- -  a post-tax discount rate of 8.1%.\n\n## EMEA\n\nEMEA has been severely impacted by COVID-19, with numerous sites suspending operations and customer project delays in the Nordics and Middle East. The latest forecasts project that recovery in the region will be slower than previously anticipated, particularly in Europe. As a result, the goodwill in the segment has been impaired by $162.4/uni00A0million.\n\nAny variation in the key assumptions of the cash flows would result in a change in the assessed value in use. If the impact of the change had a negative impact, it could, in the absence of other factors require a further impairment to goodwill. The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculations are as follows:\n\n- -  growth in EBIT to $79/uni00A0million within five years primarily due to easing of COVID-19 impacts, new technology and growth in Africa and the CIS;\n- -  a weighted average terminal growth rate in line with local country economic forecasts of 3.8%; and\n- -  a weighted average post-tax discount rate of 14.1%.\n\n## LATAM\n\nBased on the latest projected cash flows of the Group, the carrying value of the Latin America segment is approximately equal to its value in use. The value in use calculations are sensitive to earnings forecasts, changes in discount rates and terminal growth rates.\n\nAny variation in the key assumptions of the cash flows would result in a change in the assessed value in use. If the impact of the change had a negative impact, it could, in the absence of other factors require an impairment to goodwill. The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculations are as follows:\n\n- -  growth in EBIT to $87/uni00A0million within five years. This is reliant on achieving future growth in earnings primarily due to easing of COVID-19 impacts, securing new or expanded contracts and delivery of value added services;\n- -  a weighted average terminal growth rate in line with local country economic forecasts of 3.1%; and\n- -  a weighted average post-tax discount rate of 8.9%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS /parenleft.caseCONTINUED/parenright.case\n\nFor the year ended 30 September\n\n## SECTION D. MANAGING FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nOrica's Review of Operations and Financial Performance highlights funding and other treasury matters as material business risks that could adversely affect the achievement of future business performance.\n\nThis section discusses the principal market and other financial risks that the Group is exposed to and the risk management program, which seeks to mitigate these risks and reduce the volatility of Orica's financial performance.\n\n## 10.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Financial risk factors\n\nFinancial risk management is carried out centrally by the Group's treasury function under policies approved by the Board.\n\nThe Group's principal financial risks are associated with:\n\n- -  interest rate risk (note 10a);\n- -  foreign exchange risk (note 10b);\n- -  commodity price risk (note 10c);\n- -  credit risk (note 10d); and\n- -  liquidity risk (note 10e).\n\n## (a)  Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe Group is primarily exposed to interest rate risk on outstanding interest bearing liabilities. Non-derivative interest bearing assets are predominantly short-term liquid assets. Interest bearing liabilities issued at fixed rates expose the Group to a fair value interest rate risk while borrowings issued at a variable rate give rise to a cash flow interest rate risk.\n\nInterest rate risk on long-term interest bearing liabilities is managed by adjusting the ratio of fixed interest debt to variable interest debt. This is managed within policies determined by the Board via the use of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps. As at September 2022, fixed rate borrowings after the impact of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps were $1,413.9/uni00A0million (2021 $1,268.5/uni00A0million), representing a fixed/floating split of 65% and 35% respectively (2021 61% and 39%).\n\n## Interest rate sensitivity\n\nA 10% movement in interest rates without management intervention would have a $4.6/uni00A0million (2021 $4.1/uni00A0million) impact on profit before tax and a $3.2/uni00A0million (2021 $2.9/uni00A0million) impact on shareholders' equity.\n\n## (b)  Foreign exchange risk\n\n## (i)  Foreign exchange risk - transactional\n\nForeign exchange risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment, recognised asset, liability or cash flow will fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency rates.\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk due to foreign currency borrowings and sales and/or purchases denominated, either directly or indirectly, in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Group's subsidiaries.\n\nForeign exchange risk on foreign currency borrowings is managed using cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. As at September 2022, the notional balance of derivative contracts hedging foreign currency debt was $1,106.8/uni00A0million (2021 $1,003.4/uni00A0million).\n\nIn regard to foreign currency risk relating to sales and purchases, the Group may hedge up to 100% of committed exposures utilising a declining percentage over time methodology. Only exposures that can be forecast to a high probability are hedged. Transactions can be hedged for up to five years. The derivative instruments used for hedging purchase and sale exposures are bought vanilla option contracts and forward exchange contracts. Forward exchange contracts may be used only under Board policy for committed exposures and anticipated exposures expected to occur within 12 months. Bought vanilla option contracts may be used for all exposures. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are recognised at their fair value. At reporting date, Orica held foreign exchange contracts with a fair value gain of $8.3/uni00A0million (2021 fair value gain of $4.9/uni00A0million).",

Derivative contracts to hedge earnings exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting under Australian Accounting Standards. Board approved policy allows hedging of this exposure in order to reduce the volatility of full year earnings resulting from changes in exchange rates. At reporting date, Orica held no derivative contracts to hedge earnings exposures (2021 nil).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT /parenleft.caseCONTINUED/parenright.case\n\n## Net investment in foreign operations\n\nHedging of foreign investment exposures is undertaken primarily through originating debt in the functional currency of the foreign operation, or by raising debt in a different currency and swapping the debt to the currency of the foreign operation using derivative financial instruments. The remaining translation exposure is managed, where considered appropriate, using forward foreign exchange contracts, or cross currency interest rate swaps. As at reporting date, 28.9% of the Group's net investment in foreign operations was hedged (2021 37.0%).\n\n## (c)  Commodity price risk\n\nCommodity price risk refers to the risk that Orica's profit or loss or equity will fluctuate due to changes in commodity prices.\n\nNatural gas or ammonia are the primary feedstocks in Orica's production process. Orica manages its contract portfolio so that on a mass balance basis it seeks to maintain a low risk position across the contract cycle such that material input cost variations are passed through to customers in price variations through rise and fall adjustments contained in all significant contracts.\n\nThe Group may enter into derivative contracts to hedge commodity price risk that is not eliminated via contractual or other commercial arrangements. At reporting date, the fair value of commodity derivative contracts was nil (2021 nil).\n\n## (d)  Credit risk\n\nCredit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties failed to meet their obligations under a contract or arrangement. The Group is exposed to credit risk from trade and other receivables and financial instrument contracts.\n\nThe creditworthiness of customers is reviewed prior to granting credit, using trade references and credit reference agencies. Credit limits are established and monitored for each customer, and these limits represent the highest level of exposure that a customer can reach. Trade credit insurance is purchased when required.\n\nThe Group manages bank counterparty risk by ensuring that actual and potential exposure is monitored daily against counterparty credit limits, which have been assigned based on counterparty credit ratings. The Group does not hold any credit derivatives to offset its credit exposures.\n\nOrica's maximum exposure to credit risk as at 30/uni00A0September is the carrying amount, net of impairment, of the financial assets as detailed in the table below:\n\n| Financial assets            | 2022   $m   | 2021   $m   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents   | 1,255.3     | 593.7       |\n| Derivative assets           | 74.7        | 56.9        |\n| Trade and other receivables | 1,086.5     | 894.1       |\n| Total                       | 2,416.5     | 1,544.7     |\n\n## (e)  Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the possibility that there will be insufficient funds available to make payment as and when required.\n\nThe Group manages this risk via:\n\n- -  maintaining an adequate level of undrawn committed facilities in various currencies that can be drawn upon at short notice;\n- -  using instruments that are readily tradeable in the financial markets;\n- -  monitoring duration of long-term debt;\n- -  spreading, to the extent practicable, the maturity dates of long-term debt facilities; and\n- -  comprehensively analysing all forecast inflows and outflows that relate to financial assets and liabilities.",

The fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows using an appropriate market-based yield curve, which is independently derived and representative of Orica's cost of borrowings.\n\n|                                                       | 2022         | 2022             | 2021         | 2021             |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Derivative financial instruments                      | Current   $m | Non-Current   $m | Current   $m | Non-Current   $m |\n| Derivative assets                                     |              |                  |              |                  |\n| Designated as a hedge of interest bearing liabilities | 16.3         | 46.0             | -            | 48.9             |\n| Other                                                 | 12.4         | -                | 8.0          | -                |\n| Total                                                 | 28.7         | 46.0             | 8.0          | 48.9             |\n| Derivative liabilities                                |              |                  |              |                  |\n| Designated as a hedge of interest bearing liabilities | (3.6)        | (56.5)           | -            | (60.6)           |\n| Other                                                 | (4.2)        | -                | ( 5.1)       | -                |\n| Total                                                 | ( 7. 8)      | (56.5)           | (5.1)        | (60.6)           |\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost\n\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables (note 5), and trade and other payables (note 5) approximates their carrying amount due to their short maturity.\n\nInterest bearing liabilities excluding lease liabilities have a carrying amount of $2,167.5/uni00A0million (2021 $2,072.7/uni00A0million including discontinued operations).

Fair value of Private Placement debt is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yields having regard to timing of cash flows.\n\n## Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet where Orica currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. No financial assets or liabilities are currently held under netting arrangements.\n\nOrica has entered into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association ('ISDA') master agreements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting but allow for the related amounts to be set-off in certain circumstances, such as the event of default. As Orica does not presently have a legally enforceable right of set-off, derivatives are presented on a gross basis on the balance sheet.",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT /parenleft.caseCONTINUED/parenright.case\n\n## Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge its exposure to currency, interest rate and commodity price risk exposures arising from operational, financing and investing activities. Where applicable, these instruments are formally designated in hedge relationships as defined by AASB/uni00A09. To qualify for hedge accounting the Group formally designates and documents details of the hedge, risk management objective and strategy for entering into the arrangement and methodology used for measuring effectiveness.\n\nHedge accounting relationships are categorised according to the nature of the risks being hedged:\n\n| Hedge type           | Description                                                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fair value hedge     | Hedges the change in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities.                                                                                            |\n| Cash flow hedge      | Hedges the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with an asset,  liability or highly probable forecast transaction. |\n| Net investment hedge | Hedges the foreign currency translation exposure of the net assets of foreign operations.                                                                        |\n\nCritical terms of hedging instruments and hedged items are transacted to match on a 1:1 ratio by notional values. Matching critical terms enables economic offset thereafter to be determined qualitatively.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness arises primarily from the counterparties' and the Group's own credit risk which is included in the fair value of the derivative hedge instrument but not the hedge item. During the current and prior financial years, there was no material impact on profit or loss resulting from hedge ineffectiveness.\n\nAASB/uni00A09 also allows certain costs of hedging to be deferred in equity. Gains or losses associated with 'currency basis' cost of hedging are deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve as they are not material for separate disclosure. The amounts are systematically released to the income statement to align with the hedged exposure.\n\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is expected to be replaced by alternative risk-free rates (ARR) as part of inter-bank offer rate (IBOR) reform. IBOR reform impacts Orica's interest rate swaps, which reference 3-month US LIBOR. At 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02022, the notional value of hedging instruments that reference 3-month US LIBOR is US$150m and Orica has not transitioned any of its existing interest rate swaps to ARR's. Orica's interest rate swaps will only transition to ARR once US LIBOR publication ceases, which is anticipated to occur on 30/uni00A0June/uni00A02023.\n\n## Effects of hedge accounting on financial position and performance\n\n## Fair value and cash flow hedges\n\nThe table below shows the carrying amounts of the Group's Private Placement debt and the derivatives which are designated in fair value and/or cash flow hedge relationships to hedge them:\n\n- -  the carrying amount of the Private Placement debt includes foreign exchange remeasurements to year end rates and fair value adjustments when included in a fair value hedge;\n- -  the breakdown of the hedging derivatives includes remeasurement of foreign currency notional values at year end rates, fair value movements due to interest rate risk, foreign currency cash flows designated into cash flow hedges, costs of hedging recognised in other comprehensive income and ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement; and\n- -  hedged value represents the carrying amount of the Private Placement debt adjusted for the carrying amount of the designated derivatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n163",

TAXATION\n\nThis section outlines the taxes paid by Orica and the impact tax has on the financial statements.\n\nOrica has operations in more than 45 countries, with customers in more than 100 countries. In 2022, Orica paid $188.7/uni00A0million (2021 $227.2/uni00A0million) globally in corporate taxes and payroll taxes. Orica collected and remitted $200.1/uni00A0million (2021 $127.1/uni00A0million) globally in GST/VAT.\n\nAs Orica operates in a number of countries around the world, it is subject to local tax rules in each of those countries.

TAXATION /parenleft.caseCONTINUED/parenright.case\n\nDeferred tax balances are determined by calculating temporary differences based on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their amounts for taxation purposes. Where amounts are recognised directly in equity the corresponding tax impact is also recognised directly in equity.\n\nThe amount of deferred tax provided will be based on the expected manner of realisation of the asset or settlement of the liability, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at reporting date.\n\nA deferred tax asset will be recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets will be reduced to the extent it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\n## Tax consolidation\n\nOrica Limited is the parent entity in the tax consolidated group comprising all wholly-owned Australian entities.\n\nDue to the existence of a tax sharing agreement between the entities in the tax consolidated group, the parent entity recognises the tax effects of its own transactions and the current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from the subsidiary entities.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and jurisdictions where it has foreign operations and is subject to periodic challenges by local tax authorities on a range of tax matters during the normal course of business. These include transfer pricing, indirect taxes and transaction-related issues. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\n\nThe Group recognises liabilities for tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nIn addition, deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable profits are available to utilise those temporary differences and losses, and the tax losses continue to be available having regard to the nature and timing of their origination and compliance with the relevant tax legislation associated with their recoupment.\n\nAssumptions are also made about the application of income tax legislation. These assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty and there is a possibility that changes in circumstances or differences in opinions will alter outcomes which may impact the amount of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities recorded on the balance sheet and the amount of tax losses and timing differences not yet recognised. In these circumstances, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change, resulting in an impact on the earnings of the Group.\n\n## Contingent tax liabilities\n\nIn the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from tax investigations or legal proceedings. Where management are of the view that potential liabilities have a low probability of crystallising or it is not possible to quantify them reliably, they are not provided for and are disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nConsistent with other companies of the size and diversity of Orica, the Group is the subject of ongoing information requests, investigations and audit activities by tax and regulatory authorities in jurisdictions in which Orica operates. Orica co-operates fully with the tax and regulatory authorities. It is possible that Orica may incur fines and/or other penalties as a consequence of these investigations and audits.\n\n## (i)  Brazilian Tax Action\n\nThe Brazilian Taxation Authority (BTA) is claiming unpaid taxes, interest and penalties of approximately $29/uni00A0million for the 1997 financial year relating to an alleged understatement of income based on an audit of production records. Orica believes BTA has misinterpreted those production records and recently received a favourable decision from the Brazilian Civil Court in relation to an excise dispute based on the same factual matter. This decision should support the income tax dispute.\n\nICI plc, the vendor of the business to Orica, has been notified to preserve Orica's rights under the tax indemnity obtained upon acquisition of the business which provides indemnity for amounts exceeding certain limits. The BTA has been granted a bank guarantee of up to approximately $28/uni00A0million.",

GROUP STRUCTURE\n\nOrica has a diverse spread of global operations, which includes controlled entities incorporated in over 45 countries, as well as entering strategic partnering arrangements with certain third parties. This section highlights the Group structure including Orica's controlled entities, as well as those where Orica holds less than 100% interest.\n\n## 12.  INVESTMENTS IN CONTROLLED ENTITIES\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining the financial statements of all the entities that comprise the Group, being the Company (the parent entity) and its subsidiaries as defined in AASB/uni00A010 Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\nOn acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.\n\nWhen the Group relinquishes control over a subsidiary, it derecognises its share of net assets. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the information and results of each subsidiary from the date on which the Company obtains control until such time as the Company ceases to control such entity. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances, transactions and unrealised profits arising within the Group are eliminated in full.\n\nRefer to note 23 for the list of investments in controlled entities.\n\n## 13.

A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Orica recognises its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in the consolidated financial statements under applicable headings.\n\n## 14.  BUSINESSES AND NON/hyphen.caseCONTROLLING INTERESTS ACQUIRED\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group, in accordance with AASB/uni00A03 Business Combinations . On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. The transaction costs are expensed in the income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

The entity was fully impaired and the proceeds have been risk adjusted given the trade sanctions imposed on Russia. As required by Australian Accounting Standards, the foreign currency translation reserve was released to the profit and loss statement on disposal. This resulted in a gross loss of $40.6 million ($31.3 million loss after tax).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

It represents a separate major line of operations and is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of operation or business.\n\nClassification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal date or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\n\nWhen an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement and statement of comprehensive income is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.\n\nDisposal groups comprising assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.\n\nSuch disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n\n## 16.

DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nContributions to defined contribution superannuation funds are recognised in the income statement in the year in which the expense is incurred.\n\nFor each defined benefit scheme, the cost of providing retirement benefits is expensed in the income statement so as to recognise current and past service costs, interest cost on net liabilities, and the effect of any curtailments or settlements. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group's net liabilities in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the future benefit employees have earned, less the fair value of any plan assets.\n\n## (a)  Defined benefit pension plans\n\nThe Group participates in several Australian and overseas defined benefit post-employment plans that provide benefits to employees upon retirement. Plan funding is carried out in accordance with the requirements of trust deeds and the advice of actuaries. Information within these financial statements has been prepared by the local plan external actuaries. Orica were assisted by Willis Towers Watson to consolidate those results globally. During the year, the Group made employer contributions of $27.0/uni00A0million (2021 $30.7/uni00A0million) to defined benefit plans. The Group's external actuaries have forecast total employer contributions and benefit payments to defined benefit plans of $25.4/uni00A0million for 2023.\n\n## (b)  (i) Balance Sheet amounts\n\nThe amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows:\n\n|                                                              | 2022   $m   | 2021   $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Present value of the funded defined benefit obligations      | 527.6       | 735.4       |\n| Present value of unfunded defined benefit obligations        | 65.4        | 128.1       |\n| Fair value of defined benefit plan assets                    | (512.8)     | (631.4)     |\n| Deficit                                                      | 80.2        | 232.1       |\n| Restrictions on assets recognised                            | 3.1         | 1.9         |\n| Net liability in the balance sheet                           | 83.3        | 234.0       |\n| Amounts in the balance sheet:                                |             |             |\n| Liabilities                                                  | 91.0        | 238.0       |\n| Assets                                                       | ( 7.7 )     | (4.0)       |\n| Net liability recognised in balance sheet at end of the year | 83.3        | 234.0       |\n| Comprised of:                                                |             |             |\n| Net liabilities of continuing operations                     | 83.3        | 209.1       |\n| Net liabilities held for sale                                | -           | 24.9        |\n| Net liability recognised in balance sheet at end of the year | 83.3        | 234.0       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Sensitivity information indicates by how much the defined benefit obligations would increase or decrease if a given assumption were to increase or decrease with no change in other assumptions.\n\n|                                              | Weighted average of  assumptions used p.a.   | Weighted average of  assumptions used p.a.   | Change in   assumptions   | Change in   assumptions   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                              | 2022                                         | 2021                                         | +1% p.a.   $m             | -1% p.a.  $m              |\n| Rate of increase in pensionable remuneration | 3.32%                                        | 2.99%                                        | 11.9                      | (10.5)                    |\n| Rate of increase in pension payments         | 2.80%                                        | 2.36%                                        | 11.7                      | (10.6)                    |\n| Discount rate for pension plans              | 5.07%                                        | 2.74%                                        | (60.9)                    | 72.8                      |\n\nThe expected age at death for persons aged 65 is 87.8 years for men and 90.2 years for women at 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02022. A change of one year in the expected age of death would result in an $12.3/uni00A0million movement in the defined benefit obligation at 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02022.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe defined benefit obligation costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries but require the exercise of judgement in relation to assumptions for future salary and superannuation increases, long-term price inflation and bond rates. While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used may impact the earnings and equity of the Group.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS /parenleft.caseCONTINUED/parenright.case\n\n## For the year ended 30 September\n\n## SECTION H. OTHER\n\nThis section includes additional financial information that is required by Australian Accounting Standards and which management considers to be relevant information for shareholders.\n\n## 20. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nContingent liabilities relating to environmental uncertainties are disclosed in note 6 and those relating to taxation in note 11. All others are disclosed below.\n\n## (a) Guarantees, indemnities and warranties\n\n- -The Group has entered into various long-term supply contracts. For some contracts, minimum charges are payable regardless of the level of operations, but the levels of operations are expected to remain above those that would trigger minimum payments.\n- -There are guarantees relating to certain leases of property, plant and equipment and other agreements arising in the ordinary course of business.\n- -Contracts of sale covering companies and assets which were divested during the current and prior years include commercial warranties and indemnities to the purchasers.\n\n## (b) Legal, claims and other\n\nThere are a number of legal claims and exposures which arise from the ordinary course of business. There is significant uncertainty as to whether a future liability will arise in respect of these items. Management have concluded that any potential liabilities over and above those already provided for in the financial statements would not have a material effect on the Group's financial performance.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nWhere management are of the view that potential liabilities that arise in the normal course of business have a low probability of crystallising or it is not possible to quantify them reliably, they are not provided for and are disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nThe outcome of currently pending and future legal, judicial, regulatory, administrative and other proceedings of a litigious nature ('Proceedings') cannot be predicted with certainty. Proceedings can raise complex legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case, issues regarding the jurisdiction in which each Proceeding is brought and differences in applicable law. Thus, an adverse decision in Proceedings could result in additional costs that are not covered, either wholly or partially, under insurance policies and that could significantly impact the business and results of operations of the Group. Therefore, it is possible that the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Group could be materially affected by an unfavourable outcome of those Proceedings. Proceedings are evaluated on a case-by-case basis considering the available information, including that from legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes.\n\n## Warranties and Indemnities\n\nIn the course of acquisitions and disposals of businesses and assets, Orica routinely negotiates warranties and indemnities across a range of commercial issues and risks, including environmental risks associated with real property. Management uses the information available and exercises judgement in the overall context of these transactions, in determining the scope and extent of these warranties and indemnities. In assessing Orica's financial position, management relies on warranties and indemnities received, and considers potential exposures on warranties and indemnities provided. It is possible that the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Group could be materially affected if circumstances arise where warranties and indemnities received are not honoured, or for those provided, circumstances change adversely.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO BALANCE DATE\n\n## Acquisition of business\n\nOn 3/uni00A0October/uni00A02022, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of Axis Mining Technology Pty Ltd and DV8 Technology Ltd, who design, develop and manufacture specialised geospatial tools and instruments for the mining industry. The purchase price comprises $258/uni00A0million paid on completion and potential earn out payments of up to $90/uni00A0million based on the achievement of cumulative EBITDA generated from 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02022 to 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02024, and contingent on certain key management remaining employed by Orica during the earn-out period.

NEW ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\nExcept as described below, the accounting policies applied by the Group in its financial statements are the same as those applied by the Group in its consolidated financial report for the year ended 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02021.\n\n## (i)  New and amended accounting standards and interpretations adopted\n\n## AASB/uni00A02020-8 Amendments - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Phase 2)\n\nAASB/uni00A02020-8 became effective for the Group from 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02021. The standard provides relief from potential effects on the valuation of financial instruments and hedge accounting requirements caused when an existing interest rate benchmark is replaced with an alternative benchmark rate (the reform).\n\nThe adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Group. All relevant bank facility agreements will transition to alternative reference rates prior to the cessation of LIBOR. A portion of Orica's issued USD fixed rate debt is hedged using USD fixed to USD LIBOR interest rate swaps. None of these swaps reference US LIBOR post the cessation date of June 2023.\n\n## (ii)  New and amended accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective\n\nThere are no new standards or interpretations that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.",

We focused on both the forecast growth for the Group and the impact of the Group's future business plans when assessing the feasibility of the Group's forecast cashflows.\n- \u00b7 Terminal growth rates: in addition to the uncertainties described above, the Group's model is highly sensitive to changes in\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 We considered the appropriateness of the value in use method applied by the Group to perform the impairment test against the requirements of the accounting standards.\n- \u00b7 We assessed key controls in the Group's impairment process, such as Board approval of budgets and review and approval of the impairment assessment, including cash flow forecasts, by examining the review and approval of information by the Board.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the integrity of the value in use model used, including the accuracy of the underlying calculation formulas.\n- \u00b7 We compared the forecast cash flows contained in the value in use model to the future business plans approved by the Board. We checked the Group's forecast cash flows for the EMEA CGU for consistency with our understanding of the Group's decision to exit the Russian business.\n- \u00b7 We compared the Group's cumulative value in use to the Group's market capitalisation to inform our evaluation of the current forecasts incorporated in the model.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the accuracy of previous Group cash flow forecasts for the respective CGUs to inform our evaluation of current forecasts incorporated in the model.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the scope, competence and objectivity of the Group's external expert engaged to assist with the determination of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

This drives additional audit effort specific to their feasibility and consistency of application having regard to the Group's strategy.\n\n- \u00b7 Discount rates: these are complicated in nature and vary according to the conditions and environment the specific CGUs are subject to from time to time, and the approach to incorporating risks into the cash flows or discount rates. Orica engaged an external expert to assist with the determination of the discount rate for the respective CGUs.\n\n## EMEA CGU\n\nIn addition to the above, as set out in Note 9, the Group recorded impairment charges in relation to its Russian and Turkey businesses and the goodwill in the EMEA region.  This was as a result of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the decision to exit the Russian business, and the financial performance of the Turkish business . This further increased our audit effort in this key audit area.\n\nWe involved valuation specialists to supplement our senior audit team members in assessing this key audit matter.\n\nthe discount rate for the respective CGUs.\n\n- \u00b7 Working with our valuation specialists, we independently developed a discount rate range for the key countries in each CGU, using publicly available market data for comparable entities, adjusted for risk factors specific to the Group and the industry it operates in.  We compared the discount rates applied by the Group to our developed range.\n- \u00b7 Working with our valuation specialists, we assessed the forecast cash flows by comparing the implicit earnings and asset multiples from the model to corresponding multiples of comparable entities.\n- \u00b7 We considered the sensitivity of the model by varying key assumptions such as forecast operating cash flows, terminal growth rates and discount rates, within a reasonably possible range, to identify those assumptions at higher risk of bias or inconsistency in application and to focus our further procedures.\n- \u00b7 Using our knowledge of the Group's operations, their past performance and our industry experience, we challenged the Group's forecast cash flows, terminal growth rate assumptions and the feasibility of future plans.  We also compared forecast growth rates to authoritative published studies, including those related to impact of global supply chain disruptions, inflation expectations and forecast commodity prices and considered differences specific to the Group's operations.\n- \u00b7 We recalculated the impairment charge relating to the Russian and Turkish businesses and also the EMEA CGU against the recorded amounts disclosed.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the disclosures in the Financial Report using our understanding of the matter obtained from our testing and against the requirements of the accounting standards.",

We used this knowledge to challenge the Group's current cost estimates and to inform our further procedures.\n- \u00b7 We obtained a sample of the Group's quotations for remediation activities, as well as other internal and external underlying documentation for the Group's determination of required future activities, their timing and associated cost estimates.  We compared them to the nature, timing and quantum of cost contained in the provision balance. We compared the basis for recognition of the provision with the criteria in the accounting standards.\n- \u00b7 We made enquiries of various personnel regarding the Group's strategy for remediating certain source contamination and compared these for consistency with our understanding of their strategy and its impact to the provision .\n- \u00b7 We challenged the Group where provisions were unable to be made for source contamination, in particular for treatment of Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid source areas at Botany, New South Wales, in relation to the existence of information\n\n<!-- image -->",

The descriptions are not formal legal definitions.\n\n| 1.5\u00b0C world                                              | According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, knowledge-base and assessment approaches  used to understand the impacts of 1.5\u00b0C global warming above pre-industrial levels and related global  greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of  climate change, sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2D                                                       | Two dimensional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| 3D                                                       | Three dimensional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| 4D \u2122                                                     | Bulk explosives technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ACCU                                                     | Australian Carbon Credit Unit, the name of carbon credits generated in the Australian carbon market.

AN is typically produced as small porous pellets, or 'prills'. It is one of   the world's most widely used fertilisers and also the main component in many types of commercial explosives.  In explosives, its use is critical as an oxidising agent in the explosion reaction.

In accordance with the Standard, we have:\n\n- \u00b7 used our professional judgement to plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance that we are not aware of any material misstatements in the Content Elements Index whether due to fraud or error;\n- \u00b7 considered relevant internal controls when designing our assurance procedures, however we do not express a conclusion on their effectiveness; and\n- \u00b7 ensured that the engagement team possess the appropriate knowledge, skills and professional competencies.\n\nThis assurance was focused on whether the Content Elements have been addressed in the Annual Report and did not extend to assessing the accuracy or validity of any statement made throughout the Annual Report. KPMG has not been engaged to provide an assurance conclusion on the appropriateness or the operating effectiveness of the Orica strategy or how Orica creates value, including the governance, strategic management and other key business processes.\n\n## Summary of Procedures Performed\n\nOur limited assurance conclusion is based on the evidence obtained from performing the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Interviews with management responsible for the preparation of the Content Elements Index and Annual Report\n- \u00b7 Review of documentation\n- \u00b7 Assessing the suitability of disclosures\n- \u00b7 Agreeing the disclosures in the Content Elements Index to the <IR> Framework and the disclosures within the Annual Report and wider Annual Reporting suite\n\n2022 KPMG, an Australian partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Consequently the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nMisstatements, including omissions, are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence relevant decisions of the Directors of Orica Limited.\n\n## The Limitations of our Review\n\nThe Annual Report includes prospective information. Inherent to prospective information, the actual future results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and achievability of prospective information in the Annual Report.\n\n## Use of this Assurance Report\n\nThis report has been prepared for the Directors of Orica Limited for the purpose of providing an assurance conclusion on the Content Elements Index  and may not be suitable for another purpose. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report, to any person other than the Directors of Orica Limited, or for any other purpose than that for which it was prepared.\n\n## Management's responsibility\n\nManagement are responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 determining that the criteria is appropriate to meet their needs\n- \u00b7 preparing and presenting the Content Elements Index in accordance with the criteria; and\n- \u00b7 establishing internal controls that enable the preparation and presentation of the Content Elements Index  that  is  free  from  material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKPMG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdrian King Partner Melbourne 10 November 2022\n\nSarah Newman Director Melbourne 10 November 2022\n\n2022 KPMG, an Australian partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.
