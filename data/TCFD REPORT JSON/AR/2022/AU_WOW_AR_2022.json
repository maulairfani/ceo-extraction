Over the last year, we have made progress across each pillar of our 2025 plan. However, we know there is still more to do to meet our ambitions.\n\nMore details on our progress will be outlined in our 2022 Sustainability Report which will be released in September\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## People\n\nAs one of Australia and New Zealand's largest private sector employers, we are committed to being a truly inclusive and diverse workplace. Our inclusion strategy consists of five pillars - gender equity, LGBTQ+, First Nations, accessibility and cultural diversity.\n\nIn F22, we achieved 39% representation of women in our senior leadership team and maintained our Gold Tier status in the Australian Workplace Equality Index (AWEI) for the fourth consecutive year. We continue to create hands-on learning experiences for students and job candidates living with disability through our Mini Woolies program, and aim to do more to progress our accessibility agenda in the coming years.\n\nWe recognise the need to do more to listen and learn in regard to our commitment to reconciliation. In F22 we developed our reconciliation strategy and established our First Nations Advisory Board. The Advisory Board provides guidance for the Group on issues and challenges of importance to Indigenous team members, customers and communities across Australia.\n\nOur Human Rights Program has been in place for five years and underpins the work we do to build a rights-respecting culture. Throughout F22, we continued to embed human rights due diligence by:\n\n- \u00b7 Developing a labour governance framework to monitor third-party labour risks at our sites\n- \u00b7 Developing and publishing a Sustainable Cotton Policy and an Addendum to our Responsible Sourcing Standards on Responsible Recruitment\n- \u00b7 Strengthening our commitment to partnerships by signing a memorandum of understanding with the Retail Supply Chain Alliance and joining the Consumer Goods Forum Human Rights Coalition\n\nFurther information will be released in our Modern Slavery Statement in September\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 11.13\n\nTotal recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR):\n\n- \uf071 9% from F21\n\n## $41.4 M\n\nDirect community contributions\n\n## Gold Tier AWEI\n\nstatus achieved in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Planet\n\n## Product\n\nWe continue to adapt our business to manage the impacts of climate change. We are working to reduce emissions from our own operations through green electricity and electric vehicle trials. In F22 we moved beyond our own operations and established a program to allow Woolworths Group to understand our suppliers' capability on emissions reductions, identify leaders, and track improvements over time.\n\nFor more information on our strategic approach to climate change, refer to pages 50 to 57.\n\nF22 has been a year of significant milestones for our food rescue partnerships. Together with OzHarvest, we have now provided over 50 million meals to Australians in need. Through our partnership with WIRES, we have provided 150 Australian wildlife rescue agencies with food grants. Currently, around 70% of Woolworths Supermarkets have a food waste recycling solution in place to recycle food waste not suitable for consumption. We recognise there is more to do to extend this across the network.\n\nNature and biodiversity is at the forefront of environmental risk. We developed our nurturing nature strategy this year, focused on leading the future of protein and working with our partners to promote regenerative agricultural practices and improve our responsible stewardship of natural resources. Our membership of the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures Forum will inform our consideration of nature and biodiversity-related risk in our supply chain to help us take a holistic approach to our decision making.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are working to make our packaging as sustainable as possible by phasing out problematic packaging. In F22 we enhanced our data capabilities and worked to build our product level master data for our own brand packaging by engaging an external expert. This has enabled greater clarity of our performance against our ambitions. In F22 we completed 15 packaging redesign projects which will convert non-recyclable materials to recyclable, and reduce virgin plastic in packaging by 4,262 tonnes annually.\n\nPleasingly, we were ranked Australia's Healthiest Supermarket Own Brand range by The George Institute for the third consecutive year. We are committed to making healthier easier for our customers by making healthier choices more accessible and reformulating our own brand products. At the end of F22, 76% of eligible Woolworths own brand products met the Australian Government's Healthy Food Partnership targets for salt, sugar and saturated fat with the aim of achieving 100% by 2025.\n\nThis year, we launched our seafood sourcing policy to embed human rights, animal welfare and sustainable seafood sourcing requirements. As a result, all our remaining Woolworths own brand seafood products have been transitioned to ecologically responsible sources. We are also participating in the Tasmanian Government's consultations on the 10-Year Salmon Plan, and support its aim of ensuring world's best practice. We will continue to work with government, industry and community stakeholders constructively to help implement actions that underpin a sustainable salmon industry.\n\n> 10,000 t of virgin plastic packaging reduction compared to F18 baseline 1\n\nAustralia's Healthiest Supermarket Own Brands (3 years in a row) 2\n\n100 % all own brand whole shell eggs cage free\n\n- 1 Woolworths Supermarkets and Metro Food stores only.\n- 2 The George Institute for Global Health's FoodSwitch: State of the Food Supply report (2019, 2020, 2021).\n\n100 % green electricity in South Australia from July 2022\n\n31 % reduction in scope 1 & 2 emissions below 2015 baseline\n\n50 M meals donated to OzHarvest since 2014\n\n1 1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nO t her i n f o rm at i o n\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our first Mini Woolies store was launched in 2018, with 14 Mini Woolies stores operational at the end of F22. The program provides students with valuable life and work experiences in a safe environment that promotes skills, knowledge, independence, confidence and self-esteem. The program also partners with inclusive recruitment specialists, Omnia Inclusive, which has successfully placed candidates in work-experience roles in nearby Woolworths Supermarkets in NSW and Queensland. Since the Mini Woolies launch in 2018, it has seen over 1,000 students successfully finish the program. At Woolworths Group, we're committed to being a truly inclusive and diverse workplace and improving accessibility is a critical part of fulfilling our ambition. We're proud of the continued success of the program in providing students and job candidates with special needs a pathway to improved social accessibility and employment opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConnect our customer experience for good food and more everyday\n\n## Opening of Rochedale CFC in Queensland\n\nIn July 2022 WooliesX opened its first Queensland customer fulfilment centre (CFC) in Rochedale. The opening of the first CFC in the state was the next step in the continued expansion of Queensland's eCommerce network after the opening of the state's first eStore in Maroochydore earlier in the year. Located approximately 18 kms from Brisbane, the new CFC aims to serve the growing demand for online grocery shopping. The 10,000 sqm facility is the first CFC in the network to offer Direct to boot, which will support increased capacity for same day delivery, Pick up and delivery windows for growing online customers in the area. Rochedale CFC has wider aisles and more shelf space than a standard supermarket, allowing personal shoppers to handpick orders more efficiently and accurately and provide more convenience than ever before. The new CFC was also designed with an increased focus on sustainability, with features such as rainwater harvesting, smart metering to help monitor and reduce energy consumption, as well as more than 850 solar panels to provide 20% of the site's total annual electricity consumption.\n\nMore connected experiences\n\nEstablished ConnectedX to connect Group digital platforms\n\nRoll out of real-time loyalty platform, increasing personalised Everyday Rewards o/ffers\n\nContinued to scale Delivery Unlimited\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 1\n\nR\n\nD\n\ni\n\nr\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nc\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\no\n\nrs'\n\n4\n\n5\n\nO t her i n f o rm at i o n\n\n<!-- image -->",

This included the roll out of curated ranges, including a focus on a multicultural offer tailored to the local community. In F22 we relaunched our latest concept stores in Miller (Value), Port Macquarie (Core) and Double Bay (UP). Curated range reviews now cover a quarter of sales, generating incremental sales, with strongest market share growth in the Value and UP cohorts.

        "page_content": "## I am proud of the collective e/fforts of our team\n\nAfter seven years, this is my last letter as Chair of Woolworths Group. It has been a privilege, and I am proud of the work that we, the Board and management team, have achieved together, to transform the Group into a purpose-led organisation.\n\nWe did not get everything right, but I hope that history will show, we got more right than wrong and I wanted to reflect on the key learnings which have guided the last seven years.\n\nArguably, the most important decision that a board must make is the selection of the CEO. Our decision to appoint Brad Banducci, a 21st century retailer, has been pivotal to our success. His reputation both internally and externally, speaks to his outstanding leadership.\n\nSecondly, as a company we have always been guided by doing what is right, and using our values as a touchstone. This sets a higher standard than doing what is economical or legal. In this we have been tested by events such as the identification of team underpayments and the community opposition to our proposed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDan Murphy's store in Darwin. While regrettable, I am proud of how we subsequently responded.\n\nIt would also be remiss of me not to mention how proud I am of the team's response to COVID over the last two and half years and our role in ensuring Australians and New Zealanders continued to have access to food and everyday needs.\n\nThirdly, we have always taken a long-term view, resisting pressure to manage for the short term. We have consistently allocated capital to growth investments that we believe will generate shareholder value over time. And while impacted more recently by COVID-related impacts to earnings, our Group return on funds employed 1 in F22 remained strong at 13.7%.\n\nFurthermore, we invested ahead of the curve in WooliesX and our Group digital and eCommerce businesses, to meet an increasing customer need, and with the confidence that we could make them profitable. Group eCommerce sales have grown at a compound rate of 42% over the last five years to $6.3 billion in F22, we are Australia and New Zealand's largest first party retail eCommerce business, and are profitable.\n\nFourthly, we believe that shareholder value is enhanced by focusing on all stakeholders. We are obsessive about our customers, obtaining feedback from thousands of customers a week, and acting on that feedback. We care about the welfare of our teams and in recent years have increased our focus on mental health. Our success is directly linked to the success of our suppliers where we strive to achieve mutually beneficial partnerships. Because we care about the environment and the communities we serve, we have an ambitious sustainability strategy. And finally, we have focused on capital management returning over $12 billion in dividends and share buybacks over the seven years to shareholders. Our cumulative total shareholder return over this period has been over 100%.\n\nAnd last but not least, we have worked hard as a Board to become a high performing team. We review our individual and collective performance annually with external help, with both quantitative and qualitative measures. We expect our directors to know the business by being in the business, learning not telling. In Board meetings, we model the 'obligation to dissent' if you do not agree, believing that constructive conflict is healthy. This has enabled us to move decisively on major initiatives such as the exit of Home Improvement, the demerger of Endeavour Group and investment in WooliesX.\n\nWhilst we have made enormous progress since 2015, I am conscious that there is still more to be done. I wish Scott Perkins, my successor as Chair, every success in further realising our enormous potential.\n\nI also wanted to take this opportunity to acknowledge the retirement of Siobhan McKenna.

        "page_content": "## We are living our purpose and showing care for our customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nF22 marked the third year of extremely challenging operating conditions. I am proud of the resilience of our team and the care that was shown for our customers and the communities we serve as we navigated the impacts of COVID, supply chain disruption, product shortages, team absenteeism and flooding events throughout the year.\n\nThese challenges meant our customers' shopping experience was not consistent and this was reflected in our F22 customer advocacy scores. However, pleasingly our customer metric that measures whether customers felt cared for remained strong for all businesses. We have a renewed customer 1st, team 1st focus for the year ahead and we are working hard to get back to providing consistently good customer experiences.\n\nOur Group financial performance in F22 reflected the challenging trading environment. After a difficult first half, trading momentum and EBIT materially improved in the second half. F22 Group sales 1 grew by 9.2% or 5.1% excluding recent acquisitions, PFD and Quantium. Group EBIT 2 declined 2.7% to $2,690 million reflecting higher COVID-related costs in H1 in Australian Food and New Zealand Food, and BIG W store closures.\n\nGroup eCommerce sales 1 increased by 39% with eCommerce penetration reaching a record 11% in F22.\n\nAustralian Food sales in F22 were $45.5 billion, up 4.5% for the year with good growth across all states and store segments. In H2, higher food inflation contributed to sales growth following industry-wide cost price increases. As COVID restrictions ease, customers' behaviours are gradually returning to more normal and predictable patterns. A strong H2 recovery in EBIT 2 growth to 9.7% led to a small increase in EBIT 2 of 0.3% for the year after a difficult first half.\n\nWooliesX B2C eCommerce sales grew by 42.3% to $4.7 billion with eCommerce penetration of sales at 10.3%. eCommerce directly-attributable profit margin increased in F22 due to increasing scale and process improvements.\n\nGrowth rates in Australian B2B in comparison to the prior year reflected the acquisition of PFD as well as services revenue from Endeavour Group following its demerger, both at the beginning of the financial year. On an underlying basis all businesses reported higher sales than the prior year despite the impact from continued COVID disruptions with a strong first year contribution from PFD.\n\nNew Zealand Food sales in F22 increased by 5.8% to NZD $7.6 billion. The first half benefitted from nationwide\n\n- 1 Continuing operations.\n- 2 Continuing operations before significant items.\n\nlockdowns in mid-August which increased in-home consumption. Conversely, the Omicron outbreak which took hold in March caused significant disruption to the supply chain and stores which negatively impacted sales growth in H2. eCommerce sales grew by 19.7% for the year with penetration reaching a new high of 14.1% during Q4. EBIT declined 12.5% on the prior year given the COVID-related cost increases.\n\nBIG W's sales declined 3.3% to $4.4 billion in F22. Following an extended period of store closures in H1 and the impact of Omicron in Q3, sales recovered strongly in Q4, increasing by 11.9% supported by strong Easter, Mother's Day and Toy Mania events. eCommerce sales grew by 48% in F22 with penetration of 14% although growth rates and penetration slowed in H2 as lockdown restrictions eased and all stores reopened to customers.\n\nDespite the impacts of COVID and now inflation, our customers have told us that they want us to remain focused on creating a better tomorrow. Key sustainability highlights can be found on pages 6 to 7 of this report. There is always more we can do in this area but I am proud of a reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions of 31% compared to baseline, the establishment of our First Nations Advisory Board and maintaining the title of Australia's Healthiest Supermarket Own Brand range for the third consecutive year.\n\n## Our Food and Everyday Needs Ecosystem is taking shape\n\nIn the last 18 months, the shape of our Group has changed significantly with our Food and Everyday Needs Ecosystem starting to take shape.\n\nWithin B2C Food we are reimagining our food retail experience through our Core, Value, UP store segmentation with exciting new formats launched in Port Macquarie, Miller and Double Bay. Each store incorporates a curated range, smart technologies and an increasing focus on sustainability. We have also continued to make our customer experiences more convenient. At the end of F22, our Direct to boot offer was available in 681 stores and our latest CFC in Rochedale was the first to include Direct to boot to unlock additional customer and crowd based delivery capacity.\n\nTo provide our 13.7 million Everyday Rewards members with More Everyday , we offered more personalised value for our customers and introduced new related experiences. This included the launch of Everyday Pay in May, which supports QR code payments within the Everyday Rewards app eliminating the need to scan twice and is linked to instantaneous eReceipts.\n\nPFD's sales momentum improved over the year as COVID restrictions eased and operating conditions stabilised. While PFD was a significant contributor to sales and EBIT in B2B Food , all businesses delivered sales growth on the prior year. We also made good progress with our Ampol partnership with 40 Metro Ampol sites rebranded to MetroGo by the end of the year.\n\nThe formalisation of our Retail Platforms continues to gather pace. We established wiq in June last year, which brings together the best of Woolworths Group and Quantium to create a world leader in retail advanced analytics. wiq is already working on over 20 high priority use cases across the Group with early progress made on promotional effectiveness, personalised customer offers, tailored ranging and enhancing process effectiveness. Cartology, the Group's retail media business, also delivered strong revenue and profit growth during the year and expanded into New Zealand.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAs we move into F23, we expect the operating environment to remain challenging. We have become more agile but supply chain challenges and higher rates of team absenteeism will remain a reality. We are also extremely conscious of the challenges of inflation and pressure on our customers' cost-of-living. We know value remains more important than ever and we need to continue to look at every opportunity to make sure our customers in Australia and New Zealand can get their Woolies Worth in the year ahead.\n\nIn May, we announced a proposal to acquire 80% of online marketplace MyDeal. MyDeal will enhance our marketplace capabilities, particularly in general merchandise. We also announced our intention to acquire Shopper Media in July 2022 which will complement the Group's retail media business, Cartology. The acquisition supports our ambition to become the shopper media partner of choice for brands and retailers and provides more opportunities to reach customers through targeted advertising solutions.\n\nFinally, in late July we announced our Chair Gordon Cairns will be retiring from the Board following the AGM in October with Scott Perkins his successor. Gordon has served as Chair since 2015 and for the last seven years has been an essential part of the transformation of our Group to being a purpose-led organisation. On behalf of us all, I want to thank Gordon for his leadership during such a pivotal time for Woolworths Group - he has truly made us better together.\n\nWe have a renewed sense of purpose moving into F23 and I am excited about the opportunities ahead to deliver for our customers, team, shareholders and the communities we serve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBrad Banducci CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\n1 1\n\n<!-- image -->",

Closing inventory days increased 1.8 days but average inventory days from continuing operations declined by one day reflecting sales growth throughout the year.\n\nTrade payables of $5,216 million increased $384 million driven by trade payables related to the acquisition of PFD, inflation on goods purchased and the recognition of payables to Endeavour Group relating to payment services provided under the partnership arrangements.\n\nTrade and other receivables of $1,203 million increased by $421 million driven by the acquisition of PFD and the recognition of receivables relating to Endeavour Group partnership arrangements.\n\n## Other creditors, provisions and other liabilities\n\nof $4,358 million increased by $350 million, primarily driven by an increase in the provision for team member remediation of $201 million, the acquisition of PFD and increases in team member accruals and leave entitlement provisions.\n\nFixed assets, investments, loans to related parties and convertible notes of $10,000 million increased by $2,395 million, primarily due to recognition of the Group's investment in Endeavour Group of $1,646 million (at market value at 28 June 2021) and an increase in fixed assets reflecting the investment in new and existing stores, property development, and acquisition of businesses.\n\nNet assets held for sale of $266 million decreased by $5,462 million as the prior year balance included the net assets related to Endeavour Group which was demerged on 28 June 2021.\n\nIntangible assets of $5,278 million increased by $607 million largely driven by the recognition of intangible assets on the acquisition of PFD of $569 million.\n\nLease assets of $9,995 million increased by $442 million driven by lease remeasurements of $601 million, lease asset additions of $594 million, the recognition of lease assets on the acquisition of PFD of $369 million partially offset by lease depreciation of $1,039 million.\n\nOther assets of $425 million increased by $297 million mainly due to the recognition of sub-leases on attached BWS stores following the Endeavour Group demerger.\n\nTotal funds employed increased by $6,297 million, largely driven by the $7,870 million derecognition of the Endeavour Group demerger distribution liability and the recognition of the Group's investment in Endeavour Group, offset by a $5,462 million decrease in net assets held for distribution following the completion of the demerger.\n\nNet debt (excluding lease liabilities) of $3,306 million increased by $1,443 million primarily due to the additional cash outflow associated with the acquisition of PFD, higher operating capex driven by supply chain and eCommerce investment and the $2 billion share buy-back in October.\n\nLease liabilities of $12,471 million increased by $455 million with lease option remeasurements of $616 million, new property and other leases of $489 million, the recognition of lease liabilities on the acquisition of PFD of $369 million, partially offset by lease payments of $1,561 million.\n\nPut option liabilities of $630 million reflect non-controlling interests in Quantium and PFD. The liability represents the amount expected to be paid on the exercise of the options. The increase in put option liabilities compared to F21 reflects the acquisition of PFD on 28 June 2021 offset somewhat by revaluations at year end.\n\nNormalised ROFE from continuing operations was 13.7%, a decrease of 3.1 pts on the prior year due to lower EBIT from continuing operations and higher funds employed due to the acquisition of PFD and the Group's investment in Endeavour Group.\n\n## Group cash /flows for the 52 weeks ended 26 June 2022\n\n| $ MILLION                                                                         | F22 /parenleft.case 5 2 WEEKS/parenright.case   | F21 /parenleft.case 5 2 WEEKS/parenright.case   | CHANGE                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| EBITDA -

        "page_content": "EBITDA from continuing operations increased 3.1% to $5,052 million reflecting higher EBITDA from Australian Food, Australian B2B and Other segments offset somewhat by lower EBITDA from New Zealand Food and BIG W.\n\nEBITDA from discontinued operations in F22 reflects the non-cash gain on the demerger of Endeavour Group compared to Endeavour Group's trading EBITDA in F21.\n\nIncrease in inventories (continuing operations) of $343 million is due to higher inventory holdings across the Group in H2 to support elevated trading and mitigate supply chain disruption.\n\nIncrease in trade payables (continuing operations) of $165 million reflects higher purchases to support elevated trading and higher inventory holdings. The decrease in trade payables in F21 of $56 million was due to lower inventory replenishments in Q4 than the prior year.\n\nIncrease in provisions (continuing operations) of $175 million reflects an increase in provisions for remediation costs and self-insurance. In the prior year, the decrease in provisions was largely due to the cash remediation of salaried team members.\n\nNet change in other working capital and non-cash (continuing operations) was a decrease of $232 million primarily due to the first-time recognition of receivables related to the Endeavour Group sub-leases of stores and the non-cash revaluation of the put option liabilities.\n\nCash from operating activities before interest and tax was $4,817 million. After normalising for Endeavour Group's net cash flow from operating activities before interest and tax in F21 of $1,541 million, net cash provided by operating activities before interest and tax increased by 4.2% or $196 million on the prior year. This was mainly driven by higher EBITDA and a smaller impact from working capital and non-cash items from continuing operations than the prior year.\n\nInterest paid - leases was $542 million, a decline of $145 million compared to the prior year due to a reduction in lease liabilities following the demerger of Endeavour Group, partially offset by the leases recognised on the acquisition of Quantium towards the end of F21 and PFD at the beginning of F22.\n\nNet interest paid - non-leases was $59 million, a decrease of $54 million compared to prior year due to new bonds being issued at lower rates than maturing bonds despite higher average net debt during the year.\n\nTax paid increased $100 million compared to the prior year driven by higher taxable income for F21, paid in F22.\n\nPayments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of $2,416 million mainly relates to property development, investment in new stores and renewals, supply chain and IT Software. Excluding Endeavour Group capital expenditure in the prior year, the increase is primarily due to the increase in supply chain projects and property development.\n\nPayments for the purchase of businesses, net of cash acquired of $425 million primarily relates to the acquisition of a 65% equity interest in PFD.\n\nDividends paid (including to non-controlling interests) of $1,012 million declined by 12.3% compared to the prior year as F21 included dividends related to profit from Endeavour Group.\n\nProceeds from loan to related party reflects an intercompany loan of $1,712 million repaid by Endeavour Group on demerger.\n\nPayments for share buy-backs of $2.0 billion reflect the Group's off-market buy-back completed in October.\n\nThe cash realisation ratio for F22 was 33% (F21: 97%). Excluding the non-cash gain of $6,387 million on the demerger of Endeavour Group, the cash realisation ratio was 86%, broadly in line with H1. The cash realisation ratio was impacted by a working capital increase reflecting higher inventory and receivables recognised under partnership agreements, as well as higher cash tax paid compared to the current year's tax expense.\n\n## Capital management\n\n## Capital management objectives\n\nThe Group manages its capital structure with the objective of enhancing long-term shareholder value through funding its business at an optimised weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe Group returns capital to shareholders when it is consistent with its long-term capital structure objectives and will enhance shareholder value. In October 2021, the Group returned $2.0 billion in capital to shareholders through an off-market share buy-back. This resulted in the purchase of 58 million shares which were subsequently cancelled. The share buy-back complemented the payment of ordinary dividends in the period, with a total of $3.2 billion returned to shareholders (excluding franking credits) in F22.\n\nThe Group remains committed to solid investment grade credit ratings and several actions can be undertaken, if required, to support the credit profile. This includes the sale of assets, working capital initiatives, and adjusting growth capital expenditure and the property leasing profile. The Group's credit ratings are BBB (stable outlook) from S&P and Baa2 (stable outlook) from Moody's.\n\n## Financing transactions during F22\n\nIn September, the Group successfully completed a EUR550 million (approximately $880 million) seven-year European Medium Term Notes issuance and $700 million domestic Medium Term Notes issuance, comprising $350 million six-year notes and $350 million of 10-year notes.\n\nBoth issuances were structured as Sustainability Linked Bonds (SLB), with a direct link to the Group's commitment to reducing emissions. The SLB structure embeds a penalty (via a prospective margin increase of 0.25% per annum) into the terms of the notes if, at the respective testing dates of the notes, the Group's scope 1 and 2 emissions are not aligned with the forecast trajectory to meet the Group's 2030 scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction target. The proceeds of the notes have been used for general corporate purposes, including the long-term funding of the Group's investments in Quantium and PFD.\n\nIn May 2022, the Group entered into $1.25 billion of bilateral bank facilities. The facilities are revolving in nature and have tenors ranging from two to four years. The new facilities refinanced Woolworths Group Limited's existing $1.2 billion bilateral bank facilities which were cancelled upon the Group entering the new bilateral bank facilities. The bilateral bank facilities are used to manage the Group's short-term cash flow requirements and support the Group's liquidity position.\n\n## Upcoming maturities and transactions\n\nThere are no material maturities occurring in F23. The Group's next material maturity is the $750 million syndicated bank facility maturing in November 2023 and the Group intends to refinance this maturity.\n\n## Non-IFRS Financial Information\n\nThe 2022 Annual Report for the 52 weeks ended 26 June 2022 contains certain non-IFRS financial measures of historical financial performance, balance sheet or cash flows.\n\nNon-IFRS financial measures are financial measures other than those defined or specified under all relevant accounting standards and may not be directly comparable with other companies' measures but are common practice in the industry in which Woolworths Group operates. Non-IFRS financial information should be considered in addition to, and is not intended to be a substitute for, or more important than, IFRS measures. The presentation of non-IFRS measures is in line with Regulatory Guide 230 issued by the Australian Security and Investments Commission in December 2011 to promote full and clear disclosure for investors and other users of financial information and minimise the possibility of being misled by such information.\n\nThese measures are used by management and the directors as the primary measures of assessing the financial performance of the Group and individual segments. The directors also believe that these non-IFRS measures assist in providing additional meaningful information on the underlying drivers of the business, performance and trends, as well as the financial position of the Woolworths Group. Non-IFRS financial measures are also used to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods (such as comparable sales), by adjusting for non-recurring or uncontrollable factors which affect IFRS measures, to aid the user in understanding the Woolworths Group's performance. Consequently, non-IFRS measures are used by the directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive setting purposes and have remained consistent with the prior year. Non-IFRS measures are not subject to audit or review.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

VOC NPS was down four points and Store-controllable VOC was five points below the prior year, reflecting supply chain disruptions.\n\nF22 Australian Food total sales increased 4.5% to $45.5 billion with comparable sales for the year increasing 3.5% (5.1% ex Tobacco). F22 Woolworths Retail (stores and eCommerce) sales increased 4.3% (6.0% ex Tobacco) with strong growth across all states and by store segment (Core, Value and UP). H1 sales growth of 3.2% (5.2% ex Tobacco) benefitted from higher in-home consumption driven by extended COVID lockdowns in NSW and Victoria. H2 sales growth increased to 5.5% (6.9% ex Tobacco) partially reflecting higher shelf price inflation.\n\nWoolworths Supermarkets (store-originated) sales for the year were $39.6 billion, an increase of 1.1% (2.6% excluding Tobacco) and WooliesX B2C eCommerce sales increased 42.3% to $4.7 billion, with sales penetration of 10.3% (F21: 7.6%). H2 Woolworths Supermarkets (store-originated) sales growth improved to 3.1% and H2 WooliesX B2C eCommerce sales slowed marginally to 33.6% as customer behaviours normalised. Approximately 90% of eCommerce sales in F22 were fulfilled by the Woolworths Supermarkets store network.\n\nMetro Food Stores (store-originated) sales of $951 million increased 6.0% driven by new store growth and a gradual recovery of On the Go stores. The Woolworths Food Company's own and exclusive sales for the\n\n- 1 Before significant items.\n- 2 Prior period funds employed and return on funds employed have been restated to exclude the new Australian B2B segment.\n\nyear increased 4.8% supported by strong product development and growth of key brands, including the COOK, BBQ and Macro ranges. Growth during the year was impacted by own brand supply issues in the Household and Snacking categories.\n\nIn Q4, average prices increased 3.6% with inflation driven by industry-wide input cost pressures.

During the year, 11 net new stores (six Supermarkets and five Metro Food Stores) and one eStore was opened with 60 Renewals completed. Seven Supermarkets were also transferred to Metro Food Stores for reporting purposes during the year. At year end, the total fleet includes 995 Supermarkets, 90 Metro Food Stores, five CFCs and two eStores.\n\nGross margin (%) increased 74 bps to 30.4% (H1: +79 bps; H2: +68 bps) due to better buying, the impact of inflation on the sell through of existing stock, mix benefits from Longlife categories driven by growth in Cartology, as well as strategic initiatives including range curation and improved promotional effectiveness. Gross margin also benefited from a sales decline of 15% in Tobacco.\n\nCODB before significant items (%) increased 96 bps to 25.1%. Direct COVID costs (excluding discretionary team discount and bonus payments) were $211 million (F21: $205 million). H1 CODB (%) reflected material COVID disruption to the end-to-end supply chain as well as a higher wages to sales ratio due to elevated eCommerce penetration, new store growth and selective investment in IT platforms, digital capabilities and new businesses.\n\nThe increase in H2 CODB (%) of 47 bps was lower than the H1 increase of 140 bps reflecting a focus on returning to a more consistent operating rhythm. H2 COVID-related costs declined relative to H1 but higher team absenteeism remains an issue. H2 also continued to reflect wages associated with higher eCommerce penetration, supply chain investment including transition costs associated with the new Heathwood DC and investment in digital capabilities and Accelerator businesses. While some productivity benefits were generated over the year, they were below planned levels due to COVID disruptions.\n\nDepreciation and amortisation increased 6.1% driven by investment in new stores, renewals, supply chain and shorter-life technology and digital assets.\n\nF22 EBIT before significant items increased 0.3% to $2,420 million. H1 EBIT decreased 7.6% impacted by COVID disruption with a strong recovery in H2 EBIT growth of 9.7%.\n\nFunds employed increased 7.2% from F21 with investment in new stores, renewals, eCommerce, supply chain, and technology and digital assets. ROFE decreased by 1.3 pts due to higher average funds employed.\n\nDuring the year, together with Woolworths customers, the S.T.A.N.D Appeal raised over $4 million in donations to support the Salvation Army, Rural Aid, Lifeline and Foodbank. Progress in the year to support our Sustainability Plan 2025 included the installation of solar panels on an additional 30 Supermarkets and one DC, and the removal of 15 cent reusable plastic bags in WA ahead of our announcement in June to phase out all plastic bags nationally in F23.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Phasing out reusable plastic bags for a greener future\n\nIn June 2022 Woolworths Supermarkets became the first national supermarket to announce the phased removal of reusable plastic shopping bags nationwide. They will be phased out gradually state-by-state from Woolworths Supermarkets, Metro Food Stores and eCommerce orders by June 2023 and will see more than 9,000 tonnes of plastic removed from circulation annually. The phased removal of reusable plastic bags is part of the Group's broader sustainability agenda, with plastic bags also being phased out in BIG W.\n\n## Helping customers get their Woolies worth\n\nWe recognise the cost-of-living pressures being felt by our customers and our aim is for every customer to find their Woolies worth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n97\n\nHome Delivery enabled stores added in F22\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n300 winter staples on Prices Dropped for Winter\n\n200 own brand essentials on Low Price Freeze until end of 2022\n\nThousands of weekly specials available in store and online\n\nEveryday Rewards Boosters helping customers collect more points and fast track savings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## More convenience\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n52\n\nnew Direct to boot enabled stores added in F22\n\n2 2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Digital traffic growth slowed modestly in H2 as customer shopping behaviours normalised. Weekly active app users were up 63% (Woolworths app: +53% and Rewards app: +70%) in F22 and have an increased visit frequency and higher Customer NPS. Customer engagement with digital tools has seen Shopping List users increase by 37% and Recipes by 29% compared to F21.\n\nCartology 5 had another strong year with revenue growth of 29%. Higher revenue was driven by higher traffic to the Group's digital properties and new Cartology products such as the digital catalogue performing well for advertisers and customers alike.\n\n- In B2C eCommerce , following significant volatility in Q3, a more stable operating environment in Q4 and improvements in customer experience led to Q4 VOC NPS improving 11 points compared to Q3 to finish at 58, the strongest result of the year. Compared to last year, VOC NPS declined by five points, reflecting the ongoing impact of team absenteeism, supply chain challenges and product availability.\n\nF22 B2C eCommerce sales increased by 42.3% or $1.4 billion to $4.7 billion, with eCommerce penetration reaching 10.3%, up 276 bps on the prior year. Growth was driven by an increase in active customers of 22% compared\n\n- 4 Scan rates excluding Tobacco sales.\n- 5 Cartology revenue treated as an offset to COGS for external reporting purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Direct to boot delivered the highest dollar growth and Delivery Unlimited subscriptions doubled compared to the prior year. While growth slowed in H2 as lockdown restrictions eased, underlying H2 and Q4 momentum remained strong with sales growth of 33.6% and 28.8% respectively. Directly-attributable profit improved materially on the prior year reflecting scale benefits and increased efficiency.\n\nTo meet increasing customer demand, network capacity was again increased in F22 with Home Delivery added to 97 stores and Direct to boot in a further 52 stores, reaching 681 stores by year end. A new CFC in Rochedale, Qld was commissioned in July F23.\n\nEveryday Rewards members reached 13.7 million in Q4 with approximately 628,000 members joining the program compared to the prior year and 150,000 joining compared to Q3. Higher levels of member activity during\n\nthe year have led to higher incremental sales across the Group and for Everyday Rewards partners.\n\nIncreases in member engagement and weekly app usage was driven by enhanced customer experiences including more personalised member offers, real time boosting of offers and increased take up of eReceipts.\n\nEveryday Pay was launched in May to Everyday Rewards members; combining loyalty, payment and gift cards in a single digital wallet QR scan, which was rolled out to all Woolworths Supermarkets, Metro Food Stores and BIG W. Everyday Market was launched in September providing customers with a curated online marketplace that continues to grow as we build better customer and seller experiences.

Operating segment results have been restated to conform to the new structure.\n\nAustralian B2B total sales increased $2,741 million to $3,963 million in F22, growth of 224%. All Australian B2B businesses increased sales on the prior year but dollar growth primarily reflected the acquisition of PFD at the beginning of the financial year and the inclusion of Endeavour Group revenue under the partnership agreements for the first time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nB2B Food sales increased $2,260 million to $2,878 million, up 366%, with approximately three quarters of sales attributable to PFD. PFD had a strong first year as part of Woolworths Group with sales trends improving over the year as restrictions eased and benefitting from the acquisition of Fishboy at the end of February to improve its capability in seafood. Woolworths at Work, Woolworths International, Wholesale and MetroGo all reported strong sales growth in H1 and H2. Summergate's H2 sales growth was impacted by lockdown restrictions in China but full year sales remained above the prior year.\n\nB2B Supply Chain sales increased by $481 million to $1,085 million primarily due to the inclusion of Endeavour Group revenue. PC3 and SIW revenue (excluding Endeavour Group) also increased on the prior year.\n\nEBITDA increased by $98 million to $143 million largely due to higher PFD earnings offset somewhat by COVID-related impacts to trading performance, margin pressure in wholesale and export meat and investment to drive growth in the smaller businesses.\n\nDepreciation and amortisation was $101 million compared to $33 million in the prior year. The increase primarily reflects asset and lease depreciation related to PFD as well as amortisation of intangible assets of $17 million recognised on the acquisition of PFD.\n\nEBIT increased by $30 million to $42 million, at an EBIT margin of 1.1%.\n\n## Introducing Australian B2B\n\nIn October 2021 the Woolworths Group Board approved the establishment of a new operating segment, Australian B2B, which comprises B2B Food and B2B Supply Chain.\n\n## B2B Food\n\n## PFD Food Services\n\nOne of Australia's leading food service suppliers\n\nWoolworths International\n\n## Woolworths at Work\n\nInternational export business\n\nA B2B procurement solution supporting businesses\n\n## B2B Supply Chain\n\n## Primary Connect (PC3)\n\n3PL supply chain solution for Endeavour Group and other third-party customers\n\nStatewide Independent Wholesalers (SIW)\n\nTasmanian wholesale and logistics business\n\nAustralian Grocery Wholesalers (AGW)\n\nEnd-to-end wholesale business\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## New Zealand Food\n\nIn F22 New Zealand Food continued to progress its strategic and sustainability agendas despite a challenging operating environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Trading performance\n\nNew Zealand Food had a very difficult year impacted by challenging operating and trading conditions. These included supply chain disruptions caused by a three-day strike in late November, widespread Omicron community transmission, and global shipping challenges. Customer metrics were significantly impacted, particularly in H2, with a gradual improvement over Q4 following the trough in March. VOC NPS (Store and Online) increased three points compared to Q3 to 37 but declined eight points compared to the prior year. Store-controllable VOC of 75% increased by four points compared to Q3 but declined three points compared to the prior year. Improving the customer experience remains a key priority for F23.\n\nTotal sales in F22 increased by 5.8% to $7,563 million. The first half benefitted from nationwide lockdowns in mid-August which increased in-home consumption with H1 sales increasing by 8.3%. Conversely, the Omicron outbreak which took hold in March caused significant team absenteeism and disruption to the supply chain and stores which negatively impacted sales. H2 sales growth slowed to 3.1% and 2.3% in Q4 with higher selling prices somewhat offset by lower volumes.\n\neCommerce sales grew by 19.7% for F22 with penetration reaching a new high of 14.1% during Q4. Other digital and eCommerce highlights include Drive solutions and eLockers now in 75 stores, strong growth in Cartology New Zealand, and a strong increase in mobile app users, and Delivery Saver subscriptions.\n\nNew Zealand Food's franchise stores (FreshChoice and SuperValue) performed well despite the ongoing impact from the absence of international tourists, particularly over the summer period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAverage prices increased by 2.5% on last year, driven by inflation across Grocery, Fruit and Vegetables, and Perishables due to local and global cost inflation and supply challenges. In Q4, average prices increased by 3.5%, slightly below Q3 of 3.6% due to lower Fruit and Vegetables inflation in the quarter.\n\nSales per square metre increased 3.5% reflecting higher sales offset somewhat by an increase in average space of 2.2%. Despite new store and renewal activity experiencing some disruption due to COVID restrictions, six new Countdown stores and one replacement store were opened along with three renewals. This included a second 4 Star Green Star rated Countdown Supermarket in Waiata Shores, an innovative new Wanaka Pick up Metro and the first Metro Neighbourhood store in Herne Bay. At the end of the year, the store network comprised 190 Countdown stores, 39 SuperValue stores and 33 FreshChoice stores with a total of 262 stores.\n\nGross profit (%) increased 17 bps on last year. Customers continued to favour larger pack sizes which drove mix benefits, and increased use of data-driven tools in category management, more than offset transition costs to a new Hilton meat plant, higher freight costs and higher stock loss as unit growth slowed.\n\n| $ MILLION /parenleft.caseNZD/parenright.case   | F22 /parenleft.case 5 2 WEEKS/parenright.case   | F21 /parenleft.case 5 2 WEEKS/parenright.case   | CHANGE                      |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Total sales                                    | /seven.tf, /five.tf /six.tf /three.tf           | /seven.tf, /one.tf /four.tf /six.tf             | /five.tf./eight.tf%         |\n| EBITDA                                         | /six.tf/one.tf/one.tf                           | /six.tf/three.tf/three.tf                       | (/three.tf./four.tf)%       |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                  | (/two.tf/nine.tf/five.tf)                       | (/two.tf/seven.tf /two.tf)                      | /eight.tf ./seven.tf %      |\n| EBIT                                           | /three.tf/one.tf/six.tf                         | /three.tf /six.tf/one.tf                        | (/one.tf/two.tf./five.tf)%  |\n| Gross margin (%)                               | /two.tf/five.tf./four.tf                        | /two.tf/five.tf./three.tf                       | /one.tf/seven.tf bps        |\n| CODB (%)                                       | /two.tf/one.tf . /three.tf                      | /two.tf/zero.tf. /two.tf                        | /one.tf/zero.tf/four.tf bps |\n| EBIT to sales (%)                              | /four.tf./two.tf                                | /five.tf./zero.tf                               | (/eight.tf/seven.tf) bps    |\n| Sales per square metre ($)  1                  | /one.tf/seven.tf, /eight.tf /eight.tf /one.tf   | /one.tf/seven.tf, /two.tf /seven.tf /two.tf     | /three.tf. /five.tf%        |\n| Funds employed                                 | /four.tf ,/six.tf/three.tf/five.tf              | /four.tf, /three.tf/two.tf/nine.tf              | /seven.tf. /one.tf %        |\n| ROFE (%)                                       | /seven.tf. /zero.tf                             | /eight.tf./four.tf                              | (/one.tf./four.tf) pts      |\n| Scope 1 & 2 emissions (tonnes)                 | /six.tf /three.tf ,/seven.tf /eight.tf /two.tf  | /six.tf/one.tf , /eight.tf /zero.tf /two.tf     | /three.tf./two.tf%          |\n\n- 1 Sales per square metre has been restated to exclude non-sales area of customer fulfilment centres.\n\n## Introduction of joint Maori labelling on seafood\n\nIn F22 Countdown introduced joint te reo Maori and English language labelling on all packaged New Zealand fresh seafood products. The initiative is part of Countdown's ongoing commitment to incorporate te reo into the lives of everyday Kiwi's and was driven by team members who wanted to pay respect to Tangaroa and the fishermen (kaihao) who provided the fresh seafood.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "F22 CODB (%) increased by 104 bps primarily due to direct COVID costs of $61 million compared to $16 million in the prior year. H2 CODB (%) increased 178 bps also impacted by lower sales growth and other COVID-related costs like team absenteeism and supply chain disruptions. Other material increases included an 8.7% increase in depreciation and amortisation arising from investment in the store network, including spend to facilitate eCommerce growth and innovation, and spend on the supply chain transformation and digital capability.\n\nEBIT declined 12.5% on the prior year to $316 million with the EBIT margin down 87 bps on last year to 4.2%. H2 EBIT declined 30.8% to $116 million at an EBIT margin of 3.3%.\n\nROFE declined 1.4 pts to 7.0%, primarily due to lower EBIT and higher average funds employed due to investment in the store network.\n\nDespite the broader supply chain disruptions, good progress was made in transforming New Zealand Food's supply chain during the year. A new Hilton meat plant opened in July 2021 supplying case-ready meat to all Countdown stores on the North Island and the Palmerston North Ambient DC opened in August 2021. A state-of-the-art Auckland Fresh DC opened on 23 June 2022 which is expected to materially improve the quality, availability and distribution of fresh produce for customers.\n\nThe New Zealand Commerce Commission published its final recommendations following the conclusion of the Retail Grocery Market Study in March. Woolworths New Zealand supports these recommendations and will continue to engage constructively with the Government on their implementation.\n\nInitiatives supporting our sustainability agenda included launching our new 2025 Health and Nutrition targets, fundraising to support the Red Cross Pacific Tsunami Appeal, supporting and celebrating our rainbow team communities during Pride month and fundraising for RainbowYOUTH. In F22 we launched new funding for climate change combatting projects under our Growing for Good initiative.\n\n## Continued progress on supply chain transformation\n\nIn F22 New Zealand Food made significant progress on its supply chain transformation with the opening of three new distribution centres including the Hilton meat plant in July 2021, Palmerston North Ambient DC in August 2021 (PNRDC) and Auckland Fresh DC in June 2022 (AFDC). New Zealand's supply chain business was also rebranded to Primary Connect during the year.\n\nThe PNRDC and AFDC have both been awarded 4 Star Green Star accreditations and have been designed with sustainability features such as rainwater harvesting, energy-efficient LED lighting, electric forklifts and low energy and water use condensers. The AFDC's solar panels are expected to generate 22% of the site's electricity needs. In addition, the AFDC is located next to the new Hilton plant which allows for a single truck to be used for both meat and produce deliveries to North Island stores, delivering greater efficiencies and helping to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Packaging changes for the be/t\\_ter\n\nCountdown continued to progress its sustainability agenda in F22 through the introduction of more sustainable packaging. This includes new soaker-pad-free meat trays in the North Island which has removed 90 tonnes of plastic from New Zealand waste streams; as well as recyclable two litre ice cream containers and a first-to-market ready meal tray, which will see more than 121 tonnes of plastic recycled rather than sent to landfill.\n\n## Kete accelerator program supporting New Zealand small businesses and driving innovation\n\nCountdown's Kete business accelerator program was launched in F22 to support its efforts to develop a more diverse supplier base and empower small businesses. These small businesses include those owned by M\u0101ori, Pasifika, youth, women, LGBTQ+ and people with disabilities.\n\nIn its first year, Countdown selected five small businesses from the 150 applicants to help get their products shelf ready through resources and support delivered through the 12-month program. This included providing each business with customer marketing support, access to customer insights, product development and manufacturing support and mentorship from a range of industry experts within Countdown. The program is delivered in partnership with Amotai, New Zealand's supplier diversity intermediary, throughout Kete to ensure the program provides meaningful results for the businesses involved. The five small businesses selected are a diverse mix, all with a strong focus on sustainability, community and innovation. Upcycled food, a new range of nut and seed milk concentrates and poi are among the products that may soon be appearing on Countdown shelves with the support of the Kete accelerator program.\n\n## Increasing convenience\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n29\n\nStores with Drive solutions at the end of F22\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n46\n\nStores with eLocker solutions at the end of F22\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2 2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Despite the disruption in H1, the team focused on delivering consistent service and shopping experiences with VOC NPS (Store and Online) ending the year at 64, up two points on the prior year and Store-controllable VOC ending the year at 83%, stable on last year with both broadly in line with Q3.\n\nBIG W's total sales declined 3.3% to $4,431 million in F22 with comparable sales down 2.9%. Following a period of store closures in H1 when a quarter of trading days were impacted, sales in H2 increased 4.0% to $2,083 million. Q3 sales were impacted by limited customer mobility due to Omicron early in the quarter but Q4 sales growth recovered strongly to 11.9% with strong Easter, Mother's Day and Toy Mania events and cycling lockdown impacts in some Victorian stores in the prior year. The trading performance also reflects range improvements in Apparel and Home, better customer availability and promotions that resonated with customers.\n\nF22 eCommerce sales growth was 48.0% after being up 69.4% in H1 due to store closures. Sales growth remained strong in H2 at 17.6% but penetration moderated to 9.7% as lockdown restrictions eased, and all stores reopened to customers. In Q4, the new BIG W app was launched and a further 17 Direct to boot locations were added, bringing total locations to 84. Extending BIG W's offer and reach to more customers continues through other platforms, with BIG W ranges launched on the MyDeal marketplace in late August F23.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBIG W's store network remained unchanged at 176 stores with a reduction in sales per square metre of 2.4%, reflecting lower sales due to H1 store closures. The lease at BIG W's Warwick DC in Queensland has been extended to provide more stability to the network and the transition of the Hoppers Crossing DC in Victoria from a third party to Primary Connect is now complete.\n\nGross profit (%) declined by 28 bps in F22 due to a H1 reduction of 83 bps due to higher markdowns and shipping and delivery costs, and a mix shift to lower margin categories. Gross profit (%) in H2 increased by 34 bps on the prior year driven by a sales improvement in higher margin categories, higher own brand penetration and other strategic initiatives. BIG W's prices have remained competitive and provided customers with great value resulting in Product and Price VOC remaining stable in H2.\n\n| $ MILLION                      | F22 /parenleft.case 5 2 WEEKS/parenright.case       | F21 /parenleft.case 5 2 WEEKS/parenright.case         | CHANGE                          |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Total sales                    | /four.tf , /four.tf /three.tf/one.tf                | /four.tf,/five.tf/eight.tf/three.tf                   | (/three.tf./three.tf)%          |\n| EBITDA                         | /two.tf/four.tf/five.tf                             | /three.tf/four.tf/eight.tf                            | (/two.tf/nine.tf. /three.tf)%   |\n| Depreciation and amortisation  | (/one.tf/nine.tf /zero.tf)                          | (/one.tf/seven.tf /six.tf )                           | /eight.tf ./six.tf%             |\n| EBIT                           | /five.tf/five.tf                                    | /one.tf/seven.tf /two.tf                              | (/six.tf /eight.tf . /two.tf) % |\n| Gross margin (%)               | /three.tf/three.tf./four.tf                         | /three.tf/three.tf./six.tf                            | (/two.tf/eight.tf) bps          |\n| CODB (%)                       | /three.tf/two.tf ./one.tf                           | /two.tf/nine.tf./nine.tf                              | /two.tf/two.tf/three.tf bps     |\n| EBIT to sales (%)              | /one.tf./two.tf                                     | /three.tf ./seven.tf                                  | (/two.tf/five.tf/one.tf) bps    |\n| Sales per square metre ($)     | /four.tf,/four.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf                   | /four.tf , /five.tf /one.tf/seven.tf                  | (/two.tf./four.tf)%             |\n| Funds employed                 | /one.tf , /two.tf /four.tf/seven.tf                 | /one.tf,/one.tf/nine.tf /four.tf                      | /four.tf ./four.tf%             |\n| ROFE (%)                       | /four.tf./six.tf                                    | /one.tf/six.tf . /five.tf                             | (/one.tf/one.tf./nine.tf) pts   |\n| Scope 1 & 2 emissions (tonnes) | /one.tf/one.tf/zero.tf , /three.tf/nine.tf /zero.tf | /one.tf/one.tf /five.tf , /eight.tf /eight.tf /two.tf | (/four.tf ./seven.tf ) %        |\n\n## BIG W brands designed in Australia\n\nOur team of Australian designers and garment technicians are the creative innovators behind BIG W's exclusive brands.

H2 CODB (%) increased 85 bps, impacted by Omicron in Q3 as well as the impact of high levels of absenteeism and sick leave. Other increases in CODB were also due to higher team wages, higher supply chain costs driven by DC transition costs, eCommerce mix and investment in team and capabilities to support BIG W's transformation agenda.\n\nFor F22, BIG W's EBIT declined by 68.2% to $55 million with an EBIT margin of 1.2%. H2 EBIT was $30 million, 23.5% below the prior year with an EBIT margin of 1.4%.\n\nClosing inventory was lower than the prior year due to cycling a period of higher inventory to support increased sales volume in H2 F21, and from effective inventory management.

Our ability to make sound risk-informed decisions enables the Group to protect the value of our assets today and execute our strategy to deliver sustainable growth.\n\nIn the last year, Woolworths Group's risk landscape continued to be challenged by a number of issues, including extreme weather events, global supply chain and food disruptions as well as the prolonged impact of COVID on the wellbeing of our team and customers. Throughout these challenges, we remained focused on care for our customers and team and continued to work together to provide food and everyday needs for our communities.\n\nSince the beginning of 2022, there has been an increased level of macroeconomic uncertainty, such as cost and wage inflation, increases in interest rates, geopolitical tensions, and pressures on retaining and attracting talent. We have teams in place to actively monitor and manage these risks in the short-term whilst assessing and preparing for the longer-term impact.\n\nOur risks are reviewed, assessed, and where necessary adjusted through regular meetings with leaders, and senior management with Board oversight. We monitor macro risk factors such as cyber security and climate change that have multiple impacts on a number of our material risks, including: supply chain and operational resilience; legal, regulatory and governance; and meeting customer expectations. In addition, monitoring climate change is a key focus of our sustainability commitments and is considered through all strategy and transformation activities. As part of this approach, we equip our team across the Group to make decisions that lead to better outcomes for our customers, shareholders, and communities.\n\nThorough planning helps us to identify and respond to current and emerging risks relating to our people, planet, products, and the experiences we provide. Strategic risks are considered throughout our annual and quarterly planning cycles. Working together, we make sure we are flexible and agile in our ability to respond to themes, including changing customer and community expectations, digital innovation, and meeting our sustainability ambitions.\n\nWe have expanded our capability to manage our risks through the appointment of subject matter experts and risk partners across our business. We have mobilised a risk community that guides our approach to managing risk which enables our team and businesses to make better decisions.\n\nFurther information in relation to risk management can be found throughout the Annual Report and in the Corporate Governance Statement which is available on the Woolworths Group website. The material risks faced by the Group and our risk management approach to each of them are outlined on pages 46 to 49.\n\nAt Woolworths Group, managing risk is central to our efforts to live our purpose.\n\n## Risk management oversight\n\nBelow is an overview of risk governance and management at Woolworths Group together with key responsibilities of the Board and Board Committees, the Group Executive Committee, the risk community, internal audit and business leaders.

The short and long-term risks of climate change present us with potentially significant challenges to ensure our services remain available to the public, particularly following extreme weather events.\n\nThe latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports tell us that the continued lack of global emissions reduction progress has increased the required rate of reduction to stay within a 1.5 degree environment. We acknowledge that this will be a significant challenge. We have plans in place to reduce our operational (scope 1 & 2) emissions, and understand the different sectors in which our value chain (scope 3) emissions are generated, and how these could potentially reduce over time. We look forward to partnering with our suppliers, customers and industry more broadly to tackle this shared challenge.\n\n## Governance and risk management approach\n\nThe Woolworths Group Board is responsible for reviewing, appraising and approving the Group's climate change strategy, targets and material investments to manage actual or potential climate-related impacts to the Group. The Board does so on recommendation from its Sustainability Committee. The Sustainability Committee reviews and monitors performance against our climate strategy and targets, reviews effectiveness of Group frameworks and policies in relation to climate change, and provides external perspectives of climate matters within the investment landscape. The CEO and Group Executive Committee, including the Chief Sustainability Officer, have accountability for the implementation of our climate strategy, and report progress to the Sustainability Committee quarterly.\n\nThe Group Sustainability team includes a dedicated General Manager with responsibility for our climate strategy, and has a robust process in place for measuring and tracking emissions which are reported to the Group Executive Committee and Sustainability Committee on a quarterly basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability Commi/t\\_tee\n\nThe Sustainability Committee monitors progress against the climate change strategy, and is responsible for reviewing and endorsing our targets to manage actual or potential climate-related impacts to the Group.\n\n## Risk Commi/t\\_tee\n\nThe Risk Committee has oversight of the risk management framework and the Group risk profile.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Audit and Finance Commi/t\\_tee\n\nThe Audit and Finance Committee has oversight of financial reporting, financial disclosures and the Group's accounting policies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CEO and Group Executive Committee\n\nThe CEO and Executive Committee, including the Chief Sustainability Officer, have accountability for the implementation of our climate change strategy, and report progress to the Sustainability Committee quarterly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group Sustainability\n\nResponsible for driving climate risk and opportunity identification across the business, and preparing our sustainability disclosures, including reporting in line with the TCFD recommendations and quarterly Sustainability Committee reporting.\n\n## Woolworths360\n\nResponsible for energy efficiency and managing the Board-endorsed energy strategy targeting supply, demand and innovation opportunities to reduce our carbon emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Heads of business units\n\nResponsible for identifying, assessing, responding to, managing, and reporting upon climate risks within their scope and implementing appropriate risk treatment.\n\nWoolworths Group maintains a system to address and proactively manage risk in accordance with relevant legislation, regulatory obligations, shareholder expectations and good corporate governance principles. Climate-related risks and opportunities are identified through the Woolworths Group risk management process in line with our risk management framework (RMF). The RMF, which has regard to the ISO 31000 risk management standards, sets out our commitment and approach to identifying, assessing, responding to, managing and reporting risks that could impact the Group. Our Group Risk team provides us with independent oversight and advice on risk management practices and monitoring risk within agreed tolerances.\n\nClimate change has been identified as a causal risk factor that could contribute to multiple material risks. As a result, climate-related scenarios are assessed and monitored in line with the RMF. The Risk Committee has oversight of the RMF and the Group risk profile. Governance is supported by the Woolworths Group Executive Committee and relevant committees and forums across the Woolworths Group. Specific oversight of climate risk is managed by the Sustainability Committee.\n\n2 2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Strategy and risk management\n\nOur climate change strategy has been endorsed by the Woolworths Group Board and covers the following five pillars:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reduce and green our power use\n\n- -Implementing energy efficiency improvements across our network of stores and offices, and optimising new design and construction across our distribution centres\n- -Sourcing 100% renewable electricity across the Group by 2025\n\n## Introduce low-carbon tech and practices\n\n- -Upgrading to low global warming potential (GWP) refrigeration systems across our store network. By 2030, over two thirds of our stores will use this technology\n- -Testing zero emissions transport solutions across our fleet\n\n## Increase resilience in our value chain\n\n- -Assessing climate risks and opportunities associated with physical, transition and food security risks, and how these impact our customers, suppliers and operations\n- -Adopting resilience measures to address acute and chronic physical risks. For example, stores with high risk of power outages are supported by backup or portable generation\n- -Working with our suppliers to increase food production resilience, in conjunction with our nurturing nature strategy\n\n## Support industry, customer and team carbon neutrality\n\n- -Enabling our customers and team to reduce their emissions through information and education campaigns to inspire responsible use of natural resources\n- -Supporting suppliers in their own decarbonisation efforts\n\n## Support community climate change resilience\n\n- -Providing direct support for natural disaster affected communities through our Woolworths Group S.T.A.N.D program\n- -Mitigating the impact of store closures and helping to maintain stock where it is needed through physical store and network resilience\n\nWe aim to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 63% from our 2015 baseline by 2030, and our scope/uni00A03 emissions by 19%. These targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2020. As SBTi requires organisations to regularly review their progress and baselines, Woolworths Group is in the process of submitting our targets for re-validation. Our emissions reporting this year includes the demerger of Endeavour Group and the acquisitions of PFD Foods and Quantium. We operate as a Group and have a single emissions reduction target and climate change strategy. Our aspiration towards an absolute net positive goal does not change.\n\nFurther information in relation to our climate change strategy, and our progress on these initiatives, is set out in our Sustainability Report , available from September 2022.\n\n## Climate scenario analysis update\n\n## Overview\n\nFollowing our initial scenario analysis work completed in 2020, in the last 12 months we completed a significant update to further enhance our understanding of the risks that the changing climate poses to our business. We examined four physical climate scenarios and associated changes in 2030 and 2050; selected based on plausible warming pathways referenced by the IPCC, bounded by a low warming pathway representing a 1.5 degree world, and a high warming pathway representing a 4.5 degree world (IPCC, Climate Change 2021, The Physical Science Basis). The in-between scenarios represent trajectories closer to the current rate of emissions and existing national and global policy commitments (representing 2-3 degrees of warming).\n\nKey policy and development assumptions were drawn from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report; where possible adapted to Australian trajectories. This included use of the latest Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) Integrated Service Plan 2022 to inform emissions from grid electricity as well as electric vehicle take up. Further national parameters were drawn from the CSIRO's Australian National Outlook. Carbon pricing varies by each SSP, which allocates a value required to meet global emissions reduction levels.\n\nA single 'middle of the road' shared socioeconomic pathway (IPCC reference SSP2) was used across all four climate scenarios to enable focus on the climate-related variables. Under this 'middle of the road' pathway, our customers demand a wide range of healthy and convenient products. Globally, consumer demand for sustainable products is maintained, whereas animal protein consumption grows. In order to test the impact of varying global population growth on the food supply chain and food security, sensitivity analysis was undertaken using projections from SSP1 and SSP3.\n\nFinally, Woolworths Group-specific inputs were common across all scenarios; material inputs included: application of our current climate change strategy, a consistent market share, forecasts of store growth and store mix, and existing data on store closure impacts relating to historic extreme weather events.\n\nAs we develop our approach to climate scenario analysis, we have kept our analysis limited to Woolworths Supermarkets and Metro Food Stores, which comprises approximately 80% of Group revenue. We will expand this in future iterations.\n\nA more detailed table of assumptions associated with each scenario is provided at the end of this section under Key assumptions.\n\nA note on scenario analysis: A scenario describes a plausible, but hypothetical, path of development leading to a particular future outcome. Scenarios are not forecasts or predictions - they are 'what if' narratives designed to inform and challenge strategic thinking.\n\n## Climate scenario themes and opportunities\n\nTo analyse the potential impact these climate scenarios have on our business and our customers, we looked at three key themes across transition, physical infrastructure and food security. Below we present insights as well as mitigation approaches and opportunities.\n\n## Overall position\n\nThe climate scenario analysis indicated that our future business could evolve into one with near-term transition risks coupled with increasing physical infrastructure and food security risks due to climate change. Our near-term transition risks are partially mitigated through our existing emissions reduction approaches across energy and refrigerants in particular. Physical infrastructure risk - borne out by recent severe flooding events - will increase over time. This will require further consideration of our supply chain, in addition to the supermarket initiatives already in place, particularly in northern Queensland. For example, the expansion of our Townsville distribution centre and the decision to hold safety stock levels enabled northeast Queensland supermarkets to continue to be serviced while major supply routes from interstate were interrupted. Food security represents a more significant challenge for both Woolworths Group and the Australian food sector more broadly, requiring mitigating actions to be taken in order to retain the breadth of range and value for money provided for our customers. Driving a robust ongoing food security position - underpinned by our product portfolio and sourcing approaches - is key to our future competitiveness, and will represent a particular focus as our climate resilience strategy is evolved in future iterations.\n\n2 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Changes to risk under the lower and higher warming scenarios\n\nThe table below explores the risks to our Group resulting from the transition and physical impacts modelled in the lower and higher warming scenarios.\n\n## RISK CHANGES IN A 1.5 DEGREE SCENARIO\n\n## RISK CHANGES IN A 4.5 DEGREE SCENARIO\n\nOur existing business strategy is already closely aligned with a lower warming scenario that sees more aggressive transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nA residual level of operational emissions in both 2030 and 2050 will add some cost burden due to a carbon price, if not addressed. In our value chain, carbon pricing would also increase the cost of goods and transport, requiring consideration of how these costs are managed.\n\nTwo positive outcomes in the lower warming scenario relate to technology and market opportunities.\n\nThe acceleration in zero emissions transport will see earlier commercial availability of light, medium and heavy vehicles. Given we are working toward identifying a pathway to decarbonise our fleet, earlier commercial availability of cars, light vehicles and trucks will help achieve this.\n\nConsidering market opportunities, a continued increase in consumer preference toward lower carbon intensity products (combined with complementary concerns around animal welfare, and broader nature- and biodiversity-based awareness) would further validate the existing goals of the Woolworths Group Sustainability Plan.\n\nUnder the higher warming pathway, a larger number of themes drive increases in risk.\n\nA slow pace in availability of zero emissions technology makes our net positive commitment more challenging, most clearly across our transport operations.\n\nThere is a noticeable, albeit modest increase in expected weather-related interruptions to our supermarkets; in future iterations of our analysis we will seek to understand whether physical disruptions to our supply chain will have more of an impact.\n\nClimate-impacted food security represents our most uncertain risk, and this is most noticeable in a high warming scenario. Globally, areas harvested increase, but yields decrease due to a variety of climate-related factors. These impacts will already be felt by 2030 and more so by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk themes, what we already do, and further opportunities\n\n## THEME\n\n## MITIGATION AND OPPORTUNITY\n\n## Physical - Operations\n\nIn a lower warming world we still anticipate a mild increase in store exposure because of existing and predicted changes to physical climate while any anthropogenic net emissions remain.\n\nStore revenue impacts due to increased fire and rain events are real, but not materially significant in the context of our total store portfolio. In 2030, less than one store day per year could be affected by extreme weather, and in 2050, approximately two store days per year.\n\nSubstantial growth in online shopping occurs across all scenarios and will likely change the mix of asset types that require climate resilient design. While most supermarket locations are situated within leased shopping centres, Woolworths Group has more responsibility and control over online customer fulfilment centres.\n\n## Transition - Policy and legal\n\nAggressive mitigation policies may increase the costs of electricity, fuel and raw materials.\n\nA residual risk associated with our net emissions increases under the lower warming scenario, and more so once the emissions associated with our value chain are considered.\n\n## Transition - Technological\n\nDelayed adoption of new technologies could reduce our competitiveness. This is evident through the lack of opportunities to decarbonise transport in the short to medium term, particularly within the Australian and New Zealand markets.\n\nPrevious climate scenario work and store-level engineering reviews have identified more than 12 focus impacts and identified existing measures to mitigate these current risks. For example, we are working through the following actions:\n\n- \u00b7 Stores in the monsoonal north are built to standards addressing cyclone risk\n- \u00b7 Stores with high risk of power outages have back up generation or portable generator connection points\n- \u00b7 Flood barriers in stores in flood prone areas\n- \u00b7 Rainwater harvesting in high stress water areas\n\nChronic factors such as increases to average temperatures and in turn higher energy use are being addressed through ongoing improvements to store refrigeration design.\n\nIncreasing resilience in our supply chain is evident through our evolving network planning process, for example the Townsville distribution centre was expanded due to the risk of this region becoming isolated due to extreme weather.\n\nIn future years we will extend our climate risk analysis to cover our logistics supply chain in relation to factors such as extensive railroad and/or trucking route disruptions and warehouse disruptions.\n\nOur current renewable electricity and refrigerant transitions strategy addresses 80-90% of our operational (scope 1 and 2) emissions that would otherwise be exposed to a potential carbon price.\n\nOur recently launched program to work with our suppliers to address our scope 3 supplier emissions will help us understand and quantify the opportunities to reduce emissions across key commodities. We have also joined the Climate Leaders Coalition and are contributing as part of the scope 3 workstream, which looks to understand and address common challenges with scope 3 measurement and management.\n\nOur existing climate strategy has delivered an ongoing rollout of onsite renewable energy and low-GWP refrigeration.\n\nThis year's commitment to develop a group-wide transport decarbonisation plan will provide us with a clearer picture of the opportunities to reduce fleet emissions.\n\nIn an aggressive transition we would anticipate faster availability of zero emission transport opportunities to meet our goals. In contrast, in a much slower uptake of low carbon technology in the high warming scenario, lack of zero emission transport will make achievement of our goal more challenging.\n\n1\n\n2 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## THEME\n\n## Transition - Reputational\n\nCustomer expectations for sustainable products continue to build, as do investor expectations for corporate behaviour.\n\n## Transition - Market\n\nConsumer preferences could affect our mix of product sales and revenue.\n\nA continued increase in consumer preferences toward lower carbon intensity products complements growing concerns around animal welfare, and broader nature and biodiversity-based awareness.\n\n## Food security\n\nOur latest modelling suggests climate-impacted food security represents a material and uncertain risk for the Australian grocery market, and despite Australia producing far more than we consume, our prices for many of our categories are tightly linked with global markets. In the absence of improved farming techniques, the future agricultural system will likely evolve into one where the areas harvested increase, but yields decrease due to a variety of climate-related factors.\n\nAs a result, while Australians will be able to continue to access the food that they require, the associated costs could accelerate in real terms and could impact our competitiveness.\n\nWe continue to engage with our stakeholders through our Voice of Customer, Team, and Supplier channels. Our disclosure of climate-related risk continues to increase via our first dedicated TCFD update in the 2022 Annual Report.\n\nIndependent recognition, such as Woolworths Group's recent third place ranking in a Global retailers sustainability maturity survey by Boston Consulting Group and World Retail Congress, helps to provide confidence that we are making good progress.\n\nWe regularly have targeted meetings with investors on sustainability to get direct feedback. Ongoing reputational performance will be determined using the RepTrak measure that regularly tracks corporate reputation and includes a score for ESG performance and initiatives, and is linked to remuneration.\n\nWe conduct monthly customer research which points to growing momentum towards less carbon intensive products. This implies a need to decarbonise across all product categories, with the early focus on high emissions intensity livestock-based commodities. Our work in sustainable protein is an example of the opportunities created by leveraging these consumer preferences.\n\nAs Australia's largest grocery supplier, we have both a responsibility and an ability to manage this risk via our strong supplier partnerships.\n\nEarly progress in this area includes the recent launch of our nurturing nature strategy which addresses the future of protein, nature-climate co-benefits, and our recently launched value chain emissions program to understand and work to reduce our scope 3 supplier emissions.\n\nWe will continue to analyse food security risks in future iterations of our climate resilience modelling. Outcomes will help inform a more flexible and resilient range portfolio strategy, with a focus on commodities identified as having the greatest supply security challenges.\n\nMore information will be outlined in our Sustainability Report , which will be released in September\n\n## Building a more climate resilient future\n\nWe continue to focus on monitoring, managing and reducing, where possible, greenhouse gas emissions of our operations, and we are working to enhance our understanding of, and to address, the risks and opportunities created by climate change for our business.\n\nExtending our analysis to cover all parts of the Group and wider value chain, and continuation of climate change adaptation planning across our own operations is a multi-year commitment.\n\nOur focus for the next 12 months will be in the areas of:\n\n- \u00b7 Performing a more detailed assessment of climate risk for specific commodities - allowing portfolio mitigation and adaptation plans to be devised for particularly challenged areas\n- \u00b7 Commencement of climate change resilience plans for our logistics networks and physical infrastructure\n- \u00b7 Integrating our improved understanding of food security risk into our portfolio risk mitigation strategies to minimise exposure to food security impacts.\n\nFinally, and in acknowledgement of the growing momentum connecting climate change to broader impacts on nature and biodiversity, we are a member of the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum supporting the consideration of evolving nature-related risks in global supply chains. As this space evolves we will monitor and where possible integrate our climate and nature-stewardship strategies.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe following table presents key assumptions informing our

The Group has not incurred any significant liabilities under any environmental legislation.\n\n## Directors' and officers' indemnity/insurance\n\n- (i) The Constitution of the Company provides that the Company will indemnify to the maximum extent permitted by law, any current or former director, secretary or other officer of the Company or a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company against: (a)  Any liability incurred by the person in that capacity (except a liability for legal costs);\n- (b) Legal costs incurred in defending, or otherwise in connection with proceedings, whether civil, criminal or of an administrative or investigatory nature in which the person becomes involved because of that capacity; and\n- (c)  Legal costs incurred in good faith in obtaining legal advice on issues relevant to the performance of their functions and discharge of their duties as an officer of the Company or a wholly owned subsidiary, if the expenditure has been approved in accordance with the Company's policy.\n- (ii)  Directors and officers of Woolworths Group Limited and certain subsidiaries have entered into a Deed of Access, Insurance and Indemnity that provides for indemnity against liability as a director or officer, except to the extent of indemnity under an insurance policy or where prohibited by statute. The Deed also entitles the director or officer to access company documents and records, subject to undertakings as to confidentiality, and to receive directors' and officers' insurance cover paid for by the Company.\n- (iii) During or since the end of the financial period, the Company has paid or agreed to pay a premium in respect of a contract of insurance insuring directors and officers, and any persons who will insure these in the future, and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, against certain liabilities incurred in that capacity. Disclosure of the total amount of the premiums and the nature of the liabilities in respect of such insurance is prohibited by the contract of insurance.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nDuring the period, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Australia, the Company's auditor, has performed certain other services in addition to their statutory duties. The Board is satisfied that the provision of those non-audit services during the period by the auditor is compatible with, and did not compromise, the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) or as set out in Code of Conduct APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board, as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision making capacity for the Company, acting as an advocate for the Company or jointly sharing risks or rewards.\n\nDetails of amounts paid or payable to the auditor for non-audit services provided during the year by the auditor are outlined in Note 6.3 to the financial statements.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe following information, contained in other sections of this Annual Report, forms part of this Directors' Report:\n\n- \u00b7 Operating and Financial Review (Performance Highlights and Business Review) details on pages 2 to 57 inclusive in the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 Details of dividends, including the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) and shares issued as a result of the DRP, as outlined in Note 4.2 and Note 4.3 to the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Matters subsequent to the end of the financial period as outlined in Note 6.4 to the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Directors' interests in shares and performance rights as set out in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 of the Remuneration Report.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\n## Dear Shareholder,\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to share with you our F22 Remuneration Report. Throughout F22, our team continued their outstanding efforts to support our customers and the communities we serve. The team's response to the challenges throughout the year - continuing disruption from COVID, supply chain issues and flooding across the Eastern Seaboard - showed tremendous agility, commitment and the strength of our customer 1st, team 1st culture.\n\nOur remuneration framework is based on market competitive fixed pay, a balanced scorecard for short-term incentive (STI) to drive improvement across customer, team, financial and operating performance, and a long-term incentive (LTI) that aligns pay with disciplined financial management, strengthening the Group's reputation, and shareholder returns.\n\n## F22 reward outcomes: STI\n\nWe entered F22 with a plan to enable our transition to the 'New' Woolworths Group given the demerger of Endeavour and acquisitions of PFD and Quantium, and a base setting that COVID impacts would materially unwind as vaccines rolled out and restrictions eased. The subsequent waves of COVID significantly impacted trading through ongoing high levels of in-home consumption, store closures, team member absenteeism, elevated costs to operate and material disruption to our operating and logistics teams. Inflation and the dislocation resulting from geopolitical conflict in Europe and supply chain pressures worldwide also accelerated through H2.\n\nThe raw F22 STI scorecard outcome of 60% reflects these factors, with strong Sales performance offset by adverse impacts on EBIT, Customer Satisfaction and Working Capital Days metrics, which were all below Entry. Pleasingly, we improved our team Safety performance, with an outcome above Stretch.\n\nThe Board reviewed this scorecard outcome in light of its long-standing incentive adjustment principles. In relation to the Working Capital Days metric, the drivers of the below-Entry outcome were considered, the most material of which was the Board-endorsed decision to build inventory across key categories from early 2022. The Board exercised its discretion to set the outcome on the Working Capital Days measure at Entry. This results in the Group STI scorecard outcome increasing from 60% to 70% of Target. A full breakdown of scorecard outcomes can be found on page 76.\n\n## F22 reward outcomes: LTI\n\nThe F20-22 Woolworths Group Incentive Share Plan (WISP) achieved an outcome between Target and Stretch, resulting in 66.7% of the maximum performance rights vesting. Sales per square metre achieved a result above Stretch reflecting our growth in market share driven by sustained operational execution and growth in our eCommerce business. The significant impacts of COVID on F22 EBIT resulted in a below Entry outcome for the ROFE metric. The Board is pleased that despite recent\n\nvolatility, our team delivered substantial value to our shareholders over the three-year performance period, achieving a total shareholder return (TSR) of 38.4%, ranking Woolworths Group at the 78th percentile of our comparator group.\n\n## Pay compliance review and underpayments\n\nAfter identifying a number of underpayment issues in F20 for our award covered salaried team, the Board commissioned a rigorous end-to-end payroll review to proactively identify any other instances of non-compliance. This review has been closely monitored by a Sub-Committee of the Board and is expected to be completed by the end of this calendar year. We were disappointed that a number of further issues were identified during F22. Some of these impacted the financial results on which incentives were paid to our senior leaders in prior years. In response, the Board has reduced F22 STI incentives for some current Group Executive Committee members and LTI or DSTI vesting for some past Group Executive Committee members to recover any incentives inadvertently overpaid to those leaders. The Board will continue to actively monitor this program until the work is completed.\n\n## Management changes in F22\n\nWe continually develop our management team, and have succession planning strategies in place to ensure we have a strong team to deliver on our strategic priorities into the future. Following the demerger of Endeavour Group, we reviewed the Group's Key Management Personnel (KMP) and determined that the Managing Director of WooliesX would be included as KMP, reflecting WooliesX's growth and contribution as a critical enabler of the Group's strategy.\n\n## Executive remuneration framework review\n\nEach year the Board reviews the remuneration framework and the measures used to reward short and long-term performance to maintain alignment with the Group's strategic priorities. In F22 we implemented a new safety measure for our STI plan and introduced a reputation measure into our LTI plan. The Board believes that the current framework aligns executives to the delivery of the Group's strategy and growth of shareholder value and has not proposed any changes for F23.\n\n## In summary\n\nDespite a challenging year with various disruptions and a financial result below our expectations, F22 saw continued progress against our strategic priorities. We continued to make progress on the reshaping of Woolworths Group, with the successful demerger of Endeavour Group, integration of Quantium and PFD, and the announcement in May of our intent to acquire 80% of MyDeal. We remain focused on progressing our strategic agenda in F23 and beyond to deliver more value to our customers and shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Siobhan McKenna\n\nChair - People Committee\n\n## Remuneration Report 2022 Table of Contents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 1.1                                   | Our remuneration framework aligned to our strategic priorities                    | /seven.tf/two.tf                      |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| 1.2                                   | F22 executive KMP remuneration mix                                                | /seven.tf/three.tf                    |\n| 1.3                                   | How we performed and remuneration received                                        | /seven.tf/four.tf                     |\n| Executive KMP remuneration            | Executive KMP remuneration                                                        | Executive KMP remuneration            |\n| 2.1                                   | Short-term incentive                                                              | /seven.tf/five.tf                     |\n| 2.2                                   | Long-term incentive                                                               | /seven.tf/seven.tf                    |\n| 2.3                                   | What we paid executive KMP in F22 & progress on minimum shareholding requirements | /seven.tf/nine.tf                     |\n| 2.4                                   | Terms of executive KMP service agreements                                         | /eight.tf/two.tf                      |\n| 2.5                                   | F23 outlook                                                                       | /eight.tf/three.tf                    |\n| Governance                            | Governance                                                                        | Governance                            |\n| 3.1                                   | Role of the Board                                                                 | /eight.tf/four.tf                     |\n| 3.2                                   | Role of the People Committee (PC)                                                 | /eight.tf/four.tf                     |\n| 3.3                                   | Treatment of unvested equity awards upon exit                                     | /eight.tf/five.tf                     |\n| 3.4                                   | Other governance requirements                                                     | /eight.tf/six.tf                      |\n| Non-executive directors' arrangements | Non-executive directors' arrangements                                             | Non-executive directors' arrangements |\n| 4.1                                   | Non-executive directors' remuneration policy and structure                        | /eight.tf/seven.tf                    |\n| 4.2                                   | Non-executive directors' minimum shareholding requirement                         | /eight.tf/seven.tf                    |\n| 4.3                                   | Non-executive directors' equity plan                                              | /eight.tf/seven.tf                    |\n| KMP statutory disclosures             | KMP statutory disclosures                                                         | KMP statutory disclosures             |\n| 5.1                                   | KMP remuneration                                                                  | /eight.tf/eight.tf                    |\n| 5.2                                   | KMP share right movements                                                         | /nine.tf/zero.tf                      |\n| 5.3                                   | KMP share movements                                                               | /nine.tf/one.tf                       |\n| 5.4                                   | Share rights outstanding for executive KMP                                        | /nine.tf/two.tf                       |\n\nThe report has been prepared and audited against the disclosure requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\n\n## Who is covered by this report?\n\nThe Remuneration Report outlines Woolworths Group's remuneration framework and the outcomes for the year ended 26 June 2022 for Key Management Personnel.

This discretion review incorporates advice from the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief People Officer, and Head of Internal Audit, as well as consultation with Committee Chairs and all directors.\n\nOur purpose: We create better experiences together for a better tomorrow\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nActivate Everyday for our customers\n\nGrow food into B2B channels\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEvolve our Supply Chain and Retail Platforms for the future\n\nObjective:  Support Business Transformation\n\n1.1\n\nOur remuneration framework aligned to our strategic priorities  (continued)\n\n## F22 remuneration framework\n\n## Total Fixed Remuneration (TFR)\n\nTFR consists of base salary, superannuation and car allowance.\n\nTFR is set in relation to the external market and considers:\n\n- \u00b7 strategic value of the role\n- \u00b7 size and complexity of the role\n- \u00b7 individual responsibilities\n- \u00b7 experience and skills.\n\nTFR is positioned so that total target remuneration (TTR) is around median of our comparator group, which includes the ASX/two.tf/five.tf plus additional reference as required to major national and international retailers. Generally, executives who are new to role will start on a TTR package below median, and move towards median as they develop skills and experience in the role.\n\n## Our remuneration framework supports the Group strategy\n\n## Short-Term Incentive (STI)\n\n50% of the STI is delivered in cash and the remaining 50% is deferred in share rights for two years.\n\nBusiness performance is measured through a STI balanced scorecard, with /six.tf/zero.tf% weighted on financial objectives and /four.tf/zero.tf% on non-financial objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Sales (/two.tf/zero.tf%)\n- \u00b7 Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT), before significant items (/two.tf/zero.tf%)\n- \u00b7 Working Capital Days (/two.tf/zero.tf%)\n- \u00b7 Customer Satisfaction (/two.tf/zero.tf%)\n- \u00b7 Safety (/two.tf/zero.tf%).\n\nIndividual performance includes assessment against business, strategic and ways of working goals and core values.\n\n## 1.2 F22 executive KMP remuneration mix\n\n## What is the remuneration mix for executive KMP?\n\nA consistent remuneration mix applies for all executive KMP. It is strongly weighted towards variable remuneration, with performance-based pay contributing 67% of total target mix, and 50% of total target reward delivered in deferred equity.\n\nTotal Target Mix\n\nPerformance based\n\n## Total fixed remuneration  33.4%\n\nTotal Maximum Mix\n\nPerformance based\n\nTotal fixed remuneration  23.8%\n\nMaximum STI 35.7% (150% of TFR)\n\nMaximum LTI 40.5% (170% of TFR)\n\n17.85% cash 17.85% deferred share rights\n\nPerformance rights\n\n## Target STI  33.3% (100% of TFR)\n\n## Target LTI  33.3% (100% of TFR)\n\n16.65% cash 16.65% deferred share rights\n\nPerformance rights\n\n## Long-Term Incentive (LTI)\n\n## Performance rights vesting subject to performance progress over three years.\n\nThe LTI aligns executives to overall company performance through three measures focused on strategic business drivers and long-term shareholder return:\n\n- \u00b7 Relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR)\n- \u00b7 Return On Funds Employed (ROFE)\n- \u00b7 Reputation.\n\nF22 Remuneration\n\nat a glance\n\n/one.tf\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n5\n\nO t her i n f o rm at i o n\n\n<!-- image -->",

Mr Banducci does not have any vested F20 DSTI because he waived his F20 STI award as part of taking accountability for the salary underpayment issues identified in F20.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Executive KMP remuneration\n\n## 2.1 Short-term incentive\n\n## Our approach and rationale: F22 short-term incentive\n\nWe believe that alignment of our STI arrangements from the CEO through to our store teams is an important recognition of the shared accountability for transforming Woolworths Group. Individual STI outcomes reflect business performance against the STI scorecard,  individual contribution to these results and ways of working and core values. The Board also reviews executive behaviour and any malus policy considerations when determining STI outcomes for executive KMP. All measures and targets are reviewed annually so that STI drives the right outcomes each year.\n\n## Assessing business performance:\n\nThe STI balanced scorecard includes a mix of metrics, with 60% weighting on financial metrics and 40% weighting on non-financial metrics. Five equally weighted business scorecard measures drive outcomes for shareholders, customers and our team:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\uf0a2\n\nSales\n\n\uf0a2\n\nEBIT\n\n## Customer Satisfaction\n\nOur strategy is underpinned by customer experiences and success is dependent on delivering convenient ways to shop and competitive prices for customers so they continue to choose us over our competitors. Our online platforms are key to delivering new and improved ways customers can shop with us. Customer feedback is measured using Voice of Customer Net Promoter Score (VOC), based on 12-months rolling average outcomes. Outcomes are weighted 30% to eCommerce customers and 70% to in-store customers. Scores reflect outcomes across the Group, weighted 75% Australian Food, 15% New Zealand Food and 10% BIG W.\n\n## Safety\n\nWe are a people business and the safety of our team and customers is of great importance. Safety performance is measured by the Severity Rate, which is a blended measure that includes all team and customer injuries/illnesses and their severity. The higher the severity of an incident (actual or potential), the higher its severity score. The total of all severity scores is then divided by the event count to determine the Severity Rate.\n\n## Sales, EBIT and Working Capital Days\n\nIt is critical for the sustainability of our business to constantly work towards improving all elements of our financial performance, including the productivity of store selling space, the efficiency of our stores, supply chain and overall management of costs and the effective management of working capital, including inventory. Sales, EBIT and Working Capital Days performance are all key financial performance metrics used to measure the creation of value for our shareholders.\n\n\uf0a2\n\nWorking Capital Days\n\n\uf0a2\n\nCustomer Satisfaction\n\n\uf0a2\n\nSafety\n\n## Assessing individual performance:\n\nTwo equally-weighted categories of goals are used to review performance:\n\n- \u00b7 business strategy and performance goals that capture how individuals contribute to the performance of the business during the year, and their contribution to initiatives that will transform our business for the future\n- \u00b7 ways of working and people goals that capture how business strategy and performance goals have been delivered, and how leaders set their teams up for success.\n\nThe Board also has discretion to adjust STI or the vesting of deferred STI (DSTI) for individuals where it is appropriate to do so (see malus policy on page 86). In F22, the Board applied this discretion to reduce the STI outcomes for some current Group Executives, and DSTI or LTI vesting outcomes for some former Group Executives (see page 79).\n\n## Delivering STI outcomes:\n\nDepending on business and individual performance:\n\n- \u00b7 zero for below Entry performance\n- \u00b7 50% of Target for Entry performance\n- \u00b7 100% of Target for Target performance\n- \u00b7 150% of Target for Stretch performance.\n\nThe Board also has discretion to vary STI awards due to factors that are beyond these performance measures so that rewards appropriately reflect complete performance. In F22, the Board exercised this discretion resulting in an increase to the Group scorecard outcome from 60% to 70%. See page 76 for further details.\n\nGroup Executive STI awards are delivered:\n\n- \u00b7 50% as cash\n- \u00b7 50% deferred in share rights for two years.\n\nThe 50% deferred component supports increased share ownership, facilitates retention, and is a risk management lever to facilitate malus policy application during the deferral period.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The subsequent waves of COVID significantly impacted trading, and inflation, supply chain pressures worldwide and geopolitical disruption also accelerated through H2. The raw F22 STI scorecard outcome of 60% reflects these factors, with strong Sales offset by adverse impacts on EBIT, Customer Satisfaction and Working Capital Days metrics. In relation to the Working Capital Days metric, the drivers of the below Entry outcome were considered by the Board, the most material of which was the Board-endorsed decision to build inventory across key categories from early 2022. After reviewing the flow through impact, including on other STI and LTI metric outcomes, the Board exercised its discretion to set the outcome on the Working Capital Days metric at Entry. This results in the Group STI scorecard outcome increasing from 60% to 70% of Target.\n\nF22 performance against the STI scorecard was 60% of Target. Discretion exercised on Working Capital Days increased outcome to 70% of Target.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sales 1\n\nSales from continuing operations was $60,849 million, representing growth of 9.2%.

Performance across the Group was mixed. Australian Food EBIT was broadly flat vs F21 following a much improved second half. New Zealand Food's EBIT was below F21 reflecting supply chain and COVID additional costs and challenges, and BIG W was materially impacted by store closures in H1.

There was a strong improvement in Severity Rate in F22, with an outcome of 1.74. This result was driven by a reduction in high potential operationally controlled material risk events, a 6.4% reduction in team member recordable injuries/illnesses and a 13.8% reduction in customer claims.

The LTI measures represent financial and non-financial metrics. Reputation was introduced as an LTI metric to replace Sales per square metre for the F22-24 plan, and this will continue for F23-25. Sales per square metre applied for the F20-22 plan that recently vested and the F21-23 plan.\n\nLTI vesting for executive KMP is subject to Board approval (over and above meeting performance hurdles). This includes consideration under the malus policy. Measures and targets are reviewed annually.\n\n## Assessing business performance:\n\nThe LTI rewards executives subject to performance against three measures over a three-year performance period:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf0a2 Relative TSR - 40% weighting\n- \uf0a2 Return on Funds Employed - 40% weighting \uf0a2 Reputation - 20% weighting\n\n## Relative TSR\n\nrTSR is used as a measure in our LTI plan to align executive outcomes and long-term shareholder value creation. The peer group is the ASX30, excluding metals and mining companies. Vesting of 50% is achieved when our peer group ranking is at the median and 100% vesting when it is at the 75 th percentile or higher. Between the median and the 75 th percentile there is pro-rata vesting from 50% to 100%. Peer group ranking below the median results in zero vesting.\n\n## Return on Funds Employed\n\nROFE is an important measure to drive behaviours consistent with the delivery of long-term shareholder value. ROFE improvements can be delivered through earnings growth as well as the disciplined allocation of capital and management of assets and working capital. ROFE is defined as EBIT before significant items for the previous 12 months as a percentage of average (opening, mid and closing) funds employed, including significant item provisions.\n\n## Reputation\n\nReputation plays a key role in the extent to which customers choose to engage with Woolworths Group. It represents delivery against our purpose (internally), commitments (externally) - including our response to climate change - and evolving expectations of our customers. It also takes into account our relationship with our team, suppliers, and other key stakeholders. Reputation is measured using data from RepTrak, and measures brand reputation across four key metrics: trust, admiration, positive feeling and esteem. The score is calculated as the average of the previous 12 months rolling 12-month scores in the final year of the plan compared to baseline.\n\n## Vesting Schedule\n\nThe vesting schedule for these measures is:\n\n|         | rTSR  /one.tf     | ROFE              | Reputation        | TOTAL % MAX                |\n|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|\n| Entry   | /two.tf/zero.tf % | /eight.tf%        | /four.tf%         | /three.tf/two.tf%          |\n| Target  | n/a               | /two.tf/four.tf%  | /one.tf/two.tf%   |                            |\n| Stretch | /four.tf/zero.tf% | /four.tf/zero.tf% | /two.tf/zero.tf % | /one.tf/zero.tf /zero.tf % |\n\n- 1 Consistent with market practice, 50% of the rTSR tranche vests at the 50 th percentile, the entry point for vesting to occur, with stretch achieved at the 75th percentile.\n\n## Assessing individual performance:\n\nThe Board has discretion to adjust the vesting outcome for individuals where it is appropriate to do so (see malus policy on page 86).\n\n## Delivering LTI outcomes:\n\nExecutive KMP are awarded a maximum value of 170% of TFR as at the beginning of the three-year performance period. Awards of performance rights are made at face value based on the five-day VWAP up to and including 1 July at the beginning of the performance period. Dividends that would have been earned and reinvested over the performance period vest in the form of additional shares subject to the performance conditions. The deferred nature of LTI arrangements also provides a risk management lever to facilitate malus policy application during the performance period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n5\n\nO t her i n f o rm at i o n\n\n<!-- image -->",

Although COVID has had a significant impact on ROFE, resulting in an outcome below Entry for this measure, significant value has been created for shareholders, which is reflected in the strong LTI vesting outcome.\n\n## The F20-22 Award achieved 113.3% of Target (66.7% of Max)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Relative Total Shareholder Return\n\nWoolworths Group's TSR over the three-year performance period was 38.4%, ranking 7th in our peer group, which was a 78th percentile performance.

Amounts include:\n\n- \u00b7 TFR received (including base salary, superannuation, and car allowance)\n- \u00b7 other benefits received, including the deemed premium in respect of Director's and Officer's indemnity insurance\n- \u00b7 cash STI received for business and individual performance in F22\n- \u00b7 equity that vested during the year at face value for each plan\n- \u00b7 equity granted in F22 and all unvested equity awards (share rights for DSTI and performance rights for LTI).\n\nThe F20 DSTI plan vested on 1 July 2022, being the portion of the F20 STI award that was deferred as share rights. This represented 50% of the F20 STI award for executive KMP, except for the CEO who voluntarily forfeited his F20 STI award in acknowledgement of his accountability as CEO for the inadvertent underpayment of some of our salaried team members. The vested face value of the F20 DSTI award uses the Woolworths Group five-day VWAP up to and including 1 July 2022 ($35.9309).\n\nOn 1 July 2022, awards from the F20-22 WISP vested for the executive KMP. The disclosed value of the vested awards was determined using the Woolworths Group five-day VWAP up to and including 1 July 2022. The increase in share price and the accumulated dividends that would have been earned and reinvested over the period in the form of additional shares at vesting are contributing factors in the final value received by the executive KMP.\n\nThe individual tables on pages 79-81 also show progress against the minimum shareholding requirements (MSR) as at 1 July 2022. The aggregate value of current shareholdings and unvested DSTI awards are used to determine progress against MSR. Further detail on the MSR are included in Section 3.4.\n\n## F22 STI Adjustment\n\nDuring F22 further payment shortfalls were identified by the Board-initiated payroll review. Some of these shortfalls impacted STI and LTI paid to executive KMP and other members of the Group Executive Committee in prior years. The F22 STI awards for executive KMP were adjusted downwards by an amount equal to the payments they received in prior STI and LTI outcomes that would not have been paid if the shortfalls identified in the review (plus interest and on costs) had been included in the results of those prior years. Similar downward adjustments have been made to F22 STI awards for other Group Executive Committee members, and to DSTI or LTI vesting for former Group Executive Committee members, who were in those roles in the impacted years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nACTU\n\nTAR\n\nO t her i n f o rm at i o n\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\n## 2.4 Terms of executive KMP service agreements\n\nAll executive KMP are employed on service agreements that detail the components of remuneration paid but do not prescribe how remuneration levels are to be modified from year to year. The agreements do not provide for a fixed term, although the service agreements may be terminated on specified notice. The notice period is 12 months for the CEO and six months for all other executive KMP. Below is a summary of the termination provisions for executive KMP.\n\n## Termination by Woolworths Group\n\n## Termination by executive KMP\n\n## Where the notice period is worked:\n\n- \u00b7 TFR is paid in respect of and for the duration of the notice period.\n\n## Where the notice period is paid in lieu:\n\n- \u00b7 TFR in respect of the notice period (and, if appropriate, a reasonable estimate of STI) is paid as a lump sum.\n\n## In both circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 the extent to which STI, DSTI and LTI arrangements remain in place will be treated in accordance with the relevant rules for the award, including any exercise of discretion by the Board. Refer to Section 3.3 for further details.\n\n## If termination is for cause:\n\n- \u00b7 only accrued leave and unpaid total fixed remuneration for days worked is paid\n- \u00b7 STI, DSTI and LTI are forfeited.\n\n## Where the notice period is worked:\n\n- \u00b7 TFR is paid in respect of and for the duration of the notice period.\n\n## Where the notice period is paid in lieu:\n\n- \u00b7 TFR in respect of the notice period is paid as a lump sum.\n\n## In both circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 the extent to which STI is payable will be treated in accordance with the relevant rules for the award, including any exercise of discretion by the Board\n- \u00b7 unvested DSTI and LTI are treated in accordance with the relevant rules for the award and at the discretion of the Board. Refer to Section 3.3 for further detail.\n\nIn addition, and upon further payment (where required), the Company may invoke a restraint period of up to 12 months following separation, preventing executive KMP from engaging in any business activity with competitors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.5 F23 outlook\n\nEach year the Board reviews measures that are used in the STI and LTI plans to maintain relevance and alignment to the Group's strategic objectives. The Board believes the existing metrics continue to align incentive outcomes to successful delivery of the Group's strategy, and do not intend to make any changes to STI and LTI plans in F23.\n\n## Macroeconomic Outlook & Target Se/t\\_ting\n\nThe outlook for Woolworths Group for F23 continues to reflect uncertainty about the impact of COVID, supply chain disruptions and rising inflation on the business. Targets for F23 reflect the underlying assumptions of our plan, which include the expectation of some ongoing disruption but not to the same degree experienced in F22. The Board will continue to monitor performance and may apply discretion to outcomes should there be a significant divergence from the macro assumptions underlying the plan.\n\n## F23 Remuneration Changes\n\nThe Board reviews the remuneration for executive KMP each year to maintain alignment to the remuneration framework outlined in section 1.1. Following market benchmarking completed by PwC, and having regard to market competitiveness of total target reward packages, it was determined that an increase for executive KMP, other than the CEO, was warranted. This is the first increase for executive KMP in four years. The Board has approved the following increases, effective 1 September 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Ms Bardwell's TFR will increase to $1,075,000\n- \u00b7 Ms Davis' TFR will increase to $1,075,000\n- \u00b7 Mr Harrison's TFR will increase to $985,000\n\nThe Board determined that there will be no increase for Mr Banducci in F23.\n\n## Minimum Shareholding Requirements\n\nThe Board completed a review of the Group's shareholding requirement policy, including a review of market practice. The review found that the shareholding requirement policy continues to be an effective means of aligning the interests of KMP with those of shareholders. In order to simplify the policy and more closely align to market practice the period over which the Board Chair and CEO will be expected to achieve the MSR will be five years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

To achieve this alignment, the Board retains discretion over final performance and incentive outcomes, and recognises that there are cases where adjustments should be made. The Board considers PC recommendations and consequences of risk-related matters, including whether malus should be applied in the process of finalising incentive and reward outcomes. In determining reward outcomes, the Board will also pay specific attention to items that are:\n\n- \u00b7 outside of the control of management\n- \u00b7 the result of portfolio/strategy changes implemented but not envisaged in the original performance targets\n- \u00b7 due to significant change in asset valuations outside the normal course of business\n- \u00b7 significant risk management and compliance matters.\n\n## 3.2 Role of the People Commi/t\\_tee (PC)\n\nThe PC operates under its own Charter and reports to the Board. The role of the PC is to provide advice and assistance to the Board in relation to people management and remuneration policies, so that remuneration outcomes for senior executives are appropriate and aligned to company performance and shareholder expectations.\n\nThe PC reviews the CEO's proposal for performance and incentive outcomes with a risk lens. This incorporates advice from the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Chief People Officer (CPO), and Head of Internal Audit, as well as consultation with Committee Chairs and all directors to help inform its recommendations to the Board on the consequence of risk-related matters on variable remuneration of the CEO and his direct reports, and overall Group STI and LTI outcomes.\n\nA copy of the PC Charter is available on the website: www.woolworthsgroup.com.au.\n\nThe Chair of the Board and the Chair of the PC regularly engage with external stakeholders on remuneration arrangements.\n\n## Independent Remuneration Advisors\n\nWhere appropriate, the Board and the PC consult external remuneration advisors. When such external remuneration advisors are selected, the Board considers potential conflicts of interest. Advisors' terms of engagement regulate their access to, and (where required) set out their independence from, members of Woolworths Group management.\n\nThe requirement for external remuneration advisor services is assessed annually in the context of matters the PC needs to address. External advice is used as a guide, and does not serve as a substitute for directors' thorough consideration of the relevant matters.\n\nThe Board and PC engaged PwC as its independent remuneration advisor. While Woolworths Group seeks regular input from PwC, and PwC provided market benchmarking reports, no remuneration recommendations, as defined by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), were made by PwC.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.3 Treatment of unvested equity awards upon exit\n\nFor the DSTI and LTI plans, the Board has overriding discretion over the treatment of awards when an executive ceases employment. At the 2020 AGM, shareholders again approved providing the Board with discretion to determine how unvested share rights awards will be treated when an executive ceases employment.\n\nThe approach the Board would expect to take when exercising this discretion is:\n\n| REASON FOR LEAVING                                                          | DEFERRED STI                                                                                                                                   | UNVESTED LTI                                                                                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Remain on foot until the end  of the deferral period and vest  at that time | Award pro-rated for portion  of the performance period  participant has worked and  remains 'on foot' until the end  of the performance period | Genuine retirement                                                                               |\n| Death, illness and incapacity                                               |                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                  |\n| misconduct/poor performance Resignation                                     | Award forfeited Award forfeited                                                                                                                | Termination for cause/gross  Award forfeited Award forfeited                                     |\n| Mutual separation, redundancy, or other  reasons as determined by the Board | The Board will determine the appropriate treatment in the  circumstances on a case by case basis                                               | The Board will determine the appropriate treatment in the  circumstances on a case by case basis |\n\nIn cases of resignation, the Board will consider the circumstances surrounding each case to allow for the appropriate treatment. For instance, where the executive is not resigning to join a direct competitor and all reasonable steps have been taken to continue to support the success of the business through to their final date of employment, the Board may consider it appropriate to allow some incentive awards to remain on foot.\n\nIn any case, where an award remains on foot post employment, the Board retains absolute discretion under the various plan rules as to the final vesting outcome. The Board will continue to monitor the executive post employment and if they do not meet their post-employment obligations, the Board may lapse any remaining awards. For example, in cases where:\n\n- \u00b7 the executive resigns to join a competitor organisation, or in the Board's opinion the executive does not support the business to their final day of employment, any unvested DSTI and LTI will generally lapse\n- \u00b7 the executive retires from Woolworths, but then at a later date (and prior to vesting of awards) undertakes actions inconsistent with retirement, it may result in the Board reconsidering the treatment of any unvested awards.\n\nThe Board will disclose any exercise of discretion in relation to executive KMP in the Remuneration Report. No such discretion was exercised in F22.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The MSR is:\n\n- \u00b7 Chair - 200% of the annual Chair fee within four years of appointment. From 1 July 2022, the period over which the Chair will be expected to achieve the MSR will be five years. Further detail is set out on page 83.\n- \u00b7 Other non-executive directors - 100% of the annual base fee within three years of appointment.\n\nThe shares or share instruments may be held personally, by a close family member, within a self-managed superannuation fund, or by a family trust or private company.\n\nDetails of the current shareholdings for non-executive directors as at 26 June 2022 are provided in Section 5.3.\n\n## 4.3 Non-executive directors' equity plan\n\nThe non-executive director equity plan (NEDP) was introduced to encourage and facilitate share ownership, and was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 27 October 2021 to continue for a further three years. The NEDP provides a pre-set automated mechanism for participants to acquire shares, recognising that non-executive directors can often be limited in their ability to purchase shares because of Australian insider trading laws. Non-executive director share rights are allocated quarterly at the same time as the underlying shares are issued to the plan's trustee. For Australian-based directors, these rights convert into ordinary shares each half year; and for US-based directors, these rights convert into shares at the end of the director's tenure or other prescribed events (with additional shares equivalent to the dividends that would have been earned and reinvested on those rights), subject to compliance with the securities trading policy.\n\nThe NEDP supports the minimum shareholding requirement for Board members as it allows non-executive directors to reach the minimum shareholding requirements more quickly, as shares are acquired on a pre-tax basis. Details of the share rights allocated to non-executive directors are set out in Section 5.2.\n\nNon-Executive\n\nDirectors' Arrangements\n\n/four.tf\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Unvested share rights or performance rights did not receive Endeavour Group shares upon demerger. This reduced the value of these rights after Woolworths share price traded lower to reflect the demerger of Endeavour. To maintain the award values, executive KMP received an adjustment increasing the number of share rights in the on foot plans (including the F20 WISP, F20 DSTI and F21 WISP) as at 24 June 2021, being the date the team members received an adjustment.

The Financial Report of the Company is for the 52-week period ended 26 June 2022 and comprises the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The comparative period is for the 52-week period ended 27 June 2021.\n\nThe Financial Report was authorised for issue by the directors on 25 August 2022.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Australian dollars and amounts have been rounded to the nearest million dollars unless otherwise stated, in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or at fair values as at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies. The accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements, unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group are general purpose financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 , Australian Accounting Standards, and other authoritative pronouncements issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB).\n\nCompliance with Australian Accounting Standards ensures that the Financial Report complies with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Consequently, this Financial Report has been prepared in accordance with and complies with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\n\nCertain comparative amounts have been re-presented to conform with the current period's presentation to better reflect the nature of the financial position and performance of the Group.\n\nDuring the current period:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group ceased to control Endeavour Group following the demerger and in accordance with AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (AASB 5), the gain on demerger of the Endeavour Group was presented separately in the current period and within discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. Refer to Note 5.2 for further details; and\n- \u00b7 The Board approved the establishment of a new operating segment, Australian B2B. In accordance with AASB 8 Operating Segments (AASB 8), the Group restated the amounts presented in the prior period to reflect the newly reportable segment as a separate segment. Refer to Note 2.2 for further details.\n\nThe directors have, at the time of approving the Financial Report, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The going concern basis of accounting has been determined after taking into consideration all available information at the time of approving the Financial Report, including the impact from potential climate-related risks within the foreseeable future.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 1.2 Other signi/ficant accounting policies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section sets out the significant accounting policies upon which the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared as a whole and significant accounting policies not otherwise described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Where a significant accounting policy is specific to a note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the policy is described within that note.\n\n## 1.2.1 Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company incorporate the assets, liabilities, and results of all entities controlled by the Group as at and for the period ended 26 June 2022. The Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, it is exposed to, or has rights to, the variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Controlled entities are fully consolidated from the date that the Group obtains control and are deconsolidated from the date that the Group loses control. Intragroup balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity and are initially measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets. This election is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the carrying amounts of non-controlling interests are adjusted for the non-controlling interests' share of changes in equity.\n\n## 1.2.2 Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis after deducting supplier rebates and settlement discounts, and includes other costs incurred to bring inventory to its present condition and location for sale. The net realisable value of inventory has been determined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated selling expenses.\n\n## 1.2.3 Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classi/fied as held for sale or distribution\n\nNon-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale or distribution are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is met only when the sale is highly probable, the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition, and the sale is expected to occur within one year from the date of classification.\n\n## 1.2.4 Foreign currency\n\n## (I) FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Australian dollars (AUD), which is the Company's functional currency.\n\n## (II) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS (ENTITIES WITH A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF AUD)\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into AUD using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to AUD at the reporting date at the following exchange rates:\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNT\n\nAPPLICABLE EXCHANGE RATE\n\n| Monetary assets and liabilities                                 | Reporting date      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost | Date of transaction |\n\nForeign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss in the period in which they arise except:\n\n- \u00b7 Exchange differences on transactions entered to hedge certain foreign currency risks (refer to Note 4.7); and\n- \u00b7 Items noted within paragraph (iii).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.2\n\nOther signi/ficant accounting policies\n\n(continued)\n\n## (III) FOREIGN OPERATIONS (ENTITIES WITH A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OTHER THAN AUD)\n\nThe profit or loss and financial position of foreign operations are translated to AUD at the following exchange rates:\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNT\n\nAPPLICABLE EXCHANGE RATE\n\n| Revenues and expenses                                                                          | Average for the period   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation | Reporting date           |\n| Equity items                                                                                   | Historical rates         |\n\nThe following foreign exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income:\n\n- \u00b7 Foreign currency differences arising on translation of foreign operations; and\n- \u00b7 Exchange differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future. These monetary items and related hedges are considered to form part of the net investment in a foreign operation and are reclassified into the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss upon disposal of the net investment.\n\n## 1.2.5 Goods and Services Tax (GST)\n\nRevenue, expenses, and assets are recognised net of GST, except where the GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the expense or cost of the asset. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amounts of GST recoverable from or payable to the taxation authorities are included as a current asset or current liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Cash flows are included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which are recoverable from or payable to taxation authorities are classified as operating cash flows.\n\n## 1.2.6 New and amended standards adopted by the Group\n\nThe Group has adopted all relevant new and amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the AASB, which are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 28 June 2021. None of the new standards or amendments to standards that are mandatory for the first time materially affected any of the amounts recognised in the current period or any prior period.\n\n## 1.2.7 Issued standards and interpretations not early adopted\n\nThe AASB has issued a number of standards and interpretations, which are not effective until future reporting periods. Notwithstanding that the Group has not early adopted these issued standards and interpretations, the estimated impact on adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Tentative agenda decision relating to cash received via electronic transfer\n\nIn September 2021, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (Committee) reached a tentative agenda decision in response to a submission relating to the recognition of cash received via an electronic transfer system as settlement for a financial asset. The submission considered that, in the event that an electronic transfer system has an automated settlement process and therefore all cash transfers made by customers is via the system and are settled at least two working days after they are initiated by the customer to settle the trade receivable, whether the Group can derecognise the trade receivable and recognise cash on the date that the cash transfer is initiated, rather than on the date that the cash transfer is settled. The decision relating to when the Group can derecognise the trade receivable and recognise cash has not been finalised. Given that the tentative agenda decision was released during the period and discussions continue, the Group has not adopted this agenda decision in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial period ended 26 June 2022.\n\n## AASB 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nAASB 17 Insurance Contracts (AASB 17) establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts and supersedes AASB 4 Insurance Contracts (AASB 4).\n\nNotwithstanding that the Group is not an insurance business and the date of initial application of AASB 17 is for the financial period commencing 26 June 2023, the adoption of AASB 17 is expected to impact the stand-alone Statement of Financial Position of the parent entity, Woolworths Group Limited, as it provides insurance to the subsidiaries of the Group and therefore, is deemed to be an insurer. At the Group level, the impact from AASB 17 will be eliminated upon consolidation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

The estimates, judgements, and assumptions are based on historical experience, adjusted for current market conditions, and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and are reviewed on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and judgements which involve a higher degree of complexity or that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next period are included in the following notes:\n\n- \u00b7 Note 3.2 - Other financial assets and liabilities;\n- \u00b7 Note 3.3 - Leases;\n- \u00b7 Note 3.8 - Impairment of non-financial assets; and\n- \u00b7 Note 3.11 - Provisions.\n\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period; or in the period and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\n## 1.4 Individually signi/ficant items\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndividually significant items have been highlighted to help users of this Financial Report understand the financial performance of the Group during the reporting period.\n\nThe significant items recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss are as follows:\n\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf                                                        | GAIN/slash.case/parenleft.caseLOSS/parenright.case  BEFORE  INCOME TAX $M   | INCOME TAX  BENEFIT/slash.case /parenleft.caseEXPENSE/parenright.case $M   | NET GAIN/slash.case /parenleft.caseLOSS/parenright.case FOR  THE PERIOD $M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Continuing operations                                                                |                                                                             |                                                                            |                                                                              |\n| End-to-end payroll review remediation                                                | (/one.tf/six.tf/five.tf)                                                    | /five.tf/zero.tf                                                           | (/one.tf/one.tf /five.tf )                                                   |\n| Supply chain network review                                                          | /two.tf/four.tf                                                             | (/seven.tf)                                                                | /one.tf/seven.tf                                                             |\n| Revaluation of put option liabilities over non-controlling interests                 | /one.tf/six.tf /four.tf                                                     | -                                                                          | /one.tf/six.tf /four.tf                                                      |\n| Additional share-based payments expense as a result of the  Endeavour Group demerger | (/four.tf/six.tf)                                                           | -                                                                          | (/four.tf/six.tf)                                                            |\n| Gain on sale of Endeavour Group shares held by the share trust                       | /two.tf/four.tf                                                             | (/one.tf/one.tf)                                                           | /one.tf/three.tf                                                             |\n|                                                                                      | /one.tf                                                                     | /three.tf/two.tf                                                           | /three.tf/three.tf                                                           |\n| Discontinued operations                                                              |                                                                             |                                                                            |                                                                              |\n| Gain on demerger of Endeavour Group                                                  | /six.tf,/three.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf                                         | -                                                                          | /six.tf,/three.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf                                          |\n| Total Group significant items                                                        | /six.tf,/three.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf                                         | /three.tf/two.tf                                                           | /six.tf,/four.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                                              |\n\n- 1.4 Individually signi/ficant items (continued)\n\n## End-to-end payroll review remediation\n\nAs part of the Group's end-to-end payroll review program put in place to review payroll systems and processes, and to establish robust pay processes across the Woolworths Group, certain areas of non-compliance have been identified. During the period, the Group recognised $165 million predominantly relating to prior period payment shortfalls of hourly paid team members and other one-off remediation charges, such as interest. The payment shortfalls of hourly paid team members paid under retail Enterprise Agreements (EAs) predominantly relate to the previous three annual reporting periods. The annual amount has not had a material impact on the Group's financial performance in any of the individual periods to which they relate. Refer to Note 3.11 for further details.\n\n## Supply chain network review\n\nAs part of the Group's ongoing supply chain network strategy and transformation, a provision for redundancy costs associated with the announced closure of four distribution centres in New South Wales and Victoria was recognised in prior periods. During the current period, the Group reassessed the provision for redundancy costs and due to changes to the timing of planned closures, changes in shift arrangements, and increased levels of turnover, the costs relating to future redundancies has reduced. As a result, the Group recognised a $24 million gain in the period on reassessment of this provision.\n\n## Revaluation of put option liabilities over non-controlling interests\n\nDuring the period, the Group acquired an additional 2.6% equity interest in Quantium, which increased its shareholding from 75.0% to 77.6%. As a result, the Group recognised a reduction in the put option liability of $22 million, which represents the excess of the amount initially expected to be paid after 30 June 2024, over the amount paid for the shares acquired during the current period.\n\nThe Group has recognised put option liabilities over its non-controlling interests of PFD and Quantium. At each reporting period, the put option liabilities are reassessed to reflect the present value of the Group's best estimate of the amounts to be paid at the time of exercise. During the period, a net revaluation gain of $142 million was recognised and is primarily driven by the delays in the timing of expected earnings, resulting in lower than forecast earnings at the expected put option exercise date.\n\nAs a result, a total revaluation gain of $164 million was recognised during the current period.\n\n## Additional share-based payments expense as a result of the Endeavour Group demerger\n\nDuring the period, the Group incurred an additional share-based payments expense of $46 million relating to additional share rights awarded to team members whose unvested employee share plans were impacted by the Endeavour Group demerger. This charge reflects the fair value of the additional share rights awarded.\n\n## Gain on sale of Endeavour Group shares held by the share trust\n\nDuring the period, the Group recognised a gain of $24 million relating to proceeds from the sale of Endeavour Group shares that were received by the Group's share trust on the demerger record date of 1 July 2021.\n\n## Gain on demerger of Endeavour Group\n\nOn 28 June 2021, the Group lost control of Endeavour Group and recognised a gain of $6,387 million in discontinued operations, which mainly represents the difference between the net assets of Endeavour Group derecognised on transfer to shareholders and the combination of the (i) derecognition of the non-controlling interest share of Endeavour Group's net assets, (ii) recognition of the retained investment in Endeavour Group at fair value, and (iii) derecognition of the demerger distribution liability.

This section provides a summary of the key financial reporting impacts of COVID and sustainability related matters.\n\nThe financial performance of the Group and its reportable segments continues to be impacted by COVID. For the Group's period ended 26 June 2022 (F22), sales from continuing operations grew by 9.2% or 5.1%, excluding the acquisitions of PFD in H1 F22 and Quantium in H2 F21. EBIT from continuing operations declined by 4.7% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher COVID-related costs in H1 F22 in Australian Food and H2 F22 in New Zealand as well as BIG W store closures. Notwithstanding the challenging operating environment caused by supply chain disruptions, product shortages, team absenteeism, and flooding, the Group continues to make progress towards its strategic and sustainability agendas through various initiatives across the Group's reportable segments. During the period, the Group continued to advance on its strategic pillars, People, Planet, and Product, with its focus on the Planet pillar resulting in a 31% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions compared to its 2015 baseline.\n\nThe financial performance of the Group's reportable segments, including the impacts of COVID and sustainability related matters, is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Australian Food - sales grew by 4.5%, while EBIT increased by 5.4% for the period. In H1 F22, sales grew by 3.4% from the prior period, benefitting from higher in-home consumption driven by extended COVID lockdowns in New South Wales and Victoria, however was offset by material COVID disruption to the end-to-end supply chain. In Woolworths Retail, sales increased by 4.3%, mainly driven by eCommerce sales growth and Woolworths Supermarkets store-originated sales returning to growth in H2 F22. In WooliesX, B2B eCommerce sales growth remained strong and increased by 42.3%, representing 10.3% of Woolworths Retail sales. Despite significant pressure on the Group's team members from heightened demand, absenteeism and supply chain challenges, customer experience improved materially in Q4 F22 with VOC NPS up 11 points on Q3 F22. Metro Food Stores sales increased by 6.0% due to new store growth with five net new stores opened during the period and increased traffic in On the Go stores. During the period, continued progress towards the Group's sustainability agenda was made, with the achievement of 50 million meals donated to OzHarvest, the signing of renewable energy partnerships in South Australia, and the announced group-wide removal of reusable plastic bags.\n- \u00b7 Australian B2B - sales for the period were $3,963 million compared to $1,222 million in the prior period, primarily reflecting the acquisition of PFD at the beginning of the period and the first-time inclusion of Endeavour Group partnership revenue. On an underlying basis, all B2B businesses reported higher sales in F22 despite continued COVID disruptions.\n- \u00b7 New Zealand Food - sales increased by 6.6% to $7,092 million with H1 F22 benefitting from nationwide lockdowns in mid-August which increased in-home consumption. In H2 F22, EBIT was negatively impacted due to significant disruptions to stores and supply chain due to Omicron. Notwithstanding the challenging F22 operating and trading conditions, which included a three-day strike in late November 2021, widespread Omicron community transmission, and global shipping challenges, good progress was made to support the Group's sustainability agenda, including the launch of new funding for climate change combatting projects under the Group's Growing For Good initiative.\n- \u00b7 BIG W - sales decreased to $4,431 million or 3.3% compared to the prior period. Despite a period of store closures in H1 F22, when a quarter of trading days were impacted, sales increased by 4% in H2 F22. In Q3 F22, sales were impacted by limited customer mobility due to Omicron early in the quarter, however recovered in Q4 F22 with strong Easter, Mother's Day and Toy Mania events, and the cycling of lockdown impacts in some Victorian stores in the prior year. In Q3 F22, EBIT was also impacted by Omicron, high levels of absenteeism, and sick leave. During the period, progress towards the Group's sustainability agendas continued with the activation of ethical partnerships within the value chain such as memberships to Action Collaboration Transformation and Better Cotton Initiative. BIG W also launched its partnership with the Australian Literacy and Numeracy Foundation, the Free Books for Kids initiative, which distributed over 2.4 million free books to families, and the Toys for Joy initiative that helped to prevent 18 tonnes of toys going to landfill.\n- \u00b7 Other - primarily comprises the Group's costs, the Group's share of profit or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method (including $72 million of the Group's share of profit of Endeavour Group), and Quantium, which is not considered a separately reportable segment.\n\n1.5\n\nFinancial reporting impacts of COVID and sustainability related ma/t\\_ters (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial reporting impacts of COVID\n\nIn addition to the impact on financial performance, the Group has also considered the impact of COVID across its businesses. Details about the impact of COVID are included in the following notes:\n\n- \u00b7 Note 3.1 - Trade and other receivables; and\n- \u00b7 Note 3.8 - Impairment of non-financial assets.\n\n## Financial reporting impacts of sustainability related matters\n\nOn 31 March 2022, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) issued two exposure drafts in response to the demand for better information about sustainability related matters.\n\n## The exposure drafts issued were:\n\n- \u00b7 Proposed IFRS S1 General Requirements of Sustainability related Financial Information, which sets out the core content for a complete set of sustainability related financial disclosures, thereby establishing a comprehensive baseline of sustainability related financial information; and\n- \u00b7 Proposed IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures, which will require the Group to provide information that enables the users of its financial statements to understand the Group's governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets in relation to climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nNotwithstanding that the exposure drafts are not mandatory for adoption for the financial period ended 26 June 2022, the Group has acknowledged the demand for sustainability related disclosures and has considered the potential impacts of sustainability related matters within the following notes:\n\n- \u00b7 Note 3.4 - Property, plant and equipment;\n- \u00b7 Note 3.8 - Impairment of non-financial assets;\n- \u00b7 Note 3.11 - Provisions; and\n- \u00b7 Note 4.6 - Borrowings.\n\nDuring the period, acute flooding events in Northern New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia resulted in damages to critical rail and road infrastructure, which adversely affected the Group's supply chain network. As a result, the Group activated complex supply chain contingency plans to manage the transportation of essential goods to customers, which increased supply chain costs within the period as well as caused business interruptions due to store closures within the affected regions.\n\nThe impacts from these acute weather events continues to be an area of focus for the Group as it increases the resilience of its supply chain network.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where payment for the goods is received prior to control transferring to the customer, revenue recognition is deferred in contract liabilities within trade and other payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position until the goods have been delivered to, or collected by, the customer.\n\n## Loyalty program\n\nRewards points granted by the Group provide customers with a material right to a discount on future purchases. The amounts allocated to rewards points are deferred in contract liabilities within trade and other payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position until they are redeemed by the customer.\n\n## 2.2 Segment disclosures from continuing operations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group identifies different business units that are regularly reviewed by the Board in order to allocate resources and assess performance. These business units offer different products and services and are managed separately. The segment disclosures present the financial performance of each business unit and other material items.\n\n## 2.2.1 Operating segment reporting from continuing operations\n\nReportable segments from continuing operations are identified on the basis of internal reports on the business units of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Board, including the Chief Executive Officer, in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance. These business units offer different products and services, or service different customer types, and are managed separately.\n\nDuring the period, the Board approved the establishment of a new operating segment, Australian B2B, which comprises B2B Food and B2B Supply Chain. B2B Food includes PFD, Woolworths International, Woolworths at Work, and Australian Grocery Wholesalers. B2B Supply Chain includes external Primary Connect revenue (including Endeavour Group and other third-party customers) and Statewide Independent Wholesalers (SIW) in Tasmania.\n\nThe Group's reportable segments from continuing operations are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Australian Food - procurement of food and related products for resale and provision of services to retail customers in Australia;\n- \u00b7 Australian B2B - procurement and distribution of food and related products for resale to other businesses and provision of supply chain services to business customers in Australia;\n- \u00b7 New Zealand Food - procurement of food and drinks for resale and provision of services to retail customers in New Zealand;\n- \u00b7 BIG W - procurement of discount general merchandise products for resale to retail customers in Australia; and\n- \u00b7 Other - comprises Quantium, which is not considered a separately reportable segment, as well as various support functions, including property and Group overhead costs, the Group's share of profit or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method (including Endeavour Group), and consolidation and elimination journals.\n\nThere are varying levels of integration between the Group's reportable segments from continuing operations. This includes the common usage of property, services and administration functions. Intersegment pricing is determined on commercial terms.\n\nThe primary reporting measure of the reportable segments is earnings before interest, tax, and significant items which is consistent with the way management monitors and reports the performance of these segments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, at a Group level, this is recognised as a reduction in cost of sales. As a result, a $302 million (2021: $251 million) reduction in revenue, with a corresponding increase in cost of sales, has been recognised in the Other segment. At a Group level, this has not resulted in a change to earnings before interest and tax.\n- 2 Significant items net gain before tax of $1 million comprises a $24 million gain in Australian Food relating to the supply chain network review, which is offset by a $23 million net loss in Other.

COVID has not had a material impact on the loss allowances recognised at the end of the period.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less a loss allowance. They generally have terms of up to 30 days.\n\n## Impairment of trade and other receivables\n\nThe Group assesses the expected credit losses associated with its trade and other receivables on a forward-looking basis. The Group applies the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade and other receivables that share similar credit risk characteristics and days past due are grouped together and then assessed for collectability as a whole.\n\n## 3.2 Other /financial assets and liabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther financial assets and liabilities consist of derivatives, the Group's holdings in unlisted investments, loans provided to related parties, convertible and Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) notes, and put options over non-controlling interests.\n\n|                                               | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf $M   | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf $M   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Other financial assets                        |                                    |                                     |\n| Current                                       |                                    |                                     |\n| Derivatives                                   | /one.tf/zero.tf /six.tf            | /one.tf/nine.tf                     |\n| Total current other financial assets          | /one.tf/zero.tf /six.tf            | /one.tf/nine.tf                     |\n| Non-current                                   |                                    |                                     |\n| Derivatives                                   | /one.tf/seven.tf                   | /seven.tf                           |\n| Unlisted equity securities                    | /six.tf/zero.tf                    | /three.tf/three.tf                  |\n| Loans provided to related parties             | /seven.tf                          | /three.tf                           |\n| Convertible and SAFE notes                    | /one.tf/one.tf                     | /six.tf/two.tf                      |\n| Total non-current other financial assets      | /nine.tf/five.tf                   | /one.tf/zero.tf /five.tf            |\n| Total other financial assets                  | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf             | /one.tf/two.tf/four.tf              |\n| Other financial liabilities                   |                                    |                                     |\n| Current                                       |                                    |                                     |\n| Derivatives                                   | /three.tf/four.tf                  | /two.tf/zero.tf                     |\n| Put options over non-controlling interests    | /seven.tf/five.tf                  | /one.tf/four.tf /five.tf            |\n| Total current other financial liabilities     | /one.tf/zero.tf /nine.tf           | /one.tf/six.tf /five.tf             |\n| Non-current                                   |                                    |                                     |\n| Derivatives                                   | /one.tf/three.tf/five.tf           | /six.tf                             |\n| Put options over non-controlling interests    | /five.tf/five.tf/five.tf           | /two.tf/four.tf/five.tf             |\n| Total non-current other financial liabilities | /six.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf            | /two.tf /five.tf/one.tf             |\n| Total other financial liabilities             | /seven.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf          | /four.tf/one.tf/six.tf              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Derivatives\n\nRefer to Note 4.7 for details of derivatives.\n\n## Unlisted equity securities\n\nThe Group's investments in unlisted equity securities are initially designated as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, where investments are not held for trading. Investments are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs, and in subsequent periods, are measured at fair value with any change recognised in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, depending on their initial designation. Dividends received from unlisted equity securities are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Put options over non-controlling interests\n\nThe Group's put options over non-controlling interests are initially recognised at the present value of the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise with a corresponding entry to other reserves (refer to Note 4.4 for further details).\n\nAt each reporting period, the Group reassesses its put options over non-controlling interests and any changes in the estimate of the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise and the interest discount is unwound in finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Any reasonably possible changes to these inputs would result in a change to the valuation. Refer to Note 4.7.4 for sensitivity analysis of put options over non-controlling interests.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise has been discounted using the Group's marginal cost of debt for borrowing over a similar term.\n\n## 3.3 Leases\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group leases various properties (stores, support offices, distribution centres, and warehouses), equipment, and vehicles.\n\n## 3.3.1 Lease assets\n\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf                 | PROPERTIES  $M                            | PLANT AND   EQUIPMENT  $M   | OTHER  $M           | TOTAL  $M                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Cost                                          | /one.tf/nine.tf,/zero.tf /six.tf/three.tf | /two.tf/eight.tf/one.tf     | /six.tf/zero.tf     | /one.tf/nine.tf,/four.tf/zero.tf/four.tf |\n| Less: Accumulated depreciation and impairment | (/nine.tf, /two.tf/six.tf/two.tf)         | (/one.tf/zero.tf/three.tf)  | (/four.tf /four.tf) | (/nine.tf,/four.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf)      |\n| Carrying amount at end of period              | /nine.tf , /eight.tf /zero.tf/one.tf      | /one.tf/seven.tf /eight.tf  | /one.tf/six.tf      | /nine.tf,/nine.tf/nine.tf/five.tf        |\n| Movement:                                     |                                           |                             |                     |                                          |\n| Carrying amount at start of period            | /nine.tf,/four.tf/zero.tf/six.tf          | /one.tf/three.tf/six.tf     | /one.tf/one.tf      | /nine.tf, /five.tf/five.tf/three.tf      |\n| Additions                                     | /five.tf/one.tf/four.tf                   | /six.tf/nine.tf             | /one.tf/one.tf      | /five.tf/nine.tf /four.tf                |\n| Acquisition of businesses                     | /three.tf/three.tf/zero.tf                | /three.tf/nine.tf           | -

Accordingly, these lease contracts are not included in the calculation of the Group's lease liabilities. The Group has estimated that the potential future lease payments for these lease contracts as at the end of the financial period would result in an increase in undiscounted lease liabilities of $1,669 million (2021: $983 million).\n\n## 3.3.3 Other amounts recognised\n\n|                                                                                        | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf $M   | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf $M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss (included in branch expenses)                 |                                    |                                     |\n| Variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities /one.tf   | /one.tf/one.tf/zero.tf             | /seven.tf/five.tf                   |\n| Expense relating to short-term leases                                                  | /one.tf/six.tf                     | /one.tf/nine.tf                     |\n| Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (included in payments to suppliers and employees) |                                    |                                     |\n| Payments for short-term leases, service components of leases, and variable payments    | /six.tf/two.tf/five.tf             | /six.tf /zero.tf/one.tf             |\n\n- 1 Variable lease payments represent less than 5% of total lease payments (2021: 3% of total lease payments).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception of the contract. A lease conveys the right to direct the use and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A lease liability and corresponding lease asset are recognised at commencement of the lease.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of lease payments during the lease term that are not yet paid, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be determined, at the Group's incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease term. Lease payments (excluding non-lease components) include:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u00b7 Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;\n- \u00b7 Amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 Exercise price of a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise; and\n- \u00b7 Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. When there is a change in lease term or a change in future lease payments, lease liabilities are remeasured, with a corresponding adjustment to lease assets.\n\n## Lease assets\n\nLease assets are initially measured at cost comprising the initial lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date (less any lease incentives received), any initial direct costs, and any restoration costs. Lease assets are subsequently depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset. Lease assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy adopted for non-financial assets in Note 3.8.\n\n## Short-term leases\n\nShort-term leases are those with a lease term of 12 months or less. The costs associated with these leases are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss as incurred.\n\n## Holdover leases\n\nIn assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to extend or renew a lease in holdover, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to remain in the leased premises and whether a lease asset and lease liability should be recognised.\n\n3.3\n\nLeases\n\n(continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Variable lease payments\n\nThe Group has some property leases, which contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales generated from a store and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## Non-lease components\n\nThe Group separates the non-lease components for property leases based on a residual method using property outgoings market data and separates the non-lease components for other leases based on the individual contract breakdown of these costs or otherwise best estimate of these costs. Non-lease components of lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss as incurred and include items such as embedded property outgoings, repairs and maintenance.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates\n\n## Determining the lease term\n\nIn determining the lease term, the Group considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment. Extension options are most common for property leases.

Determining the incremental borrowing rate requires significant judgement. The discount rate is derived from key external market based rates and the Group's credit margin, whilst considering the type of asset being leased, and the length of the lease. At the end of the reporting period, the weighted average incremental borrowing rate for the Group was 4.4% (2021: 4.4%).\n\n- 1 Represents the weighted average number of years from the end of the reporting period to the end of the reasonably certain lease term.\n- 2 Represents the weighted average number of years from the end of the reporting period to the contractual lease end date, which has been disclosed for informative purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and a proportion of overheads. The cost of development properties (those being constructed or developed for future use) includes borrowing, holding, and development costs until the asset is complete.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nAssets (excluding freehold land) are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives to their residual values. Freehold land is not depreciated. Useful lives and residual values are reassessed at each reporting period following the Group's consideration of physical, economic and environmental factors, which includes, but is not limited to, asset condition, expected use, wear-and-tear, technology changes, and climate-related risks. Any changes to the estimate are accounted for on a prospective basis and where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate assets. The useful lives are as follows:\n\n| Buildings              | 25-40 years    |\n|------------------------|----------------|\n| Plant and equipment    | 2.5-20 years   |\n| Leasehold improvements | Up to 25 years |\n\n## Disposal of assets\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n## Impairment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy for impairment of non-financial assets as disclosed in Note 3.8.\n\n## Financial reporting impacts of sustainability related matters\n\n## Useful lives\n\nDuring the period, there were no changes to the useful lives of property, plant and equipment as a result of climate-related risks. If in future reporting periods there are changes to the proposed useful lives and/or residual values due to climate-related risks, these changes will be accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\nFor the financial period ended 26 June 2022, the weighted average remaining life of the Group's property, plant and equipment is approximately eight years. Buildings, freehold land and leasehold improvements represent 46% and plant and equipment represent 54% of the Group's total property, plant and equipment, with a weighted average remaining useful life of 7.5 years and 8.5 years respectively. The Group has identified climate-related risks to its assets and is currently working through actions to address these risks, including stores in the monsoonal north are built to standards addressing cyclone risk, stores with high risk of power outages have back up generation or portable generator connection points, stores in flood prone areas have flood barriers, and rainwater harvesting in high stress water areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Goodwill arises when the Group acquires a business at a cost which exceeds the fair value of net assets acquired and represents the synergies expected to arise from the purchase. Brand names have mainly been recognised as a result of New Zealand supermarket acquisitions and help to identify and differentiate the Group's network from others. Software includes programs and operating systems used by the Group.\n\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf                 | GOODWILL  $M                         | BRAND  NAMES  $M          | SOFTWARE /one.tf $M                  | OTHER  $M                 | TOTAL  $M                            |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Cost                                          | /three.tf,/three.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf | /three.tf/zero.tf/five.tf | /three.tf , /zero.tf/one.tf /five.tf | /three.tf/five.tf/one.tf  | /six.tf,/nine.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf    |\n| Less: accumulated amortisation and impairment | (/one.tf/one.tf/zero.tf )            | -

Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing fees to obtain access to the cloud provider's application software, are recognised as operating expenses when the services are received.\n\nSome of these costs incurred are for the development of a software code that enhances, modifies, or creates additional capability to existing on-premise systems and meets the definition of and recognition criteria for an intangible asset. These costs are recognised as intangible software assets and are amortised over the useful life of the software on a straight-line basis. The useful lives of these assets are reviewed annually, and any change is accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets include customer relationships and contracts, intellectual property, and algorithms, which are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Where the asset is acquired in a business combination, cost represents the fair value at the date of acquisition.\n\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Useful lives are reassessed annually. The useful lives of intangible assets have been assessed as follows:\n\n| Customer relationships and contracts   | Three to 10 years   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Intellectual property and algorithms   | Nine years          |\n\nOther intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy for impairment of non-financial assets disclosed in Note 3.8.\n\n## 3.7 Investments accounted for using the equity method\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method represent the Group's investments in associates and joint ventures in which the Group has significant influence or joint control.\n\n## 3.7.1 Details of investments accounted for using the equity method\n\n|                                                                             | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf     | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                                                             | OWNERSHIP  INTEREST  %          | $M                                | OWNERSHIP  INTEREST  %           | $M                               |\n| Endeavour Group Limited                                                     | /one.tf/four.tf ./six.tf        | /one.tf,/six.tf/four.tf/six.tf    | /eight.tf/five.tf./four.tf       | -                                |\n| Other individually immaterial investments in associates  and joint ventures | -                               | /four.tf/five.tf                  | -                                | /three.tf/zero.tf                |\n|                                                                             |                                 | /one.tf , /six.tf /nine.tf/one.tf |                                  | /three.tf/zero.tf                |\n\nOn 28 June 2021, the Group lost control of Endeavour Group Limited, an Australian company, and recognised the retained 14.6% equity interest at fair value as an investment in associate. The fair value was calculated using the VWAP of Endeavour Group Limited shares trading on the ASX in their first five trading days ($6.21).\n\nFollowing the initial recognition of its investment in associate, the Group applies the equity method of accounting and recognises its share of total comprehensive income of Endeavour Group Limited for the current period based on consensus data.

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, and is determined for an individual asset where possible, otherwise, for the CGU to which it belongs.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Investments accounted for using the equity method\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method comprises investments in associates and joint ventures. An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control.\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method are initially recognised at cost, and are subsequently accounted for using the equity method by including the Group's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income or loss of the associate or joint venture in the carrying amount of the investment until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases. Dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment in associate or joint venture.\n\n3.8\n\nImpairment of non-/financial assets (continued)\n\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, indefinite life intangible assets are allocated to each of the Group's CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies relating to the business combination, identified according to operating segments and grouped at the lowest levels for which the assets are monitored for internal management purposes, as follows:\n\n|                              | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf      | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf       | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf   |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                              | GOODWILL  $M                       | BRAND  NAMES  $M                | GOODWILL  $M                         | BRAND  NAMES  $M                 |\n| Australian Food              | /six.tf/two.tf/seven.tf            | /three.tf                       | /three.tf /eight.tf/one.tf           | /three.tf                        |\n| Australian B/two.tfB /one.tf | /three.tf/six.tf/one.tf            | /four.tf/three.tf               | -                                    | -                                |\n| New Zealand Food             | /two.tf,/zero.tf/six.tf/seven.tf   | /two.tf/four.tf/zero.tf         | /two.tf,/one.tf/one.tf/two.tf        | /two.tf/four.tf/three.tf         |\n| Quantium /two.tf             | /one.tf/four.tf/three.tf           | /one.tf/nine.tf                 | /three.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf          | /one.tf/nine.tf                  |\n|                              | /three.tf,/one.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf | /three.tf/zero.tf/five.tf       | /two.tf , /eight.tf /eight.tf/one.tf | /two.tf/six.tf/five.tf           |\n\n- 1 The Australian B2B reportable segment includes goodwill of $354 million recognised on acquisition of PFD and $7 million relating to the acquisition of other smaller businesses, and $43 million of brand names relating to the acquisition of PFD.\n- 2 During the period, the Group finalised its acquisition accounting and its initial allocation of goodwill relating to the acquisition of Quantium. As a result, $245 million of the $388 million of goodwill was allocated to the Australian Food reportable segment, which is based on where the expected benefits from the Quantium acquisition are expected to be earned.\n\nCGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. Where the carrying value of the asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount through the recognition of an impairment loss.\n\nThe Group's impairment testing is performed at the reportable segment level, business unit level and where applicable, an individual store or region level. During the period, no material impairment losses were recognised.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial reporting impacts of COVID\n\n## Calculation of recoverable amount\n\nThe three-year F23 Board approved business plan was used in assessing value in use for each CGU. This plan incorporates the estimated impact on the Group from COVID, which has shaped trading through the last two years. As COVID becomes endemic, customer shopping behaviour is expected to evolve, including the potential for customers to become more value seeking given the evolving inflationary environment. The base setting for the F23 plan includes the cycling of major COVID disruptions from the current year, as well as, managing inflationary impacts through sales and costs. Refer to critical accounting estimates for further details.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe carrying value of assets subject to impairment testing includes inventories which are carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value. There have been no material changes to the Group's inventory provisions as a result of COVID.\n\n## Financial reporting impacts of sustainability related matters\n\nThe potential long-term financial impacts of climate change, including the costs of reaching the Group's 2030 emissions reduction targets are continuing to be assessed. However, at this stage, the Group does not consider the potential impacts of climate change to present a risk of impairment of the carrying value of non-financial assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is assessed at the CGU level, which is the smallest group of assets generating cash inflows independent of other CGUs that benefit from the use of the respective asset.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of a CGU are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the CGU on a pro-rata basis.\n\n## Reversal of impairment\n\nAn impairment loss is reversed, other than for goodwill, if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates\n\nKey assumptions used in determining the recoverable amount of assets include expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, and discount rates.\n\n## Expected future cash flows\n\nIn assessing VIU, the estimated future cash flows are based on the Group's most recent Board approved business plan covering a period not exceeding five years and incorporates the estimated impact on the Group from market conditions forecast through the recovery phase of COVID.\n\n## Long-term growth rates\n\nLong-term growth rates are based on past experience, expectations of external market operating conditions, and other assumptions which take into account the specific features of each business unit.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nThe recoverable amount has been determined using a VIU discounted cash flow model. In assessing VIU, the estimated future pre-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset. The pre-tax discount rates used vary depending on the nature of the business and the country of operation.

A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in association with these capital losses as it is not probable that there will be sufficient capital gains available against which these capital losses can be utilised in the foreseeable future. At the reporting date, the Group has unused revenue losses of $65 million (2021: $56 million). A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these revenue losses as it is not probable that there will be sufficient profit available against which these losses can be utilised during the five-year period that these losses remain available to be carried forward.\n\n## 3.9.4 Tax consolidation\n\nThe Company and its wholly-owned Australian resident entities formed a tax consolidated group with effect from 1 July 2002. Woolworths Group Limited is the head entity of the tax consolidated group and has assumed the current tax liabilities of the members in the tax consolidated group (the Woolworths tax group). Income tax expense or benefit, deferred tax assets, and deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary differences of the members of the tax consolidated group are recognised by each subsidiary where the subsidiary would have been able to recognise the deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability on a standalone basis. The members of the tax consolidated group have entered into a tax funding agreement with the Company which sets out the funding obligations in respect of income tax amounts. The agreement requires payments by the subsidiary to the Company equal to the income tax liability assumed by the Company. The Company is required to make payment to the subsidiary equal to the current tax asset assumed by the Company. In respect of carried forward tax losses brought into the group on consolidation by subsidiary members, the Company will pay the subsidiary member for such losses when these losses are transferred to the tax consolidated group, where the subsidiary member would have been entitled to recognise the benefit of these losses on a standalone basis. Income tax expense of $163 million (2021: $126 million) was charged by the Company to subsidiaries during the period through at call intercompany accounts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\nIncome tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss for the period presented comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income, or directly in equity, respectively.\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax payable represents the amount expected to be paid to taxation authorities on taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled, or asset realised, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit or in relation to the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences or unused tax losses and tax offsets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. In determining the availability of future taxable profits, any reasonably possible changes due to the potential impacts from climate-related risks may impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe benefit of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life will flow to the Group on an annual basis, therefore the carrying amount will be recovered through use.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has provided in excess of $500 million in relation to the remediation of these salaried team members. Significant progress has been made to remediate the impacted salaried team members, with $457 million paid to those team members to date.\n\nIn June 2021, the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) commenced legal proceedings against the Woolworths Group, seeking orders in relation to alleged contraventions of the Fair Work Act and for further compensation of the affected salaried team members. Class action proceedings brought by Adero Law Firm against the Woolworths Group in 2019 also continue.\n\nThe Group is defending its interpretation of the clauses subject to the FWO proceedings and the class action proceedings. While the Group has been guided by extensive advice from external counsel, these proceedings are at an early stage and the outcome and total costs associated with the proceedings are uncertain. There is a risk that the Court may determine these matters contrary to the Group's current assessment of the position, and require the Group to make further material remediation payments. Any changes to the provision as a result of new information will be treated as a change in accounting estimate and will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss in the period in which the new information is available.\n\nAs at 26 June 2022, the Group has a provision of $90 million to settle any remaining obligations.\n\n## END-TO-END PAYROLL REVIEW\n\nDuring the 2021 financial period, the Group established an end-to-end payroll review across the Group's payroll systems and processes to test and ensure compliance with the Group's obligations under the GRIA as well as other modern awards, Enterprise Agreements (EAs) and statutory entitlements for team members across the Group. As part of this review, certain areas of non-compliance have been identified.\n\nThe review to date has resulted in the Group recognising a team member pay remediation provision of $201 million for the period (of which $165 million was recognised as a significant item, refer to Note 1.4 for further details) relating to payment shortfalls, predominantly of hourly paid team members employed pursuant to the Woolworths Supermarkets, Metro and BIG W EAs. Whilst the review is ongoing, as at 26 June 2022, significant progress has been made, with more than 98% of team members obligations reviewed, representing 93% of the Group's total payroll costs.\n\nThe Group has applied extensive resources to the review and analysis of its records, and the calculation of the likely remediation to affected team members. Notwithstanding this, uncertainty remains in relation to the Group's exposure. The review is ongoing and may give rise to further provisions as it progresses to completion, with significant modelling required to finalise team remediation payments, which is also subject to the finalisation of the Group's engagement with the relevant regulators.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amount recognised is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nThe provision for employee benefits comprises a liability for benefits accruing to employees in respect of annual leave and long service leave and also includes any liability for the Group's team member pay remediation.\n\nLiabilities expected to be settled within 12 months are measured at their nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement.\n\nLiabilities which are not expected to be settled within 12 months are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.\n\n## Self-insurance\n\nThe provision for self-insured risks primarily represents the estimated liability for workers' compensation and public liability claims.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nA provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been publicly announced.\n\n## Onerous contracts and store exit costs\n\nAn onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net costs of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract, and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil the contract.\n\n3.11\n\nProvisions\n\n(continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial reporting impacts of sustainability related matters\n\nThe impact from flooding during the period has not had a material impact on the Group's Consolidated Financial Position as it is insured against any damages to its inventories and property, plant, and equipment. The impacts of acute weather events, such as flooding, on physical assets and subsequent business interruptions includes, but is not limited to, an increase in the Group's cost of insurable risks primarily due to higher premiums, higher deductibles and policy exclusions.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates\n\nThe estimates and judgements applied in determining the Group's provisions involve a high degree of complexity and have a risk of causing a material adjustment in subsequent periods. Any changes to the provision as a result of new information will be treated as a change in accounting estimate and will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss in the period in which the new information is available.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nWhere a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation, with the exception of employee benefits, the cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Employee benefits are discounted with reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Rates are reviewed periodically, and given the nature of the estimate, reasonably possible changes are not considered likely to have a material impact.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nIn estimating the value of employee benefits, consideration is given to expected future salary and wage levels (including on-cost rates), experience of employee departures, and periods of service. The assumptions are reviewed periodically and, given the nature of the estimate, reasonably possible changes in assumptions are not considered likely to have a material impact.\n\nIncluded in employee benefits are the team member remediation provisions which represent the Group's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligations in accordance with the relevant EAs and GRIA.\n\n## Self-insured risks\n\nSelf-insurance provisions are determined based on independent actuarial assessments, which consider numbers, amounts, and duration of claims and allow for future inflation and investment returns. Allowance is included for injuries which occurred before the reporting date, but where the claim is expected to be notified after the reporting date. The assumptions are reviewed periodically, and given the nature of the estimate, reasonably possible changes in assumptions are not considered likely to have a material impact.\n\n## Restructuring, onerous contracts, and store exit costs\n\nRestructuring provisions are recognised based on the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the Group.\n\nProvisions for onerous contracts and store closures are recognised based on the lower of the estimated unavoidable net costs of meeting all leases and other obligations under the stores and associated contracts, and the Group's best estimate of the compensation expected to be payable to landlords and other third parties as a result of early termination of contracts. Estimates differ depending on the rent, location, lease exit terms, and the Group's assessment of the timing and likely termination costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

August 2022, the Board of Directors declared a final dividend of 53 cents per share in respect of the 2022 financial period, fully franked at a 30% tax rate. The amount will be paid on or around 27 September 2022 and is expected to be $643 million. As the dividends were declared subsequent to 26 June 2022, no provision had been made at 26 June 2022.\n\n## Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP)\n\nThe DRP remains active. Eligible shareholders may participate in the DRP in respect of all or part of their shareholding. There is currently no DRP discount applied and no limit on the number of shares that can participate in the DRP.\n\nShares will be allocated to shareholders under the DRP for the 2022 final dividend at an amount equal to the Average Market Price of Shares over the Pricing Period less a discount (if any), and rounded to the nearest cent, or such other price determined by the Board in its absolute discretion. The Average Market Price of Shares is the average of the daily volume weighted average market price of ordinary shares of the Company traded on the ASX over the period of five trading days commencing on 5 September 2022. The last date for receipt of election notices for the DRP is 2 September 2022. The Company intends to issue new shares to satisfy its obligations under the DRP.\n\nDuring the period, 13.9% (2021: 14.0%) of the dividends paid were reinvested in shares of the Company.\n\n## Franking credit balance\n\n|                                                                                                       | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf $M   | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf $M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Franking credits available for future financial periods (tax paid basis, /three.tf/zero.tf% tax rate) | /nine.tf /eight.tf/one.tf          | /one.tf ,/seven.tf/four.tf /zero.tf |\n\nThe above amount represents the balance of the franking accounts at the end of the period, adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 Franking credits that will arise from the payment of income tax payable at the end of the period; and\n- \u00b7 Franking debits that will arise from the payment of dividends provided at the end of the period.\n\nThe above franking credit balance excludes $57/uni00A0million attributable to other non-controlling interests (2021: $18 million). On 28 June 2021, $692 million of franking credits were transferred to Endeavour Group on demerger.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the event of winding up of the Company, ordinary shareholders rank after creditors and are fully entitled to any proceeds on liquidation.\n\n## Share options and performance rights\n\nRefer to Note 6.2 for further details of outstanding options and performance rights. Performance rights carry no rights to dividends and no voting rights.\n\n## Demerger distribution\n\nOn 18 June 2021, the Group obtained shareholder approval for the separation of Endeavour Group. Accounting for the demerger is guided by AASB Interpretations 17 Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners . A demerger distribution liability equal to the fair value of the net assets to be distributed of $7,870 million was recognised and was allocated between a capital reduction of $904 million, and a demerger dividend of $6,966 million. The value of the capital reduction has been determined in accordance with the tax allocation specified by an ATO ruling and has been recognised against share capital.

The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss when the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss, consistent with the applicable accounting policy. Refer to Note 4.7 for details of hedging.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR)\n\nFCTR comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations where their functional currency is different to the Group's presentation currency. Gains and losses on hedging instruments that are designated as hedging instruments for hedges of net investments in foreign operations are also included in the FCTR. Refer to Note 4.7 for details of hedging.\n\n## Remuneration reserve\n\nThe employee remuneration reserve comprises the fair value of share-based payment plans recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. Refer to Note 6.2 for details of share-based payments.\n\nShares issued by the Woolworths Employee Share Trust are charged against the remuneration reserve.\n\n## Demerger reserve\n\nThe demerger reserve comprises the demerger dividend which represented the difference between the fair value of Endeavour Group's net assets distributed and the capital reduction. Refer to Note 5.2 for details on the accounting for the Endeavour demerger.\n\n## Other reserves\n\nOther reserves comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Equity instrument reserve: arises on the revaluation of investments in unlisted equity securities. Subsequent to initial recognition, these investments are measured at fair value with any changes recognised in other comprehensive income.\n- \u00b7 Put option liability reserve: arises on recognition of put options over non-controlling interests. Subsequent to initial recognition, the corresponding put option liability is measured at fair value with any changes recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n## 4.5 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section presents the components of the Group's cash and cash equivalents balance and a reconciliation of the Group's profit for the period to net cash flows provided by operating activities.\n\n## 4.5.1 Cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n\n|                                                                                                      | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf $M   | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf $M   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents (as presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position) /one.tf | /one.tf,/zero.tf/three.tf/two.tf   | /one.tf,/zero.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents (included within assets held for sale or distribution)                     | -

The Group manages its liquidity requirements with a range of short-term money market loans, bank loans, and flexible debt instruments with varying maturities.\n\n## 4.6.1 Capital structure\n\nThe Group manages its capital structure with the objective of enhancing long-term shareholder value through funding its business at an optimised weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe Group returns capital to shareholders when consistent with its long-term capital structure objectives and where it will enhance shareholder value. In October 2021, the Group returned $2 billion to shareholders through an off-market share buy-back (comprising a dividend and capital component of $1,750 million and $250 million respectively). This resulted in the purchase of 58 million shares, which were subsequently cancelled. The share buy-back complemented the payment of ordinary dividends (excluding franking credits), with a total of $3.2 billion returned to shareholders in the current period. The Group remains committed to solid investment grade credit ratings and a number of actions can be undertaken to support the credit profile, including the sale of non-core assets, further working capital initiatives, and adjusting growth capital expenditure and the property leasing profile. The Group's credit ratings 1 are BBB (stable outlook) according to Standard & Poor's and Baa2 (stable outlook) according to Moody's.\n\n## 4.6.2 Borrowings\n\n## (I) FINANCING TRANSACTIONS DURING 2022\n\nIn September and October 2021, the Group successfully completed the following senior unsecured debt capital market transactions:\n\n- \u00b7 EUR550 million (approximately $880 million) seven-year European Medium Term Notes issuance; and\n- \u00b7 $700 million domestic Medium Term Notes issuance, comprising $350 million of six-year notes and $350 million of 10-year notes.\n\nBoth issuances were structured as Sustainability Linked Bonds (SLBs) and have been used for general corporate purposes, including the long-term funding of the Group's investments in Quantium and PFD.\n\nIn May 2022, the Group entered into $1.25 billion of bilateral bank facilities. These facilities are revolving in nature and have tenors ranging from two to four years. These facilities refinanced the Group's existing $1.2 billion bilateral bank facilities which were cancelled upon the Group entering into the new bilateral bank facilities. The bilateral bank facilities have been used to manage the Group's short-term cash flow requirements and to support its liquidity position.\n\n## (II) UPCOMING MATURITIES AND TRANSACTIONS\n\nNo material maturities are expected to occur in the subsequent financial year. The Group's next material maturity is the $750 million syndicated bank facility in November 2023, upon which it is intended that this facility will be refinanced.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial reporting impacts of sustainability related matters\n\nThe SLBs have a direct link to the Group's commitment to reducing emissions. The SLB structure embeds a penalty (via a prospective margin increase of 0.25% per annum) into the terms of the notes that applies if, at the respective testing dates of the notes, the Group's scope 1 and 2 emissions are not aligned with the forecast trajectory to meet the Group's 2030 emissions reduction targets. The Group has committed to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions from its own operations by 63% by 2030 compared to a 2015 baseline. As at 26 June 2022, the Group also had a Green Bond on issue that is certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative. The proceeds of the Green Bond have been fully allocated to eligible assets as per the Climate Bonds Standards, being low emissions supermarkets, solar energy installations, LED lighting upgrades and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning optimisation projects.\n\n- 1 These credit ratings have been issued by a credit rating agency which holds an Australian Financial Services Licence with an authorisation to issue credit ratings to wholesale clients only and are for the benefit of the Group's debt providers.\n\n4.6\n\nBorrowings\n\n(continued)\n\n## 4.6.3 Composition of debt\n\n|                                     |          |                       | NOTIONAL VALUE                   | NOTIONAL VALUE                    | CARRYING VALUE                        | CARRYING VALUE                       |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                     | CURRENCY | MATURITY              | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf $M | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf $M | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf $M      | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf $M    |\n| Current, unsecured                  |          |                       |                                  |                                   |                                       |                                      |\n| Short-term money market loans       |          |                       |                                  |                                   |                                       |                                      |\n| Money market loan, on call          | AUD      | At call               | /two.tf/eight.tf/one.tf          | /four.tf/four.tf                  | /two.tf/eight.tf/one.tf               | /four.tf/four.tf                     |\n| Money market loan, on call          | NZD      | At call               | /four.tf/six.tf                  | -

These cumulative foreign exchange losses were offset by cumulative foreign exchange gains on cross currency swaps which also matured during the period). Refer to Note 4.7.1 for further details.\n- 2 Other includes $164 million relating to the Medium Term Notes (Green Bond) and Domestic Notes, which are hedged items in a fair value hedge relationship and are subject to changes in the carrying amount due to fair value adjustments attached to each arrangement and $89 million of borrowings recognised on acquisition of PFD (2021: $4 million of bank loans related to Endeavour Group which were transferred to liabilities held for distribution).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Borrowings\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, borrowings are stated at amortised cost. Any difference between cost and redemption value is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss over the period of the borrowings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.7 Financial risk management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section provides a summary of the Group's exposure to market, liquidity, and credit risks, along with the Group's policies and strategies in place to mitigate these risks.\n\nThe Group's Treasury function is responsible for managing its liquidity, funding, and capital requirements, and identifying and managing financial risks relating to the Group's operations. These financial risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk (refer to Note 4.7.1);\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk (refer to Note 4.7.2); and\n- \u00b7 Credit risk (refer to Note 4.7.3).\n\nThese risks affect the fair value measurements applied by the Group, which are detailed in Note 4.7.4.\n\nThe Group adheres to a treasury policy approved by the Board, which set written principles on liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk, and the use of derivatives for hedging purposes. The Treasury function reports on its compliance with the policy to the Board and such compliance is reviewed periodically by the Group's internal auditors.\n\nThe Group uses various types of derivatives to hedge its exposures to variability in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes.\n\n## 4.7.1 Market risk\n\n## (I) INTEREST RATE RISK\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that a change in interest rates may negatively impact the Group's cash flow or profitability because the Group's borrowings reset directly in accordance with interest rate benchmarks or reset regularly to current rates influenced by interest rate benchmarks. The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between floating and fixed rate borrowings and through the use of approved derivatives to hedge the risk.\n\n## (II) FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK\n\nForeign exchange risk is the risk that a change in foreign exchange rates may negatively impact the Group's cash flow or profitability because the Group has an exposure to a foreign currency or has foreign currency denominated obligations.\n\nTo hedge against the majority of this exposure, the Group uses approved derivatives to hedge up to 100% of the risk. The exposure to purchases of inventory in foreign currencies is primarily managed through forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options. These have been designated as cash flow hedges and the Group has established a 100% hedge relationship against the identified exposure.\n\nTo hedge the risk of adverse movements in foreign exchange rates in relation to borrowings denominated in foreign currency, the Group enters into cross currency swaps under which it agrees to exchange specified principal and interest foreign currency amounts at an agreed future date at a specified exchange rate. All foreign currency term borrowings are 100% hedged in this way.\n\nForeign currency exposures arising on translation of net investments in foreign subsidiaries are predominantly unhedged.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, the unrealised gain of $33 million attributable to the interest rate component has been recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve (2021: nil) at the reporting date, with insignificant hedge ineffectiveness.\n\nThe movement in the recognised loss attributable to the foreign exchange component of $41 million (2021: nil) has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss during the period, completely offsetting the foreign exchange revaluation of the underlying debt.\n\n## Interest rate swaps - cash /flow hedges\n\nAt the reporting date, there were no interest rate swaps designated in a cash flow hedge relationship.\n\n## Interest rate swaps - fair value hedges\n\nAt the reporting date, interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges have an unrealised loss of $148 million (2021: $16 million unrealised gain). These interest rate swaps are designated to be in a 100% hedge relationship against the identified exposure, and the movement in the unrealised loss of $164 million has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss (2021:/uni00A0$4 million gain), offsetting the movement in the fair value of the hedged item. The weighted average interest rate hedged is BBSW + 1.01% (2021: BBSW + 1.20%).\n\n- 4.7 Financial risk management (continued)\n\n## (IV) CASH FLOW HEDGE RESERVE\n\nThe table below details the movements in the cash flow hedge reserve during the period:\n\n|                                                                                                         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf $M   | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf $M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Balance at start of period                                                                              | (/one.tf/three.tf)                 | (/three.tf/eight.tf)                |\n| Gain/(loss) arising on changes in fair value of hedging instruments entered into  for cash flow hedges: |                                    |                                     |\n| Forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options                                                 | /eight.tf/five.tf                  | (/two.tf/three.tf)                  |\n| Cross currency swaps                                                                                    | /three.tf/three.tf                 | (/one.tf/nine.tf)                   |\n| Interest rate swaps                                                                                     | -                                  | /three.tf/one.tf                    |\n| Income tax related to gains recognised in other comprehensive income                                    | (/three.tf/three.tf)               | /three.tf                           |\n|                                                                                                         | /eight.tf/five.tf                  | (/eight.tf)                         |\n| Transfers to initial carrying amount of hedged items:                                                   |                                    |                                     |\n| Forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options                                                 | /one.tf/nine.tf                    | /four.tf/six.tf                     |\n| Income tax related to amounts transferred to initial carrying amount of hedged items                    | (/six.tf)                          | (/one.tf/three.tf)                  |\n|                                                                                                         | /one.tf/three.tf                   | /three.tf/three.tf                  |\n| Balance at end of period                                                                                | /eight.tf/five.tf                  | (/one.tf/three.tf)                  |\n\n## (V) SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group's exposure to floating interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, after taking into consideration hedges of foreign currency payables, foreign currency borrowings and forecast foreign currency transactions, is not considered material.\n\n## (VI) POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT\n\nThe Group entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) in May 2021 for a period of 10 years commencing January 2022. However, due to delays in construction, the commencement of the PPA was deferred until July 2022.\n\nThe PPA is not a physical electricity supply contract but operates as a contract for difference where a strike price is agreed. If the electricity spot price is higher than the strike price, the counterparty will pay the difference to the Group. Similarly, if the electricity spot price is lower than the strike price, the Group will pay the difference to the counterparty. The PPA is classified as a derivative and is measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## 4.7.2 Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not have sufficient cash balances and access to funding sources to meet its cash obligations. This risk arises through the possibility that unusually large amounts may fall due for payment, there is an interruption to cash inflows due to technology incidents or banking system interruption, or there is an interruption to funding sources and markets.\n\nThe treasury policy approved by the Board has set an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for short, medium, and long-term funding requirements.\n\nThe Group maintains a minimum daily liquidity ratio, which the Treasury function monitors and forecasts over a 12-month rolling period. The Group may decide to hold higher levels of liquidity from time to time in anticipation of expected requirements or events. To minimise refinancing risk, the Group maintains a diversity of funding sources and debt maturities. Upcoming maturities are included in the liquidity ratio calculation and must be covered by adequate liquidity to repay or refinance them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cash flows represented are contractual and calculated on an undiscounted basis, based on current rates at the reporting date.\n\n- 4.7 Financial risk management (continued)\n\n## 4.7.3 Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that counterparties who may be required to pay monies to the Group may fail and therefore not be able to make those payments. Under the treasury policy approved by the Board, the Group can only invest short-term surplus funds or execute derivatives with approved counterparty banks and financial institutions that are rated BBB+ or higher by Standard & Poor's (or equivalent with other rating agencies).\n\nThe recognised financial assets of the Group include amounts receivable arising from unrealised gains on derivatives. For derivatives which are deliverable, credit risk may also arise from the potential failure of the counterparties to meet their obligations under the respective contracts at maturity.\n\nAt the reporting date, no material credit risk exposure existed in relation to potential counterparty failure on such financial instruments. Other than the loss allowance recognised in relation to trade and other receivables in Note 3.1, no financial assets were impaired or past due.\n\n## 4.7.4 Fair value measurement of /financial instruments\n\nSome of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The following table provides information about how the fair values of these financial assets and financial liabilities are determined. They are grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value measurement inputs are observable. There were no transfers between level 1, level 2, or level 3 during the period.\n\n- Level 1 Fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- Level 3 Fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\n|                                                            |                               | FAIR VALUE ASSET                  | FAIR VALUE ASSET                   | FAIR VALUE LIABILITY              | FAIR VALUE LIABILITY               |                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                            | NOTE                          | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf  $M | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf  $M | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf  $M | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf  $M | FAIR VALUE  HIERARCHY |\n| Forward exchange contracts and foreign  currency options   | /four.tf . /seven.tf. /one.tf | /nine.tf/four.tf                  | /three.tf                          | (/six.tf)                         | (/one.tf/nine.tf)                  | Level /two.tf         |\n| Cross currency, interest rate swaps and  fair value hedges | /four.tf . /seven.tf. /one.tf | /seven.tf                         | /two.tf/three.tf                   | (/one.tf/six.tf/three.tf)         | (/seven.tf)                        | Level /two.tf         |\n| Convertible and SAFE notes                                 | /three.tf./two.tf             | /one.tf/one.tf                    | /six.tf/two.tf                     | -                                 | -                                  | Level /two.tf         |\n| Unlisted equity securities                                 | /three.tf./two.tf             | /six.tf/zero.tf                   | /three.tf/three.tf                 | -                                 | -                                  | Level /three.tf       |\n| Put options over non-controlling interests                 | /three.tf./two.tf             | -                                 | -                                  | (/six.tf/three.tf/zero.tf)        | (/three.tf/nine.tf /zero.tf )      | Level /three.tf       |\n\n## LEVEL 3 MOVEMENTS\n\nThe movements in the unlisted equity securities and put options over non-controlling interests are as follows:\n\nPUT OPTIONS OVER NON/hyphen.case\n\n|                                                | UNLISTED EQUITY SECURITIES       | UNLISTED EQUITY SECURITIES        | CONTROLLING INTERESTS            | CONTROLLING INTERESTS             |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                                | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf $M | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf $M | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf $M | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf $M |\n| Balance at start of the period                 | /three.tf/three.tf               | /one.tf/zero.tf                   | (/three.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf)      | -                                 |\n| Additions                                      | /eight.tf                        | /one.tf/one.tf                    | (/four.tf/one.tf/one.tf)         | (/three.tf/nine.tf /zero.tf)      |\n| Interest unwind                                | -                                | -                                 | (/one.tf/three.tf)               | -                                 |\n| Revaluation                                    | /one.tf/nine.tf                  | /one.tf/two.tf                    | /one.tf/six.tf /four.tf          | -                                 |\n| Early acquisition of additional shares /one.tf | -                                | -                                 | /two.tf/zero.tf                  | -                                 |\n| Balance at end of the period                   | /six.tf/zero.tf                  | /three.tf/three.tf                | (/six.tf/three.tf/zero.tf)       | (/three.tf/nine.tf /zero.tf)      |\n\n- 1 Relates to the early acquisition of Quantium shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Any material valuation adjustments are reported to the Board.\n\nThe following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments categorised within level 2 and level 3 of the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- \u00b7 The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is determined using a discounted cash flow model where future cash flows are estimated based on market forward exchange rates as at the end of the reporting period and the contract forward rate, discounted by the observable yield curves of the respective currency;\n- \u00b7 The fair value of foreign currency options is determined using a Black-Scholes model;\n- \u00b7 The fair value of cross currency and interest rate swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow model where future cash flows are estimated based on market forward rates as at the end of the reporting period and the contract rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the various respective counterparties;\n- \u00b7 The fair value of convertible and SAFE notes is determined using a Black-Scholes model or a Monte Carlo simulation model;\n- \u00b7 The fair value of unlisted equity securities is determined using the pricing from the latest external fundraising of the unlisted entity which represents the current market value of the investment or, where this is not available, using an appropriate model such as a discounted cash flow model based on estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate that reflects the relative risks of the investment; and\n- \u00b7 The fair value of put options over non-controlling interests is determined as the present value of the amounts expected to be paid at the time of exercise, discounted at the Group's cost of debt.\n\n## LEVEL 3 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\n\n## Unlisted equity securities\n\nReasonably possible changes at the reporting date to the significant unobservable inputs would not have resulted in a material change in the value of unlisted equity securities.\n\n## Put options over non-controlling interests\n\nFor the fair value of put options over non-controlling interests, reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the significant unobservable inputs, holding other inputs constant, would have resulted in the following valuations:\n\n|                                                                   |                       | CHANGE IN REVENUE /one.tf   | CHANGE IN REVENUE /one.tf   | CHANGE IN REVENUE /one.tf   | CHANGE IN REVENUE /one.tf   | CHANGE IN REVENUE /one.tf   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf  /parenleft.case$ M/parenright.case |                       | /hyphen.case/two.tf %       | /hyphen.case/one.tf %       | /zero.tf%                   | /one.tf%                    | /two.tf%                    |\n| CHANGE IN EBITDA MARGIN                                           | /hyphen.case/two.tf % | (/five.tf/nine.tf/one.tf)   | (/five.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf)  | (/six.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf)  | (/six.tf/one.tf/seven.tf )  | (/six.tf/two.tf/six.tf)     |\n| CHANGE IN EBITDA MARGIN                                           | /hyphen.case/one.tf % | (/six.tf/zero.tf/three.tf)  | (/six.tf/one.tf/one.tf)     | (/six.tf/two.tf/zero.tf)    | (/six.tf/two.tf/nine.tf)    | (/six.tf/three.tf/eight.tf) |\n| CHANGE IN EBITDA MARGIN                                           | /zero.tf%             | (/six.tf/one.tf/three.tf)   | (/six.tf/two.tf/two.tf)     | (/six.tf/three.tf/zero.tf)  | (/six.tf/four.tf/zero.tf)   | (/six.tf /four.tf/nine.tf)  |\n| CHANGE IN EBITDA MARGIN                                           | /one.tf%              | (/six.tf/two.tf/four.tf)    | (/six.tf/three.tf/two.tf)   | (/six.tf /four.tf/one.tf)   | (/six.tf/five.tf/one.tf)    | (/six.tf/six.tf/zero.tf)    |\n| CHANGE IN EBITDA MARGIN                                           | /two.tf%              | (/six.tf/three.tf/four.tf)  | (/six.tf/four.tf/three.tf)  | (/six.tf/five.tf/two.tf)    | (/six.tf/six.tf/two.tf)     | (/six.tf/seven.tf /two.tf)  |\n\n- 1 Change in revenue growth only applies to the Quantium put option liability.\n\n4.7\n\nFinancial risk management (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value. Subsequently, at each reporting date, the derivative is remeasured at fair value and the gain or loss on remeasurement is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, unless the derivatives are designated as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge where the gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not due to be realised or settled within 12 months.\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nA cash flow hedge is a hedge of an exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss.\n\nWhere a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate cash flow hedge reserve within equity.\n\nWhen the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, then the associated gains and losses that were accumulated in equity will be reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss. The ineffective part of any derivative designated as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified immediately into the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. Gains or losses removed from equity during the period in relation to interest rate hedge instruments are recognised within finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n## Fair value hedge\n\nA fair value hedge is a hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss. Where a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, together with the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, in the line item relating to the hedged item.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss from that date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

This resulted in the Group gaining control of PFD for a total consideration of $438 million. In addition, PFD minority shareholders have a put option and the Group has an equivalent call option over the remaining 35% of the shares in PFD which is exercisable after three years from the acquisition date.\n\nPFD delivers a range of dry goods, frozen and chilled products, fresh seafood and meat, confectionery, paper products, and cleaning products. PFD has a broad and diverse range of customers, including pubs and clubs, caf\u00e9s, airlines, hotels, restaurants, aged care and retirement villages, resorts and theme parks, convenience outlets, venue and field caterers, quick service restaurants, schools and kindergartens, and sporting, child care and correctional facilities.\n\nThe investment supports the Group's Food and Everyday Needs Ecosystem strategy and will continue to unlock synergies for both businesses across the combined network and fleet. For the Group, it will enhance store range localisation and provide fleet synergies through better route and capacity optimisation across the combined network. The Group will help to support PFD's growth through access to the Group's logistics, digital and data analytics, and operational capabilities.\n\n## 5.1.1 Identi/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n\nDuring the period, the Group finalised its acquisition accounting for PFD and no material adjustments to the amounts initially recognised were made. The following table summarises the recognised amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, including the fair value of PFD's intangible assets.\n\n|                                        | $M                          |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Assets                                 |                             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents              | /four.tf/five.tf            |\n| Trade and other receivables /one.tf    | /one.tf/five.tf/two.tf      |\n| Inventories                            | /one.tf/two.tf/seven.tf     |\n| Lease assets                           | /three.tf/six.tf/nine.tf    |\n| Property, plant and equipment          | /four.tf/seven.tf           |\n| Intangible assets /two.tf              | /two.tf/one.tf/five.tf      |\n| Deferred tax assets                    | /two.tf/one.tf              |\n| Total assets                           | /nine.tf /seven.tf/six.tf   |\n| Liabilities                            |                             |\n| Trade and other payables               | /two.tf/seven.tf/one.tf     |\n| Lease liabilities                      | /three.tf/six.tf/nine.tf    |\n| Provisions                             | /four.tf/seven.tf           |\n| Borrowings                             | /eight.tf/nine.tf           |\n| Deferred tax liabilities               | /seven.tf/one.tf            |\n| Total liabilities                      | /eight.tf /four.tf/seven.tf |\n| Total identifiable net assets acquired | /one.tf/two.tf/nine.tf      |\n\n- 1 Trade and other receivables include trade receivables which comprises gross contractual amounts due of $133 million, of which $4 million has a loss allowance recognised against it at acquisition date.\n- 2 Intangible assets include customer contracts of $168 million, brand names of $43 million and software of $4 million, which were recognised on acquisition date. Customer contracts are being amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated average life of the contracts, while brand names are indefinite life intangible assets and are subject to annual impairment testing.\n- 5.1 Acquisition of subsidiary (continued)\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition has been recognised as follows:\n\n|                                                       | $M                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Consideration                                         | /four.tf/three.tf/eight.tf |\n| Non-controlling interest /one.tf                      | /four.tf/five.tf           |\n| Less:  Fair value of identifiable net assets acquired | (/one.tf/two.tf/nine.tf)   |\n| Goodwill                                              | /three.tf/five.tf/four.tf  |\n\n- 1 Based on the non-controlling interest's proportion of the fair value of identifiable net assets of PFD.\n\nThe goodwill is attributable mainly to the skills and technical talent of PFD's workforce, the benefits from the inclusion of PFD in the Food and Everyday Needs Ecosystem, and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\n## PUT OPTION\n\nThe Group has a put option liability over the remaining 35% of the shares in PFD, which is expected to be exercised after 30 June 2024. On acquisition, a put option liability of $411 million was recognised, representing the present value of the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise within other financial liabilities with a corresponding charge directly to equity.\n\nAt each reporting period, the amount expected to be paid at the time of exercise is reassessed with reference to the key terms of the shareholders agreement and the business outlook. Refer to Note 4.7.4 fair value measurement of financial instruments for further details.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Business combinations\n\nThe Group accounts for acquisitions of businesses using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquir/e.ss01d. /G.ss01ood/w.ss01i/l.ss01/l.ss01 is m/e.ss01/a.ss01sur/e.ss01d /a.ss01s /t.ss01h/e.ss01 /e.ss01xc/e.ss01ss o/f.ss01 /t.ss01h/e.ss01 sum o/f.ss01 /t.ss01h/e.ss01 consid/e.ss01r/a.ss01/t.ss01ion /t.ss01r/a.ss01ns/f.ss01/e.ss01rr/e.ss01d, /t.ss01h/e.ss01 /a.ss01moun/t.ss01 o/f.ss01 /a.ss01n/y.ss01 non-con/t.ss01rolling interest in the acquiree, and the fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment in accordance with the policy adopted for non-financial assets in Note 3.8. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\n\nWhen the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\nWhen a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group's previously held interest in the acquired entity is remeasured to its acquisition date fair value. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The following are accounting policies that are significant to the Company only as the related transactions are either not material for the Group or eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost and are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy adopted for non-financial assets in Note 3.8. Dividends received from subsidiaries are recognised in profit or loss when a right to receive the dividend is established.\n\n## Investments in associates\n\nInvestments in associates are initially recognised at cost, and are accounted for using the equity method by including the Company's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income or loss of the associate in the carrying amount of the investment until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases. Dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment in associate.\n\n## Lessor accounting\n\nThe Company recognises amounts due from lessees under finance leases as receivables at the amount of the Company's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Company's net investment outstanding in respect of the leases. The Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income.\n\n## 5.5 Related parties\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section outlines the Group's transactions with its related parties, such as its subsidiaries, Key Management Personnel, and material associates.\n\n## 5.5.1 Transactions within the Group\n\nDuring the reporting period and previous reporting periods, Woolworths Group Limited advanced loans to, received and repaid loans from, and provided treasury, accounting, legal, taxation, and administrative services to other entities within the Group. Entities within the Group also exchanged goods and services in sale and purchase transactions. All transactions occurred on the basis of normal commercial terms and conditions. Balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of the Company, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.\n\n## 5.5.2 Directors and Key Management Personnel\n\nAll transactions with directors and Key Management Personnel (including their related parties) were conducted at an arm's length basis in the ordinary course of business and under usual terms and conditions for customers and employees. Related parties of Key Management Personnel who are employees received employee benefits on standard terms and conditions. The total remuneration for Key Management Personnel of the Group is as  follows:\n\n|                              | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf $                                            | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf $                                  |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Short-term employee benefits | /one.tf/zero.tf,/two.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf,/four.tf/two.tf/two.tf            | /one.tf/two.tf,/one.tf/four.tf/nine.tf,/seven.tf/four.tf/seven.tf |\n| Post employment benefits     | /two.tf /nine.tf/one.tf , /five.tf /zero.tf /five.tf                       | /one.tf /nine.tf /seven.tf, /eight.tf /zero.tf /seven.tf          |\n| Other long-term benefits     | /one.tf/two.tf /three.tf , /one.tf/four.tf/one.tf                          | /eight.tf/two.tf,/zero.tf/four.tf/three.tf                        |\n| Share-based payments         | /seven.tf, /nine.tf /five.tf /two.tf , /eight.tf /eight.tf /three.tf       | /eight.tf,/eight.tf/two.tf/five.tf,/nine.tf/seven.tf/one.tf       |\n|                              | /one.tf /eight.tf , /six.tf /three.tf /seven.tf, /nine.tf /five.tf /one.tf | /two.tf/one.tf,/two.tf/five.tf/five.tf,/five.tf/six.tf/eight.tf   |\n\n## 5.5.3 Transactions with the Group's material associate, Endeavour Group Limited\n\nEffective from the separation date of 28 June 2021, long-term strategic Partnership Agreements were established which document the close and mutually beneficial relationship between both parties and reflects the way in which Endeavour Group has historically operated as part of the Group. These agreements cover key business areas, including the provision of goods and services related to supply chain and stores, IT, loyalty and FinTech, digital, media and business support, and occur on the basis of normal commercial terms and conditions. The provision of these goods and services were eliminated on consolidation prior to the demerger of Endeavour Group. However, from the date that control was lost on 28 June 2021, these transactions are disclosed as related party transactions.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Group settles liabilities with third parties on behalf of Endeavour Group and subsequently recovers these costs directly from Endeavour. As a result, these transactions have not been disclosed as related party transactions. However, balances that remain unsettled with Endeavour Group at the reporting date, including amounts relating to third-party cost recoveries, are disclosed as related party receivables. During the period, the Group entered into the following transactions with its material associate, Endeavour Group and the amounts outstanding as at 26 June 2022 are as follows:\n\n|                                                 | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf $M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Revenue from the sale of goods and services     | /five.tf/zero.tf/six.tf            |\n| Other revenue                                   | /eight.tf/six.tf                   |\n| Purchase of goods and services                  | (/two.tf/one.tf)                   |\n| Amounts receivable from Endeavour Group /one.tf | /three.tf/nine.tf/two.tf           |\n| Amounts payable to Endeavour Group /two.tf      | (/one.tf/zero.tf /six.tf )         |\n\n- 2 Includes $90 million relating to payables for unsettled electronic funds transfers, credit card and debit card point of sale transactions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

The guarantees are based on independent actuarial advice of the outstanding liability.\n\nNo provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements in respect of these contingencies however there is a provision of $628 million for self-insured risks (2021: $591 million), which includes liabilities relating to workers' compensation claims, that have been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at the reporting date.\n\nFrom time to time, entities within the Group are party to various legal actions as well as inquiries from regulators and government bodies that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Consideration has been given to such matters and it has been determined that these matters are not at a stage to support a reasonable evaluation of the likely outcome.\n\n## 6.2 Employee bene/fits\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section presents the Group's benefits provided to its employees, including remuneration, superannuation, share schemes, and retirement plans.\n\n## 6.2.1 Employee bene/fits expense from continuing operations\n\n|                              | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf $M    | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf $M    |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Remuneration and on-costs    | /eight.tf , /eight.tf/one.tf/two.tf | /seven.tf, /seven.tf/four.tf /two.tf |\n| Superannuation expense       | /six.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf           | /five.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf           |\n| Share-based payments expense | /one.tf/three.tf/nine.tf            | /nine.tf/three.tf                    |\n|                              | /nine.tf,/six.tf/three.tf/eight.tf  | /eight.tf , /four.tf/two.tf /two.tf  |\n\n## 6.2.2 Share-based payments\n\n## LONG-TERM INCENTIVE (LTI) PLAN\n\nEquity settled share-based payments form part of the remuneration of eligible employees of the Group.

It has been offered to:\n\n- \u00b7 Executives of newly acquired businesses in order to retain intellectual property during transition periods; or\n- \u00b7 Attract new executives.\n\nSign-on and retention rights generally do not have performance measures attached to them due to the objective of retaining key talent and vest subject to the executive remaining employed by the Group, generally for two or more years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. Refer to Note 3.11 for further details.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nEquity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The fair value of instruments with market-based performance conditions (e.g. TSR) is calculated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The probability of achieving market-based performance conditions is incorporated into the determination of the fair value per instrument. The fair value of instruments with non-market-based performance conditions (e.g. SQM, reputation, and ROFE), service conditions and retention rights is calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.\n\nThe fair value determined at grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of non-market based vesting conditions. Any change in original estimates is recognised in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6.2\n\nEmployee bene/fits\n\n(continued)\n\n## 6.2.3 Share schemes\n\nThe total shares purchased during the year were 3,874,029 (2021: 4,385,989) at an average price per share of $35.28, following the Endeavour demerger (2021:/uni00A0$42.90) to satisfy the vesting of share rights and allocation of shares under the Group's employee share plans.\n\nNo additional expense is recognised in relation to the shares purchased under the Employee Share Purchase Plan and the shares issued under the Non-executive Director Equity Plan as they are acquired out of salary sacrificed remuneration.\n\n## EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN (SPP)\n\nThe SPP provides permanent full-time and part-time employees who are Australian tax residents and are aged 18 years or over with the opportunity to purchase shares from pre-tax income via salary sacrifice. The Group pays the associated brokerage costs.\n\n## NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR EQUITY PLAN\n\nThe Non-executive Director Equity Plan allows Non-executive Directors to acquire share rights through a pre-tax fee sacrifice plan.\n\n## 6.2.4 Retirement plans\n\n## DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS\n\nThe Company sponsors a defined benefit plan, the Woolworths Group Superannuation Plan (WGSP or the Plan), that provides superannuation benefits for employees upon retirement. The WGSP consists of members with defined benefit entitlements and defined contribution benefits. The defined benefit plan is closed to new members. The assets of the WGSP are held in a sub-plan within AMP SignatureSuper that is legally separated from the Group. The WGSP invests entirely in pooled unit trust products where prices are quoted on a daily basis.\n\nThe Group contributes to the WGSP at rates as set out in the Trust Deed and Rules and the Participation Deed between the Group and AMP Superannuation Limited. Members contribute to the WGSP at rates dependent upon their membership category. The plan provides lump sum defined benefits that are defined by salary and period of membership.\n\nAn actuarial valuation was carried out at both reporting dates by Willis Towers Watson. The principal actuarial assumptions used for the purpose of the valuation are as follows:\n\n|                                  | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf %   | /two.tf/zero.tf /two.tf/one.tf %   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Discount rate                    | /four.tf./three.tf                | /two.tf./four.tf                   |\n| Expected rate of salary increase | /three.tf./zero.tf                | /two.tf./five.tf                   |\n| Rate of price inflation          | /two.tf./six.tf                   | /two.tf./zero.tf                   |\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group's exposure to reasonably possible changes of the discount rate or expected rate of salary increase, while holding all other assumptions constant, is not considered material.\n\nThe average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 5.4 years (2021: 6.1 years) which relates wholly to active participants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Net interest income or expense, service costs and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nPayments to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

The other information comprises the information included in the Group's Annual Report for the 52-week period ended 26 June 2022 but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Directors' Responsibilities for the Financial Report\n\nThe directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management and the directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report (continued)\n\nWe communicate with the directors, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on the Remuneration Report\n\n## Opinion on the Remuneration Report\n\nWe have audited the Remuneration Report included in pages 70 to 93 of the Directors' Report for the 52-week period ended 26 June 2022.\n\nIn our opinion, the Remuneration Report of Woolworths Group Limited, for the 52-week period ended 26 June 2022, complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDELOITTE TOUCHE TOHMATSU\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTom Imbesi Partner Chartered Accountants\n\nSydney, 25 August 2022\n\nTaralyn Elliott Partner Chartered Accountants Sydney, 25 August 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",
