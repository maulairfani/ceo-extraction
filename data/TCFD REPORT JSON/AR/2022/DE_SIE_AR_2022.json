        "page_content": "## 1. Organization of the Siemens Group and basis of presentation\n\nSiemens is a technology group that is active in nearly all countries of the world, focusing on the areas of automation and digitalization in the process and manufacturing industries, intelligent infrastructure for buildings and distributed energy systems, smart mobility solutions for rail transport, and medical technology and digital healthcare services.\n\nSiemens comprises Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens AG), a stock corporation under the Federal laws of Germany, as the parent company, and its subsidiaries. Our Company is incorporated in Germany, with our corporate headquarters situated in Munich. As of September 30, 2022, Siemens had around 311,000 employees.\n\nAs  of  September  30,  2022,  Siemens  has  the  following  reportable  segments: Digital  Industries , Smart  Infrastructure , Mobility and Siemens Healthineers , which together form our 'Industrial Business' and Siemens Financial Services (SFS), which supports the activities of our industrial businesses and also conducts its own business with external customers. Furthermore, we report results for Portfolio Companies , which comprises businesses that are managed separately to improve their performance.\n\nOur reportable segments and Portfolio Companies may do business with each other, leading to corresponding orders and revenue. Such orders and revenue are eliminated on the Group level.\n\n## Non-financial matters of the Group and Siemens AG\n\nSiemens has policies for environmental, employee and social matters, for the respect of human rights, and anti-corruption and bribery matters, among others. Our business model is described in chapters 1 and 3 of this Combined Management Report. Reportable information that is necessary for an understanding of the development, performance, position and the impact of our activities on these matters is included  in  this  Combined  Management  Report,  in  particular  in  chapters  3  through  7.  Forward-looking  information,  including  risk disclosures,  is  presented  in  chapter  8.  Chapter  9  includes  additional  information  that  is  required  to  be  reported  in  the  Combined Management Report related to the parent company Siemens AG. As supplementary information, amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial  Statements  and  the  Annual  Financial  Statements  of  Siemens  AG  related  to  such  non-financial  matters,  and  additional explanations thereto, are included in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022, Notes 17, 18, 22, 26 and 27, and in the Notes to the Annual Financial Statements for fiscal 2022, Notes 16, 17, 20, 21 and 25. In order to inform the users of the financial reports in a focused manner, these disclosures are not subject to a specific non-financial framework - in contrast to the disclosures in our separate 'Sustainability report 2022' document, which are based on the standards developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Said document also includes detailed information on DEGREE, Siemens' sustainability framework. With DEGREE, Siemens intends to manage and track its progress on selected ambitions in the environmental, social and governance areas.\n\nDisclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy: The key performance indicators in this section were determined based on Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 in conjunction with the International Financial Reporting Standards applicable for the Consolidated Financial  Statements.  Thereby,  revenue,  capital  expenditures  and  operating  expenses  were  predominantly  directly  allocated  to  an economic activity listed in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/852; in determining capital expenditures and operating expenses, allocations were also made based on the revenue of the Taxonomy-eligible activities. To avoid double counting, the allocation was always made to one economic activity only. Taxonomy-eligible revenue accounted for 20% of revenue according to the Consolidated Statement of Income in the reporting year. In the reporting year, Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures accounted for 40% of additions (including additions from business combinations) to other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in accordance with Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial  Statements.  Taxonomy-eligible  operating  expenses  accounted  for  14%  of  the  corresponding  expenses  recognized  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements in the reporting year. The remaining portions of the key performance indicators are not Taxonomyeligible. Our main Taxonomy-eligible economic activities are derived from the manufacture of low-carbon transport and energy-efficient building technologies (mainly from Mobility and Smart Infrastructure operations), transport infrastructure (from Mobility operations) and the  service  of  energy-efficient  building  technologies  (from  Smart  Infrastructure  operations),  as  well  as  the  Group's  own  real  estate portfolio. The majority of Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures result from the latter economic activity. The above-mentioned economic activities refer to chapters 3, 6 and 7 of Annex I of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/852.",

Financial performance system\n\n## 2.1 Revenue growth\n\nIn the Siemens Financial Framework we aim to achieve a revenue growth range of 5% to 7% per year on a comparable basis over a cycle of three to five years. Our primary measure for managing and controlling our revenue growth is comparable growth, because it shows the development in our business net of currency translation effects, which arise from the external environment outside of our control, and portfolio effects, which involve business activities which are either new to or no longer a part of the respective business.\n\nCurrency translation effects are the difference between revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the current period and revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the comparison period. For calculating the percentage change year-over-year, this absolute difference is divided by revenue for the comparison period. A portfolio effect arises in the case of an acquisition  or  a  disposition  and  is  calculated  as  the  change  year-over-year  in  revenue  related  to  the  transaction.  For  calculating  the percentage change, this absolute change is divided by revenue for the comparison period. Any portfolio effect is excluded for the 12 months following the relevant transaction after which both current and past reporting periods fully reflect the portfolio change. For orders, we apply the same calculations for currency translation and portfolio effects as described above.\n\n## 2.2 Profitability and capital efficiency\n\nWithin the Siemens Financial Framework, we aim to achieve over a cycle of three to five years margins that are comparable to those of our relevant competitors. Therefore, we have defined profit margin ranges for our industrial businesses which also consider the profit margins of their respective relevant competitors. Profit margin is defined as profit of the respective business divided by its revenue.\n\nFor our industrial businesses, profit represents EBITA adjusted for amortization of intangible assets not acquired in business combinations.\n\nWe have set the following margin ranges:\n\n|                                            | Margin range   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Digital Industries                         | 17 - 23%       |\n| Smart Infrastructure                       | 11 - 16%       |\n| Mobility                                   | 10 - 13%       |\n| Siemens Healthineers                       | 17 - 21%       |\n| Siemens Financial Services (ROE after tax) | 15 - 20%       |\n\nFor Siemens Healthineers, we present the margin range we expect as that company's majority shareholder.\n\nIn line with common practice in the financial services business, our financial indicator for measuring capital efficiency at SFS is return on equity after tax, or ROE after tax. ROE is defined as SFS' profit after tax, divided by its average allocated equity.\n\nPrimary measure for managing and controlling profit and profitability at the Group level: Net income is the primary driver of basic earnings per share from net income (EPS) as well as of EPS before purchase price allocation accounting (EPS pre PPA) which is used for our capital market communication. EPS pre PPA is defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and related income taxes. As with EPS, EPS pre PPA includes the amounts attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG. We aim to achieve high-single-digit annual growth in EPS pre PPA over a cycle of three to five years.\n\nWe seek to work profitably and as efficiently as possible with the capital provided by our shareholders and lenders. For purposes of managing and controlling our capital efficiency, we use return on capital employed, or ROCE, as our primary measure in our Siemens Financial Framework. Our goal is to achieve a ROCE within a range of 15% to 20% over a cycle of three to five years.\n\n## 2.3 Capital structure\n\nSustainable  revenue  and  profit  development  is  supported  by  a  healthy  capital  structure.  Accordingly,  a  key  consideration  within  the Siemens Financial Framework is to maintain ready access to the capital markets through various debt products and preserve our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. Our primary measure for managing and controlling our capital structure is the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA (continuing operations). This financial measure indicates the approximate amount of time in years that would be  needed  to  cover  Industrial  net  debt  through  income  from  continuing  operations,  without  taking  into  account  interest,  taxes, depreciation and amortization. We aim to achieve a ratio of up to 1.5.\n\n## 2.4 Liquidity and dividend\n\nWe intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. In the Siemens Financial Framework, we strive for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year, or that at least matches the prior year level.\n\nAs in the past, we intend to fund the dividend payout from Free cash flow. Our primary measure to assess our ability to generate cash, and ultimately to pay dividends, is the cash conversion rate for the Siemens Group, defined as the ratio of Free cash flow (continuing and discontinued operations) to Net income. Over a cycle of three to five years, we aim to achieve a cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate.\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, will submit the following proposal to allocate the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for fiscal 2022: to distribute a dividend of \u20ac4.25 on each share of no par value entitled to the dividend for fiscal 2022 existing at the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting; the remaining amount is to be carried",

        "page_content": "## 3. Segment information\n\n## 3.1 Overall economic conditions\n\nGlobal economic development in fiscal 2022 was dominated by three disruptions: the war in Ukraine, the repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), and the economic slowdown in China. After the strong rebound of economic growth in calendar 2021, in which global gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 5.9%, calendar 2022 is expected to show global GDP increasing by only 2.9%. The postCOVID economic recovery came to a sudden end during calendar 2022.\n\nGlobal economic activity expanded strongly in the second half of calendar 2021 in light of increasing vaccination rates and lifted COVID19 restrictions as well as recovering consumer spending. This triggered inflationary pressures, especially in the United States (U.S.) and in Europe.  Primary  reasons  for  these  inflationary  pressures  included  limitations  on  the  supply  of  goods  and  services  due  to  COVID-19 repercussions (logistics bottlenecks, material and component shortages in the manufacturing sector, labor shortages especially in the service sector), while large stimulus packages and high household savings fueled pent-up demand. In addition, already high energy prices increased significantly and added to surging inflation rates.\n\nThe war in Ukraine impacted the overall economic conditions starting in the first quarter of calendar 2022. Energy prices - already soaring in the latter half of 2021 - sky-rocketed in the first half of calendar 2022. The tightening of gas flows from Russia to the European Union (EU) resulted in European natural gas prices temporarily increasing by as much as ten-fold compared to the prior year. Oil prices also increased significantly - global prices for Brent crude oil nearly doubled in March 2022 compared to March 2021. Both over-proportionally hit Germany and the industrial sector, especially energy-intensive industries such as chemicals. But due to its very strong start in calendar 2022, the EU economy is still expected to grow by 3.3% in calendar 2022.\n\nThe war in Ukraine put further pressure on developing economies, especially in the Middle East, Africa, and Turkey, as both Russia and Ukraine were major exporters of grain and fertilizer before the war. For emerging markets in aggregate, GDP is estimated to increase by 3.4% in calendar 2022 after it expanded by nearly 7% in 2021.\n\nChina's zero-COVID strategy became even more strict with the emergence of the Delta variant and the highly infectious Omicron variant, resulting in more major lockdowns which burdened economic activity and global supply chains in the second half of calendar 2021. In addition, regulatory restrictions on several high-growth sectors and companies along with a recession in the very important real estate sector weighed on the economy. Hence, China's GDP growth is expected to slow significantly in calendar 2022, to 3.0%, after it rebounded in calendar 2021 with 8.1%.\n\nWhile energy prices were a major contributor to inflationary pressure, both the U.S. and the EU experienced broader-based price increases. This resulted in a strong response by the Federal Reserve which massively tightened monetary policy by starting to reduce money supply (quantitative tightening) and increasing its key interest rate by 300 basis points from March to September 2022. The European Central Bank (ECB) also started to tighten monetary policy to reduce inflation. ECB's interest rate on main refinancing operations increased by a cumulative 125 basis points in August and September. U.S. inflation (as measured by the consumer price index, or CPI) is currently expected at 8.1% for calendar 2022, with EU inflation at 9%. Producer prices (PPI) are expected to increase even more: by 16.8% in the U.S. and as much as 30.4% in the EU, though a large part of the increase in the EU is driven by energy prices: while the overall PPI in September 2022 increased by 41.4% year-over-year, the index excluding energy grew by only 15% year-over-year.\n\nAs the Federal Reserve went forward with tackling inflation, it was followed by central banks around the world. The appreciation of the U.S.  dollar  against  most  other  currencies  added  to  inflation  outside  of  the  U.S.  and  put  pressure  on  international  financial  markets, especially for some emerging countries.\n\nOverall, the major economies experienced significant economic disruptions during calendar 2022. Therefore, GDP in calendar 2022 will grow much more slowly than was expected last year. For advanced countries in aggregate, calendar 2022 GDP is expected to expand by 2.5%. For emerging markets, the increase in calendar 2022 GDP is estimated at 3.4%.\n\nThe partly estimated figures presented here for GDP are based on an S&P Global report dated November 15, 2022.\n\n## 3.2 Digital Industries\n\nDigital Industries offers a comprehensive product portfolio and system solutions for automation used in discrete and process industries; these  offerings  include  automation  systems  and  software  for  factories,  numerical  control  systems,  motors,  drives  and  inverters  and integrated automation systems for machine tools and production machines. Digital Industries also provides process control systems, machine-to-machine communication products, sensors (for measuring pressure, temperature, level, flow rate, distance or shape) and radio  frequency  identification  systems.  Furthermore,  Digital  Industries  offers  production  and  product  lifecycle  management  (PLM) software,  and  software  for  simulation  and  testing  of  mechatronic  systems.  These  leading  software  offerings  are  integrated  with  an electronic design automation (EDA) software portfolio, and the open, cloud-based industrial Internet of Things (IoT) operating system MindSphere, which connects machines and physical infrastructure to the digital world. All these software offerings are complemented by the Mendix cloud-native low-code application development platform, which allows customers to significantly reduce app development times through visual representation of underlying code as well as by digital marketplaces for the global electronics value chain, such as Supplyframe and Pixeom. Digital Industries also provides customers with lifecycle and data-driven services.\n\nTaken together, Digital Industries' offerings enable customers to optimize entire value chains from product design and development through production and post-sale services. With its advanced software solutions in particular, Digital Industries supports customers in their evolution towards the 'Digital Enterprise,' resulting in increased flexibility and efficiency of production processes and reduced time to market for new products. The most important customer customermarkets include the automotive industry, the machine building industry, the  pharmaceutical  and  chemicals  industry,  the  food  and  beverage  industry  and  the  electronics  and  semiconductor  industry.  Digital Industries serves its customers through a common regional sales organization spanning all its businesses, using various sales channels depending on the type of customer and industry and also enhancing customer choice across all channels. Changes in customer demand, especially for standard products, are driven strongly by macroeconomic cycles, and can lead to significant short-term fluctuation in Digital Industries' profitability. Volume from large contracts in the software business, particularly for EDA, may also result in strong fluctuations",

        "page_content": "in quarterly volume and profitability. In fiscal 2022, Digital Industries started to transition parts of its software business, particularly PLM, from largely upfront revenue recognition towards Software as a Service (SaaS), which yields more predictable recurring revenue and offers growth  opportunities  by  opening  access  to  new  customers,  especially  small  and  medium-sized  companies  seeking  to  reduce  costs associated with owning complex IT infrastructure. The transition held back revenue growth rates and profit margin development in the software business in fiscal 2022 and Digital Industries expects continued impacts until completion of the transition. Competition with Digital  Industries'  business  activities  comes  primarily  from  multinational  corporations  that  offer  a  relatively  broad  portfolio  and  from smaller companies active only in certain geographic or product markets.\n\nDigital Industries sees three trends influencing its business and providing long-term growth opportunities. Producers of investment goods in today's increasingly digital environment must modernize their production capacity, particularly to increase production flexibility and reduce time to market. This environment also spurs producers to complement their core products with vertical solutions and service offerings, which their customers either need or want in order to take full advantage of the investment goods. Finally, there is a trend from globalization to regionalization, to support local economic development, to increase supply chain resilience or to better adapt solutions to local needs. This is increasingly accompanied by more differentiated regulatory requirements.\n\nResearch & Development (R&D) activities  at  Digital  Industries  are  aimed  at  helping  customers  to  increase  production  and  resource efficiency  by  merging  the  real  and  the  digital  worlds  in  a  continuous  flow  of  data  using  cutting-edge  technologies  such  as  artificial intelligence (AI), edge computing, cloud technologies, additive manufacturing, and industrial 5G technology. As part of Siemens' open digital marketplace Siemens Xcelerator - a business platform that includes a curated portfolio of IoT-enabled hardware, software and digital services from across Siemens and certified third parties and facilitates interactions and transactions between customers, partners and developers - Digital Industries is developing Industrial Operations X, a next-generation industrial IoT solution. Industrial Operations X is aimed at bringing together solutions and applications, ranging from sensors and edge computing to the cloud, IoT as a service and lowcode development capabilities, as well as including a wide range of ready-to-use apps. Furthermore, in fiscal 2022, Digital Industries launched the open Industrial Edge Ecosystem where third-party app providers can offer solutions based on the Siemens Industrial Edge platform, an IT platform which enables the scalable deployment of IT technologies and apps in the production environment. Customers thus benefit from a broad range of compatible software components, offered by numerous providers and manufacturers, which they can readily integrate into their manufacturing processes. For example, offerings of the Industrial Edge Ecosystem include an AI-based edge app to increase availability of drives. In fiscal 2022, Digital Industries strengthened its transition to SaaS by introducing a cloud-based version of its NX software (NX X) that combines the advantages of computer aided design software, centralized storage capacity and native collaboration.  With  its  latest  advances  in  additive  manufacturing,  Digital  Industries  enables  cost-effective  bespoke  manufacturing  of consumer products. Also in fiscal 2022, Digital Industries enabled the transmission of Profinet IO via a private 5G network, which allows industrial data to be transmitted securely across network boundaries in real time for industrial applications. This is made possible by the VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) transmission technology in the Scalance 5G routers and security appliances from Digital Industries. Major investments of Digital Industries in fiscal 2022 relate to its own factory automation, motion control and process automation businesses, to further automate and digitalize facilities particularly in Germany, China and the Czech Republic.\n\n|                            | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   | % Change   |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)         | 2022          | 2021          | Actual     | Comp.      |\n| Orders                     | 25,283        | 18,427        | 37%        | 32%        |\n| Revenue                    | 19,517        | 16,514        | 18%        | 13%        |\n| therein: software business | 4,691         | 4,290         | 9%         | 0%         |\n| Profit                     | 3,892         | 3,360         | 16%        |            |\n| Profit margin              | 19.9%         | 20.3%         |            |            |\n\nOrder growth was driven by extraordinarily strong customer demand in Digital Industries' major market segments. Orders rose in all businesses including a sharp increase in the factory automation business and substantial growth contributions from the other businesses. Within the software business, both EDA and PLM made strong growth contributions due to large contract wins. Revenue growth was mainly driven by the automation businesses. While Digital Industries successfully avoided major supply chain disruptions, shortages for electronics components and raw materials led to extended delivery times for some automation products. Growth in the software business was due mainly to positive currency translation effects. A high rate of customer acceptance of the PLM SaaS transition reduced current license revenue in favor of recurring future subscription revenue. On a geographic basis, orders rose substantially in all three reporting regions and revenue was up by double digits in all regions. Volume growth was led by the Asia, Australia region and included positive currency translation effects. Profit and profitability rose in all automation businesses led by a sharp increase in the motion control business. The increases were supported by higher capacity utilization and pricing measures to offset cost inflation. In contrast, profit in the software business declined. This was due mainly to revenue development from the SaaS transition and higher expenses related to cloud-based activities, which were also influenced by the SaaS transition. Severance charges fell to \u20ac64 million from \u20ac114 million in the prior year. Digital Industries' order backlog rose sharply year-over-year, reaching \u20ac14 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac11 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2023.\n\nIn  fiscal  2022, markets served  by  Digital  Industries  grew  clearly.  Growth  was  driven  by  a  further  recovery  in  global  manufacturing production, only partly held back by impacts related to the war in Ukraine, lockdown measures and electricity shutdowns in China, and global supply chain and logistics constraints. Nominal market growth in fiscal 2022 benefited from fast-rising price inflation especially in discrete and process industries, which started to weigh on real demand, especially consumer spending, towards the end of the fiscal year. Markets grew in all three reporting regions, led by Asia, Australia and the Americas. Overall, markets for discrete industries rose faster while recovery in the more project-related process industries was delayed. Within Digital Industries' most important customer markets, growth in the automotive industry was held back by the above-mentioned factors, most notably supply chain constraints, which impacted production. Ongoing structural changes in the macroeconomy - such as working from home, adoption of e-vehicles, and international trade  conflicts  -  are  expected  to  restrain  the  automotive  industry's  mid-term  growth  perspectives.  The  machine-building  industry expanded strongly, with growth driven by demand in Japan, the U.S. and eastern European countries. The machine-building industry benefited from demand for general investment goods. This development was evident in demand for automation equipment which in addition benefited from the trend towards digitalization. The pharmaceutical and the chemicals industries grew throughout the fiscal year,",

        "page_content": "but with slower momentum towards the end of the fiscal year. The food and beverage industry grew steadily throughout the fiscal year, with the beverage industry growing faster than the food industry. Global production of electronics and semiconductors experienced strong growth in fiscal 2022, with some moderation during the course of the fiscal year due in part to production lockdowns in China. Market shifts before fiscal 2022 in the semiconductor industry led to global shortages of semiconductors for certain customer segments such as the  automotive  industry;  demand  patterns  began  to  normalize  at  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  including  more  moderate  spending  on consumer electronics. Supplier price increases, caused mainly by shortages, affected all of the key markets for Digital Industries, and were sharper than usual for a period of economic rebound. For fiscal 2023, Digital Industries' primary markets are expected to show strong revenue growth benefiting in part from high order backlogs and price inflation. While growth is expected to be more evenly spread across the three reporting regions than in fiscal 2022, growth momentum is expected to slow down gradually over the course of the fiscal year. Growth expectations for fiscal 2023 are subject to a high level of uncertainty depending among other factors on the development of geopolitical tensions, trade sanctions, energy markets and interest rates.\n\n## 3.3 Smart Infrastructure\n\nSmart Infrastructure offers products, systems, solutions, services and software to support a sustainable transition from fossil to renewable energy sources, as well as a transition to smarter, more sustainable buildings and communities.

Order growth was highlighted by strong demand from industrial customers, for data centers and for digital building services, and included proactive purchasing by customers. Revenue also rose in all businesses led by the electrical products  business,  which  operated  in  strong  customer  markets.  Smart  Infrastructure  successfully  avoided  major  disruptions  from challenging supply chain conditions. On a geographic basis, orders and revenue rose in all three reporting regions. The strongest growth contribution came from the Americas region, driven by the U.S., while growth in the Asia, Australia region was held back by impacts related to COVID-19 in China. Both order and revenue development included positive currency translation effects. Profit and profitability rose in all businesses, with the strongest increases coming from the electrical products business and the buildings business. The increases were due mainly to higher capacity utilization, pricing measures to offset cost inflation and cost savings related to prior execution of Smart Infrastructure's competitiveness program. Severance charges, largely associated with the program, fell to \u20ac28 million from \u20ac47 million a year earlier. In fiscal 2022, Smart Infrastructure recorded a \u20ac54 million gain from the sale of a business. These positive effects were only partly offset by COVID-19-related impacts mainly from medical leaves and lockdowns in China. Smart Infrastructure's order backlog was \u20ac15 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac10 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2023.\n\nOverall, markets served by Smart Infrastructure grew clearly in fiscal 2022. Market dynamics were influenced by a further recovery from COVID-19-related effects, severe supply chain and logistics constraints, strong price inflation and effects from the war in Ukraine. On a geographic basis, all reporting regions contributed to growth. Price inflation affected all regions and came in particularly high in the U.S. In China, growth was held back by lockdown measures, which also impacted growth dynamics in other countries, while Europe was most strongly affected by the war in Ukraine. Grid markets grew above average with market growth driven by demand for integration of energy from renewable resources. Industrial markets grew nearly as fast as grid markets, driven by growth in the automotive industry among other factors. Growth in the buildings market came in somewhat lower mainly due to weaker growth momentum in commercial building markets. In fiscal 2023, markets served by Smart Infrastructure are expected to grow slightly slower than in fiscal 2022. While growth in residential and commercial building markets and some industrial markets is expected to slow down somewhat, demand for data centers and power distribution is expected to be robust. Price inflation is expected to contribute to market growth in fiscal 2023. Overall, market development in fiscal 2023 is expected to continue to be influenced by supply chain constraints and effects from the war in Ukraine, including on energy prices. Further impacts could arise from potential lockdown measures in China and geopolitical tensions.\n\n## 3.4 Mobility\n\nMobility combines all Siemens businesses in the area of passenger and freight transportation. Within its rolling stock business, its offerings encompass trains for urban and regional transport such as vehicles for metro systems, trams and light rail, and commuter trains as well as trains and passenger coaches for intercity and long-distance services, such as high-speed rail. Rolling stock offerings furthermore include locomotives for freight or passenger transport and solutions for automated transportation such as automated people movers. Offerings in its rail infrastructure business include products and solutions for rail automation, such as automatic train control systems, interlocking, operations control and telematic systems, digital station solutions and railway communication systems, signaling on-board and crossing products and yard and depot solutions; and for electrification such as AC and DC traction power supply, contact lines and network control. With its service business, Mobility provides customer services for rolling stock and rail infrastructure throughout the entire lifecycle, such as maintenance and digital services. In its turnkey business, it bundles consulting, planning, financing, construction, service and operation of complete mobility systems. Mobility's software business comprises intermodal solutions, such as platforms for fleet management, route planning,  ticketing  and  payments  solutions  and  data  analytics.  To  enhance  these  offerings,  Mobility  at  the  beginning  of  fiscal  2022 acquired SQCAP B.V. (Sqills), Netherlands, a provider of cloud-based inventory management, reservation, and ticketing software for public transport operators. During fiscal 2022, Mobility divested its road traffic business, Yunex Traffic.\n\nMobility sells its products, systems and solutions through its worldwide network of sales and execution units. The principal customers of Mobility are public and state-owned companies in the transportation and logistics sectors, so its markets are driven primarily by public spending. Customers usually have multi-year planning and implementation horizons, and their contract tenders therefore tend to be independent of short-term economic trends. Large contracts in the rolling stock and the rail infrastructure business are often awarded together  with  service  contracts,  which  start  to  generate  revenue  only  after  the  respective  products  and  solutions  have  been  put  in operation,  which  can  be  a  number  of  years  after  the  contract  award.  Mobility's  principal  competitors  are  multinational  companies. Consolidation among Mobility's competitors is continuing and may lead to increased competitive pressure within the rail transport industry and also to fewer sourcing options for rail customers.\n\nThe  main trends driving  Mobility's  markets  are  urbanization,  the  need  to  reduce  emissions  from  transportation,  and  digitalization. Increasing populations in urban centers need daily mobility that is simpler, faster, and more flexible, reliable and affordable. At the same time, cities and national economies face the challenge of cutting CO2 and noise emissions and reducing space requirements and costs of transportation.  The  pressure  on  mobility  providers  to  meet  all  these  needs  is  expected  to  rise  continuously.  Furthermore,  improving availability,  connectivity,  and  sustainability  of  rail  infrastructures  increasingly  requires  digital  solutions,  which  generates  growth opportunities for providers of such solutions. IoT systems and new software-based solutions such as Mobility as a Service (MaaS) are expected to become major growth enablers for the rail industry. While a significant drop in ridership driven by COVID-19 has strongly impacted mobility operators, overall trends towards urbanization and decarbonization persist unchanged and many countries have been allocating significant funds to rail and public transport operators to address these trends.",

Mobility again took in a substantial volume from large orders, nearly on the high level of the prior year. Contract wins in fiscal 2022 were highlighted by an order worth \u20ac1.5 billion for high-speed trains in Germany, a number of orders for locomotives, among them a \u20ac0.6 billion order for locomotives and associated service in the U.S., and an order worth \u20ac0.3 billion for a train control system from Norway. Order intake a year earlier included among others Mobility's largestever contract in the Americas, worth \u20ac2.8 billion, for trainsets and associated services. Revenue rose in all businesses, led by the services business and the rail infrastructure business. Growth was partly held back by supplier delays in delivering materials and components, along with effects related to COVID-19 mainly including medical leave for employees. On a geographic basis, revenue growth was driven mainly by  the  region  Europe,  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  (C.I.S.),  Africa,  Middle  East,  due  particularly  to  a  significant  growth contribution from Germany. Profit was burdened by impairments and other charges totaling \u20ac0.6 billion for winding down business activities in Russia, among them a \u20ac0.2 billion impairment of the entire carrying amount of an investment accounted for using the equity method. In addition, profit included impacts from supplier delays and COVID-19 effects. These burdens were largely offset by a gain of \u20ac0.7 billion from the sale of Yunex Traffic. Severance charges were \u20ac27 million, compared to \u20ac22 million a year earlier. Mobility's order backlog was \u20ac36 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac10 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2023.\n\nMarkets served by Mobility grew moderately in fiscal 2022, supported by long-term trends such as urbanization and decarbonization, though growth dynamics were held back by effects related to COVID-19 and by material shortages. The market for rolling stock saw large orders across all segments, especially for high-speed trains, commuter trains and locomotives. The rail infrastructure market has seen growth in  both  urban  and  mainline  segments  due  to  the  renewal  and  extension  of  mainline  tracks  and  the  ongoing  trend  towards automatic  train  protection  (ATP),  including  communications-based  train  control  (CBTC)  and  ETCS  technologies.  The  service  business benefited from an increased installed base at global level and large backlogs in maintenance orders backlogs in some countries. On a geographic basis, market development in Europe continued to be characterized by awards of mid-size to large orders, particularly in Germany, Denmark and in Switzerland. While demand in the Middle East rose, demand in Africa was held back by ongoing uncertainties related to budget constraints and political climates. In the Americas region, customer demand was strongest for urban and mainline transport, especially in the U.S. and Canada. Within the Asia, Australia region, markets saw ongoing rail investments, particularly in China. For fiscal 2023, markets served by Mobility are expected to grow significantly with all reporting regions contributing to growth. Market expansion  is  expected  to  be  supported  by  a  large  number  of  fiscal  stimulus  and  investment  programs.  Mobility  anticipates  that  rail operators in Europe, particularly in Germany and in the U.K., will continue making significant investments in rolling stock and advanced rail infrastructure solutions and that customers in the Middle East and Africa will tender large turnkey systems, especially for additional rail lines in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Markets in the Americas region are expected to remain strong, especially due to ongoing investments in urban and mainline transport and large investment programs dedicated to transportation and enhancements of existing infrastructure in the U.S. In Asia, markets in China are also expected to remain strong with investments in high-speed trains, urban transport, freight logistics and rail infrastructure driving growth. Markets in India are expected to grow strongly due to investments in  high-speed  trains  and  infrastructure.  Despite  an  adverse  short-term  impact  from  COVID-19,  rail  transport  and  intermodal  mobility solutions are expected to remain a high priority. In emerging countries, rising incomes are expected to result in greater demand for public transport solutions.\n\n## 3.5 Siemens Healthineers\n\nSiemens as majority shareholder holds just over 75% of the shares of the publicly listed Siemens Healthineers AG, Germany (Siemens Healthineers).

Competition in the imaging, Varian and advanced therapies businesses consists mainly of a small number of large multinational companies, while the diagnostics market is fragmented with a variety of global players that compete with each other across market segments and also with several regional players and specialized companies in niche technologies. The business activities of Siemens Healthineers are to a certain extent resilient to  short-term  economic  trends  because  large  portions  of  its  revenue  stem  from  recurring  business.  They  are,  however,  directly  and indirectly dependent on trends in healthcare markets and on developments in health policy, and geopolitical developments around the world.\n\nThe addressable markets of Siemens Healthineers are shaped by four major trends . The first is demographic, in particular the growing and aging global population. This trend poses major challenges for global healthcare systems and, at the same time, offers opportunities for players  in  the  healthcare  industry  as  the  demand  for  cost-efficient  healthcare  solutions  continues  to  intensify.  The  second  trend  is economic development in emerging countries, which opens up improved access to healthcare for many people. Significant investment in the expansion of private and public healthcare systems will persist, driving overall demand for healthcare products and services and hence market growth. The third trend is the increase in chronic diseases as a consequence of an aging population and environmental and lifestylerelated changes. This trend results in far more patients with multiple morbidities, putting further pressure on healthcare systems and leading to higher costs; it also increases the need for new ways to detect and treat diseases more timely. The fourth global trend, the transformation of healthcare providers such as hospitals and laboratories, results from a combination of societal and market forces that are driving healthcare providers to operate and organize their businesses differently. Increasing cost pressure on the healthcare sector is prompting  the  introduction  of  new  remuneration  models  for  healthcare  services,  such  as  value-based  rather  than  treatment-based reimbursement. Digitalization and artificial intelligence are thereby likely to be key enablers for healthcare providers as they increasingly focus on enhancing the overall patient experience, with better outcomes and overall reduction in cost of care. This development is driven partly by society's increasing resistance to healthcare costs, payers' increasing professionalization, burdens from chronic disease, rapid scientific  progress  and staff shortages. As a result of these factors, healthcare providers are consolidating into networked structures, resulting in larger clinic and laboratory chains, often operating internationally, which act increasingly like large corporations. Applying this industrial logic to the healthcare market can lead to systematic improvements in quality, while at the same time reducing costs.\n\nR&D activities at Siemens Healthineers are aimed at delivering innovative, sustainable solutions to its customers while safeguarding and improving its competitiveness. In particular, in the areas of artificial intelligence, sensing technology, and robotics R&D activities were expanded. In addition, Siemens Healthineers harnesses advanced technologies such as AI and data analytics to improve cancer treatment and expand global access to cancer care. Key applications of sensing technology range from laboratory diagnostic tests via computed tomography detectors and electromagnetic measurement fields in magnetic resonance all the way to ultrasonic transducers. Siemens Healthineers already uses robots for laboratory assistance, radiation, patient handling, and robotic imaging devices. Siemens Healthineers focuses its investments mainly  on  enhancing  competitiveness and innovation. The main capital expenditures were for spending for factories to expand manufacturing and technical capabilities, in particular in the U.S. and China, and for additions to intangible assets, including capitalized development expenses within the Atellica Solution and Central Lab product lines.\n\n|                    | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   | % Change   |\n|--------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac) | 2022          | 2021          | Actual     | Comp.      |\n| Orders             | 25,556        | 20,320        | 26%        | 9%         |\n| Revenue            | 21,715        | 17,997        | 21%        | 6%         |\n| Profit             | 3,369         | 2,847         | 18%        |            |\n| Profit margin      | 15.5%         | 15.8%         |            |            |\n\nIn fiscal 2022, Siemens Healthineers recorded double-digit growth both in orders and revenue , which developed similarly. All businesses contributed to this growth. On a geographic basis, the Americas and Asia, Australia regions recorded substantial growth, both benefiting from strong positive portfolio and currency translation effects. In total, portfolio effects, primarily related to the acquisition of Varian in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, added ten percentage points to order and nine percentage points to revenue growth; additionally, currency translation effects added seven percentage points to order and six percentage points to revenue growth. Profit benefited primarily from strong earnings development in the diagnostics business which was driven by high demand for rapid coronavirus antigen tests. The imaging business again posted strong earnings, which were higher than in the prior year. Overall profitability was burdened by subsequent measurement effects from purchase price allocation related to the Varian acquisition totaling \u20ac0.2 billion and by higher procurement and logistics  costs.  Severance  charges  were  \u20ac71  million  in  fiscal  2022  and  \u20ac68  million  in  fiscal  2021.  The  order  backlog  for  Siemens Healthineers was \u20ac34 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac12 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2023.\n\nIn general, the addressable global markets excluding rapid coronavirus antigen tests grew slightly on a revenue basis in fiscal 2022. From a regional perspective, the Asia, Australia region saw market growth in most businesses; in China, growth opportunities were prevented by COVID-19-related restrictions. In the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East, EU government investment programs, among others, were able to support growth in most businesses. In the U.S., market growth was recorded in most businesses. Globally, overall market development for the imaging business was supported by positive developments in the magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear medicine markets, after demand had already recovered in the prior fiscal year; in contrast, delays in revenue recognition due to global supply chain constraints, among other factors, weakened growth. The imaging market is expected to grow moderately overall in fiscal 2023, driven mainly by pent-up demand for major modalities. Within the diagnostics business, the rapid coronavirus antigen test market experienced a sharp increase; in addition, point-of-care (excluding rapid coronavirus antigen tests) and laboratory diagnostics (excluding molecular diagnostics)  recorded  ongoing  recovery  in  patient  volumes  as  markets  continued  to  return  to  normalized  levels  following  COVID-19 lockdowns. The diagnostics market is expected to achieve moderate growth in fiscal 2023, excluding COVID-19 testing and molecular diagnostics, and return to pre-COVID-19 market growth across most regions. In Varian markets, product and service innovations led to higher customer investment in the U.S. and Western Europe, while other markets were driven by a need to expand access to oncology equipment and services to underserved population groups and regions. The market for Varian is expected to continue its significant growth. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and global supply chain challenges, the resumption of oncology investments is expected to increase. For advanced therapies, the market recovered from COVID-19 in all relevant regions. The expectation for advanced therapies is that the market will continue to grow clearly in fiscal 2023, but at a more measured pace than in fiscal 2022.",

Based on its comprehensive financing know-how and specialist technology expertise in the areas of Siemens businesses, SFS supports its customers' investments with leasing, lending, working capital and structured financing solutions and offers a broad range of equipment and project financing. In addition, SFS supports Siemens' industrial businesses with financial advisory services and via a joint go-to-market that includes SFS's risk management expertise, such as to assess the risk profiles of projects or business models. Furthermore, SFS  collaborates  with  Siemens'  industrial  businesses  to  co-develop  new  digital  business  models  and  enables  its  customers  to  drive sustainable  growth  through  smart  financing  solutions.  Recent  examples  include  pay-per-use  and  pay-for-outcome  models  that  give customers more financial flexibility.\n\n|                             | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)          | 2022          | 2021          |\n| Earnings before taxes (EBT) | 498           | 512           |\n| therein: equity business    | 269           | 49            |\n| ROE (after taxes)           | 15.6%         | 15.5%         |\n\n|                    | Sep 30,   | Sep 30,   |\n|--------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac) | 2022      | 2021      |\n| Total assets       | 33,263    | 30,384    |\n\nEarnings before taxes were affected by an increase of expenses for credit risk provisions compared to fiscal 2021 and for impairments on assets in the debt business. Therein impacts of \u20ac0.2 billion were recorded in connection with the sale of the financing and leasing business in Russia at the end of fiscal 2022. Decreased results from the debt business were nearly offset by a sharply improved earnings contribution from the equity business, which was driven by gains from fair value measurements and sales of investments, including an offshore wind-farm project divested for a gain of \u20ac0.1 billion, and from energy-related investments in connection with rising prices in global energy markets.\n\nThe increase in total assets since the end of fiscal 2021 was driven by positive currency translation effects.\n\nNet cash from operations (defined as the sum of cash flows from operating and investing activities) amounted to \u20ac(616) million compared to \u20ac105 million in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, net cash from operations comprised Free cash flow of \u20ac985 million and \u20ac820 million, respectively, and remaining cash flows from investing activities, including from change in receivables from financing activities, of \u20ac(1,601) million and \u20ac(715) million, respectively.\n\nSFS is de-risking its business profile by reducing exposure to energy-related equity investments. This has the additional benefit of more tightly focusing SFS's business scope and capital allocation on areas of intense domain know-how closely aligned with Siemens' customers and  markets,  particularly  for  Digital  Industries,  Smart  Infrastructure  and  Mobility.  Accordingly,  SFS  is  influenced  by  the  business development of the markets served by our industrial businesses, among other factors, including macroeconomic effects like inflation or recession which could impact the credit risk of customers. In addition to its high level of diversification across industries, SFS has a strong regional footprint in investment-grade countries, with the highest share in the U.S. SFS intends to maintain a highly diversified portfolio across regions, while participating in the strong economic development of selected Asian markets.\n\n## 3.7 Portfolio Companies\n\nPortfolio  Companies comprise  businesses  which  deliver  a  broad  range  of  customized  and  application-specific  products,  software, solutions, systems and services for different industries including oil and gas, chemical, mining, cement, logistics, energy, marine, water and fiber. Unrealized potential within these businesses requires adjustment in their approach using defined measures including internal re-organization, digitalization, cost improvements, and optimizing procurement, production and service activities. After achieving certain threshold performance targets, businesses may be transferred to one of Siemens industrial businesses, combined with an external business from the same industry, sold or placed into an external private equity partnership.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, Siemens sold its mail and parcel-handling business (formerly part of Siemens Logistics) to the K\u00f6rber Group and its atequity investment in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH to Valeo GmbH. Siemens also reached an agreement in May 2022 to sell its Commercial Vehicles business to Meritor, Inc. Closing of the transaction was at the beginning of fiscal 2023.\n\nTaking these divestments into consideration, Portfolio Companies consists mainly of three fully consolidated, separately managed units. Large  Drives  Applications,  which  offers  electric  motors,  converters  and  solutions  for  mining,  is  being  carved  out  to  increase  its entrepreneurial freedom and thereby unlock its full potential. Siemens Logistics, offers sorting technology and solutions, focused on baggage and cargo handling at airports. The third fully consolidated unit, Siemens Energy Assets, comprises certain remaining regional business activities of the former Gas and Power segment; as part of the Siemens Energy carve-out these activities remained with Siemens due to country-specific regulatory restrictions or economic considerations.\n\nDemand within  the  industries  served  by  Portfolio  Companies  mainly  shows  a  delayed  response  to  changes  in  the  overall  economic environment. The results are strongly dependent, however, on customer investment cycles in their key industries. In commodity-based industries such as oil and gas or mining, these cycles are driven mainly by commodity price fluctuations rather than changes in produced volumes. The heterogonous industrial customer base of the fully consolidated units requires a dedicated sales approach based on in-depth understanding of specific industries and customer requests, resulting in the use of various sales and marketing channels for Portfolio Companies.",

The profit was driven by the two disposals mentioned above: a gain of \u20ac1.1 billion from the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business and a revaluation gain of \u20ac0.3 billion in connection with the sale of the equity investment in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH. For comparison, the loss in fiscal 2021 was due mainly to negative results in the equity investment. Additionally, Portfolio Companies recorded lower severance charges of \u20ac20 million, down from \u20ac74 million in fiscal 2021. Portfolio Companies' order backlog was \u20ac4 billion at the end of fiscal 2022, of which \u20ac3 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2023.\n\nAlthough the broad range of businesses is operating in diverse markets, overall the main markets served by Portfolio Companies are generally  impacted  by  uncertainties  regarding  geopolitical  and  economic  developments  which  tend  to  increase  customer  caution regarding purchasing decisions. However, ongoing recovery is expected to continue in most end-customer vertical markets in fiscal 2023.\n\n## 3.8 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nProfit\n\n|                                                                     | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                  | 2022          | 2021          |\n| Siemens Energy Investment                                           | (2,911)       | (396)         |\n| Siemens Real Estate                                                 | 118           | 94            |\n| Innovation                                                          | (190)         | (207)         |\n| Governance                                                          | (582)         | (751)         |\n| Centrally carried pension expense                                   | (113)         | (170)         |\n| Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations | (990)         | (738)         |\n| Financing, eliminations and other items                             | (474)         | 452           |\n| Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements                 | (5,141)       | (1,717)       |\n\nThe result for Siemens Energy Investment was strongly influenced by an impairment of \u20ac2.7 billion on Siemens' 35% stake in Siemens Energy AG. The negative result also included Siemens' share of Siemens Energy's after-tax loss and, in addition, expenses from amortization of assets resulting from purchase price allocation due to the initial recognition of the investment at fair value in September 2020.\n\nThe increase in Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations related mainly to the acquisition of Varian by Siemens Healthineers.\n\nFinancing, eliminations and other items included impacts totaling \u20ac0.5 billion at Corporate Treasury, resulting from the sale of Siemens' financing and leasing business in Russia at the end of fiscal 2022. Further negative effects included a revaluation loss of \u20ac0.3 billion on the stake in Thoughtworks Holding, Inc. (the prior year included a gain of \u20ac0.3 billion on this stake) as well as a loss of \u20ac0.1 billion resulting from applying hyperinflation accounting related mainly to T\u00fcrkiye. These effects were partly offset by a gain of \u20ac0.5 billion in connection with an investment accounted for using the equity method mainly due to its fair value measurement. For comparison, fiscal 2021 included gains of \u20ac0.4 billion related to the transfers of assets to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. in Germany and expenses of \u20ac0.1 billion from revised estimates related to provisions for a legacy project.",

Results of operations\n\n## 4.1 Orders and revenue by region\n\nCurrency  translation  effects  added  five  percentage  points  each  to  order  and  revenue  growth,  respectively.  Portfolio  transactions,  in particular the acquisition of Varian by Siemens Healthineers in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, added three percentage points to order and two percentage points to revenue growth year-over-year. The ratio of orders to revenue (book-to-bill) for Siemens in fiscal 2022 was 1.24.

The broad-based increase in emerging markets was driven by China and, to a lesser degree, India.\n\nIn  the Europe,  C.I.S.,  Africa,  Middle  East region,  order  intake  increased  in  all  four  industrial  businesses.  Order  growth  was  led  by substantial increases in Digital Industries and Mobility. Smart Infrastructure and Siemens Healthineers also recorded strong order growth year-over year. In Germany, Mobility posted sharp growth due to a higher volume from large orders that included a \u20ac1.5 billion order for high-speed trains. Digital  Industries  and  Smart  Infrastructure  also  posted  double-digit  growth,  while  orders  for  Siemens  Healthineers declined due mainly to lower volume from rapid coronavirus antigen tests.\n\nOrder intake in both the Americas region and in the U.S. showed a similar pattern: Smart Infrastructure, Digital Industries and Siemens Healthineers recorded double-digit growth, while orders in Mobility declined sharply on a lower volume from large orders which in the prior year included a \u20ac2.8 billion order in the U.S. In addition, order intake both in the region and in the U.S. was subject to significant positive currency translation effects, as well as strong portfolio effects which related primarily to the acquisition of Varian.\n\nIn the Asia, Australia region, order intake was up on double-digit increases in the majority of industrial businesses, with sharp growth at Digital Industries. The pattern of order development in China was largely the same as for the region. Overall, order intake both in the region and in China benefited clearly from positive currency translation effects.\n\n## Revenue (location of customer)\n\n|                                     | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   | % Change   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                  | 2022          | 2021          | Actual     | Comp.      |\n| Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East | 33,481        | 31,138        | 8%         | 6%         |\n| therein: Germany                    | 11,961        | 11,249        | 6%         | 6%         |\n| Americas                            | 20,680        | 16,312        | 27%        | 10%        |\n| therein: U.S.                       | 17,241        | 13,521        | 28%        | 10%        |\n| Asia, Australia                     | 17,816        | 14,815        | 20%        | 10%        |\n| therein: China                      | 9,557         | 8,232         | 16%        | 5%         |\n| Siemens (continuing operations)     | 71,977        | 62,265        | 16%        | 8%         |\n| therein: emerging markets\u00b9          | 20,249        | 17,651        | 15%        | 6%         |\n\nRevenue related to external customers rose in all four industrial businesses year-over-year, with the highest contributions coming from Siemens Healthineers.

Severance  charges  for  continuing  operations  were  \u20ac272  million,  of  which  \u20ac190  million  were  in  Industrial  Business.  In  fiscal  2021, severance charges for continuing operations were \u20ac410 million, of which \u20ac251 million were in Industrial Business.\n\nIncome from continuing operations decreased by 22%. The tax rate in fiscal 2022 was 38% (fiscal 2021: 25%), substantially impacted by the nontax-deductible impairment of the stake in Siemens Energy AG. Following the war in Ukraine, Siemens decided to exit business activities in Russia. Subsequent to this decision, Income from continuing operations was burdened by negative effects totaling \u20ac1.3 billion related to these activities primarily at Mobility, SFS and Corporate Treasury.\n\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in  fiscal 2021 included primarily a gain of \u20ac0.9 billion from the sale of Flender GmbH.\n\nThe decrease in Basic EPS and in EPS pre PPA reflects the decrease of Net income attributable to Shareholders of Siemens AG, which was \u20ac3,723 million in fiscal 2022 compared to \u20ac6,161 million in fiscal 2021.\n\nThe impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG burdened ROCE by 5.3 percentage points, resulting in a declined ROCE year-over-year which is below the target range set in our Siemens Financial Framework.\n\n## 4.3 Research and development\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we reported research and development expenses of \u20ac5.6 billion, compared to \u20ac4.9 billion in fiscal 2021. The resulting R&D intensity, defined as the ratio of R&D expenses and revenue, was 7.8%, as in fiscal 2021. Additions to capitalized development expenses amounted to \u20ac0.3 billion as in the prior year. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, Siemens worldwide held approximately 43,600 granted patents in its continuing operations. On average, we had 46,900 R&D employees in fiscal 2022.\n\nOur research and development activities are ultimately geared to developing innovative, sustainable solutions for our customers - and our businesses - while also strengthening our own competitiveness. Joint implementation by the operating units and Technology, our central R&D department, ensures that research activities and business strategies are closely aligned with one another, and that all units benefit equally and quickly from technological developments.\n\nSiemens core technologies have been determined to be critical for our Company's long-term success and that of our customers and have been refocused in fiscal 2022 in eleven technology areas: additive manufacturing and materials, cybersecurity and trust, data analytics and artificial intelligence, power electronics, simulation and digital twin, sustainable energy and infrastructure, automation, integrated circuits and electronics, connectivity and edge, software systems and processes, and user experience.\n\nWe advance technologies also through our open innovation concept. We work closely with scholars from leading universities, research institutions and academic start-ups, not only under bilateral cooperation agreements but also in publicly funded collective projects. Our focus here is on our strategic research partners and in particular the Siemens Research and Innovation Ecosystems, which we maintain at 16 locations worldwide.\n\nSiemens' global venture capital unit, Next47, provides capital to help start-ups expand and scale. It serves as the creator of next-generation businesses for Siemens by building, buying and partnering with innovative companies at any stage. Next47 is focused on anticipating how emerging technologies will influence our end markets. This foreknowledge enables our Company and our customers to grow and thrive in the age of digitalization.",

The latter line item rose also due to increased positive fair values of derivative financial instruments, partly offset by effects related to the sale of Siemens' financing and leasing business in Russia.\n\nInventories increased in all industrial businesses, with the build-up most evident at Siemens Healthineers, Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure.\n\nWhile the currency translation effects mentioned above resulted in an increase of goodwill and other intangible assets , another major factor  was  the  acquisition  of  Brightly.  The  increase  of  other  intangible  assets  resulted  also  from  the  acquisition  of  Sqills.  For  further information see Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022.\n\nThe impairment on Siemens' 35% stake in Siemens Energy was the main factor for the decrease of investments accounted for using the equity method .\n\nDeferred tax assets decreased due mainly to income tax effects related to remeasurement of defined benefits plans.\n\nThe decrease in other assets was driven mainly by lower net defined benefit assets, primarily from effects of asset ceiling.",

This was partly offset by reclassifications of long-term instruments totaling \u20ac4.5 billion.\n\nContract liabilities increased in all industrial businesses, with the build-up most evident at Siemens Healthineers, Digital Industries and Mobility.\n\nCurrent income tax liabilities increased mainly due to future tax payments resulting from the sale of Siemens' mail and parcel-handling business, among other divestments.\n\nLong-term debt increased due primarily to the issuance of euro instruments of \u20ac5.0 billion and currency translation effects for bonds issued in the U.S. dollar and British pound. Set against this were mainly decreases from the above-mentioned reclassifications.\n\nProvisions for pensions and similar obligations decreased mainly due to a higher discount rate. This effect was partially offset by a negative return on plan assets and inflation-related adjustments.\n\nThe increase of other financial liabilities resulted primarily from negative fair values of derivative financial instruments, which declined further.\n\nThe main factors for the increase in total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG were \u20ac3.7 billion in net income attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG; positive other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, of \u20ac5.8 billion resulting mainly from currency translation, partly offset by negative effects from remeasurements of defined benefit plans. The increase was partly offset by dividend payments of \u20ac3.2 billion (for fiscal 2021) and the repurchases of 14,185,791 treasury shares totaling \u20ac1.6 billion (including commission to a commissional bank).\n\n## Capital structure ratio\n\nOur capital structure ratio as of September 30, 2022 decreased to 1.0 from 1.5 a year earlier. The change was due to a decrease in Industrial net debt and a higher EBITDA.\n\n## Debt and credit facilities\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, we recorded, in total, \u20ac44.8 billion in notes and bonds, \u20ac2.7 billion in loans from banks, \u20ac0.1 billion in other financial indebtedness and \u20ac3.0 billion in lease liabilities. Notes and bonds were issued mainly in the U.S. dollar and euro, and to a lesser extent in the British pound.\n\nWe have credit facilities totaling \u20ac7.5 billion which were unused as of September 30, 2022.\n\nFor further information about our debt see Note 16 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022.

This included primarily Siemens' obligations from performance and credit guarantees in connection with the Siemens Energy business, for which Siemens has reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  commitments,  there  are  contingent  liabilities  of  \u20ac0.4  billion  which  result  mainly  from  other  guarantees,  legal proceedings and from joint and several liabilities of consortia. Other guarantees include \u20ac0.1 billion in connection with the Siemens Energy business, for which Siemens has reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.\n\nIrrevocable loan commitments amounted to \u20ac4.0 billion. A considerable portion of these commitments resulted from asset-based lending transactions, meaning that the respective loans can be drawn only after the borrower has provided sufficient collateral.\n\nFor further information about our commitments and contingencies see Note 21 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022.\n\n## Share buyback\n\nThe share buyback program announced on June 24, 2021 with a volume of up to \u20ac3 billion ending September 15, 2026, at the latest, began on November 15, 2021. This buyback is executed based on the authorization provided by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020. In fiscal 2022, Siemens repurchased 14,185,791 shares under this share buyback program.\n\n## 6.2 Cash flows\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                                      | Fiscal year  2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities                                                    |                     |\n| Net income                                                                              | 4,392               |\n| Change in operating net working capital                                                 | 537                 |\n| Other reconciling items to cash flows from operating activities - continuing operations | 5,392               |\n| Cash flows from operating activities - continuing operations                            | 10,322              |\n| Cash flows from operating activities - discontinued operations                          | (81)                |\n| Cash flows from operating activities - continuing and discontinued operations           | 10,241              |\n| Cash flows from investing activities                                                    |                     |\n| Additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment                        | (2,084)             |\n| Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired                                        | (2,207)             |\n| Purchase of investments and financial assets for investment purposes                    | (1,404)             |\n| Change in receivables from financing activities of SFS                                  | (1,100)             |\n| Other disposals of assets                                                               | 4,327               |\n| Cash flows from investing activities - continuing operations                            | (2,467)             |\n| Cash flows from investing activities - discontinued operations                          | (23)                |\n| Cash flows from investing activities - continuing and discontinued operations           | (2,490)             |\n| Cash flows from financing activities                                                    |                     |\n| Purchase of treasury shares                                                             | (1,565)             |\n| Re-issuance of treasury shares and other transactions with owners                       | (305)               |\n| Issuance of long-term debt                                                              | 4,969               |\n| Repayment of long-term debt (including current maturities of long-term debt)            | (6,663)             |\n| Change in short-term debt and other financing activities                                | 455                 |\n| Interest paid                                                                           | (824)               |\n| Dividends paid to shareholders of Siemens AG                                            | (3,215)             |\n| Dividends attributable to non-controlling interests                                     | (354)               |\n| Cash flows from financing activities - continuing operations                            | (7,502)             |\n| Cash flows from financing activities - discontinued operations                          | (1)                 |\n| Cash flows from financing activities - continuing and discontinued operations           | (7,502)             |\n\nAll industrial businesses recorded cash inflows from operating activities which exceed their profit, with the highest contribution from Digital Industries.

Within the industrial businesses, ongoing investments related mainly to technological innovations; maintaining, extending and digitalizing our capacities for designing, manufacturing and marketing new solutions; improving productivity; and replacements of fixed assets. These investments amounted to \u20ac1.5 billion in fiscal 2022. The remaining portion related mainly to Siemens Real Estate, including significant amounts  for  projects  such  as  new  office  buildings  in  Germany.  Siemens  Real  Estate  is  responsible  for  uniform  and  comprehensive management of Company real estate worldwide (except for Siemens Healthineers) and supports the industrial businesses and corporate activities with customer-specific real estate solutions.\n\nWith regard to capital expenditures for continuing operations, we expect a significant increase in fiscal 2023. In the coming years, up to \u20ac0.6 billion are to be invested in Siemensstadt Square. This project initiated in fiscal 2019 aims to transform Siemens' existing industrial area in Berlin into a modern urban district supporting a diverse range of purposes, including strengthening key technologies. Further investments are planned in relation to Siemens Campus Erlangen. In addition, we continue to invest in attractive innovation fields through Next47, our global venture capital unit.",

        "page_content": "## 7. Overall assessment of the economic position\n\nFiscal 2022 was marked by geopolitical and economic turmoil, in particular by the war in Ukraine and its global repercussions, which further exacerbated already existing economic problems in many countries and which also affected Siemens. As a consequence of the war, Siemens decided to exit business activities in Russia. Despite strong global efforts in combating COVID-19, the pandemic continued to impact economic development worldwide, resulting in lockdowns particularly in China and affecting global supply and logistics chains. Our focus has been on successfully managing in this complex environment. In fiscal 2022, we saw accelerated demand in particular for our offerings in the areas of automation, digitalization, resource efficiency and decarbonization. We expect them to continue to be growth drivers in the coming years.\n\nDuring the fiscal year, we made further progress in sharpening our business portfolio. On the divestment side, we sold the road-traffic business Yunex Traffic, our share in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive and the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics. On the acquisition  side,  we  strengthened  our  industrial  businesses  through  the  acquisition  of  Sqills,  a  provider  of  cloud-based  inventory management, reservation, and ticketing software for public transport operators. This acquisition enhances Mobility's existing offerings for increasing the availability, capacity and utilization of public transportation. We also strengthened Smart Infrastructure's presence in the market for the software used to manage built infrastructure through the acquisition of Brightly, a U.S.-based provider of cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) for asset and maintenance management and for energy and sustainability management. As a significant further step in implementing our digitalization strategy, in June 2022 we launched Siemens Xcelerator, a digital business platform that includes a curated portfolio of IoT-enabled hardware, software and digital services from across Siemens and from certified third parties. Siemens Xcelerator facilitates interactions and transactions between customers, partners and developers and thus enables acceleration of the digital transformation of our customers of all sizes in industry, buildings, power transmission grids and mobility.\n\nSiemens was very successful in fiscal 2022 despite the complex geopolitical and economic environment mentioned above. Many of our key  customer  industries  including  automotive,  machine  building,  pharmaceuticals,  chemicals,  electronics,  cloud  services  and  public transport kept growing and we continued to successfully avoid major supply chain disruptions. However, tight supply and logistics chains led  to  extended  delivery  times  for  some  automation  products,  while  effects  related  to  COVID-19,  mainly  including  medical  leave  for employees, impacted some of our own production capacity. Our Industrial Business again achieved excellent results, particularly in Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and Siemens Healthineers. Results at Mobility were strongly burdened by negative effects for winding down business activities in Russia. Outside Industrial Business, exiting financing and leasing activities in Russia resulted in further charges, burdening results in Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements and SFS. Also outside Industrial Business, a significant decline in the market value of Siemens Energy AG led to an impairment of our stake in the company; as a consequence, after the third quarter of fiscal 2022 we had to revise the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report for fiscal 2021 for EPS pre PPA to include the earnings effect of the impairment.\n\nOrders rose 25% year-over-year to \u20ac89.0 billion, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.24, thus fulfilling our expectation of a ratio above 1. All our four industrial businesses increased orders year-over-year. Order growth was led by substantial increases at Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure. Orders at Siemens Healthineers also rose substantially and included new orders from the acquisition of Varian. Mobility, which won large contracts in both periods under review, among them an order worth \u20ac1.5 billion for high-speed trains in Germany in fiscal 2022, increased order intake moderately year-over-year. Overall, order growth benefited from positive currency translation effects.\n\nRevenue was also higher in all our industrial businesses, rising to \u20ac72.0 billion, a 16% increase year-over-year, which included positive currency translation effects. Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and Siemens Healthineers contributed double-digit growth. Revenue growth at Digital Industries was driven mainly by the automation businesses, while in its software business a high rate of customer acceptance of the PLM SaaS transition reduced current license revenue in favor of recurring future subscription revenue. Revenue at Smart Infrastructure rose on contributions from all businesses, led by the electrical products business. At Siemens Healthineers, revenue also grew in all businesses and included positive portfolio effects. Revenue at Mobility rose moderately, as revenue development was held back by supplier delays in delivering materials and components and by effects related to COVID-19. Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects, revenue for Siemens grew 8.2%. We thus exceeded the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report for fiscal 2021, which was to achieve mid-single-digit comparable revenue growth, and also exceeded our subsequent guidance provided in the Half-year Financial Report 2022, which was to achieve 6% to 8% in comparable revenue growth.\n\nProfit Industrial Business rose 17% to a record-high \u20ac10.3 billion. All industrial businesses except Mobility increased their profit year-overyear. The strongest increase came from Smart Infrastructure on improvements in all its businesses. Higher profit at Siemens Healthineers included another strong contribution from the rapid coronavirus antigen testing business in the diagnostics business. Profit growth at Digital Industries was driven by the automation businesses, only partly offset by a decline in profit in the software business due mainly to higher expenses related to cloud-based activities. Profit at Mobility came in lower due mainly to negative effects for winding down business activities in Russia totaling \u20ac0.6 billion and also to burdens from supplier delays and COVID-19 effects, only partly offset by a \u20ac0.7 billion gain from the sale of Yunex Traffic.\n\nOur Industrial Business generated a strong profit margin of 15.1%, up slightly from 15.0% a year earlier. This increase was due to Smart Infrastructure which improved its profit margin to 12.8%. Digital Industries and Siemens Healthineers contributed the highest margins with 19.9% and 15.5%, respectively, while the profit margin for Mobility came in at 8.2%.\n\nEarnings before taxes at SFS declined moderately as higher earnings from the equity business were more than offset by decreased results in the debt business, including a \u20ac0.2 billion impact in connection with the sale of the financing and leasing business in Russia. Return on equity after tax for SFS was 15.6%. Profit for Portfolio Companies included a \u20ac1.1 billion gain from the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics and a \u20ac0.3 billion revaluation gain in connection with the sale of our stake in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH. Results within Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements were burdened by a \u20ac2.7 billion impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG and a \u20ac0.5 billion impact resulting from the sale of Siemens' financing and leasing business in Russia.\n\nDespite the excellent performance of our Industrial Business, net income in fiscal 2022 declined to \u20ac4.4 billion, down from \u20ac6.7 billion a year earlier in which discontinued operations contributed income of \u20ac1.1 billion largely related to the sale of Flender. The successful further focusing of our portfolio in fiscal 2022 resulted in income of \u20ac2.2 billion, including the above-mentioned gains related to the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics and Yunex Traffic; this figure exceeded the \u20ac1.5 billion in such income a year earlier, including the gain from the sale of Flender. Nevertheless, positive results from divestments were more than offset by the \u20ac2.7 billion",

Basic EPS from net income came in at \u20ac4.65 and EPS pre PPA was \u20ac5.47. Due particularly to the impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG, which burdened basic EPS from net income and EPS pre PPA each by \u20ac3.37 per share, we did not reach the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report for fiscal 2021, which was to achieve EPS pre PPA in a range of \u20ac8.70 to \u20ac9.10; we did achieve our forecast revised after the third quarter of fiscal 2022, which was for EPS pre PPA in a range of \u20ac5.33 to \u20ac5.73.\n\nThe impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG burdened ROCE by 5.3 percentage points, resulting in ROCE of 10.0% for fiscal 2022, below our forecast given in the Combined Management Report 2021, which was for ROCE to improve in our target range of 15% to 20%.\n\nWe evaluate our capital structure using the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA. Due to a combination of a decrease in Industrial net debt and higher EBITDA year-over-year, this ratio declined to 1.0. We thus achieved the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report 2021, which was to achieve a ratio below the prior-year figure of 1.5.\n\nFree cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal 2022 was \u20ac8.2 billion, on the high level of a year earlier. The cash conversion rate for Siemens, defined as the ratio of Free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations to Net income, was 1.86, exceeding our targeted cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate for Siemens.\n\nWe intend to continue providing an attractive shareholder return. The Siemens Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, proposes a dividend of \u20ac4.25 per share, up from \u20ac4.00 per share a year earlier.",

        "page_content": "## 8. Report on expected developments and associated material opportunities and risks\n\n## 8.1 Report on expected developments\n\n## 8.1.1 Worldwide economy\n\nAfter a dynamic start in calendar 2022, the global economy experienced a substantial slowdown in the course the year, mainly due to the war in Ukraine, spiraling energy prices and very high inflation rates. Several regions were expected to be already in or on the verge of a recession at the end of calendar 2022. Calendar 2023 is likely to be a year of economic headwinds, with GDP in Europe and the U.S. contracting slightly and global GDP expanding by only 1.5%. The outlook is subject to an extraordinarily high level of uncertainty.\n\nThe EU's economic output is expected to decline by 0.5% in calendar 2023. This assumes that the war in Ukraine does not escalate further. Energy prices, which increased dramatically in calendar 2022, should remain at a high level but ease further compared with the highs of summer 2022. Germany is likely to see a somewhat more significant decline in GDP (-1.0%) due to its high dependence on Russian energy supplies.\n\nIn the USA, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise the key policy interest rate to almost 5% in calendar 2023 in order to bring inflation back down to the target level of 2%. The ECB is expected to raise its main refinancing rate to almost 3% in calendar 2023. Rising financing costs will likely cause residential and commercial construction to decline. Investment in property, plant and equipment and software is expected  to  weaken.  Consumer  spending  is  expected  to  increase  slightly,  while  spending  on  services  is  expected  to  increase  more significantly than spending on goods -thus the shift from services to products triggered by COVID-19 should continue to reverse and spending patterns normalize. Economic output is expected to contract slightly by 0.2% in calendar 2023.\n\nEconomic growth in China is expected to accelerate only slightly in calendar 2023, after the COVID-19 lockdowns and the housing sector crisis already weighed on GDP growth in calendar 2022 (+3%). The impact of the necessary adjustments in China's real estate sector, the limited benefit of stimulus packages due to concerns about high debt levels, and weakening export demand are together expected to limit China's GDP growth to 4.4% in calendar 2023.\n\nHaving probably peaked in calendar 2022, inflation is expected to weaken slightly in calendar 2023. In the USA, consumer price inflation is estimated at 4.3% in calendar 2023, down from 8.1% in calendar 2022. In the EU, inflation is still expected to be 6.5% (down from 9% in calendar 2022). Producer prices, which are more volatile than consumer prices and run ahead of them, are expected to fall by 5.4% in the USA in calendar 2023 (after an increase of 16.8% in calendar 2022), while they are still expected to rise by 5.4% in the EU (after 30.4% in calendar 2022).\n\nOverall,  the  macroeconomic  environment  is  likely  to  be  challenging  for  Siemens  in  fiscal  2023  given  the  economic  headwinds.  For example, global fixed capital formation is expected to grow by only 1.7% in calendar 2023, down from 2.7% in calendar 2022. However, two effects are expected to provide significant support to our customer markets in fiscal 2023: Firstly, key customer sectors should be supported by the still very high order backlogs and work them off as supply and logistics chains ease. In this context, the infrastructure sector should continue to benefit from various (green) stimulus programs. On the other hand, producer prices are rising, which means that higher costs are being passed on to customers, at least in part. These higher prices also contribute to nominal (not price-adjusted) growth in customer markets in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe forecasts presented here for GDP and fixed investments are based on a report from S&P Global dated November 15, 2022.\n\n## 8.1.2 Siemens Group\n\nWe are basing our outlook for fiscal 2023 on the above-mentioned expectations and assumptions regarding the overall economic situation and  also  on  the  specific  market  conditions  we  expect  for  our  respective  industrial  businesses,  as  described  in  chapter  3  Segment information. Furthermore, we assume that geopolitical tensions do not further escalate and challenges from COVID-19 and supply chain constraints continue to ease. We expect continued impacts from higher prices for raw materials and components and from wage increases, which we intend to cover with improved productivity and by adjusting prices for our own products, solutions and services, particularly at Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure.\n\nWe are exposed to currency translation effects, mainly involving the U.S. dollar, the British pound and currencies of emerging markets, particularly the Chinese yuan. While we expect volatility in global currency markets to continue in fiscal 2023, we have improved our natural hedge on a global basis through geographic distribution of our production facilities in the past. Additionally, Siemens is still a net exporter from the Eurozone to the rest of the world, so a weak euro is principally favorable for our business and a strong euro is principally unfavorable. In addition to the natural hedging strategy just mentioned, we also hedge currency risk in our export business using derivative financial instruments. We expect these steps to help us limit effects on income related to currency in fiscal 2023. In this outlook, we assume that currency translation effects in fiscal 2023 do not significantly influence nominal volume growth rates for our businesses.\n\nThis outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters and material impairments.\n\n## Segments\n\nWith our high order backlog, particularly in short-cycle businesses, we expect our industrial businesses to continue their profitable growth.\n\nDigital Industries expects for fiscal 2023 to achieve comparable revenue growth of 10% to 13%. The profit margin is expected to be 19% to 22%.\n\nSmart Infrastructure expects for fiscal 2023 comparable revenue growth of 8% to 11%. The profit margin is expected to be 13% to 14%.\n\nMobility expects for fiscal 2023 comparable revenue growth of 6% to 9%. The profit margin is expected to be 8% to 10%.",

        "page_content": "Siemens Healthineers expects to achieve comparable revenue development between (1)% and 1% in fiscal 2023. Siemens Healthineers is expected to contribute solidly to the profit and profit margin of our Industrial Business.\n\nSiemens Financial Services expects Earnings before taxes in fiscal 2023 close to the prior-year level. Return on equity (ROE) (after tax) is expected to be at the lower end of the target range of 15% to 20%.\n\n## Revenue growth\n\nFor comparable revenue, we expect the Siemens Group to achieve comparable revenue growth in the range of 6% to 9%. Furthermore, we anticipate that orders in fiscal 2023 will exceed revenue for a book-to-bill ratio above 1.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, our order backlog totaled \u20ac102 billion, and we expect conversion from the backlog to strongly support revenue growth in fiscal 2023 with approximately \u20ac45 billion of past orders converted to current revenue. For expected conversion of order backlog to revenue for our respective segments, see chapter 3 Segment information.\n\n## Profitability\n\nOutside our reportable segments, we expect profit at Portfolio Companies of \u20ac0.3 billion in fiscal 2023, including a substantial contribution from the sale of the Commercial Vehicles business, which closed at the beginning of fiscal 2023.\n\nFurthermore, within Siemens Energy Investment, we expect amortization of assets resulting from purchase price allocation due to the initial  recognition  of  the  investment  at  fair  value  in  September  2020,  to  be  \u20ac0.1  billion  in  fiscal  2023.  In  addition,  Siemens  Energy Investment includes further effects from at-equity accounting, such as our share in Siemens Energy's profit (loss) after tax. We anticipate that Siemens Real Estate will continue with real estate disposals depending on market conditions, at a similar level as in fiscal 2022. Results for Innovation also are expected on the prior-year level, which was a negative \u20ac0.2 billion. Results related to Governance were a negative \u20ac0.6 billion in fiscal 2022; we expect an improvement in fiscal 2023, to a negative \u20ac0.5 billion. Centrally carried pension expense are expected  to  be  on  the  prior-year  level,  which  was  a  negative  \u20ac0.1  billion.  Amortization  of  intangible  assets  acquired  in  business combinations, which was \u20ac1.0 billion in fiscal 2022, is expected at \u20ac0.9 billion in fiscal 2023. Financing, eliminations and other items, which were a negative \u20ac0.5 billion in fiscal 2022, are expected in a range between a negative \u20ac0.5 billion and a negative \u20ac0.6 billion.\n\nWe anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of 26% to 31%, compared to 38% in fiscal 2022. This assumption does not take into  consideration  possible  impacts  from  potential  major  tax  reforms.  We  do  not  expect  material  influence  on  financial  results  from discontinued operations in fiscal 2023.\n\nOur forecast for net income takes into account a number of additional factors. We assume solid project execution to continue in fiscal 2023. We plan to increase the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, which was 7.8% in fiscal 2022, to approximately 8% with a strong focus on software and digital technologies. Severance charges, which were \u20ac0.3 billion in fiscal 2022, are expected at a similar level in fiscal 2023. While gains from executing our portfolio improvement program contributed \u20ac2.2 billion to net income in fiscal 2022, we expect a sharply lower contribution from such gains in fiscal 2023.\n\nGiven the above-mentioned assumptions, we expect profitable growth of our industrial businesses to drive an increase in EPS pre PPA to a range of \u20ac8.70 to \u20ac9.20 in fiscal 2023, along with a corresponding increase in net income.\n\n## Capital efficiency\n\nFor fiscal 2023, we expect ROCE, to come close to or reach the lower end of our target range of 15% to 20%.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nWe aim in general for a capital structure, defined as the ratio of industrial net debt to EBITDA (continuing operations), of up to 1.5 and expect to achieve this in fiscal 2023.\n\n## Cash conversion rate\n\nFor fiscal 2023, we expect a cash conversion rate that contributes to reaching our target of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate of Siemens over a cycle of three to five years.\n\n## 8.1.3 Overall assessment\n\nOur outlook for fiscal 2023 is based on the assumptions that geopolitical tensions do not further escalate and challenges from COVID-19 and supply chain constraints continue to ease. Under these conditions, with our high order backlog, particularly in short-cycle businesses, we expect our industrial businesses to continue their profitable growth.\n\nFor the Siemens Group we expect comparable revenue growth in the range of 6% to 9% and a book-to-bill ratio above 1.\n\nWe expect this profitable growth of our industrial businesses to drive an increase in EPS pre PPA to a range of \u20ac8.70 to \u20ac9.20 in fiscal 2023.\n\nThis outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters and material impairments.\n\nOverall, the actual development for Siemens and its segments may vary, positively or negatively, from our outlook due to the risks and opportunities described below or if our expectations and assumptions do not materialize.\n\n## 8.2 Risk management\n\n## 8.2.1 Basic principles of risk management\n\nOur risk  management policy stems from a philosophy of pursuing sustainable growth and creating economic value while managing appropriate risks and opportunities and avoiding inappropriate risks. As risk management is an integral part of how we plan and execute our business strategies, our risk management policy is set by the Managing Board. Our organizational and accountability structure requires",

        "page_content": "each of the respective managements of our organizational units to implement risk management programs that are tailored to their specific industries and responsibilities, while being consistent with the overall policy.\n\n## 8.2.2 Enterprise risk management process\n\nWe have implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems which support us in the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business. The most important of these systems include our enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning is intended to support us in considering potential risks and opportunities well in advance of major business decisions, while management reporting is intended to enable us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our risk management and its contributing elements are regularly subject of audit activities by our internal  audit  function.  Accordingly,  if  deficits  are  detected,  it  is  possible  to  adopt  appropriate  measures  for  their  elimination.  This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nRisk  management  at  Siemens  builds  on  a  comprehensive,  interactive  and  management-oriented  Enterprise  Risk  Management  (ERM) approach that is integrated into the organization and that addresses both risks and opportunities. Our ERM approach is based on the globally accepted COSO Standard (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) Enterprise Risk Management Integrating with Strategy and Performance (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process, our internal control  and  compliance  management  system.  They  consider  a  company's  strategy,  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  its  business operations, the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of, and response regarding, risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing and effective measures and controls. If  risks  have  already  been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the consolidated financial statements (e.g. as a provision or risk contingency), they are supposed to be incorporated with their financial impact in the entity's business objectives. As a consequence, only additional  risks  arising  from  the  same  subject  (e.g.  deviations  from  business  objectives,  different  impact  perspectives)  should  be considered. In order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle; we complement this periodic reporting with an ad-hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risks and opportunities are evaluated in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation and regulatory  requirements.  The  bottom-up  identification  and  prioritization  process  is  supplemented  by  workshops  with  the  respective managements of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different  management  levels  and  are  included  in  the  subsequent  reporting  process,  if  found  to  be  relevant.  Reported  risks  and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above.\n\nResponsibilities  are  assigned  for  all  relevant  risks  and  opportunities,  with  the  hierarchical  level  of  responsibility  depending  on  the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one  of  our  general  response  strategies.  Our  general  response  strategies  with  respect  to  risks  are  avoidance,  transfer,  reduction  or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to 'seize' the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management. Accordingly, we have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the  risk  of  fluctuations  in  currency  and  interest  rates  by  engaging  in  hedging  activities.  Regarding  our  projects,  systematic  and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks in order to  reduce  our  exposure  to  such  risks  and  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  losses.  Among  others,  we  address  the  risk  of  fluctuation  in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries, and by adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary. Due to regular screening of climate risks and environmental, social and governance (ESG) developments we can initiate related mitigation actions in a timely manner as part of our DEGREE implementation. Worldwide there are risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic or other infectious developments such as bioterrorism to cause high disease rates in countries, regions or continents. We constantly check information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. and Europe, the Robert Koch Institute in Germany and other institutions in order to be able to identify early epidemic or pandemic risks and determine and initiate related mitigation actions as early as possible.\n\n## 8.2.3 Risk management organization and responsibilities\n\nTo oversee the ERM process and to further drive the integration and harmonization of existing control activities to align with legal and operational requirements, the Managing Board established a Risk Management and Internal Control Organization, led by the Head of Assurance. In order to allow for a meaningful discussion of risk at the Siemens Group level, this organization aggregates individual risks and opportunities of similar cause-and-effect nature into broader risk and opportunity themes. This aggregation naturally results in a mixture  of  risks,  including  those  with  a  primarily  qualitative  assessment  and  those  with  a  primarily  quantitative  risk  assessment. Accordingly, we do not adopt a purely quantitative assessment of risk and opportunity themes. Thematic risk and opportunity assessments as well as our risk-bearing capacity then form the basis for the evaluation of the company-wide risk and opportunity situation during the quarterly Managing Board meetings. The Head of Assurance assists the Managing Board with the operation and oversight of the risk and internal control system and reporting to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.",

        "page_content": "## 8.3 Risks\n\nBelow we describe the risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition (including effects on assets, liabilities and cash flows), results of operations and reputation. The order in which the risks are presented in each of the four categories reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these risks and thus provides an indication of the risks' current importance to us. Additional risks not known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business objectives and operations. Unless otherwise stated, the risks described below relate to all our organizational units.\n\n## 8.3.1 Strategic risks\n\nEconomic, political and geopolitical conditions: We see high uncertainties regarding the global economic and geopolitical outlook, which deteriorated significantly in the past year due to multiple headwinds, all of which may continue to intensify. First and foremost, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its political and economic consequences, such as sanctions and countermeasures, result in far-reaching risks. War in Ukraine may have a negative impact on sales development, production processes as well as purchasing and logistics processes, for  example  through  interruptions  in  supply  chains  and  energy  supplies  or  bottlenecks  affecting  components,  raw  materials  and intermediate products. The conflict could also intensify further to the point of expanding to include other warring parties, including NATO countries, and the use of unconventional weapons. An expansion of the war would have a significant impact on the Siemens market environment. But even the current state of war could have a further negative impact on economic development if potential energy supply shortfalls make rationing necessary in industry and households or even result in blackouts during the next months. This would fuel already high inflation, with further risk of a sustained wage-price-spiral. In any case one of the core risks for the Siemens outlook is that central banks may fail to get inflation under control and have then to react even more restrictively. Alternatively, central banks may overreact, which could lead to rapid monetary tightening. More restrictive financial conditions would likely push advanced economies into recession and pose a significant risk to vulnerable emerging economies. Highly indebted (emerging and industrialized) countries could suffer from increasing financing costs, further U.S. dollar appreciation, and loss of investor confidence. Other risks could arise for the stability of public finances and the banking sector. Further risks are coming from other geopolitical tensions (particularly associated with Ukraine, the Baltics, Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans, China, Taiwan, and Iran). Recent, electoral results within the European Union may make cooperation and  implementation  of  reforms  more  difficult.  Obstruction  and  redefinitions  of  international  cooperation  could  severely  impact  our business. First and foremost a aggravating U.S.-China decoupling would have adverse effects on confidence and investment activity and would severely hit Siemens' business. Increasing trade barriers, protectionism, sanctions and in particular technical regulations would negatively impact production costs and productivity along our global value chains, as well as significantly impede or even hinder access to sales markets. Even though the latest virus variants have seemed less dangerous, the COVID-19 pandemic is still taking a toll on global economic activity, in particular due to the strict 'zero-COVID' policy in China with potential spillovers to the global economy (e.g., further tightening supply chain bottlenecks). But also, the evolution of more aggressive and lethal variants remains a key risk for the global economy. We have additional business risk from further weakening of Chinese economic growth. The ongoing crisis in China's real estate sector poses a threat to China's economic outlook, with potential spillovers to the global economy. A significant risk to our sales potential and cost structure is coming from potential supply chain bottlenecks, due to growing lack of availability of intermediate goods, in particular electronic components. We are dependent on the economic development of certain industries; a continuation or even an intensification of the cyclical and structural headwinds in core customer industries, e.g., automotive or construction, would have adverse impact on our business prospects. A terrorist attack, an escalation of conflicts like in the Ukraine or elsewhere or a significant cybercrime incident, or a series of such attacks or incidents in major economies, could depress economic activity globally and undermine consumer and business confidence. Additionally, the highly interconnected global economy remains vulnerable to natural disasters, further pandemics or hybrid warfare.\n\nIn general, due to long-cycle businesses in our organizational units and the importance of long-term contracts for Siemens, there is usually a  time lag between changes in macroeconomic conditions and their impact on our financial results. In contrast, short-cycle business activities react quickly to volatility in market demand. If the moderate growth of certain markets stalls again and if we are not successful in adapting our production and cost structure to subsequent changes in conditions in the markets in which we operate, there can be no assurance that we will not experience adverse effects. For example, our customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products, solutions and services, or fail to follow through on purchases or contracts already executed. Furthermore, the prices for our products, solutions and services may decline to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. In addition, it may become more difficult for our customers to obtain financing. Contracted payment terms, especially regarding the level of advance payments by our customers relating to long-term projects, may become less favorable, which could negatively impact our financial condition. Siemens' global setup with operations in almost all relevant economies, our wide range of offerings with varied exposures to business cycles, and our balanced mix of business models (e.g., equipment, components, systems, software, services and solutions) help us to absorb impacts from adverse developments in any single market.\n\nDisruptive technologies: The markets in which our businesses operate experience rapid and significant changes due to the introduction of  innovative  and  disruptive  technologies.  In  the  fields  of  digitalization  (e.g.  IoT,  artificial  intelligence,  cloud  computing,  industrial metaverse), there are risks associated with new competitors, substitutions for existing products/solutions/services, new business models (e.g. in terms of pricing, financing, extended scopes for project business or subscription models in the software business) and finally the risk that our competitors may have more advanced time-to-market strategies and introduce their disruptive products and solutions faster than Siemens. Our operating results depend to a significant extent on our technological leadership, our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in our markets and to optimize our cost base accordingly. Introducing new products and technologies requires a significant commitment to research and development, which in return requires expenditure of considerable financial resources that may not always result in success. Our results of operations may suffer if we invest in technologies that do not operate or may not be integrated as expected, or that are not accepted in the marketplace as anticipated, or if our products, solutions or systems are not introduced to the market in a timely manner, particularly compared to our competitors, or even become obsolete. We constantly apply for new patents and actively manage our intellectual property portfolio to secure our technological position. However, our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services that are similar to ours.\n\nIncreasing  sustainability  focus :  The  increasing  ESG-requirements  from  governments,  investors  and  customers  as  well  as  financing restrictions  for  greenhouse  gas  emitting  technologies  could  result  in  additional  costs.  The  growing  requirements  in  the  regulatory",

        "page_content": "environment, but also the self-commitment to own sustainability and climate protection targets, bear further liability risks. Additionally, business involvement in areas of public debate regarding sustainability might be negatively perceived and trigger adverse media attention. This could lead to reputational damage and have an impact on achievement of our business goals. We address these risks, among other things,  in  the  context  of  our  sustainability  framework  DEGREE,  in  which  we  have  also  set  ourselves  ambitious  sustainability  targets. Measures to reduce climate-related risks include, for example, our decarbonization strategy (including Science Based Target), as well as our engagement in the supply chain. In fiscal 2021, we introduced an ESG risk framework along with an optimized ESG due diligence process. This supports Siemens businesses with due diligence in the customer-oriented environment with a view to possible environmental and social risks as well as related human rights and reputational risks.\n\nCOVID-19: Compared to the first years of the pandemic, we are seeing a recovery in many business sectors, and travel has also normalized in  many areas. The availability of vaccines has improved, although their effectiveness against emerging virus variants cannot yet be conclusively assessed. Nevertheless, regional lockdowns may continue to be the result. The extent and duration of individual impacts on our business are difficult to predict. For example, if measures to the virus are initiated at short notice or last an unpredictably long time, our business may be significantly impacted in ways that exceed current expectations and go beyond mitigation measures already in place. We could face unexpected closures of sites, factories or office buildings of our suppliers, customers or our own operations, which would affect our ability to produce or deliver our products, solutions and services. The longer such restrictive measures (e.g. curfews) last, the deeper the resulting consequences will be. Possible consequences include an unchecked increase of public and private debt which hampers the post-crisis recovery, serious disruptions in the financial system, and insolvencies among Siemens customers and suppliers. In the long term, a reversal of globalization could reduce the potential for future growth. Various task forces and crisis teams in all functional areas of Siemens continue to closely monitor COVID-19 events and engage in active mitigation activities if required.\n\nCompetitive environment : The worldwide markets for our products, solutions and services are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms and shifts in market demands. We face strong, established competitors as well as rising competitors from emerging markets and new industries, which may have a better cost structure. Some industries in which we operate are undergoing consolidation, which may result in stronger competition, a change in our relative market position, an increase in inventory of finished or work-in-progress goods, or unexpected price erosion. Furthermore, there is a risk that critical suppliers could be taken over by competitors and a risk that competitors are increasingly offering services to our installed  base.  We  address  these  risks  with  various  measures,  for  example  benchmarking,  strategic  initiatives,  sales  push  initiatives, executing  productivity  measures  and  target  cost  projects,  rightsizing  of  our  footprint,  outsourcings,  mergers  and  joint  ventures  and optimizing our product and service portfolio. We continuously monitor and analyze competitive, market and industry information in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely reacting to such changes.\n\nPortfolio measures, at-equity investments, other investments and strategic alliances : Our strategy includes divesting our activities in some  business  areas  and  strengthening  others  through  portfolio  measures,  including  mergers  and  acquisitions.  With  respect  to divestments, we may not be able to divest some of our activities as planned, and the divestitures we do carry out could have a negative impact on our business situation, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky because of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products. There can be no assurance that any of the businesses we acquire can be integrated successfully and in a timely manner as originally planned, or that they will perform as anticipated once integrated. In addition, we may incur significant acquisition, administrative, tax and other expenditures in connection with these transactions, including costs related to integration of acquired businesses. Furthermore, portfolio measures may result in additional financing needs and adversely affect our capital structure. Acquisitions can lead to substantial additions to intangible assets, including goodwill, in our statements of financial position. If we were to encounter continuing adverse business developments or if we were otherwise to perform worse than expected at acquisition activities, then these intangible assets, including goodwill, might have to be impaired, which could adversely affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. Our investment portfolio includes  investments  held  for  purposes  other  than  trading  and  other  investments.  Any  factors  negatively  influencing  the  financial condition and results of operations of our at-equity investments and other investments could have an adverse effect on our equity pickup related to these investments or may result in a related write-off. In addition, our business situation, financial condition and results of operations could also be adversely affected in connection with loans, guarantees or non-compliance with financial covenants related to these  investments.  Furthermore,  such  investments  are  inherently  risky  as  we  may  not  be  able  to  sufficiently  influence  corporate governance processes or business decisions taken by our at-equity investments, other investments and strategic alliances, which may have a negative effect on our business and especially on our reputation. In addition, joint ventures bear the risk of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products. Strategic alliances may also pose risks for us because we compete in some  business  areas  with  companies  with  which  we  have  strategic  alliances.  Besides  other  measures,  we  handle  these  risks  with standardized processes as well as dedicated roles and responsibilities in the areas of mergers, acquisitions, divestments and carve-outs. This includes the systematic treatment of all contractual obligations and post-closing claims.\n\n## 8.3.2 Operational risks\n\nCyber/Information security :  Digital technologies are deeply integrated into our business portfolio. Further integration of information technology  into  products  and  services  in  conjunction  with  changing  business  strategies  (such  as  outsourcing,  globally  distributed development, a lesser degree of sole production) are leading to an increasingly distributed supply chain, making efficient controls difficult. The fact of a large number of suppliers requires a significant effort for the initial and regular verification of the effective implementation of cybersecurity requirements by suppliers. Siemens business entities might lose market access if their products, solutions and services do not comply with increased regulations and legal requirements for cybersecurity in their respective countries. We observe a global increase of cybersecurity threats and higher levels of professionalism in computer crime, which pose a risk to the security of products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data. According to external sources of relevant data this trend has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Especially the numbers of phishing attacks and malicious websites have  increased  significantly.  Moreover,  the  information  technology  market  is  concentrated  among  a  small  number  of  information technology and software vendors, which could lead to dependence on a single provider. There can be no assurance that the measures aimed  at  protecting  our  intellectual  property  and  portfolio  will  address  these  threats  under  all  circumstances.  There  is  a  risk  that confidential information or data privacy-relevant information may be stolen or that the integrity of our portfolio may be compromised,",

Cybersecurity covers the IT of our entire enterprise including office IT, systems and applications, special-purpose networks, and our operating environments such as manufacturing and research and development (R&D). Like other large multinational companies, we face active cyber threats from sophisticated adversaries that are supported by organized crime and nation-states engaged in economic espionage or even sabotage. We strive to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, considering new models of flexible working environments, and comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems through cyber defense with an artificial intelligence solution to identify attacks faster and prevent damage to society and to critical infrastructures, our customers, our partners and Siemens overall. We initiated the industrial 'Charter of Trust,' signed by a growing group of global companies, which sets out principles for building trust in digital technologies and creating a more secure digital world. Nonetheless, our systems, products, solutions and services, as well as those of our service providers, remain potentially vulnerable to  attacks.  Such  attacks  could  potentially  lead  to  the  publication,  manipulation  or  leakage  of  information  such  as  through  industrial espionage. They could also result in deliberate improper use of our systems, vulnerable products, production downtimes and supply shortages, with potential adverse effects on our reputation, our competitiveness and results of operations. We might lose market access if our products, solutions and services do not comply with local regulations and requirements for cybersecurity. For increased protection of Siemens and reduction of a potential financial impact caused by cyber incidents, the risk transfer possibilities have been evaluated. As a result of an international insurance tender, the currently insurable cybersecurity risks have been to a partial extent transferred to a consortium of insurance companies.\n\nSupply chain management : The financial performance of our operating units depends on reliable and effective supply chain management for components, sub-assemblies, energy, critical parts (e.g. semiconductors) and materials. Capacity constraints and supply shortages resulting from ineffective supply chain management may lead to production bottlenecks, delivery delays, quality issues and additional costs. We also rely on third parties to supply us with parts, components and services. Using third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products may reduce our control over manufacturing yields, quality assurance, product delivery schedules and costs. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid supply-related problems, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter supply problems in  the  future,  especially  if  we  use  single-source  suppliers  for  critical  components.  Shortages  and  delays  could  materially  harm  our businesses. Unanticipated increases in the price of components or raw materials due to market shortages or other reasons could also adversely affect performance. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the risk of delays and interruptions in the supply chain as a consequence of catastrophic events (including pandemics), geopolitical uncertainties, energy shortages, sabotage, cyber incidents or suppliers' financial difficulties, particularly if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply or means of transportation in a timely manner or at all. Besides other measures, we mitigate price fluctuation in global raw material markets with various hedging instruments.\n\nInternal programs and initiatives : We are in a continuous process of operational optimization and constantly engage in cost-reduction initiatives,  including  ongoing  capacity  adjustment  measures  and  structural  initiatives.  Consolidation  of  business  activities  and manufacturing facilities, outsourcings, joint ventures and the streamlining of product portfolios are all part of these cost-reduction efforts. These measures may not be implemented as planned, may turn out to be less effective than anticipated, may become effective later than estimated or may not become effective at all. Any future contribution of these measures to our profitability will be influenced by the actual savings achieved and by our ability to sustain them. In case of restructuring and outsourcing activities, there could be delays in product deliveries or we might even experience delivery failures. Furthermore, delays in critical R&D projects could lead to negative impacts in running projects. We constantly control and monitor the progress of these projects and initiatives using standardized controlling and milestone tracking approaches.\n\nProject-related risks : A number of our segments conduct activities under long-term contracts that are awarded on a competitive bidding basis. Such contracts typically arise at Mobility and in various activities of Smart Infrastructure or Portfolio Companies. Some of these contracts are inherently risky because we may assume substantially all of the risks associated with completing a project and meeting postcompletion warranty obligations. For example, we may face the risk that we must satisfy technical requirements of a project even though we have not gained experience with those requirements before winning the project. The profit margins realized on fixed-priced contracts may vary from original estimates as a result of changes in costs and productivity over a contract's term. We sometimes bear the risk of unanticipated project modifications, shortage of key personnel, quality problems, financial difficulties of our customers and/or significant partners, cost overruns or contractual penalties caused by unexpected technological problems, unexpected developments at the project sites,  unforeseen  changes  or  difficulties  in  the  regulatory  or  political  environment,  performance  problems  with  our  suppliers, subcontractors  and  consortium  partners  or  other  logistical  difficulties.  Some  of  our  multi-year  contracts  also  contain  demanding installation and maintenance requirements in addition to other performance criteria relating to timing, unit cost and compliance with government regulations, which, if not satisfied, could subject us to substantial contractual penalties, damages, non-payment and contract termination. There can be no assurance that contracts and projects, in particular those with long-term duration and fixed-price calculation, can be completed profitably. To tackle those risks, we established a global project management organization to systematically improve the technical and commercial capabilities of our project management personnel. For very complex projects we conduct dedicated risk assessments in very early stages of the sales phase before we decide to hand over a binding offer to our customers.\n\nShortage of skilled personnel : Competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel (e.g. specialists, experts, digital talent) remains intense in the industries and regions in which our businesses operate. We have ongoing demand for highly skilled employees and a need to enhance diversity, inclusion and sense of belonging in our workforce. Our future success depends in part on our continued ability to identify, assess and hire engineers, digital talent and other qualified personnel. We must also integrate, develop and retain them after they join us, which appears especially relevant in times of a new, increasingly virtual working environment. We address these topics for example by strengthening the capabilities and skills of our talent acquisition teams and a strategy of proactive search for people with the required capabilities in our respective industries and markets. Starting in fiscal 2023 we will roll out our new Employer Branding activities with focus on hard-to-fill positions in our key markets. Technology and digitalization help us to be more effective in attracting and selecting diverse talent. In addition, we have a focus on diversity and structured succession planning.\n\n## 8.3.3 Financial risks\n\nRisks from pension obligations : The provisions for pensions and similar obligations may be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, as well as by movements in financial markets or a change in the mix of assets in our investment portfolio. Additionally, they are subject to legal risks with regard to plan design, among other factors. A significant increase in underfunding may",

        "page_content": "have a negative effect on our capital structure and rating, and thus may tighten refinancing options and increase costs. In order to comply with local pension regulations in selected foreign countries, we may face an economic risk of increasing cash outflows due to changes in funding level according to local regulations of our pension plans in these countries or to changes in the regulations themselves.\n\nAudits by tax authorities and changes in tax regulations : We operate in nearly all countries of the world and therefore are subject to many different tax regulations. Changes in tax laws in any of these jurisdictions could result in higher tax expenses and increased tax payments. Furthermore, legislative changes could impact our tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the uncertain legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights. As a globally operating organization,  we  conduct  business  in  countries  subject  to  complex  tax  rules,  which  may  be  interpreted  in  different  ways.  Future interpretations or developments of tax regimes may affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. We are regularly audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions and we continuously identify and assess relevant risks.\n\nMarket price risks : We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, especially between the U.S. dollar and the euro, because a high percentage of our business volume is conducted as exports from Europe to regions using the U.S. dollar. In addition, we are exposed to effects involving the currencies of emerging markets, in particular the Chinese yuan. Appreciable changes in euro exchange rates could materially change our competitive position. We are also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. Even hedging activities to mitigate such risks may result in a reverse effect. Fluctuations in exchange or interest rates, negative developments in the financial markets and changes in central bank policies could therefore negatively impact our financial results. Market prices show higher volatility than before due to increased macroeconomic uncertainties (e.g. resulting from inflation, COVID-19, war in Ukraine).\n\nLiquidity and financing risks : Our treasury and financing activities could face adverse deposit and/or financing conditions from negative developments related to financial markets, such as limited availability of funds and hedging instruments, an updated evaluation of our solvency, particularly from rating agencies, negative interest rates, and impacts arising from more restrictive regulation of the financial sector, central bank policy, or the usage of financial instruments. Widening credit spreads due to uncertainty and risk aversion in the financial  markets  might  lead  to  adverse  changes  in  the  market  values  of  our  financial  assets,  in  particular  our  derivative  financial instruments.\n\nCredit risks : We provide our customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing of orders and projects, including guarantees. Siemens Financial Services in particular bears credit risks due to such financing activities if, for example, customers do not meet obligations arising  from  these  financing  arrangements,  meet  them  only  partially,  or  meet  them  late.  The  credit  environment  has  become  more dynamic due to a more uncertain macroeconomic outlook (e.g. inflation) and geopolitical tensions.\n\nFor further information on post-employment benefits, derivative financial instruments, hedging activities, financial risk management and related measures, see Notes 17, 24 and 25 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022.\n\n## 8.3.4 Compliance risks\n\nCurrent  and  future  investigations  regarding  allegations  of  corruption,  of  antitrust  violations  and  of  other  violations  of  law : Proceedings against us or our business partners regarding allegations of corruption, of antitrust violations and of other violations of law may lead to fines as well as penalties, sanctions, injunctions against future conduct, profit disgorgements, disqualifications from directly and indirectly engaging in certain types of business, the loss of business licenses or permits, other restrictions and legal consequences as well as negative public media coverage. Accordingly, we may, among other things, be required to comply with potential obligations and liabilities arising in connection with such investigations and proceedings, including potential tax penalties. Moreover, any findings related to public corruption that are not covered by the 2008 and 2009 corruption charge settlements, which we concluded with U.S. and German authorities, may endanger our business with government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations. Monitors could again be appointed to review future business practices and we may otherwise be required to further modify our business practices and our compliance program.\n\nIn its global business, Siemens does part of its business with state-owned enterprises and governments. We also participate in a number of projects funded by government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations, such as multilateral development banks. Ongoing or potential future investigations into allegations of corruption, antitrust violations or other violations of law could as well impair relationships with such parties or could result in our exclusion from public contracts. Such investigations may also adversely affect existing private business relationships and our ability to pursue potentially important strategic projects and transactions, such as strategic alliances, joint ventures or other business alliances, or could result in the cancellation of certain of our existing contracts. Moreover, third parties, including our competitors, could initiate significant litigation.\n\nIn addition, future developments in ongoing and potential future investigations, such as responding to the requests of governmental authorities  and  cooperating  with  them,  could  divert  management's  attention  and  resources  from  other  issues  facing  our  business. Furthermore, we might be exposed to compliance risks in connection with recently acquired operations that are in the ongoing process of integration.\n\nAlong  with  other  measures,  Siemens  has  established  a  global  compliance  organization  that  conducts  among  others  compliance  risk mitigation  processes  such  as  Compliance  Risk  Assessments  or  initiates  internal  audit  activities  performed  by  the  internal  assurance department.\n\nChanges of regulations, laws and policies :  As a diversified company with global businesses we are exposed to various product- and country-related regulations, laws and policies influencing our business activities and processes. According to observations and analysis, there is an increasing risk that existing technical regulations in target markets will suddenly change, or new ones will be set in force, which result in market access criteria that our products do not meet. The affected products would lose marketability in this market. Reducing the risk of a sales-stop depends on the required correction for the non-conformity. In case the product can technically stay as is, while it has to undergo new and additional conformity assessment and certification, there will be considerable effort and cost to carry out the needed testing and certification procedures. In a worse case, the affected product will need re-engineering or re-design to meet the requirements of the changed or new technical regulation even before it can become re-assessed and certified for market approval. The latter case will cause significant extra effort and cost to make the needed product changes and to maintain the country-specific product variant as an additional derivative item in the portfolio. In the worst case, if the two aforementioned ways of maintaining the product's marketability prove to be not feasible, we must stop selling the affected product in the market. We monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all",

However, any changes in regulations, laws and policies could adversely affect our business activities and processes as well as our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nSanctions and export control : As a globally operating organization, we conduct business with customers in countries which are subject to export control regulations, embargoes, economic sanctions, debarment policies or other forms of trade restrictions (hereafter referred to as 'sanctions') imposed by the U.S., the EU, China or other countries or organizations. New or expanded sanctions in countries in which we do business may result in a curtailment of our existing business in such countries or indirectly in other countries. We are also aware of policies of national authorities and institutional investors, such as pension funds or insurance companies, requiring divestment of interests in and prohibiting investment in and transactions with entities doing business with countries identified by the U.S. Department of State as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, it is possible that such policies may result in our inability to gain or retain certain investors or customers. In addition, the termination of our activities in sanctioned countries may expose us to customer claims and other actions. Our reputation could also suffer due to our activities with counterparties in or affiliated with these countries.\n\nProtectionism  (including  tariffs/trade  war) :  Protectionist  trade  policies,  de-coupling  and  changes  in  the  political  and  regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate, such as import and export controls, tariffs and other trade barriers including debarment from  certain  markets,  and  price  or  exchange  controls,  could  affect  our  business  in  national  markets  and  could  impact  our  business situation, financial position and results of operations; we may also be exposed to penalties, other sanctions and reputational damage. In addition, the uncertainty of the legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights and subject us to increasing costs related to adjusting our compliance programs.\n\nEnvironmental, health & safety and other governmental regulations : Some of the industries in which we operate are highly regulated. Current and future environmental, health and safety and other governmental regulations or changes thereto may require us to change the way we run our operations and could result in significant increases in our operating or production costs. Furthermore, we see the risk of potential environmental and health and safety incidents as well as potential non-compliance with environmental and health and safety regulations  affecting  Siemens  and  our  contractors  or  sub-suppliers,  resulting  for  example  in  serious  injuries,  business  interruptions, penalties, loss of reputation and internal or external investigations.\n\nIn addition, while we have procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable governmental regulations in the conduct of our business operations, it cannot be excluded that violations of applicable governmental regulations may be caused either by us or by third parties  that  we  contract  with,  including  suppliers  or  service  providers  whose  activities  may  be  attributed  to  us.  Any  such  violations particularly expose us to the risk of liability, penalties, fines, reputational damage or loss of licenses or permits that are important to our business operations. In particular, we could also face liability for damage or remediation for environmental contamination at the facilities we design or operate. With regard to certain environmental risks, we maintain liability insurance at levels that our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. We may incur environmental losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance, and such losses may have an adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nCurrent or future litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings : Siemens is and potentially will be involved in numerous legal disputes and proceedings in various jurisdictions. These legal disputes and proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. Asserted claims are generally subject  to  interest  rates.  Some  of  these  legal  disputes  and  proceedings  could  result  in  adverse  decisions  for  Siemens;  or  decisions, assessments or requirements of regulatory authorities could deviate from our expectations, which may have material effects on our business activities as well as our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Siemens maintains liability insurance for certain legal risks at levels our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. However, the insurance policy does not  protect  Siemens  against,  in  particular,  reputational  damage.  Moreover,  Siemens  may  incur  losses  relating  to  legal  disputes  and proceedings beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance or exceeding any provisions made for losses related to legal disputes and proceedings. Finally, there can be no assurance that Siemens will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the future.\n\nFor additional information with respect to specific proceedings, see Note 22 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022.\n\n## 8.3.5 Assessment of the overall risk situation\n\nThe  most  significant  challenges  have  been  mentioned  first  in  each  of  the  four  risk  categories:  strategic,  operational,  financial  and compliance.\n\nWhile our assessments of individual risks have changed during fiscal 2022 due to developments in the external environment, changes in our business portfolio, effects of our own mitigation measures and the revision of our risk assessment, the overall risk situation for Siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year. We currently see the strategic risk economic, political and geopolitical conditions as the most significant challenge for us followed by the operational risk cyber/information security.\n\nAt present, no risks have been identified that either individually or in combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## 8.4 Opportunities\n\nWithin our ERM we regularly identify, evaluate and respond to opportunities that present themselves in our various fields of activity. Below we describe our most significant opportunities. Unless otherwise stated, the opportunities described relate to all organizational units. The order  in  which  the  opportunities  are  presented  reflects  the  currently  estimated  relative  exposure  for  Siemens  associated  with  these opportunities  and  thus  provides  an  indication  of  the  opportunities'  current  importance  to  us.  The  described  opportunities  are  not necessarily the only ones we encounter. In addition, our assessment of opportunities is subject to change because the Company, our markets and technologies are constantly advancing. It is also possible that opportunities we see today will never materialize.\n\nFavorable political and regulatory environment (including sustainability) : A favorable political and regulatory environment including the transition towards a low-carbon economy could restore a more positive industrial investment sentiment that supports the growth of",

        "page_content": "our markets. In addition, government initiatives and subsidies (including tax reforms, green and digital recovery plans, R&D among others) may lead to more government spending (e.g. infrastructure, healthcare, mobility or digitalization investments) and ultimately result in an opportunity for us to participate in ways that increase our revenue and profit. Investments to strengthen countries' resilience, energy and food security, as well as to diversify value chains close to major markets (reshoring, nearshoring) can present opportunities to businesses. By enabling our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using our portfolio and by reducing CO2 emission in our own operations,  Siemens  strives  to  support  the  transition  towards  a  low-carbon  economy.  Siemens  also  welcomes  and  supports  recent legislative and governmental measures to accelerate the mitigation of climate change, especially in Europe such as through the Green Deal or sustainable finance initiatives.\n\nTurning COVID-19 challenges into opportunities : Accelerated post COVID-19 recovery of certain markets driven by e.g. digitalization, decarbonization and demographic change might lead to business opportunities. One of the success factors is a balanced and flexible workforce strategy. There is also the chance to strengthen our customer relationships through additional market offerings that specifically address use cases related directly to the COVID-19.\n\nValue creation through innovation : We drive innovation by investing significantly in R&D in order to develop sustainable solutions for our  customers  while  also  strengthening  our  own  competitiveness.  Being  an  innovative  company  and  constantly  inventing  new technologies that we expect will meet future demands arising from the megatrends of demographic change, urbanization, digitalization, environmental change, resource scarcity and glocalization is one of our core purposes. We are granted thousands of new patents every year and continuously develop new concepts and convincing new digital and data-driven business models. This helps us create the next generation of ground-breaking innovations in such fields as digital twin, artificial intelligence, automation and edge computing. Across our operating units, we are profiting from our strength in connecting the real and digital worlds. Our new Xcelerator platform is an open, digital business platform featuring a curated portfolio of IoT-enabled hardware and software, an ecosystem and a marketplace to enhance the digital transformation of our customers. We see growth opportunities in opening up access to new markets and customers through new marketing and sales strategies, which we implement in our operating units. Our position along the value chains of automation and digitalization allows us to further increase market penetration. Along these value chains, we have identified several clear growth fields in which we see our greatest long-term potential. Hence, we are combining and developing our resources and capabilities for these growth fields.\n\nMergers, acquisitions, equity investments, partnerships, divestments and streamlining our portfolio :  We constantly monitor our current and potential markets to identify opportunities for strategic mergers, acquisitions, equity investments and partnerships, which may complement our organic growth. Such activities may help us to strengthen our position in our existing markets, provide access to new or underserved markets, or complement our technological portfolio in strategic areas. Opportunities might also arise when portfolio optimization measures generate gains, which enable us to further pursue our other strategies for growth and profitability.\n\nOptimization of organization and processes : On the one hand, we leverage ideas to drive further improvements in our processes and cost  structure,  such  as  common  computing  architecture  for  image  processing.  Furthermore,  we  leverage  ideas  to  drive  further improvements in our processes and cost structure optimizing factory capacities for shorter lead times. On the other hand, we see an opportunity of further penetrating markets by quality initiative program and avoiding or reducing non conformance cost.\n\nLeveraging  Market  Potential: Through  sales  and  services  initiatives  we  continuously  strive  to  grow  and  extend  our  businesses  in established markets, open up new markets for existing portfolio elements and strengthen our installed base in order to gain a higher market share and increased profits. Furthermore, we aim to increase our sales via improved account management and new distribution channels.\n\nAssessment of the overall opportunities situation : The most significant opportunity for Siemens is favorable political and regulatory environment (including sustainability) as described above.\n\nWhile our assessments of individual opportunities have changed during fiscal 2022 due to developments in the external environment, changes in our business portfolio, our endeavors to profit from them and revision of our strategic plans, the overall opportunity situation for Siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year.\n\n## 8.5 Significant characteristics of the internal control and risk management system\n\n## 8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM\n\nOur ICS and ERM are based on the principles, guidelines and measures introduced by the Managing Board, which are aimed at the organizational implementation of the Managing Board's decisions. Our ICS and ERM include the management of risks and opportunities relating to the achievement of business goals, the correctness and reliability of internal and external accounting, and compliance with the laws  and  regulations  relevant  to  Siemens.  Sustainability  aspects  are  covered  as  well  and  are  continuously  developed  based  on  the regulatory requirements.\n\nOur  ICS  and  ERM  are  based  on  the  globally  accepted  COSO  framework  (Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission).  Our  ERM  approach  is  based  on  the  COSO  Standard  'Enterprise  Risk  Management  -  Integrating  with  Strategy  and Performance' (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. Our ICS is based on the internationally recognized 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework' (2013) also developed by COSO. The framework defines the elements of a control system and sets the standard for assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our ICS, both systems are complementary.\n\nAll Siemens entities are part of our ICS and ERM. The scope of activities to be performed by each entity is different, depending, among others, on the entity's impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens and the specific risks associated with the entity. The management of each entity is obliged to implement an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within their area of responsibility, based on the group-wide mandatory methodology.\n\nOverall responsibility for our ICS and ERM lies with the Managing Board. The Siemens Risk and Internal Control (RIC) organization bundles and integrates the internal control and ERM processes and supports the Managing Board in designing and maintaining adequate and",

        "page_content": "effective  processes  for  implementing,  monitoring  and  reporting  on  internal  control  and  ERM  activities.  It  consists  of  the  central  RIC departments  of  Siemens  AG  and  the  RIC  departments  at  our  organizational  units.  The  central  RIC  departments  are  responsible  for monitoring and coordinating the entire processes in order to ensure an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within the Group.\n\nWe have an overarching, integrated ICS and ERM methodology (RIC methodology) with a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined, documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested regularly for their adequacy and effectiveness. For more information on ERM, see chapter 8.2 Risk management.\n\nOur ICS and ERM and their contributing elements are regularly subject of audit activities by our internal audit function. These are carried out either as part of the risk-based annual audit plan or as part of audits scheduled during the year upon request. Siemens Healthineers has its own internal audit function and annual audit plan. Topics from the annual audit plan of Siemens Healthineers that are also relevant for our Managing Board and Audit Committee must be mandated first by Siemens Healthineers' Managing Board and Audit Committee and subsequently by our Managing Board and Audit Committee. The audit procedures for these topics will be generally executed by joint teams including members of our and Siemens Healthineers' internal audit functions, thus respecting the interests of both Siemens AG and Siemens Healthineers.\n\nAt the end of each fiscal year, our Managing Board performs an evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS and ERM. This evaluation is based primarily on the Siemens 'In Control'-Statement and quarterly Managing Board meetings. The purpose of the \"In Control\" Statement is to provide an overview of the key elements of the ICS and ERM of Siemens AG and its affiliated companies at the end of the fiscal year, to summarize the activities undertaken to review its adequacy and effectiveness and highlight any critical control weaknesses identified as part of these activities. The information contained in this statement is provided to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG to report on the effectiveness of the ICS and ERM. The Siemens 'In Control' Statement is supported by certifications at various corporate levels and by all affiliated companies. In the quarterly Managing Board meetings, the company-wide risk and opportunity situation is evaluated, the results of the internal control process are explained and once a year an overall conclusion is made about the adequacy and effectiveness of our ICS or ERM. Based on this, the Managing Board has no indication that our ICS or ERM in their respective wholes have not been adequate or effective as of September 30, 2022.\n\nNevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any risk management and control system. For example, no system even if deemed to be adequate and effective - can guarantee that all risks that will actually occur will be identified in advance or that any process violations will be ruled out under all circumstances.\n\nThe Audit Committee is systematically integrated into our ICS and ERM. In particular, it oversees the accounting and the accounting process as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS, ERM and the internal audit system.\n\nSiemens Healthineers is largely subject to the Group-wide principles for our ICS and ERM and is responsible for adhering to those principles.\n\nThe integration of Varian into our ICS, which began in fiscal 2021 after the acquisition by Siemens Healthineers, continued in fiscal 2022 and was completed to a large extent with regard to the most significant Varian entities. The integration measures will be continued in fiscal 2023.\n\n## 8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)\n\nThe ICS and ERM also include a CMS geared to the Company's risk situation.\n\nOur CMS is based on the three pillars -- prevent, detect and react -- and includes the legal risk areas of corruption, antitrust law, data protection, money laundering, export controls and respect for human rights. It is based on an extensive internal set of rules: The Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines ('BCG') define the basic principles and standards of behavior that must be observed by all employees in the company  units  and  in  relation  to  customers,  external  partners  and  the  public.  In  addition,  there  are  extensive  internal  compliance regulations, including associated controls, which oblige all Siemens employees to ensure the implementation of the CMS. They contain topic-specific implementation regulations for the individual risk areas with regard to compliance processes and tools as well as additional guidelines  and  information.  The  compliance  operating  model  contains  binding  specifications  for  the  employees  of  the  compliance organization and describes responsibilities and how the CMS works.\n\nCompliance risk management and compliance reviews as part of the CMS aim to identify compliance risks at an early stage and thus enable to take appropriate and effective measures to avoid or minimize risks. The risk assessment is also integrated into individual business processes and tools. The results of CMS that are relevant to the Group are taken into account as part of the Company-wide ERM.\n\nThe Compliance Control Program aims to ensure compliance and implementation of the CMS and processes used worldwide. It is part of the ICS and is continuously further developed and adapted to the current Siemens guidelines. In addition, current compliance issues are discussed at the management level on a regular basis.\n\nThe entire CMS is continuously adapted to business-specific risks and various local legal requirements. The findings from compliance risk management as well as compliance controls and audits are used to derive measures for its further development.\n\n## 8.5.3 Significant characteristics of the accounting-related ICS and ERM\n\nThe overarching objective of our accounting-related ICS and ERM -- as part of the overarching ICS and ERM -- is to ensure that financial reporting is conducted in a proper manner, such that the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report of the Siemens Group and the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG as the parent company are prepared in accordance with all relevant regulations.\n\nOur  ICS  and  ERM  are  based  on  the  globally  recognized  COSO  framework  (Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway\n\nCommission), for further information see 8.5.1.\n\nAt the end of each fiscal year, our management performs an evaluation of the effectiveness of the accounting-related ICS. We have a standardized  procedure  under  which  necessary  controls  are  defined,  documented  in  accordance  with  uniform  standards,  and  tested regularly for their effectiveness. Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any control system, and no system, including one determined to be effective, may prevent or detect all misstatements",

        "page_content": "Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the basis of a centrally issued conceptual framework which primarily consists of uniform Financial Reporting Guidelines and a chart of accounts. For Siemens AG and other companies within the Siemens Group required to prepare financial statements in accordance with German Commercial Code, this conceptual framework is complemented by mandatory regulations specific to the German Commercial Code. The need for adjustments in the conceptual framework due to regulatory changes is analyzed on an ongoing basis. Accounting departments are informed quarterly about current topics and deadlines from an accounting and closing process perspective.\n\nThe base data used in preparing our financial statements consists of the closing data reported by the operations of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries.  The  preparation  of  the  closing  data  of  most  of  our  entities  is  supported  by  an  internal  shared  services  organization. Furthermore,  other  accounting  activities,  such  as  governance  and  monitoring  activities,  are  usually  bundled  on  a  regional  level.  In particular cases, such as valuations relating to post-employment benefits, we use external experts. The reported closing data is used to prepare the financial statements in the consolidation system. The steps necessary to prepare the financial statements are subject to both manual and automated controls.\n\nQualification  of  employees involved in the accounting process is ensured through appropriate selection processes and training. As a fundamental principle, based on materiality considerations, the 'four eyes' principle applies, and specific procedures must be adhered to for data authorization. Additional control mechanisms include target-performance comparisons and analyses of the composition of and changes in individual line items, both in the closing data submitted by reporting units and in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In line  with  our  information  security  requirements,  accounting-related  IT  systems  contain  defined  access  rules  protecting  them  from unauthorized access. The manual and system-based control mechanisms referred to above generally also apply when reconciling the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) closing data to the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we execute an internal certification process. Management at different levels of our organization, supported by confirmations by managements of entities under their responsibility, confirms the accuracy of the financial data that has been reported to Siemens' corporate headquarters and reports on the effectiveness of the related control systems.\n\nSiemens Healthineers is subject to our Group-wide principles for the accounting-related internal control and risk management system and is responsible for adhering to those principles.\n\nThe integration of Varian into our accounting-related ICS, which began in fiscal 2021 after the acquisition by Siemens Healthineers, continued in fiscal 2022 and was largely completed with regard to the main Varian entities. The integration measures will be continued in fiscal 2023.\n\nOur  internal  audit  function  systematically  reviews  our  financial  reporting  integrity,  our  accounting-related  ICS  and  ERM.  Siemens Healthineers has its own internal audit department and annual audit plan (see also 8.5.1). The Audit Committee is integrated into our accounting-related  ICS.  In  particular,  it  oversees  the  accounting  and  accounting  process  and  the  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  the associated ICS, the ERM and the internal audit system. Moreover, we have rules for accounting-related complaints.",

Siemens AG\n\nThe  Annual  Financial  Statements  of  Siemens  AG  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  regulations  set  forth  in  the  German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz).\n\nIn  fiscal  2022,  results  for  Siemens  AG  arise  mainly  from  the  business  activities  of  Digital  Industries  and  Smart  Infrastructure  and  are influenced significantly by the results of subsidiaries and investments we own either directly or indirectly. The business development of Siemens AG is fundamentally subject to the same risks and opportunities as the Siemens Group. Therefore, the foregoing explanations for the Siemens Group apply also for Siemens AG.\n\nThe Supervisory Board and the Managing Board propose to distribute a dividend of \u20ac4.25 per share of no par value entitled to the dividend, from the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 amounting to \u20ac3.613 million. The proposed dividend represents a total payout of \u20ac3.4 billion based on the estimated number of shares entitled to dividend at the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. We intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. This includes striving for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year, or that at least matches the prior-year level. For fiscal 2023, we expect that net income of Siemens AG will be sufficient to fund the distribution of a corresponding dividend.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the number of employees was around 49,000.\n\n## 9.1 Results of operations\n\nStatement of Income of Siemens AG in accordance with German Commercial Code (condensed)\n\n|                                                                                             | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                                          | 2022          | 2021          |            |\n| Revenue                                                                                     | 17,390        | 15,094        | 15%        |\n| Cost of sales                                                                               | (12,502)      | (10,960)      | (14)%      |\n| Gross profit                                                                                | 4,888         | 4,135         | 18%        |\n| as percentage of revenue                                                                    | 28%           | 27%           |            |\n| Research and development expenses                                                           | (1,785)       | (1,570)       | (14)%      |\n| Selling and general administrative expenses                                                 | (3,283)       | (2,999)       | (9)%       |\n| Other operating income (expenses), net                                                      | (306)         | (196)         | (56)%      |\n| Financial income, net  thereof Income (loss) from investments, net 4.204 (prior year 5.303) | 3,599         | 5,797         | (38)%      |\n| Income from business activity                                                               | 3,115         | 5,166         | (40)%      |\n| Income taxes                                                                                | 498           | (20)          | n/a        |\n| Net income                                                                                  | 3,612         | 5,147         | (30)%      |\n| Profit carried forward                                                                      | 185           | 171           | 8%         |\n| Allocation to other retained earnings                                                       | (185)         | (1,918)       | 90%        |\n| Unappropriated net income                                                                   | 3,613         | 3,400         | 6%         |\n\nOn a geographical basis, 74% of revenue was generated in the Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East region, 18% in the Asia, Australia region and 8% in the Americas region. Exports from Germany accounted for 57% of overall revenue. In fiscal 2022, orders for Siemens AG amounted to \u20ac20.8 billion.\n\nThe increases of revenue, cost of sales and research and development expenses were due mainly to Digital Industries.\n\nThe R&D intensity (R&D as a percentage of revenue) was 10%, on the same level as fiscal 2021. The research and development activities of  Siemens  AG  are  fundamentally  the  same  as  for  its  corresponding  business  activities  within  the  Siemens  Group.  Research  and development expenses in both periods related mainly to Digital Industries. On an average basis, Siemens AG employed 7,000 people in R&D in fiscal 2022.\n\nThe increase in selling and general administrative expenses was due mainly to higher selling expenses led also by Digital Industries.\n\nOther operating income (expenses), net , included lower income from the release of provisions related to a former investment, as in fiscal 2021.\n\nFinancial income, net, was burdened by Siemens' decision to exit business activities in Russia as a consequence of the war in the Ukraine. Subsequent to this decision, Siemens AG recorded impacts of \u20ac0.6 billion in connection with allowances on receivables from affiliated companies and an impairment of \u20ac0.3 billion on the investment OOO Siemens, Russia. In addition to these impacts, financial income, net, decreased mainly due to the following reasons:\n\nThe main factors in lower income (loss) from investments, net included an increase of \u20ac3.4 billion in impairments on investments, driven by an impairment of \u20ac2.9 billion on Siemens AG's stake in Siemens Energy AG, Germany, and a decrease of \u20ac1.7 billion in gains from the disposals of investments, which in fiscal 2021 included a gain of \u20ac0.9 billion from the sale of Flender GmbH, Germany. These factors were partly offset by an increase of \u20ac2.9 billion in income from profit transfer agreements with affiliated companies, due mainly to higher income of \u20ac2.6 billion from Siemens Beteiligungen Inland GmbH, Germany, and an increase of \u20ac1.2 billion in income from investments, which included income of \u20ac2.4 billion from the investment in Siemens Beteiligungsverwaltung GmbH & Co. OHG, Germany.\n\nA negative change in other financial income (expenses), net included a decrease of \u20ac0.7 billion in gains from non-current securities and a negative change of \u20ac0.6 billion for provisions relating to derivative financial instruments. Additionally, it included the allowances on receivables from affiliated companies of \u20ac0.6 billion as mentioned above. In contrast, there was a decrease of \u20ac0.6 billion in expenses from interest component of changes in pension provisions that are not offset against designated plan assets; this related mainly to a",

The liquidity management is based on the financing policy of the Siemens Group, which is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. Intra-group financing activities drove both an increase of \u20ac8.5 billion in receivables from affiliated companies, which resulted in higher inventories, receivables and other assets, and an increase of \u20ac5.0 billion in liabilities to affiliated companies, which was the main reason for the increase of trade payables, liabilities to affiliated companies and other liabilities.\n\nThe increase in provisions for pensions and similar commitments was due mainly to recording of current service and interest costs, including actuarial valuation effects relating to the increase of the rate of pension progression up to 2.0% per year (1.5% per year in fiscal 2021) in connection with the inflation, partly offset by payments for pensions and similar commitments.\n\nThe decrease in equity was due to dividends paid in fiscal 2022 (for fiscal 2021) of \u20ac3.2 billion and share buybacks during the year amounting to \u20ac1.6 billion. These factors were partly offset by net income for the year of \u20ac3.6 billion and the transfer of \u20ac0.6 billion in treasury shares to employees in connection with our share-based payment programs. The equity ratio as of September 30, 2022 decreased to 19%, from 21% a fiscal year earlier. For the disclosures in accordance with Section 160 para. 1 no. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act about treasury shares, refer to Note 15 of our Notes to Annual Financial Statements for fiscal 2022.\n\n## 9.3 Corporate Governance statement\n\nThe Corporate Governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code is publicly available on the company's website at siemens.com/corporate-governance.",

Takeover-relevant information (pursuant to Sections 289a and 315a of the German Commercial Code) and explanatory report\n\n## 10.1 Composition of common stock\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company's common stock totaled \u20ac2.550 billion. The capital stock is divided into 850 million registered shares of no par value (Siemens shares). The shares are fully paid in. All shares confer the same rights and obligations. The shareholders' rights and obligations are governed in detail by the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, in particular by Sections 12, 53a et seq., 118 et seq. and 186 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\n## 10.2 Restrictions on voting rights or transfer of shares\n\nAt the Shareholders' Meeting, each share of stock has one vote and accounts for the shareholder's proportionate share in the Company's net income. An exception to this rule applies with regard to treasury shares held by the Company, which do not entitle the Company to any rights. Under Section 136 of the German Stock Corporation Act the voting right of the affected shares is excluded by law.\n\nSiemens shares issued to employees worldwide under the employee share programs implemented since the beginning of fiscal 2009, in particular the Share Matching Plan, are freely transferable unless applicable local laws provide otherwise. Under the rules of the Share Matching Plan, however, in order to receive one matching share free of charge for each three shares purchased, participants are required to hold the shares purchased by them for a vesting period of several years, during which the participants must be continuously employed by Siemens AG or any of its affiliated companies. The right to receive matching shares is forfeited if the purchased shares are sold, transferred, hedged on, pledged or hypothecated in any way during the relevant vesting period.\n\nThe von Siemens-Verm\u00f6gensverwaltung GmbH (vSV) has, on a sustained basis, powers of attorney allowing it to exercise the voting rights for 10,584,465 shares (as of September 30, 2022) on behalf of members of the Siemens family. These shares are part of the total number of shares held by the family's members. The powers of attorney are based on an agreement between the vSV and, among others, members of the Siemens family. The shares are voted together by vSV, taking into account the suggestions of a family partnership established by the family's members or of one of this partnership's governing bodies.\n\n## 10.3 Legislation and provisions of the Articles of Association applicable to the appointment and removal of members of the Managing Board and governing amendment to the Articles of Association\n\nThe appointment and removal of members of the Managing Board are subject to the provisions of Sections 84 and 85 of the German Stock Corporation Act and Section 31 of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz). According to Section 8 para. 1 of the Articles of Association, the Managing Board is comprised of several members, the number of which is determined by the Supervisory Board.\n\nAccording to Section 179 of the German Stock Corporation Act, any amendment to the Articles of Association requires a resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting. The authority to adopt purely formal amendments to the Articles of Association was transferred to the Supervisory Board under Section 13 para. 2 of the Articles of Association. In addition, by resolutions adopted during past Shareholders' Meetings, the Supervisory  Board  has  been  authorized  to  amend  Section  4  of  the  Articles  of  Association  in  accordance  with  the  utilization  of  the Authorized and Conditional Capitals, and after expiration of the then-applicable authorization and utilization period.\n\nResolutions of the Shareholders' Meeting require a simple majority vote, unless a greater majority is required by law (Section 23 para. 2 of the  Articles  of  Association).  Pursuant  to  Section  179  para.  2  of  the  German  Stock  Corporation  Act,  amendments  to  the  Articles  of Association require a majority of at least three-quarters of the capital stock represented at the time of the casting of the votes, unless another capital majority is prescribed by the Articles of Association.\n\n## 10.4 Powers of the Managing Board to issue and repurchase shares\n\nThe Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until February 2, 2026 by up to  \u20ac90  million  through  the  issuance  of  up  to  30  million  Siemens  shares  against  contributions  in  cash  (Authorized  Capital  2021). Subscription rights of existing shareholders are excluded. The new shares shall be offered exclusively to employees of the Company and any of its affiliated companies. To the extent permitted by law, such employee shares may also be issued in such a manner that the contribution to be paid on such shares is covered by that part of the annual net income which the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board may allocate to other retained earnings under Section 58 para. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\nFurthermore, the Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until January 29, 2024 by up to \u20ac510 million through the issuance of up to 170 million Siemens shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind (Authorized Capital 2019).\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the total unissued authorized capital of Siemens AG therefore consisted of \u20ac600 million nominal that may be used, in installments with varying terms, by issuance of up to 200 million Siemens shares.\n\nBy resolutions of the Shareholders' Meetings on January 30, 2019 and February 5, 2020, the Managing Board is authorized to issue bonds with conversion, exchange or option rights or with warrants attached, or a combination of these instruments, entitling the holders to subscribe to up to 80 million and up to 60 million Siemens shares, respectively. Based on these two authorizations, the Company or its affiliated companies may issue bonds until January 29, 2024 and February 4, 2025, respectively, each in an aggregate principal amount of up to \u20ac15 billion. In order to grant shares of stock to holders/creditors of such convertible bonds or warrant bonds, the capital stock was conditionally increased by resolutions of the Shareholders' Meetings in 2019 and 2020, by up to 80 million and up to 60 million Siemens",

They are, as a matter of principle, to be offered to shareholders for subscription. The Managing Board is authorized to exclude, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, subscription rights of shareholders in the event of capital increases against contributions in kind. In the event of capital increases against contributions in cash, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude shareholders' subscription rights with the approval of the Supervisory Board in the following cases:\n\n- \u00b7 The issue price of the new shares/bonds is not significantly lower than the stock market price of the Siemens shares already listed or the theoretical market price of the bonds computed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial methods (exclusion of subscription rights, limited to 10% of the capital stock, in accordance with or by mutatis mutandis application of Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 German Stock Corporation Act).\n- \u00b7 The exclusion is necessary with regard to fractional amounts resulting from the subscription ratio.\n- \u00b7 The  exclusion  is  used  to  grant  holders  of  conversion  or  option  rights  or  conversion  or  option  obligations  on  Siemens  shares  a compensation for the effects of dilution.\n\nThe new shares issued or to be issued in exchange for contributions in cash and in kind and with shareholders' subscription rights excluded, may in certain cases be subject to further restrictions. The details of those restrictions are described in the relevant authorization. In addition, the Managing Board has issued the commitment not to increase the capital stock from the Authorized Capital 2019 and the Conditional Capitals 2019 and 2020 by a total of more than 10% of the capital stock existing at the time of the Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020, to the extent that capital increases with shareholders' subscription rights excluded are made from the Authorized Capital 2019 against  contributions  in  cash  or  in  kind  or  to  service  convertible  bonds  and/or  warrant  bonds  issued  under  the  authorizations approved on January 30, 2019 or February 5, 2020 with shareholders' subscription rights excluded. This commitment ends no later than February 4, 2025.\n\nThe Company may not repurchase its own shares unless so authorized by a resolution duly adopted by the shareholders at a general meeting or in other very limited circumstances set forth in the German Stock Corporation Act. On February 5, 2020, the Shareholders' Meeting authorized the Company to acquire until February 4, 2025 up to 10% of its capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution or - if this value is lower - as of the date on which the authorization is exercised. The aggregate of shares of stock of Siemens AG repurchased under this authorization and any other Siemens shares previously acquired and still held in treasury by the Company or attributable to the Company pursuant to Sections 71d and 71e of the German Stock Corporation Act may at no time exceed 10% of the then existing capital stock. Any repurchase of Siemens shares shall be accomplished at the discretion of the Managing Board either (1) by acquisition over the stock exchange, (2) through a public share repurchase offer or (3) through a public offer to swap Siemens shares for shares in a listed company within the meaning of Section 3 para. 2 German Stock Corporation Act. The Managing Board is additionally authorized to complete the repurchase of Siemens shares in accordance with the authorization described above by using certain derivatives (put and call options, forward purchases and any combination of these derivatives). In exercising this authorization, all stock repurchases based on the derivatives are limited to a maximum volume of 5% of Siemens' capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution at the Shareholders' Meeting. A derivative's term of maturity may not, in any case, exceed 18 months and must be chosen in such a way that the repurchase of Siemens shares upon exercise of the derivative will take place no later than February 4, 2025.\n\nIn addition to selling them over the stock exchange or through a public sales offer to all shareholders, the Managing Board is authorized by resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020 to also use Siemens shares repurchased on the basis of this or any previously given authorization for every permissible purpose, in particular as follows: Such Siemens shares may be\n\n- \u00b7 retired;\n- \u00b7 used in connection with share-based compensation programs and/or employee share programs of the Company or any of its affiliated companies and issued to individuals currently or formerly employed by the Company or any of its affiliated companies as well as to board members of any of the Company's affiliated companies;\n- \u00b7 offered and transferred, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to third parties against non-cash contributions;\n- \u00b7 sold by the Managing Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, against payment in cash if the price at which such Siemens shares are sold is not significantly lower than the market price of Siemens stock (exclusion of subscription rights, limited to 10% of the capital stock, by mutatis mutandis application of Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 German Stock Corporation Act); or\n- \u00b7 used to service or secure obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares arising particularly from or in connection with convertible bonds or warrant bonds of the Company or its affiliated companies. Moreover, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude subscription rights in  order  to  grant  holders/creditors of conversion or option rights or respective conversion or option obligations on Siemens shares subscription rights as compensation against effects of dilution to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercise of such rights or fulfillment of such obligations, and to use Siemens shares to service such subscription rights.\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board is authorized to use shares acquired on the basis of this or any previously given authorization to meet obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares that were or will be agreed with members of the Managing Board within the framework of rules governing Managing Board compensation.\n\nOn June 24, 2021, the Company announced that it would launch a new five-year share buyback program, beginning in fiscal 2022. This buyback, which began on November 15, 2021 and extends at the latest until September 15, 2026, is limited to a maximum value of \u20ac3 billion (excluding incidental transaction charges) on purchases of no more than 50 million Siemens shares. Using the authorization given by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020, Siemens repurchased 14.2 million shares by September 30, 2022 under this share  buyback.  This  buyback  has  the  exclusive  purposes  of  retirement,  of  issuing  shares  to  employees,  board  members  of  affiliated companies and members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, and of servicing/securing the obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares arising particularly from or in connection with convertible bonds and warrant bonds.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company held 57,454,171 shares of stock in treasury.",

        "page_content": "For  details  on  the  authorizations  referred  to  above,  especially  the  terms  to  exclude  subscription  rights,  please  refer  to  the  relevant resolution and to Section 4 of the Articles of Association.\n\n## 10.5 Significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, Siemens AG maintained lines of credit in the amount of \u20ac7.45 billion.\n\nIn December 2021, Siemens AG entered into two bilateral loan agreements in the total amount of \u20ac600 million, which have been fully drawn.\n\nIn December 2021, a consolidated subsidiary as borrower and Siemens AG as guarantor entered into a bilateral loan agreement in the amount of \u20ac500 million, which has been fully drawn. In addition, in March 2020 and in June 2019 respectively, a consolidated subsidiary as borrower and Siemens AG as guarantor entered into a bilateral loan agreement, each of which has been drawn in the full amount of US$ 500 million.\n\nThe lines of credit, and the relevant loan agreements mentioned above provide their respective lenders with a right of termination in the event that (1) Siemens AG becomes a subsidiary of another company or (2) a person or a group of persons acting in concert acquires effective control over Siemens AG by being able to exercise decisive influence over its activities (Art. 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) 139/2004).\n\nFramework  agreements  concluded  by  Siemens  AG  under  International  Swaps  and  Derivatives  Association  Inc.  documentation  (ISDA Agreements) grant each counterparty a right of termination, including in certain cases of (i) a transformation (for example mergers and changes of form), (ii) an asset transfer or (iii) acquisition of ownership interests that enables the acquirer to exercise control over Siemens AG or its controlling bodies. Partially this right of termination exists only, if (1) the resulting entity fails to simultaneously assume Siemens AG's  obligations  under  the  ISDA  Agreements  or  (2)  the  resulting  entity's  creditworthiness  is  materially  weaker  than  Siemens  AG's immediately prior to such event. Generally, ISDA Agreements are designed such that upon termination all outstanding payment claims documented under them are to be netted.\n\n## 10.6 Compensation agreements with members of the Managing Board or employees in the event of a takeover bid\n\nThe contracts with the members of the Managing Board previously contained the right of the member to terminate his or her contract with the Company for good cause in the event of a change of control that results in a substantial change in the position of a Managing Board  member  (for  example,  due  to  a  change  in  corporate  strategy  or  a  change  in  the  Managing  Board  member's  duties  and responsibilities). A change of control exists if one or several shareholders acting jointly or in concert acquire a majority of the voting rights in Siemens AG and exercise a controlling influence, or if Siemens AG becomes a dependent enterprise as a result of entering into an intercompany agreement within the meaning of Section 291 of the German Stock Corporation Act, or if Siemens AG is to be merged into an existing corporation or other entity. If this right of termination is exercised, the Managing Board member is entitled to a severance payment in the amount of no more than two years' compensation. The calculation of the annual compensation includes not only the base compensation and the target amount for the bonus, but also the target amount for the stock awards, in each case based on the most recent completed fiscal year prior to termination of the contract. The stock-based compensation components for which a firm commitment already exists will remain unaffected. Additionally, the severance payments cover non-monetary benefits by including an amount of 5% of the total severance amount. Severance payments will be reduced by 10% as a lump-sum allowance for discounted values and for income earned elsewhere. However, this reduction will apply only to the portion of the severance payment that was calculated without taking account of the first six months of the remaining term of the Managing Board member's contract. There is no entitlement to a severance payment if the Managing Board member receives benefits from third parties in connection with a change of control. A right to terminate the  contract  does  not  exist  if  the  change  of  control  occurs  within  a  period  of  twelve  months  prior  to  a  Managing  Board  member's retirement.\n\nOn September 18, 2019, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG resolved that the contracts with members of the Managing Board should not contain such right of termination in the future. This has already been taken into account in the case of contract extensions and in the case of new contracts with the newly appointed members of the Managing Board as of October 1, 2020.\n\n## 10.7 Other takeover-relevant information\n\nWe are not aware of, nor have we during the last fiscal year been notified of, any shareholder directly or indirectly holding 10% or more of the voting rights. There are no Siemens shares with special rights conferring powers of control. Shares of stock issued by Siemens AG to employees under its employee share program and/or as share-based compensation are transferred to the employees. The beneficiary employees who hold shares of employee stock may exercise their control rights in the same way as any other shareholder in accordance with applicable laws and the Articles of Association.",

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1 Basis of presentation\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements present the operations of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft with registered offices in Berlin (registry number HRB 12300) and Munich (registry number HRB 6684), Germany, and its subsidiaries (the Company or Siemens). They have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union as well as with the additional requirements set forth in Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The Consolidated Financial Statements are in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Consolidated Financial Statements were authorized for issue by the Managing Board on December 5, 2022. Siemens prepares and reports its Consolidated Financial Statements in euros (\u20ac). Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided. Siemens is a German based multinational focused technology company.\n\n## NOTE 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates\n\nCertain of the following accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where Siemens reasonably could have used a different estimate in the  current  accounting  period.  Siemens  cautions  that  future  events  often  vary  from  forecasts  and  that  estimates  routinely  require adjustment.\n\nOverall, we face an increasingly complex and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, including potential energy and gas shortfalls or outages, less predictable and escalating volatility in non-financial and financial markets (in share prices, rising interest and inflation rates, foreign currency prices, etc.), as well as a rising apprehension of a potential shift into an economic downturn. Impacts of the pandemic coronavirus spread on Siemens' Consolidated Financial Statements are contingent on the further evolution of virus variants and its dangerousness, the progress of worldwide vaccinations, the vaccines' effectiveness and the imposition of consequential lockdowns. Effects vary considerably by region and customer industries. Siemens is currently operating in a surrounding, which requires dealing with COVID-19, the war in Ukraine and sanctions imposed on Russia as well as the need to take potential countermeasures being taken by Russia into account. Uncertainties increase in prognosis and forecasts, in applying critical accounting estimates and in using management judgements.  Those  trends  could  impact  fair  values  and  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  amount  and  timing  of  results  of operations and cash flows of Siemens. Severity and duration of those trends are decisive on the magnitude of its impact on Siemens' Consolidated Financial Statements. Siemens based its estimates and assumptions on existing knowledge and best information available.\n\nFollowing the war in Ukraine, Siemens decided to exit business activities in Russia. Subsequent to this decision, Income from continuing operations was burdened by negative effects totaling \u20ac1.3 billion related to these activities primarily at Mobility, SFS and Corporate Treasury of Financing, eliminations and other items. For further information, see Notes 3, 4, 11, 13, 23 and 29.\n\nBasis of consolidation - The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries over which the Company has control. Siemens controls an investee if it has power over the investee. In addition, Siemens is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from the involvement with the investee and Siemens is able to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of Siemens' return.\n\nBusiness combinations - Cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date  of  exchange.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a  business  combination  (including  contingent  liabilities)  are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method). If there is no loss of control, transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions not affecting net income. At the date control is lost, any retained equity interests are remeasured to fair value. In case of a written put option on non-controlling interests the Company assesses whether the prerequisites for the transfer of present ownership interest are fulfilled at the balance sheet date. If the Company is not the beneficial owner of the shares underlying the put option, the exercise of the put option will be assumed at each balance sheet date and treated as equity transaction between shareholders with the recognition of a purchase liability at the respective exercise price. The non-controlling interests participate in profits and losses during the reporting period.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures -  Associates  are  companies  over  which Siemens has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally through direct or indirect ownership of 20% to 50% of the voting rights). Joint ventures are entities over which Siemens and one or more parties have joint control. Joint control requires unanimous consent of the parties sharing control in decision making on relevant activities.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. If the investment was retained in a transaction in which Siemens lost control of a subsidiary, the fair value of the investment represents the cost on initial recognition. Siemens' share of its associate's or joint venture's post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in  the  Consolidated  Statements of Income, and its share of post-acquisition changes in equity that have not been recognized in the associate's or joint venture's profit or loss is recognized directly in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition changes also include effects from fair value adjustments and are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When Siemens' share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the investment, Siemens does not recognize further losses, unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. The interest in an associate or joint venture is the carrying amount of the investment together with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of Siemens' net investment in the associate or joint venture.\n\nSiemens reviews associates and joint ventures for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that its investment is impaired, for example a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. This includes the use of judgements, in particular with respect to the net investment in Siemens Energy AG.",

        "page_content": "Foreign currency translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is other than the euro, are translated using the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, while the Consolidated Statements of Income are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Differences arising from such translations are recognized within equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign subsidiary is recognized. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, whereas cash and cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.\n\nForeign currency transaction - Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at that functional currency applying the spot exchange rate at the date when the underlying transactions are initially recognized. At the end of the reporting period, foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are revalued to functional currency applying the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized in net income. Those foreign currency-denominated transactions which are classified as non-monetary are remeasured using the historical spot exchange rate.\n\nRevenue recognition - Siemens recognizes revenue when, or as control over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer; i.e. when the customer is able to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits, provided a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration is probable taking our customer's creditworthiness into account. Revenue is the transaction price Siemens expects to be entitled to. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur once associated uncertainties are resolved. The amount of variable consideration is calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to better predict the amount of variable consideration. Consideration is adjusted for the time value of money if the period between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant financing benefit either to the customer or Siemens. If a contract contains more than one distinct good or service, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling prices. If stand-alone selling prices are not observable, the Company reasonably estimates those. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point in time or over time.\n\nRevenues from construction-type contracts : Revenues are recognized over time under the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs. An expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expense immediately. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.\n\nThe  percentage-of-completion  method  places  considerable  importance  on  accurate  estimates  of  the  extent  of  progress  towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. These significant estimates include total estimated costs, total estimated revenues, contract risks, including technical, political and regulatory risks, risks from supply chain constraints and other judgments. Under the percentage-of-completion method, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. In addition, Siemens needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it is terminated. In determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected to be the most likely scenario, all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract are considered on an individual basis.\n\nRevenues from maintenance and service contracts : Revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than straight-line, as services are provided, i.e. under the percentage-of-completion method as described above. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.\n\nRevenues from product sales : Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually upon delivery of the goods. Invoices are issued at that point in time and are usually payable within 30 days.\n\nRevenues from software contracts: Software contracts usually comprise the sale of subscription licenses and perpetual licenses, which are both on-premise, as well as technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades and the sale of software-as-aservice. Subscription contracts generally contain two separate performance obligations: time-based software license and technical support service. Revenues for perpetual and time-based licenses granting the customer a right to use Siemens' intellectual property are recognized at a point in time, i.e. when control of the license passes to the customer. Revenues for technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades are recognized over time on a straight-line basis as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by Siemens' services. Software-as-a-service contracts including related cloud services represent one performance obligation for which revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis. Payment terms for all transactions are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.\n\nIncome from interest - Interest is recognized using the effective interest method.\n\nFunctional  costs -  In  general,  operating  expenses  by  types  are  assigned  to  the  functions  following  the  functional  area  of  the corresponding profit and cost centers. Amortization, depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are included in functional costs depending on the use of the assets.\n\nProduct-related expenses - Provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties are recorded in line item Cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized.\n\nResearch and development costs - Costs of research activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of development activities are capitalized when the recognition criteria in IAS 38 are met. Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses with an amortization period of generally three to 25 years.\n\nEarnings per share - Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income from continuing operations, income from discontinued operations and net income, all attributable to ordinary shareholders of Siemens AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by assuming conversion or exercise of all potentially dilutive securities and sharebased payment plans.\n\nGoodwill - Goodwill is not amortized, instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating unit or a group of cashgenerating units, generally represented by a segment. Siemens Healthineers is tested one level below the segment. This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.",

        "page_content": "For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the (group of) cash-generating unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. If the carrying amount of the (group of) cash-generating unit(s), to which the goodwill is allocated, exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to that (group of) cash-generating unit(s) is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the (group of) cash-generating unit(s)' fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If either of these values exceeds the carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine both values. These values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future periods.\n\nThe determination of the recoverable amount of a (group of) cash-generating unit(s) to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management. The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e.g. by the successful integration of acquired entities, volatility  of  capital  markets,  interest  rate  developments,  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations  and  the  outlook  on  economic  trends.  In determining recoverable amounts, discounted cash flow calculations generally use five-year projections (in exceptional cases up to ten years) that are based on financial forecasts. Cash flow projections consider past experience and represent management's best estimate about future developments. Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates. Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates and weighted average cost of capital.  These  estimates,  including  the  methodology  used,  can  have  a  material  impact  on  the  respective  values  and ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment.\n\nOther intangible assets - The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives for patents, licenses and other similar rights generally range from three to five years, except for  intangible  assets  with  finite  useful  lives  acquired  in  business  combinations.  Intangible  assets  acquired  in  business  combinations primarily consist of customer relationships and trademarks as well as technology. Useful lives in specific acquisitions ranged from two to 30 years for customer relationships and trademarks (in fiscal 2021 four to 30 years) and for technology from five to 22 years (in fiscal 2021 five to 22 years).\n\nProperty, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment, is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method. The following useful lives are assumed:\n\n| Factory and office buildings    | 20 to 50 years         |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Other buildings                 | 5 to 10 years          |\n| Technical machinery & equipment | generally 10 years     |\n| Office & other equipment        | generally 5 years      |\n| Equipment leased to others      | generally 3 to 7 years |\n\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets - The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets involves the use of estimates in determining the assets' recoverable amount, which can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment.\n\nLeases - A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Further information on leases can be found in Notes 8, 13 and 16.\n\nLessor : Leases are classified as either finance or operating leases, determined based on whether substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset are transferred. If this is the case, the lease is classified as a finance lease; if not, it is an operating  lease.  Receivables  from  finance  leases  are  recognized  at  an  amount  equal  to  the  net  investment  in  the  lease.  The  assets underlying the operating leases are presented in Property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives or to their estimated residual value. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLessee : Siemens recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months if the underlying asset is not of low value. Payments for short-term and low-value leases are expensed over the lease term. Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation expense and impairment losses adjusted for any remeasurements. Right-of-use assets are depreciated under the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying assets. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments due over the lease term, generally discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. They are remeasured in case of modifications or reassessments of the lease.\n\nDiscontinued operations and non-current assets held for disposal - Discontinued operations are reported when a component of an entity  is  classified  as  held  for  disposal  or  has  been  disposed  of,  if  the  component  represents  a  separate  major  line  of  business  or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to disposal. A non-current asset or a disposal group is held for disposal if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction or through a distribution to owners rather than through continuing use. Depreciation and amortization cease for assets classified as held for disposal. In the Consolidated Statements of Income and of Cash Flows, discontinued operations are reported separately from continuing operations; prior periods are presented on a comparable basis. The disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements outside of Note 3 relate to continuing operations or  assets  and  liabilities  not  held  for  disposal.  The  determination  of  the  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  includes  the  use  of  estimates  and assumptions that tend to be uncertain.\n\nIncome taxes - Tax positions are calculated taking into consideration the respective local tax laws, relevant court decisions and applicable tax  authorities'  views.  Tax  regulations  can  be  complex  and  possibly  subject  to  different  interpretations  of  tax  payers  and  local  tax authorities. Different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax legislative procedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into account based on management's considerations. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected tax consequences of future periods attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future  taxable  profit  is  available,  including  income  from  forecasted  operating  earnings,  the  reversal  of  existing  taxable  temporary",

        "page_content": "differences  and  available  tax  planning  opportunities  that  Siemens  would  execute.  As  of  each  period-end,  Siemens  evaluates  the recoverability of deferred tax assets, based on taxable income of past periods and projected future taxable profits. As future developments are uncertain and partly beyond Siemens's control, assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in which deferred tax assets will recover. Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption.\n\nContract assets, contract liabilities, receivables - When either party to a contract with customers has performed, Siemens presents a contract  asset,  a  contract  liability  or  a  receivable  depending  on  the  relationship  between  Siemens'  performance  and  the  customer's payment. Contract assets and liabilities are presented as current since incurred in the normal operating cycle. Receivables are recognized when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Valuation allowances for credit risks are made for contract assets and receivables in accordance with the accounting policy for financial assets measured at amortized cost.\n\nInventories -  Inventories  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  acquisition  or  production  costs  and  net  realizable  value,  costs  being  generally determined based on an average or first-in, first-out method. Determining net realizable value of inventories involves accounting estimates for quantity, technical and price risks.\n\nDefined benefit plans -  Siemens measures the entitlements by applying the projected unit credit method. The approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. In determining the net present value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered (Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)), the expected rates of future salary increases and expected rates of future pension progressions are considered. The assumptions used for the calculation of the DBO as of the period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the following year. Significant plans apply individual spot rates from full discount rate curves to determine service cost and interest expense. The net interest income or expense for the fiscal year will be based on the discount rate for the respective year multiplied by the net defined benefit liability (asset) at the preceding fiscal year's period-end date.\n\nService cost, past service cost and settlement gains (losses) for pensions and similar obligations as well as administration costs unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs. Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized immediately in profit or loss. For unfunded plans, the amount in line item Provisions for pensions and similar obligations equals the DBO. For funded plans, Siemens offsets the fair value of the plan assets from the DBO. Siemens recognizes the net amount, after adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling.\n\nRemeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset). They are recognized in Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.\n\nActuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation increases, rate of pension progression and mortality rates. Discount rates used are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period. In case such yields are not available, discount rates are based on government bonds yields. Due to changing market, economic and social conditions, the underlying key assumptions may differ from actual developments.\n\nEntitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at period-end. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the DBO is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back to a present value.\n\nProvisions - A provision is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position when it is probable that the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. When a contract becomes onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision.\n\nSignificant  estimates  are  involved  in  the  determination  of  provisions  related  to  onerous  contracts,  warranty  costs,  asset  retirement obligations, legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations (Legal Proceedings). Siemens records a provision for onerous contracts with customers when current estimates of total estimated costs exceed estimated revenue. Onerous contracts with customers are identified by monitoring the progress of the project and updating the estimates which requires significant judgment relating to achieving certain performance standards as well as estimates involving warranty costs and estimates regarding project delays including the assessment of responsibility splits between the contract partners for these delays.\n\nLegal Proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, considerable judgment is part of determining whether it is probable that there is a present obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the reporting period, whether it is probable that such a Legal Proceeding will result in an outflow of resources and whether the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Internal and external counsels are generally part of the determination process. Due to new developments, it may be necessary, to record a provision for an ongoing Legal Proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously recognized provision. Upon resolution of a Legal Proceeding, Siemens may incur charges in excess of the recorded provisions for such matters. The outcome of Legal Proceedings may have a material effect on Siemens' financial position, its results of operations and/or its cash flows.\n\nTermination benefits - Termination benefits are provided as a result of an entity's offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancy before the regular retirement date or from an entity's decision to terminate the employment. Termination benefits in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, are recognized as a liability and an expense when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.\n\nFinancial instruments - A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model they are held in, financial instruments are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost, measured at fair value, loan commitments, contract assets and receivables from finance leases. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at the  trade  date.  Initially,  financial  instruments  are  recognized  at  fair  value  and  net  of  transaction  costs,  if  not  categorized  at  FVTPL. Subsequently, financial assets and liabilities are measured according to the category to which they are assigned to:\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) : a) mandatorily measured at FVTPL: Debt financial assets are measured at FVTPL if the business model they are held in is not a hold-to-collect or a hold-and-sell business model, or if their contractual cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest. Equity instruments are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCI-option is  elected.  b)  Financial  assets  designated  as  measured  at  FVTPL  are  irrevocably  designated  at  initial  recognition  if  the  designation",

        "page_content": "significantly reduces accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise if assets and liabilities as well as recognizing gains (losses) were measured on different bases.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) :  are equity instruments for which Siemens irrevocably elects to present subsequent fair value changes in OCI at initial recognition of the instrument. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income tax expenses, as well as gains and losses on the subsequent sale of the instruments are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost : Loans, receivables and other debt instruments held in a hold-to-collect business model with contractual cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less valuation allowances for expected credit losses.\n\nValuation  allowances  are  set  up  for  expected  credit  losses,  representing  a  forward-looking  estimate  of  future  credit  losses  involving significant judgment. Expected credit loss is the gross carrying amount less collateral, multiplied by the probability of default and a factor reflecting  the  loss  in  the  event  of  default.  Valuation  allowances  are  not  recognized  when  the  gross  carrying  amount  is  sufficiently collateralized. Probabilities of default are mainly derived from internal rating grades. A simplified approach is used to assess expected credit losses from trade receivables, lease receivables and contract assets by applying their lifetime expected credit losses. The valuation allowance for loans and other long-term debt instruments primarily held at Financial Services (SFS) is measured according to a three-stage impairment approach:\n\nStage 1 : At inception, twelve-month expected credit losses are recognized based on a twelve months probability of default.\n\nStage 2 :  If  the  credit  risk  of  a  financial  asset  increases  significantly  without being credit-impaired, lifetime expected credit losses are recognized  based  on  a  lifetime  probability  of  default.  A  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  is  determined  for  each  individual  financial instrument using internal credit ratings. A rating deterioration does not trigger a transfer into Stage 2, if the credit rating remains within the investment grade range. More than 30 days past due payments will not be transferred into Stage 2, if the delay is not credit-riskrelated.\n\nStage 3 : If the financial asset is credit-impaired, valuation allowances equal lifetime expected credit losses. A financial asset is considered credit-impaired when there is observable information about significant financial difficulties and a high vulnerability to default, however, the definition of default is not yet met. Impairment triggers include liquidity problems, a request for debt restructuring or a breach of contract. A credit-risk driven contractual modification always results in a credit-impaired financial asset.\n\nFinancial assets are written off as uncollectible if recovery appears unlikely. Generally, if the limitation period expired, when a debtor's sworn statement of affairs is received, or when the receivable is not pursued due to its minor value. Receivables are written off when bankruptcy proceedings close.\n\nA financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred to another party. Significant modifications of contractual terms of a financial asset measured at amortized cost result in derecognition and recognition of a new financial asset; for insignificant modifications, the carrying amount of the financial asset is adjusted without derecognition.\n\nCash and cash equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid investments with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.\n\nLoan  Commitments -  Expected  credit  losses  for  irrevocable  loan  commitments  are  determined  using  the  three-stage  impairment approach for financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized as a liability.\n\nFinancial  liabilities -  except  for  derivative  financial  instruments,  Siemens  measures  financial  liabilities  at  amortized  cost  using  the effective interest method.\n\nDerivative financial instruments - Derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts are measured at fair value unless they are designated as hedging instruments, for which hedge accounting is applied. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or, in the case of a cash flow hedge, in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes (applicable deferred income tax). Certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also accounted for separately as derivatives.\n\nFair value hedges :  The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk. Where an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in its fair value is recognized as a separate financial asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income. For hedged items carried at amortized cost, the adjustment is amortized until maturity of the hedged item. For hedged firm commitments the initial carrying amount of the assets or liabilities  that  result  from  meeting the firm commitments are adjusted to include the cumulative changes in the fair value that were previously recognized as separate financial assets or liabilities.\n\nCash flow hedges :  The  effective  portion  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income.\n\nShare-based payment - Share-based payment awards at Siemens are predominately designed as equity-settled. Fair value is measured at grant date and is expensed over the vesting period. Fair value is determined as the market price of the underlying shares, considering dividends during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to as well as market conditions and non-vesting conditions, if applicable. Plans granting the rights to receive subsidiary shares constitute own shares and, accordingly, are accounted as equity-settled.\n\nPrior-year  information -  The  presentation  of  certain  prior-year  information  has  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current  year presentation.",

(Varian) was finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to reflect new information  obtained.  Adjustments  were  made  retrospectively  as  of  the  acquisition  date  and  increased  Goodwill  by  \u20ac0.2  billion  to \u20ac8.2 billion and decreased Other intangible assets by \u20ac0.1 billion to \u20ac6.2 billion. The adjustments were due to valuation effects resulting from the final allocation of intangible assets, including goodwill, to currency areas and new information in the context of Varian's project business. Due to the allocation to individual currency areas, the foreign currency translation led to a decrease in Other components of equity of \u20ac0.3 billion as of September 30, 2021.\n\nIn October 2021, Siemens acquired all shares in the Netherlands based company SQCAP B.V. (Sqills), a provider in the provision of cloudbased inventory management, reservation, and ticketing software to public transport operators around the world. The acquired business is integrated into Mobility. The purchase price is \u20ac537 million paid in cash, plus a contingent consideration recognized at the acquisition date at an amount of \u20ac88 million, representing the upper end of the bandwidth. The purchase price allocation was finalized as of fiscal year-end. Resulting Other Intangible assets include mainly customer-related intangible assets of \u20ac200 million and technology-related intangible assets of \u20ac138 million. Goodwill of \u20ac365 million comprises intangible assets that are not separable such as employee knowhow and expected synergy effects. The acquired business is included since the beginning of the reporting period and contributed Revenue of \u20ac32 million and Net income of \u20ac(26) million for the period from its acquisition date to September 30, 2022, including earnings effects from the purchase price allocation and integration costs.\n\nIn August 2022, Siemens acquired all shares in Brightly Software Inc. (Brightly), an U.S.-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider of asset and maintenance management solutions. The acquired business will be integrated into Smart Infrastructure. The purchase price is U$1.166  billion  (\u20ac1.144  billion)  paid  in  cash  plus  a  contingent  consideration  recognized  at  the  acquisition  date  at  US$135  million (\u20ac132 million)  which  is  based  on  the  achievement  of  revenue  related  performance  indicators  as  of  September  30,  2024,  and September 2025. The outcome of the contingent consideration is estimated to range between zero and US$0.3 billion (\u20ac0.3 billion). The purchase price allocation is preliminary as a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities has not been finalized; it resulted in the following assets and liabilities: Goodwill of \u20ac1.1 billion, customer-related intangible assets of \u20ac0.6 billion, other intangible assets of \u20ac0.1 billion, other assets of \u20ac0.1 billion, long-term debt of \u20ac0.4 billion (settled after the acquisition), a deferred tax liability of \u20ac0.2 billion and other liabilities of \u20ac0.1 billion. Goodwill comprises intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know-how and expected synergy effects. The acquired business contributed Revenue of \u20ac25 million and a Net loss of \u20ac8 million for the period from its acquisition date to September 30, 2022, including earnings effects from the purchase price allocation and integration costs. If Brightly had been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 1, 2021, revenue and net income, including earnings effects from purchase price allocation and integration costs, would have been \u20ac72.103 billion and \u20ac4.318 billion, respectively, in fiscal year 2022.\n\nIn addition, Siemens closed several smaller acquisitions in fiscal 2022 and 2021 for a total purchase price of \u20ac123 million and \u20ac429 million, respectively, mainly paid in cash. In fiscal 2022, and 2021, the (preliminary) purchase price allocations resulted in Other intangible assets of \u20ac54 million and \u20ac147 million, respectively, and Goodwill of \u20ac81 million and \u20ac254 million, respectively, which comprises intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know-how and expected synergy effects. The purchase price allocation for some of the acquired businesses is preliminary, as a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities has not been finalized.\n\n## Disposals\n\nIn January 2022, Siemens signed an agreement to sell its intelligent road traffic solutions business Yunex Traffic (Yunex) to Atlantia S.p.A. The transaction closed as of June 30, 2022. The consideration received was \u20ac930 million in cash.

Significant  changes  with  an  adverse  effect  in  the economic and legal environment subsequent to sanctions imposed on Russia triggered an impairment of \u20ac172 million presented in Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net, resulting in a recoverable and carrying amount of nil.\n\nIn  February  2022,  Siemens  AG  and  Valeo  GmbH  signed  an  agreement  to  sell  Siemens  AG's  50%  stake  in  the  at  equity  accounted joint venture Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH (disclosed in Portfolio Companies) to Valeo GmbH. The transaction closed in July 2022. The agreement triggered a partial reversal of a previous impairment and resulted in a gain of \u20ac292 million presented in Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net. The recoverable amount was derived from the net consideration (including repayment of shareholder loans).\n\nSiemens Energy AG, an associate accounted for using the equity method, is globally active in the transmission and generation of electrical power and is publicly listed. The stock market value of the investment in Siemens Energy AG was \u20ac2.9 billion and \u20ac 5.9 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, Siemens Energy AG added a loss to Share of profit (loss), net of \u20ac(207) million and \u20ac(396) million, respectively. The loss includes Siemens' share of Siemens Energy AG's net losses of \u20ac(142) million and \u20ac(159) million as well as effects from fair value adjustments at initial recognition of \u20ac(65) million and \u20ac(237) million, respectively. In fiscal 2022, our investment in Siemens Energy AG was impaired by \u20ac2.7 billion. The impairment loss is included in Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method and in reconciling items of Segment information. As of June 30, 2022, the significant decline in the fair value of the investment triggered an impairment test. At this date, the recoverable amount of \u20ac3.6 billion was determined as the investment's fair value less costs to sell using Siemens Energy AG's market capitalization (level 1 of the fair value hierarchy). Siemens received dividends of 26 million from Siemens Energy AG in fiscal 2022.\n\nBelow summarized financial information of Siemens Energy AG are disclosed at a 100 per cent basis.

The determined fair value of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units is assigned to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair value less costs to sell is mainly driven by the terminal value, which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions on the terminal value growth rate and discount rate. Both assumptions are determined individually for each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. Discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Siemens Financial Services' discount rate represents its specific cost of equity. The discount rates are calculated based on a risk-free rate of interest and a market risk premium. In addition, the discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit or group of cashgenerating units by taking into account specific peer group information on beta factors, leverage and cost of debt as well as country specific premiums. The parameters for calculating the discount rates are based on external sources of information. The peer group is subject to an annual review and adjusted, if necessary. Terminal value growth rates take into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data and industry specific trends.\n\nThe following table presents key assumptions used to determine fair value less costs to sell for impairment test purposes for the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated:\n\n|                                 | Sep 30, 2022   | Sep 30, 2022                 | Sep 30, 2022             |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)              | Goodwill       | Terminal  value growth  rate | After-tax  discount rate |\n| Digital Industries              | 8,226          | 1.9%                         | 9.0%                     |\n| Varian of Siemens Healthineers  | 8,134          | 1.9%                         | 8.0%                     |\n| Imaging of Siemens Healthineers | 7,260          | 1.9%                         | 7.5%                     |\n\nRevenue figures in the detailed forecast planning period of the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated are based on average revenue growth rates (excluding portfolio effects) of between 8.3% and 10.3% (7.3% and 9.3% in fiscal 2021).\n\n|                                 | Sep 30, 2021   | Sep 30, 2021                 | Sep 30, 2021             |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)              | Goodwill       | Terminal  value growth  rate | After-tax  discount rate |\n| Varian of Siemens Healthineers  | 7,636          | 1.7%                         | 7.8%                     |\n| Digital Industries              | 7,417          | 1.7%                         | 8.5%                     |\n| Imaging of Siemens Healthineers | 6,525          | 1.7%                         | 7.5%                     |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis for the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated was based on a reduction in after-tax future cash flows by 10% or an increase in after-tax discount rates by one percentage point or a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by one percentage point.

In May 2022, the 2.9% US$1.75 billion fixed-rate instruments were redeemed at face value.\n\n## Assignable and term loans\n\nAs  of  September  30,  2022,  and  2021,  five  bilateral  term  loan  facilities  are  outstanding  (in  aggregate  \u20ac2.1  billion  and  \u20ac1.8  billion, respectively).\n\nIn fiscal 2022, three bilateral term loan facilities were newly signed: one bilateral \u20ac500 million term loan facility maturing in fiscal 2025; one bilateral \u20ac250 million term loan facility maturing in fiscal 2023 with one one-year extension option and one bilateral \u20ac350 million term loan facility maturing in fiscal 2023 with one one-year extension option.\n\nThe bilateral \u20ac500 million term loan facility, the bilateral US$350 million term loan facility and the bilateral US$150 million term loan facility, all maturing in fiscal 2022, were redeemed as due.\n\nThe existing bilateral US$500 million term loan facility (\u20ac513 million) maturing in March 2024 has been extended for one year; there is no extension option remaining. The second bilateral US$500 million term loan facility (\u20ac513 million) has a maturity until June 2024.\n\n## Commercial paper program\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, and 2021, Siemens has a US$9.0 billion (\u20ac9.2 billion and \u20ac7.8 billion as of September 30, 2022 and 2021) commercial paper program in place including US$ extendible notes capabilities. As of September 30, 2022, none were outstanding; as of September 30, 2021, US$15 million (\u20ac13 million) were outstanding. Siemens' commercial papers have a maturity of generally less than 90 days. Interest rates ranged from 0.08% to 3.06% in fiscal 2022 and from 0.05% to 0.21% in fiscal 2021.\n\n## NOTE 17 Post-employment benefits\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe defined benefit plans open to new entrants are based predominantly on contributions made by the Company. Only to a certain extent, those  plans  are  affected  by  longevity,  inflation  and  compensation  increases  and  take  country  specific  differences  into  account.  The Company's major plans are funded with assets in segregated entities. In accordance with local laws these plans are managed in the interest of the beneficiaries by way of contractual trust agreements with each separate legal entity. The defined benefit plans cover 443,000 participants, including 180,000 actives, 84,000 deferreds with vested benefits and 179,000 retirees and surviving dependents.\n\n## Germany\n\nIn  Germany, pension benefits are provided through the following plans: BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans as well as deferred compensation plans. The majority of active employees participate in the BSAV. Those benefits are based predominantly on notional contributions and the return on the corresponding assets of this plan, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the employer. At inception of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation increases. However, the frozen plans still expose Siemens to investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and longevity risk. The pension plans are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA). In Germany no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply.\n\n## U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., the Pension Plans are sponsored by Siemens, which for the most part have been frozen to new entrants and to future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts. Siemens has appointed the Investment Committee as the named fiduciary for the management of the assets of the Plans. The Plans' assets are held in Trusts and the trustees of the Trusts are responsible for the administration  of  the  assets  of  the  Trusts,  taking  directions  from  the  Investment  Committee.  The  Plans  are  subject  to  the  funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA). There is a regulatory requirement to maintain a minimum funding level of 80% in the defined benefit plans in order to avoid benefit restrictions. At their discretion, sponsoring employers may contribute in excess of this regulatory requirement. Annual contributions are calculated by independent actuaries.\n\n## U.K.\n\nPension benefits are mainly offered through the Siemens Benefit Scheme for which, until the start of retirement, an inflation increase of the majority of accrued benefits is mandatory. The required funding is determined by a funding valuation carried out every third year based on legal requirements. Due to deviating guidelines for the determination of the discount rates, the technical funding deficit is usually larger than the IFRS funding deficit. To reduce the deficit Siemens entered into an agreement with the trustees to provide annual payments of \u00a331 (\u20ac36) million until fiscal 2033. The agreement also provides for a cumulative advance payment by Siemens AG compensating the remaining annual payments at the date of early termination of the agreement due to cancellation or insolvency.",

        "page_content": "## Switzerland\n\nFollowing the Swiss law of occupational benefits (BVG) each employer has to grant post-employment benefits for qualifying employees. Accordingly, Siemens in Switzerland sponsors several cash balance plans. These plans are administered by external foundations. The board of the main foundation is composed of equally many employer and employee representatives. The board of the foundation is responsible for investment policy and asset management, as well as for any changes in the plan rules and the determination of contributions to finance the benefits. The Company is required to make total contributions at least as high as the sum of the employee contributions set out in the plan rules. In case of an underfunded plan the Company together with the employees may be asked to pay supplementary contributions according to a well-defined framework of recovery measures.\n\n## Development of the defined benefit plans 1\n\n|                                                                                                    | Defined benefit  obligation   (DBO) 2 (I)   | Defined benefit  obligation   (DBO) 2 (I)   | Fair value of   plan assets  (II)   | Fair value of   plan assets  (II)   | Effects of asset  ceiling   | Effects of asset  ceiling   | Net defined benefit  balance  (I -

Sensitivities reflect changes in the DBO solely for the assumption changed.\n\n## Asset Liability Matching Strategies\n\nAs a significant risk, the Company considers a decline in the plans' funded status due to adverse developments of plan assets and/or defined benefit obligations resulting from changing parameters. Accordingly, Siemens implemented a risk management concept aligned with the defined benefit obligations (Asset Liability Matching). Risk management is based on a worldwide defined risk threshold (Value at Risk). The concept, the Value at Risk and the asset development including the investment strategy are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing basis  under  consultation  of  senior  external  experts.  Independent  asset  managers  are  selected  based  on  quantitative  and  qualitative analyses, which include their performance and risk evaluation. Derivatives are used to reduce risks as part of risk management.",

Multi strategy funds mainly comprise absolute return funds and diversified growth funds that invest in various asset classes within a single fund and aim to stabilize return and reduce volatility. Derivatives predominantly consist of financial instruments for hedging interest rate risk and inflation risk.\n\n## Future cash flows\n\nEmployer contributions expected to be paid to defined benefit plans in fiscal 2023 are \u20ac250 million. Over the next ten fiscal years, average annual benefit payments of \u20ac1,869 million and \u20ac1,754 million, respectively, are expected as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.

Order related losses and risks are provided for anticipated losses and risks on uncompleted construction, sales and leasing contracts.\n\nThe Company is subject to asset retirement obligations related to certain items of property, plant and equipment. Such asset retirement obligations are primarily attributable to environmental clean-up costs and to costs primarily associated with the removal of leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term.\n\nEnvironmental  clean-up  costs  relate  to  remediation  and  environmental  protection  liabilities  which  have  been  accrued  based  on  the estimated costs of decommissioning the site for the production of uranium and mixed-oxide fuel elements in Hanau, Germany (Hanau facilities), as well as for a nuclear research and service center in Karlstein, Germany (Karlstein facilities). In May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal Republic of Germany entered into a contract under public-law, based on which the obligation of final disposal of nuclear waste is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of \u20ac360 million. The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules. Estimation uncertainties still relate to assumptions made to measure the obligations that remain with Siemens AG, regarding conditioning and packaging of nuclear waste, as well as intermediate storage and transport to the final storage facility 'Schacht Konrad' or a logistics depot until year-end 2032. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the provisions total \u20ac487 million and \u20ac507 million, respectively.",

The provisions are for incurred and reported insurance losses as well as for incurred, hence, not yet reported insurance losses as of fiscal year-end. The provision is determined using actuarial standard valuation methodologies, which are parameterized based on historical loss data. Life reinsurance contracts have an average term of 19 years, whereas the cash outflows for the industrial business reinsurance contracts are expected within the next five years. Other also includes provisions for Legal Proceedings, as far as the risks that are subject to such Legal Proceedings are  not  already  covered  by  project  accounting.  Provisions  for  Legal  Proceedings  amounted  to  \u20ac236  million  and  \u20ac251  million  as  of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, \u20ac181 million and \u20ac109 million are included for claims and charges resulting from the construction business. Furthermore, Other includes provision for indemnifications in connection with dispositions of businesses of \u20ac92 million and \u20ac96 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. Such indemnifications may protect the buyer from potential tax, legal and other risks in conjunction with the purchased business.\n\n## NOTE 19 Equity\n\nSiemens' issued capital is divided into 850 million registered shares with no par value and a notional value of \u20ac3.00 per share as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The shares are paid in full. At the Shareholders' Meeting, each share has one vote and accounts for the shareholders' proportionate share in the Company's net income. All shares confer the same rights and obligations.\n\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2021, Siemens repurchased 14,185,791 shares and 976,346 shares, respectively. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, Siemens transferred 4,376,201 and 4,022,053 treasury shares, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company has treasury shares of 57,454,171 and 47,644,581 respectively.\n\nShare  based  payment  expenses  increased  Capital  reserve  by  \u20ac376  million  and  \u20ac294  million  (including  non-controlling  interests), respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021. In connection with the settlement of share based payment awards Siemens treasury shares (at cost) were transferred to employees amounting to \u20ac257 million and \u20ac226 million, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021, which decreased Capital reserve and Retained earnings by \u20ac191 million and \u20ac66 million, respectively in 2022 and by \u20ac165 million and \u20ac61 million in fiscal 2021.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, and 2021, total authorized capital of Siemens AG is \u20ac600 million nominal issuable in installments based on various time-limited authorizations, by issuance of up to 200 million registered shares of no par value. Siemens AG's conditional capital is \u20ac420.6 million or 140.2 million shares as of September 30, 2022 and 2021; which, primarily, can be used to serve convertible bonds or warrants  under  warrant  bonds  that  could  or  can  be  issued  based  on  various  time-limited  authorizations  approved  by  the  respective Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nDividends paid per share were \u20ac4.00 and \u20ac3.50, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021. The Managing Board and the Supervisory Board propose to distribute a dividend of \u20ac4.25 per share to holders entitled to dividends, in total representing approximately \u20ac3.4 billion in expected payments. Payment of the proposed dividend is contingent upon approval at the Shareholders' Meeting on February 9, 2023.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, Siemens launched a new five-year share buyback program of up to \u20ac3 billion.\n\n## NOTE 20 Additional capital disclosures\n\nA key consideration of our capital structure management is to maintain ready access to capital markets through various debt instruments and to sustain our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. In order to achieve our target, Siemens intends to maintain an Industrial net debt divided by EBITDA (continuing operations) ratio of up to 1.5 for fiscal 2022 and beyond in accordance with our Financial Framework and a ratio of up to 1.0 as of September 2021 and prior periods. The ratio indicates the approximate number of years that would be needed to cover the Industrial net debt through Income from continuing operations, excluding interest, other financial income (expenses), taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairments. The fiscal 2021 ratio is disclosed as computed in the prior year.",

Additionally, credit guarantees are issued in the course of the SFS business. Credit guarantees generally provide that in the event of default or non-payment by the primary debtor, Siemens will be required to settle such financial obligations. The maximum amount of these guarantees is equal to the outstanding balance of the credit or, in case a credit line is subject to variable utilization, the nominal amount of the credit line. These guarantees have typically residual terms of up to four years. The Company held collateral mainly through inventories and trade receivables. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, Credit guarantees include \u20ac123 million and \u20ac124 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy. Siemens accrued \u20ac2 million and \u20ac3 million relating to credit guarantees as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nFurthermore,  Siemens  issues  performance  guarantees,  which  mainly  include  performance  bonds.  In  the  event  of  non-fulfillment  of contractual obligations by the primary obligor, Siemens will be required to pay up to an agreed-upon maximum amount. These agreements typically have terms of up to ten years. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, Performance guarantees include \u20ac8,562 million and \u20ac14,508 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy; the related contract liability amount for parent company",

As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company accrued \u20ac54 million and \u20ac51 million, respectively, relating to performance guarantees.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, and 2021, in addition to guarantees disclosed in the table above, there are contingent liabilities of \u20ac421 million and \u20ac475 million which mainly result from other guarantees, legal proceedings and from joint and several liabilities of consortia, in particular from the construction of a power plant in Finland. Other guarantees include \u20ac99 million and \u20ac189 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.\n\n## NOTE 22 Legal proceedings\n\n## Proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations\n\nAs previously reported, in July 2008, Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A. (OTE) filed a lawsuit against Siemens AG with the district court of Munich, Germany, seeking to compel Siemens AG to disclose the outcome of its internal investigations with respect to OTE. OTE seeks to obtain information with respect to allegations of undue influence and/or acts of bribery in connection with contracts concluded between Siemens AG and OTE from calendar 1992 to 2006. At the end of July 2010, OTE expanded its claim and requested payment of damages by Siemens AG of at least \u20ac57 million to OTE for alleged bribery payments to OTE employees. In October 2014, OTE increased its damage claim to the amount of at least \u20ac68 million. Siemens AG continues to defend itself against the expanded claim.\n\nAs previously reported, in May 2014, the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo initiated a lawsuit against Siemens Ltda. as well as other companies and several individuals claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL2.5 billion (approximately \u20ac476 million as of September 2022) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train refurbishment contracts entered into between 2008 and 2011. In January 2015, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted a lawsuit of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo and two customers against Siemens Ltda., Siemens AG and other companies and individuals claiming damages in an unspecified amount. In March 2015, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted a lawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and other companies claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL487 million (approximately \u20ac93 million as of September 2022) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train maintenance contracts entered into in 2000 and 2002. In September 2015, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted another lawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and other companies  claiming,  inter  alia,  damages  in  an  amount  of  BRL918  million  (approximately  \u20ac175  million  as  of  September  2022)  plus adjustments  for  inflation  and  related  interest  in  relation  to  train  maintenance  contracts  entered  into  in  2006  and  2007.  Siemens  is defending itself against these actions. It cannot be excluded that further significant damage claims will be brought by customers or the state against Siemens.\n\nAs previously reported, in June 2015, Siemens Ltda. appealed to the Supreme Court against a decision of a previous court to suspend Siemens Ltda. from participating in public tenders and signing contracts with public administrations in Brazil for a five year term based on alleged irregularities in calendar 1999 and 2004 in public tenders with the Brazilian Postal authority. In June 2018, the court accepted Siemens' appeal and declared the earlier instance decision as void. In June 2021, the court referred the case back to the court of first instance. In February 2018, the Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico in Brasilia filed a lawsuit based on the same set of facts, mainly claiming the exclusion of Siemens Ltda. from public tenders for a ten year term. Siemens Ltda. is defending itself against the lawsuit. Siemens Ltda. is currently not excluded from participating in public tenders.\n\nSiemens is involved in numerous Legal Proceedings in various jurisdictions. These Legal Proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. In addition, further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be extended. Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates.\n\nSome of these Legal Proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens, which may have material effects on its business activities as well as its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nFor Legal Proceedings information required under IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets is not disclosed if the Company concludes that disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the matter.",

Fair value of debt instruments, is either based on prices provided by price service agencies or is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market interest rates.\n\nFair values of derivative financial instruments are determined in accordance with the specific type of instrument. Fair values of derivative interest rate contracts are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument. Interest rate futures are valued based on quoted market prices, if available. Fair values of foreign currency derivatives are based on forward exchange rates. Options are generally valued based on quoted market prices or based on option pricing models. No compensating effects from underlying transactions (e.g. firm commitments and forecast transactions) are considered.\n\nThe Company limits default risks resulting from derivative financial instruments by generally transacting with financial institutions with a minimum credit rating of investment grade. Based on Siemens' net risk exposure towards the counterparty, the resulting credit risk is considered via a credit valuation adjustment.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, and 2021, Level 3 financial assets include venture capital investments of \u20ac607 million and \u20ac515 million (Next47 investments).

Reclassifications of foreign currency risk hedges with operative business purposes are presented as functional costs. Costs of hedging reserve is the forward element of forward contracts that are not designated as hedge accounting and which are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis as the hedged item is time-period related.\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate risk management\n\n## Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship\n\nThe  Company  manages  its  risks  associated  with  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  denominated  receivables,  payables,  debt,  firm commitments and forecast transactions primarily through a Company-wide portfolio approach. Under this approach the Company-wide risks are aggregated centrally, and various derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and options, are utilized to minimize such risks. Such a strategy does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The Company also accounts for foreign currency derivatives, which are embedded in sale and purchase contracts.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Company's operating units apply hedge accounting to certain significant forecast transactions and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Particularly, the Company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of variability of future cash flows resulting from forecast sales and purchases as well as firm commitments. The risk mainly results from contracts denominated in US$ both from Siemens' operating units entering into long-term contracts e.g. from the project business and from the standard product business. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, the risk is hedged against the euro at an average rate of 1.2293 \u20ac/US$ and 1.2808 \u20ac/US$ (forward purchases of US$), respectively and 1.0258 \u20ac/US$ and 1.2070 \u20ac/US$ (forward sales of US$). As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the hedging transactions have an average remaining maturity until 2027 and 2026 (forward purchases of US$) as well as 2023 and 2022 (forward sales of US$).",

        "page_content": "Included are Siemens' foreign currency forward contracts, entered into in fiscal 2021, to hedge foreign currency risks relating to US$10 billion (\u20ac10 billion) bonds granted to Siemens Healthineers, through which a synthetic Euro financing structure is achieved. It factually, also turns interest into \u20ac with volume weighted average interest rates of currently about 0.3% and 0.3%, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Interest rate risk management\n\n## Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship\n\nInterest rate risk management relating to the Group, excluding SFS' businesses, uses derivative financial instruments under a portfoliobased approach to manage interest risk actively. Interest rate management of the SFS and businesses remains to be managed separately, considering the term structure of SFS' financial assets and liabilities on a portfolio basis. Neither approach qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. Net cash receipts and payments in connection with interest rate swap agreements are recorded as interest expense in Other financial income (expenses), net.\n\n## Cash flow hedges of floating-rate commercial papers\n\nSiemens applies cash flow hedge accounting to a revolving portfolio of floating-rate commercial papers of nominal US$200 million. Siemens  pays  a  fixed  rate  of  interest  and  receives  a  variable  rate  of  interest,  offsetting  future  changes  in  interest  payments  of  the underlying floating-rate commercial papers. Net cash receipts and payments are recorded as interest expenses. The Company had interest rate swap contracts to receive variable rates of interest of an average of 3.64% and 0.13%, respectively, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and paid fixed rates of interest at an average rate of 1.95% and 1.95%, respectively, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt obligations\n\nUnder interest rate swap agreements outstanding in fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company agreed to pay a variable rate of interest multiplied by a notional principal amount, and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest multiplied by the same notional principal amount. These interest rate swap agreements offset future changes in interest rates designated as hedged risk on the fair value of the underlying fixed-rate debt obligations. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the carrying amounts of \u20ac10,718 million and \u20ac6,305 million,  respectively,  of  fixed-rate  debt  obligations  are  designated  in  fair  value  hedges,  including  \u20ac(973)  million  and  \u20ac304  million cumulative fair value hedge adjustments. Unamortized fair value hedge adjustments of \u20ac169 million and \u20ac181 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, relate to no longer applied hedge accounting. The amounts are amortized over the remaining term of the underlying debt, maturing until 2042. Carrying amount adjustments to debt of \u20ac1,273 million and \u20ac236 million, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021 are included in Other financial income (expenses), net; the related swap agreements resulted in gains (losses) of \u20ac(1,236) million and \u20ac(243) million, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Net cash receipts and payments relating to such interest rate swap agreements are recorded as interest expenses.\n\nThe Company had interest rate swap contracts to pay variable rates of interest of an average of 0.86% and (0.14)% as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively and received fixed rates of interest (average rate of 1.07% and 1.50%, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively). The notional amount of indebtedness hedged as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was \u20ac11,719 million and \u20ac6,007 million, respectively. This changed 26% and 15% of the Company's underlying notes and bonds from fixed interest rates into variable interest rates as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The notional amounts of these contracts mature at varying dates based on the maturity of the underlying hedged items. The net fair value of interest rate swap contracts (excluding accrued interest) used to hedge indebtedness as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was \u20ac(959) million and \u20ac277 million, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 25 Financial risk management\n\nIncreasing  market  fluctuations  may  result  in  significant  earnings  and  cash  flow  volatility  risk  for  Siemens.  The  Company's  operating business as well as its investment and financing activities are affected particularly by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. In order to optimize the allocation of financial resources across Siemens' segments and entities, as well as to achieve its aims, Siemens identifies, analyzes and manages the associated market risks. The Company seeks to manage and control these risks primarily through its regular operating and financing activities and uses derivative financial instruments when deemed appropriate.\n\nIn  order  to  quantify  market  risks  Siemens  has  implemented  a  system  based  on  Value  at  Risk  (VaR),  which  is  also  used  for  internal management of Corporate Treasury activities. The VaR figures are calculated based on historical volatilities and correlations of various risk factors, a ten day holding period, and a 99.5% confidence level.\n\nActual results that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income may differ  substantially  from  VaR  figures  due  to  fundamental  conceptual  differences.  While  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are prepared in accordance with IFRS, the VaR figures are the output of a model with a purely financial perspective and represent the potential financial loss, which will not be exceeded within ten days with a probability of 99.5%. Although VaR is an important tool for measuring market risk, the assumptions on which the model is based give rise to some limitations including the following. A ten day holding period assumes that it is possible to dispose of the underlying positions within this period. This may not be valid during continuing periods of illiquid markets. A 99.5% confidence level means that there is a 0.5% statistical probability that losses could exceed the calculated VaR. The use of historical data as a basis for estimating the statistic behavior of the relevant markets and finally determining the possible range of the future outcomes on the basis of this statistic behavior may not always cover all possible scenarios, especially those of an exceptional nature.\n\nAny market sensitive instruments, including equity and interest-bearing investments that our Company's pension plans hold are not included in the following quantitative and qualitative disclosures.",

        "page_content": "## Foreign currency exchange rate risk\n\n## Transaction risk\n\nEach Siemens unit conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to future cash flows denominated in a currency other than its functional currency is exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the ordinary course of business, Siemens units are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective currencies as well as production activities and other contributions along the value chain in the local markets.\n\nOperating  units  are  prohibited  from  borrowing  or  investing  in  foreign  currencies  on  a  speculative  basis.  Intercompany  financing  or investments of operating units are preferably carried out in their functional currency or on a hedged basis.\n\nAccording to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. Foreign currency transaction exposure of Siemens units from contracted business and cash balances in foreign currency is generally hedged approximately by 100% with Corporate Treasury. Foreign currency transaction exposure of Siemens units from planned business above defined thresholds has to be hedged with Corporate Treasury within a band of 75% to 100% for a hedging period of at least three months.\n\nGenerally, the operating units conclude their hedging activities internally with Corporate Treasury. By applying a cost-optimizing portfolio approach, Corporate Treasury itself hedges foreign currency exchange rate risks with external counterparties and limits them.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the VaR relating to foreign currency exchange rates was \u20ac126 million and \u20ac39 million. This VaR was calculated under consideration of items of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in addition to firm commitments, which are denominated in foreign currencies, as well as foreign currency denominated cash flows from forecast transactions for the following twelve months. The increase in the VaR resulted mainly from a higher net foreign currency position after hedging activities and a higher volatility, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the euro.\n\n## Translation risk\n\nMany Siemens units are located outside the Eurozone. Because the financial reporting currency of Siemens is the euro, the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into euro for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. To consider the effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is that investments in foreign-based operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous. Effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amounts into euro are reflected in the Company's consolidated equity position.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different. In order to manage the Company's position with regard to interest rate risk, interest income and interest expenses, Corporate Treasury performs a comprehensive corporate interest rate risk management by using fixed or variable interest rates from bond issuances and derivative financial instruments when appropriate. The interest rate risk relating to the Group, excluding SFS' business, is mitigated by managing interest rate risk within an integrated Asset Liability Management approach. The interest rate risk relating to SFS' business is managed separately, considering the term structure of financial assets and liabilities. The Company's interest rate risk results primarily from funding in the U.S. dollar, British pound and euro.\n\nIf  there  are  no  conflicting  country-specific  regulations,  all  Siemens  operating  units  generally  obtain  any  required  financing  through Corporate Treasury in the form of loans or intercompany clearing accounts. The same concept is adopted for deposits of cash generated by the units.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the VaR relating to the interest rate was \u20ac864 million and \u20ac529 million. The increase was driven mainly by a higher interest rate volatility for the U.S. dollar and the euro.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk results from the Company's inability to meet its financial liabilities. Siemens follows a deliberated financing policy that is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. Siemens mitigates liquidity risk  by  the  implementation  of  effective  working  capital  and  cash  management,  arranged  credit  facilities  with  highly  rated  financial institutions, via a debt issuance program and via a global multi-currency commercial paper program. Liquidity risk may also be mitigated by the Siemens Bank GmbH, which increases the flexibility of depositing cash or refinancing.\n\nIn addition, Siemens constantly monitors funding options available in the capital markets, as well as trends in the availability and costs of such funding, with a view to maintaining financial flexibility and limiting repayment risks.\n\nThe following table reflects our contractually fixed pay-offs for settlement, repayments and interest. The disclosed expected undiscounted net cash outflows from derivative financial liabilities are determined based on each particular settlement date of an instrument and based on the earliest date on which Siemens could be required to pay. Cash outflows for financial liabilities (including interest) without fixed amount or timing are based on the conditions existing at September 30, 2022.",

Hence, credit risks are determined by the solvency of the debtors, the recoverability of the collaterals, the success of projects we invested in and the global economic development.\n\nThe effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a core competency of our risk management system. In this context, Siemens has implemented a binding credit policy.\n\nSiemens maintains a Credit Risk Intelligence Unit to which numerous operating units from the Siemens Group regularly transfer business partner data as a basis for a centralized internal rating and credit limit recommendation process. Due to the identification, quantification and active management of credit risks, this increases credit risk transparency.\n\nRatings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating methodologies, with information obtained from customers, external rating agencies, data service providers and Siemens' credit default experiences. Internal ratings consider appropriate forward-looking  information  relevant  to  the  specific  financial  instrument  like  expected  changes  in  the  debtor's  financial  position, ownership, management or operational risks, as well as broader forward-looking information, such as expected macroeconomic, industryrelated and competitive developments. The ratings also consider a country-specific risk component derived from external country credit ratings. Ratings and credit limits for financial institutions as well as Siemens' public and private customers, which are determined by internal  risk  assessment  specialists,  are  continuously  updated  and  considered  for  investments  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  in determining the conditions under which direct or indirect financing will be offered to customers.\n\nAn exposure is considered defaulted if the debtor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit obligations. A range of internally defined events trigger a default rating, including the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, receivables being more than 90 days past due, or a default rating by an external rating agency.\n\nTo analyze and monitor credit risks, the Company applies various systems and processes. A main element is a central IT application that processes data from operating units together with rating and default information and calculates an estimate, which may be used as a basis for individual bad debt provisions. Additionally, qualitative information is considered to particularly incorporate the latest developments.\n\nThe carrying amount is the maximum exposure to a financial asset's credit risk, without taking account of any collateral. Collateral reduces the valuation allowance to the extent it mitigates credit risk. Collateral needs to be specific, identifiable and legally enforceable to be taken into account. Those collaterals are mostly held in the portfolio of SFS.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, collateral of \u20ac1,444 million and \u20ac748 million, respectively, relate to financial assets measured at fair value.  Those  collaterals  are  provided  in  connection  with  netting  agreements  for  derivatives  providing  protection  from  the  risk  of  a counterparty's  insolvency.  As  of  September  30,  2022  and  2021,  collateral  held  for  credit-impaired  receivables  from  finance  leases amounted to \u20ac53 million and \u20ac90 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, collateral held for financial assets measured at amortized cost amounted to \u20ac3,817 million and \u20ac3,328 million, respectively, including \u20ac108 million and \u20ac46 million, respectively, for credit-impaired loans in SFS' asset finance business. Those collaterals mainly comprised property, plant and equipment. Credit risks arising from irrevocable loan commitments are equal to the expected future pay-offs resulting from these commitments.\n\nSFS'  external  financing  portfolio  disaggregates  into  credit  risk  rating  grades  as  of  September  30,  2022  as  follows  (pre  valuation allowances):\n\n|                              | Loans and other debt   instruments under the general   | Loans and other debt   instruments under the general   | Loans and other debt   instruments under the general   | Financial guarantees and  loan commitments   | Financial guarantees and  loan commitments   | Financial guarantees and  loan commitments   | Lease Re- ceivables   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)           | Stage 1                                                | Stage 2                                                | Stage 3                                                | Stage 1                                      | Stage 2                                      | Stage 3                                      |                       |\n| Investment Grade Ratings     | 6,134                                                  | 4                                                      | n/a                                                    | 729                                          | n/a                                          | n/a                                          | 2,257                 |\n| Non-Investment Grade Ratings | 16,382                                                 | 702                                                    | 640                                                    | 3,182                                        | 56                                           | 53                                           | 3,678                 |",

        "page_content": "Trade receivables of operating units are generally rated internally; as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, approximately 45% and 47%, respectively,  have  an  investment  grade  rating  and  55%  and  53%,  respectively,  have  a  non-investment  grade  rating.  Contract  assets generally show similar risk characteristics as trade receivables in operating units.\n\nAmounts  above  do  not  represent  economic  credit  risk,  since  they  consider  neither  collateral  held  nor  valuation  allowances  already recognized.\n\n## Equity Price Risk\n\nSiemens' investment portfolio consists of direct and indirect investments in publicly traded companies that are classified as long term investments. These investments are monitored based on their current market value, affected primarily by fluctuations on the volatile technology-related markets worldwide. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the market value of Siemens' portfolio, which mainly consists of one investment in a publicly traded company, was \u20ac339 million and \u20ac678 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the VaR relating to the equity price was \u20ac74 million and \u20ac105 million.\n\n## NOTE 26 Share-based payment\n\nShare-based payment awards may be settled in newly issued shares of capital stock of Siemens AG, in treasury shares or in cash. Sharebased payment awards may forfeit if the employment of the beneficiary terminates prior to the expiration of the vesting period. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, expense from equity-settled awards on a continuing basis are \u20ac377 million and \u20ac294 million; cash-settled awards on a continuing basis resulted in gains (expenses) of \u20ac12 million and \u20ac(8) million in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Included is expense of \u20ac160 million and \u20ac137 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting from various individually immaterial plans, of which \u20ac110 million and \u20ac74 million, respectively, stem from Siemens Healthineers plans. Siemens Healthineers plans are largely similar to Siemens' plans, except for granting Siemens Healthineers AG shares.\n\n## Stock Awards\n\nThe Company grants stock awards to members of the Managing Board, members of the senior management and other eligible employees. Stock awards entitle the beneficiary to Siemens shares without payment of consideration at the end of the vesting period. The vesting period for awards granted to members of the senior management in fiscal 2022 is three years and four years for awards granted prior to fiscal 2022. Awards granted to members of the Managing Board are subject to a four year vesting period.\n\nStock awards are tied to performance criteria. For stock awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021, 80% of the target amount is linked to the relative total shareholder return of Siemens compared to the total shareholder return of the MSCI World Industrials sector index (TSRTarget); the remaining 20% are linked to a Siemens internal sustainability target considering environmental, social and governance targets (ESG-Target). The annual target amount for stock awards up to and including tranche 2019 is linked to the share price performance of Siemens relative to the share price performance of five important competitors. The target attainment for each individual performance criteria ranges between 0% and 200%. For awards granted since fiscal 2019 settlement is in shares only corresponding to the actual target attainment. Awards granted prior to fiscal 2019, target outperformances in excess of 100% are settled in cash.\n\n## Commitments to members of the Managing Board\n\nThe Managing Board's stock awards are based on criteria described above. Fair values are \u20ac10 million and \u20ac12 million, respectively, in fiscal  2022  and  2021,  calculated  by  applying  a  valuation  model.  In  fiscal  2022  and  2021,  inputs  to  that  model  include  an  expected weighted volatility of Siemens shares of 24.41% and 24.30%, respectively, and a market price of \u20ac153.34 and \u20ac112.70 per Siemens share. Expected volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities. The model applies a risk-free interest rate of up to (0.15)% and (0.49)%  in  fiscal  2022  and  2021,  respectively,  and  an  expected  dividend  yield  of  2.61%  in  fiscal  2022  and  3.10%  in  fiscal  2021. Assumptions relating to correlations between the Siemens share price and the development of the MSCI index were derived from historic observations of share price and index changes.\n\n## Commitments to members of the senior management and other eligible employees\n\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2021, 1,459,182 and 1,975,492 equity-settled stock awards were granted relating to the TSR-Target with a fair value of \u20ac106 million and \u20ac104 million, respectively. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, 365,610 and 493,472 equity-settled stock awards were granted relating to the ESG-Target with a fair value of \u20ac51 million and \u20ac48 million, respectively.\n\nThe fair value of stock awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021 (TSR-related) was calculated applying a valuation model. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, inputs to that model include an expected weighted volatility of Siemens shares of 24.41% and 24.34%, respectively, and a share price per Siemens share of \u20ac153.58 and \u20ac112.36. Expected volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities. The model applies a risk-free interest rate of up to (0.23)% in fiscal 2022 and up to (0.49)% in fiscal 2021 and an expected dividend yield of 2.61% and 3.11% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Assumptions relating to correlations between the Siemens share price and the development of the MSCI Index were derived from historic observations of share price and index changes. The fair value of the ESG component of \u20ac140.52 and \u20ac97.63 per share in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, was determined as the market price of Siemens shares less the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period.",

The shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter. Plan participants receive the right to one Siemens share without payment of consideration (matching share) for every three investment shares continuously held over a period of about three years (vesting period) provided the plan participant has been continuously employed by Siemens until the end of the vesting period.\n\n## Monthly Investment Plan\n\nUnder the Monthly Investment Plan employees other than senior managers may invest a specified part of their compensation in Siemens shares on a monthly basis over a period of twelve months. Shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date once a month. If the Managing Board decides that shares acquired under the Monthly Investment Plan are transferred to the Share Matching Plan, plan participants will receive the right to matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above with a vesting period of about two years. The Managing Board decided that shares acquired under the tranches issued in fiscal 2021 and 2020 are transferred to the Share Matching Plan as of February 2022 and February 2021, respectively.\n\n## Base Share Program\n\nUnder the Base Share Program employees of Siemens AG and participating domestic Siemens companies may invest a fixed amount of their compensation in Siemens shares, sponsored by Siemens. The shares are bought at market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter and grant the right to receive matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above. The fair value of the Base Share Program amounted to \u20ac24 million and \u20ac25 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## Resulting Matching Shares:\n\n|                                  | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                  | 2022          | 2021          |\n| Outstanding, beginning of period | 1,389,016     | 1,509,046     |\n| Granted                          | 557,839       | 654,483       |\n| Vested and fulfilled             | (573.440)     | (624,480)     |\n| Forfeited                        | (64,030)      | (80,385)      |\n| Settled                          | (53,561)      | (69,648)      |\n| Outstanding, end of period       | 1,255,825     | 1,389,016     |\n\nThe weighted average fair value of matching shares granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021 of \u20ac121.35 and \u20ac96.92 per share, respectively, was determined as the market price of Siemens shares less the present value of expected dividends; non-vesting conditions were taken into account.\n\n## Jubilee Share Program\n\nFor their 25th and 40th service anniversary eligible employees receive jubilee shares. There were 3.11 million and 3.15 million entitlements to jubilee shares outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Description of reportable segments\n\nDigital Industries offers a comprehensive product portfolio and system solutions for automation used in discrete and process industries, complemented by product lifecycle and data-driven services,\n\nSmart Infrastructure offers products, systems, solutions, services and software to support a sustainable transition from fossil to renewable energy sources, as well as a transition to smarter, more sustainable buildings and communities,\n\nMobility combines all Siemens businesses in the area of passenger and freight transportation, including rail vehicles, rail automation systems, rail electrification systems, road traffic technology, digital and cloud-based solutions and related services,\n\nSiemens Healthineers provides healthcare solutions and services. It develops, manufactures, and sells a diverse range of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic products and services to healthcare providers.\n\nSiemens Financial Services provides financing solutions to Siemens' customers and other companies via debt and equity investments, offering leasing, lending and working capital financing solutions, equipment and project financing and financial advisory services.\n\n## Portfolio Companies (POC)\n\nPortfolio  Companies comprise  businesses  which  deliver  a  broad  range  of  customized  and  application-specific  products,  software, solutions, systems and services for different industries including oil and gas, chemical, mining, cement, logistics, energy, marine, water and fiber.\n\n## Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nTo better address our investors' needs, individual line items of our Profit and Asset reconciliations are displayed in a new structure since fiscal 2022. Essentially, the previous line item Corporate items is split into Governance, Innovation and into financing and other items. The latter  were  combined  with  our  previous  Eliminations,  Corporate  Treasury  and  other  reconciling  items  and  renamed  to  Financing, eliminations and other items. Content and measurement principles of reconciling items mainly remained unchanged. Prior period amounts conform to the current period disclosure.\n\nSiemens Energy Investment -  includes our investment in Siemens Energy accounted for using the equity method, and previously, a smaller investment in connection with Siemens Energy sold in fiscal 2022.\n\nSiemens Real Estate (SRE) - manages the Group's real estate business portfolio, operates the properties, and is responsible for building projects and the purchase and sale of real estate; excluded is the carved-out real estate of Siemens Healthineers.\n\nInnovation - mainly includes results from our units Technology and Next47.\n\nGovernance - primarily includes Siemens brand fees and governance costs, group managing costs, IT and corporate services.\n\nCentrally carried pension expense - includes the Company's pension related income (expense) not allocated to the segments, POC or Siemens Real Estate.\n\nFinancing, eliminations and other items - comprise activities of Advanta and Global Business Services, results from corporate projects, equity interests and activities generally intended for closure as well as activities remaining from divestments, consolidation of transactions within the segments, certain reconciliation and reclassification items as well as central financing activities. It also includes interest income and expense, such as, for example, interest not allocated to segments or POC (referred to as financing interest), interest related to central financing activities or resulting consolidation and reconciliation effects on interest.\n\n## Measurement - Segments\n\nAccounting policies for Segment information are generally the same as those used for the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment information is disclosed for continuing operations; prior year Assets are reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. For internal and segment reporting purposes intercompany lease transactions, however, are classified as operating leases by the lessor and are accounted for off-balance sheet by the lessee (except for intercompany leases with Siemens Healthineers as lessees). Intersegment transactions are based on market prices.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue includes revenue from contracts with customers and revenue from leasing activities. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, lease revenue is \u20ac1,104 million and \u20ac1,050 million, respectively. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, Digital industries recognized \u20ac4,691 million and \u20ac4,290 million revenue, respectively, from its software business, Smart Infrastructure recognized \u20ac3,799 million and \u20ac3,387 million in its service business. Revenues of Mobility are mainly derived from construction-type business.\n\n## Profit\n\nSiemens' Managing Board is responsible for assessing the performance of the segments (chief operating decision maker). The Company's profitability measure of the segments except for SFS is earnings before interest, certain pension costs, income taxes and amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations as determined by the chief operating decision maker (Profit). The major categories of items excluded from Profit are described below.\n\nInterest income (expenses) are excluded from Profit. Decision-making regarding financing is typically made at the corporate level.\n\nDecisions on essential pension items are made centrally. Accordingly, Profit primarily includes amounts related to service cost of pension plans only, while all other regularly recurring pension related costs are included in reconciliations in line item Centrally carried pension expense.",

        "page_content": "Amortization  expenses  of  intangible  assets  acquired  in  business  combinations  are  not  part  of  Profit.  Furthermore,  income  taxes  are excluded from Profit since income tax is subject to legal structures, which typically do not correspond to the structure of the segments. The effect of certain litigation and compliance issues is excluded from Profit, if such items are not indicative of performance. This may also be the case for items that refer to more than one reportable segment, SRE and (or) POC or have a corporate or central character. Costs for support functions are primarily allocated to the segments.\n\n## Profit of the segment SFS\n\nIn contrast to performance measurement principles applied to other segments, interest income and expenses are included, since interest is an important source of revenue and expense of SFS.\n\n## Asset measurement principles\n\nManagement determined Assets (Net capital employed) as a measure to assess capital intensity of the segments except for SFS. Its definition corresponds to the Profit measure except for amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations which are not part of Profit, however, the related intangible assets are included in the segments' Assets. Segment Assets is based on Total assets of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, primarily excluding intragroup financing receivables, tax related assets and assets of discontinued operations, since the corresponding positions are excluded from Profit. The remaining assets are reduced by noninterest-bearing liabilities other than tax related liabilities, e.g. trade payables, to derive Assets. In contrast, Assets of SFS is Total assets. In individual cases assets of Mobility include project-specific intercompany financing of long-term projects. Assets of Siemens Healthineers include real estate, while real estate of all other segments is carried at SRE.\n\n## Orders\n\nOrders are determined principally as estimated revenue of accepted purchase orders for which enforceable rights and obligations exist as well as subsequent order value changes and adjustments, excluding letters of intent. To determine orders, Siemens considers termination rights and customer's creditworthiness.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, and 2021, order backlog totaled \u20ac102 billion and \u20ac85 billion (continuing operations); thereof Digital Industries \u20ac14 billion and \u20ac7 billion, Smart Infrastructure \u20ac15 billion and \u20ac11 billion, Mobility \u20ac36 billion and \u20ac36 billion and Siemens Healthineers \u20ac34 billion and \u20ac27 billion. In fiscal 2023, Siemens expects to convert approximately \u20ac45 billion of the September 30, 2022 order backlog into  revenue;  thereof  at  Digital  Industries  approximately  \u20ac11  billion,  Smart  Infrastructure  approximately  \u20ac10  billion,  Mobility approximately \u20ac10 billion and Siemens Healthineers approximately \u20ac12 billion.\n\n## Free cash flow definition\n\nFree cash flow of the segments constitutes cash flows from operating activities less additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Except for SFS, it excludes financing interest, except for cases where interest on qualifying assets is capitalized or classified as contract costs; it also excludes income tax as well as certain other payments and proceeds. Free cash flow of SFS includes related financing interest payments and proceeds; income tax payments and proceeds of SFS are excluded. In individual cases, free cash flow of Mobility includes project-specific intercompany financing of long-term projects.\n\n## Amortization, depreciation and impairments\n\nAmortization,  depreciation  and  impairments  includes  depreciation  and  impairments  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  as  well  as amortization and impairments of intangible assets each net of reversals of impairment.\n\n## Measurement - POC and Siemens Real Estate\n\nPOC follows the measurement principles of the segments except for SFS. Siemens Real Estate applies the measurement principles of SFS.\n\n## Additional segment information\n\nMobility was burdened by a negative effect on profit of \u20ac0.6 billion for winding down business activities in Russia; it includes a net impact from and in connection with contracts with customers in Russia of \u20ac(0.4) billion as well as the impairment of an investment accounted for using the equity method of \u20ac0.2 billion. Siemens Financial Services incurred pre-tax losses of \u20ac0.2 billion and Financing, eliminations and other items pre-tax losess of \u20ac0.5 billion at Corporate Treasury, in connection with the sale of Siemens' financing and leasing business in Russia at the end of fiscal 2022.\n\n## Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nProfit\n\n|                                                                     | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                  | 2022          | 2021          |\n| Siemens Energy Investment                                           | (2,911)       | (396)         |\n| Siemens Real Estate                                                 | 118           | 94            |\n| Innovation                                                          | (190)         | (207)         |\n| Governance                                                          | (582)         | (751)         |\n| Centrally carried pension expense                                   | (113)         | (170)         |\n| Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations | (990)         | (738)         |\n| Financing, eliminations and other items                             | (474)         | 452           |\n| Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements                 | (5,141)       | (1,717)       |",

In  addition,  we  have  audited  the  group  management  report  of  Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the last paragraph of chapter 1 beginning with 'Disclosures in accordance with EU taxonomy' of the group management report, the sections '8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM' and '8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)' in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report as well as the content of the Corporate Governance Statement which is published on the website stated in the combined management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- \u00b7 the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  comply,  in  all  material  respects,  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB ['Handelsgesetzbuch': German Commercial Code] as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as of September 30, 2022 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022, and\n- \u00b7 the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the group management report does not cover the last paragraph in chapter 1 beginning with 'Disclosures in accordance with EU taxonomy' of the group management report, the sections '8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM' and '8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)' in chapter 8.5 of the group management report and the content of the Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nPursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n## Basis for the opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as 'EU Audit Regulation') and in compliance with German Generally Accepted  Standards  for  Financial  Statement  Audits  promulgated  by  the  Institut  der  Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer  [Institute  of  Public  Auditors  in Germany] (IDW). In conducting the audit of the consolidated financial statements we also complied with International Standards on Auditing  (ISA).  Our  responsibilities  under  those  requirements,  principles  and  standards  are  further  described  in  the  'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Art. 10 (2) f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art. 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n## Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:\n\n## Revenue recognition on construction-type contracts\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The Group conducts a significant portion of its business under construction-type contracts, particularly in the Mobility business. Revenue from long-term construction-type contracts is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, generally over time under the percentage-of-completion method. We consider the accounting for construction-type contracts to be an area posing a significant risk of material misstatement (including the potential  risk  of  management  override  of  internal  controls)  and  accordingly  a  key  audit  matter,  because  management's  assessments significantly impact the determination of the extent of progress towards completion. These assessments include, in particular, the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill contractually defined obligations, total estimated contract costs, remaining costs to completion and total estimated contract revenues, as well as contract risks including technical, political, regulatory and legal risks.",

    {
        "page_content": "Revenues, total estimated contract costs and profit recognition may deviate significantly from original estimates based on new knowledge about cost overruns and changes in project scope over the term of a construction-type contract.\n\nThe sanctions imposed as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the management's decision to wind down the affected businesses have restricted the fulfilment of existing construction-type contracts with Russian customers. The accounting for risks from these contracts is associated with increased uncertainty and complexity, especially with regards to the management's assessments on implications from contract terminations.\n\nFurthermore,  the  effects  of  the  coronavirus  pandemic  (COVID-19)  as  well  as  current  macroeconomic  developments  on  the  project business, such as delays in project execution, price increases or disruptions in supply chains as well as change in law clauses with regards to compensation for damages or contractual penalties for delays in delivery and their accounting treatment were of key significance for our audit.\n\nAuditor's response: As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding of the Group's internally established methods, processes and control mechanisms for project management in the bid and execution phase of construction-type contracts. In this regard, we assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the accounting-related internal controls in the project business by obtaining an understanding of  business  transactions  specific  to  construction-type  contracts,  from  the  initiation  of  the  transaction  through  presentation  in  the consolidated financial statements. We also tested controls addressing the timely assessment of changes in cost estimates and the timely and complete recognition of such changes in the project calculation.\n\nAs  part  of  our  substantive  audit  procedures,  which  particularly  involved  project  reviews,  we  evaluated  management's  estimates  and assumptions based on a risk-based selection of a sample of contracts. Our sample primarily included projects that are subject to significant future uncertainties and risks, such as projects with complex safety/technical and regulatory requirements or projects with a large portion of  materials  and  services  to  be  provided  by  suppliers  or  consortium  partners,  fixed-price  or  turnkey  projects,  cross-border  projects, especially projects with Russian customers, projects affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and projects with changes in cost estimates, delays and/or low or negative margins.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, review of the contracts and their terms and conditions including contractually agreed partial deliveries and services, termination rights, penalties for delay and breach of contract, liquidated damages as well as joint and several liability.  In  order  to  evaluate  whether  revenues  were recognized on an accrual basis for the selected projects, we analyzed revenues attributable to the fiscal year and corresponding cost of sales to be recognized in the statement of income considering the extent of progress towards completion and examined the accounting for the associated items in the statement of financial position.\n\nFor  this  we  also  assessed  the  accounting  for  contractually  agreed  options,  contract  amendments  or  contract  terminations  (including related pending legal proceedings) particularly in relation to construction-type contracts with Russian customers in connection with the sanctions against Russia and the Managing Board's decision to wind down the affected businesses. We also assessed the recognition requirements and the recoverability of assets, such as inventories, receivables and reimbursement claims.\n\nWe  further  performed  inquiries  of  project  management  (both  commercial  and  technical  project  managers)  with  respect  to  the development of the projects including the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 on project execution, the reasons for deviations between planned and actual costs, the current estimated costs to complete the projects, and management's assessments on probabilities that contract risks and claims from joint and several liability will materialize.\n\nTo identify anomalies in the development of margins and other project KPIs, we also applied data analysis procedures. In designing our audit procedures, we also considered results from project audits conducted by the internal audit function. Furthermore, we obtained evidence from third parties for selected projects (e.g., project acceptance documentation, contractual terms and conditions, and lawyers' confirmations regarding alleged breaches of contract and asserted claims) and visited plant sites. Due to the large contract volume and risk profile, our audit procedures focused on large contracts for delivery of high-speed and commuter trains and Mobility contracts with Russian customers.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to revenue recognition on construction-type contracts.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for construction-type contracts,  refer  to  Note  2  Material  accounting  policies  and  critical  accounting  estimates  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements. With respect to contract assets and liabilities as well as provisions for order related losses and risks, refer to Note 10 Contract assets  and  liabilities,  Note  18  Provisions  and  Note  21  Commitments  and  contingencies  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Since the spin-off of Siemens Energy AG in September 2020, Siemens AG has held a 35.1% stake in the listed Siemens Energy AG and accounts for this investment as an associate applying the equity method in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. During the fiscal year 2022, the market value of the investment was predominantly below the carrying amount, also as of September 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, the market value has declined significantly and an impairment of the investment based on the stock market price was recognized in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets.\n\nDue to the judgments and estimates by management in the analyses and measurements as well as the overall material impact on the assets,  liabilities  and  financial  position  of  the  Group  and  the  related  significant  risk  of  material  misstatement,  the  assessment  of  an impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG was one of the key audit matters.\n\nAuditor's response: As part of our audit procedures in relation to management's assessment of an impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, we examined the methods and processes defined internally for the identification of objective indicators of impairment and thus the timing of a possible impairment as well as the measurement of an impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG.\n\nWith regards to the assessment of whether there are objective indicators of an impairment, in particular regarding the interpretation of a possible significant decline of the fair value, we evaluated management's assessment made on a quarterly and year-end basis as well as management's  judgements  and  estimates  contained  therein  and  obtained  external  evidence  on  credit  ratings,  stock  market  prices,",

        "page_content": "analysts' assessments and observable valuation indicators in this regard. In order to evaluate management's assessment as of September 30, 2022, we also considered the parameters and effects of the capital measure taken by the investee in September 2022 and of the expected acquisition of further shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A. by Siemens Energy AG. In addition, with the assistance of internal valuation specialists, we assessed the judgemental assumptions in determining the recoverable amount and the calculation of the impairment loss as of June 30, 2022.\n\nFurthermore,  we  evaluated  the  disclosures  regarding  the  investment  in  Siemens  Energy  AG  and  its  impairment  in  the  notes  to  the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG as of September 30, 2022.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for investments in associates,  refer  to  Note  2  Material  accounting  policies  and  critical  accounting  estimates  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements. Details on the impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG are presented in Note 4 Interests in other entities.\n\n## Provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: We considered the accounting for provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, including allegations of corruption and antitrust violations to be a key audit matter. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and, accordingly, on assets, liabilities and financial performance. The proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal issues and accordingly, considerable management judgment, in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks.\n\nAuditor's response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. To determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted are known and to assess management's estimates of the expected cash outflows, our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the Group entrusted with these matters, obtaining written statements from in-house legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their  probability,  obtaining  confirmations  from  external  legal  advisors  and  evaluating  internal  statements  concerning  the  accounting treatment in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.\n\nWe further considered alleged or substantiated non-compliance with legal provisions, official regulations (including sanctions) and internal company policies (compliance violations) by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters, obtaining written statements from external legal advisors, and by inquiring of the compliance organization. In this regard, among other procedures, we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and assessed on this basis whether management's evaluation of any risks to be accounted for in the consolidated financial statements is plausible.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the disclosures on proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for provisions, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. With respect to proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, refer to Note 22 Legal proceedings.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Siemens operates in numerous countries with different local tax legislation. The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions, and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the measurement and completeness of deferred tax liabilities as well as  the  tax  assessment of the accounting implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, especially with regard to the tax deductibility of recognized expenses.\n\nAuditor's  response: With  the  assistance  of  internal  tax  specialists  who  have  knowledge  of  relevant  local  tax  law,  we  examined  the processes installed by management for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions.\n\nIn the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, we evaluated whether management's assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year 2022, which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions, was in compliance with tax law. In particular, this includes the tax implications arising from cross border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices, the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company shares and corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities. With regard to the accounting implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict we assessed the deductibility of the respective recognized expenses. In order to assess measurement and completeness, we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors. Further, we evaluated management's assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law. In this context we also inspected expert tax opinions and assessments commissioned by management.\n\nIn assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we above all analyzed management's assumptions with respect to tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income, also in view of the implications of current geopolitical and  macroeconomic developments, and compared them to internal business plans. In the course of our audit procedures regarding deferred tax liabilities, we examined in",

Management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the declaration pursuant to Sec. 161 AktG ['Aktiengesetz': German Stock Corporation Act] on the Corporate Governance Code, which is part of the Corporate Governance Statement, and for the Compensation Report. In all other respects, management is responsible for the other information.

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the consolidated financial statements and the group management report\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the IASB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as management has determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.  It  also  has  the  responsibility  for  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern.  In  addition,  management  is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for  such  arrangements  and  measures  (systems)  as  management  has  considered  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  a  group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the",

We remain solely responsible for our opinions;\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- \u00b7 Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management considers necessary to enable the preparation of disclosures in accordance  with  EU  Taxonomy  that  is  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  (manipulation  of  the  disclosures  in accordance with EU Taxonomy) or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, management has disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\n## Independence and quality assurance of the audit firm\n\nWe have complied with the German professional requirements on independence as well as other professional conduct requirements.\n\nOur audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional pronouncements, in particular the BS WP/vBP ['Berufssatzung f\u00fcr Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer/vereidigte Buchpr\u00fcfer': Professional Charter for German Public Accountants/German Sworn Auditors]) in the exercise of their Profession and the IDW Standard on Quality Management issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW): Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QS 1), and accordingly maintains a comprehensive quality management system that includes documented policies and procedures with regard to compliance with professional ethical requirements, professional standards as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.\n\n## Responsibilities of the auditor\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy based on our assurance engagement.\n\nWe  conducted  our  assurance  engagement  in  accordance  with  the  International  Standard  on  Assurance  Engagements  (ISAE)  3000 (Revised): 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information' issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). This standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Company's disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as the interpretation by management disclosed in the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy. In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the auditor.\n\nIn  the  course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, performed the following assurance procedures and other activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Inquiries of relevant employees for the assessment of the process to identify the Taxonomy-eligible economic activities,\n- \u00b7 Inquiries of the employees responsible for data capture and consolidation as well as the preparation of the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy, to evaluate the reporting processes, the data capture and compilation methods as well as regarding internal controls to the extent relevant for the limited assurance of the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy,\n- \u00b7 Identification of likely risks of material misstatement in the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy,\n- \u00b7 Analytical evaluation of data at the level of the Group and businesses as well as service and governance units,\n- \u00b7 Inquiries and inspection of documents on a sample basis relating to the collection and reporting of data,\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of the presentation of the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy.",

Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.\n\n## Assurance conclusion\n\nBased on the assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft for the period from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as the interpretation by management as disclosed in the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy.\n\n## Restriction of use\n\nWe draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted for the Company's purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the assurance engagement. As a result, it may not be suitable for another purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, the report is not intended to be used by third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it. Our responsibility is to the Company alone. We do not accept any responsibility to third parties. Our assurance conclusion is not modified in this respect.\n\n## General engagement terms and liability\n\nThe 'General Engagement Terms for Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer and Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaften [German Public Auditors and Public Audit Firms]' dated January 1, 2017 are applicable to this engagement and also govern our relations with third parties in the context of this engagement (www.de.ey.com/general-engagement-terms). In addition, please refer to the liability provisions contained there in no. 9 and to the exclusion of liability towards third parties. We accept no responsibility, liability or other obligations towards third parties unless we have concluded a written agreement to the contrary with the respective third party or liability cannot effectively be precluded.\n\nWe make express reference to the fact that we will not update the report to reflect events or circumstances arising after it was issued, unless required to do so by law. It is the sole responsibility of anyone taking note of the summarized result of our work contained in this report to decide whether and in what way this result is useful or suitable for their purposes and to supplement, verify or update it by means of their own review procedures.\n\nMunich, December 5, 2022\n\nErnst & Young GmbH\n\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft\n\nBreitsameter\n\nJohne\n\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcferin\n\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcferin\n\n[German Public Auditor]\n\n[German Public Auditor]",

        "page_content": "## 3. Notes to Annual Financial Statements\n\n## 3.1 General Disclosures\n\nSiemens AG has registered offices in Berlin and Munich, Germany. The Company is registered in the commercial register maintained by the local courts in Berlin Charlottenburg, Germany, under the entry number HRB 12300, and in Munich, Germany, under the entry number HRB 6684.\n\nThe  Annual  Financial  Statements  of  Siemens  AG  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  regulations  set  forth  in  the  German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG). Amounts are presented in millions of euros (\u20ac million). Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided.\n\n## 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles\n\nRevenue are proceeds from selling and leasing products, providing services and granting licenses, including licensing contracts for the use of the Siemens trademark.\n\nNegative interest from financial investments is presented as a deduction in interest income , and positive interest from borrowings as a deduction in interest expenses .\n\nIntangible assets acquired for consideration are capitalized at acquisition costs and amortized on a straight-line basis over a maximum of five years or, if longer, the contractually agreed useful life. Items are amortized on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition. The capitalization option for internally generated intangible assets is not used.\n\nAcquired goodwill is generally amortized systematically over the expected useful life of five to 15 years. The expected useful life is based on the expected use of the acquired businesses and is determined in particular by economic factors such as future growth and profit expectations, synergy effects and employee base.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment : The components of production costs are described in the context of the explanations for inventories. In general, property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method. In certain cases, the declining balance method is applied, whereby a switch is made from the declining balance to the straight-line method as soon as the latter results in higher depreciation expense. Items are depreciated on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition. Low-value non-current assets that are subject to wear and tear, movable, and capable of being used independently, are expensed immediately or capitalized and fully depreciated in the year of acquisition.\n\nUseful lives of property, plant and equipment\n\n| Factory and office buildings                | 20 to 50 years      |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Other buildings                             | 5 to 10 years       |\n| Technical equipment and machines            | mostly 10 years     |\n| Other equipment, plant and office equipment | 3 to 8 years        |\n| Equipment leased to others                  | mostly 3 to 5 years |\n\nSpecial  reserve  with  an  equity  portion includes  reserves  pursuant  to  Section  6b  of  the  German  Income  Tax  Act (Einkommensteuergesetz), recognized and transferred in fiscal years prior to the transition to regulations of the German Accounting Law Modernisation Act (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz).\n\nFinancial assets : Impairment losses are recognized if the decline in value is presumed to be other than temporary. This applies, if objective evidence, particularly events or changes in circumstances, indicate a significant or other than temporary decline in value. In case of an impairment in prior periods, a lower recognized value may not be maintained if the reasons for the impairment do no longer exist.\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of average acquisition or production costs and daily values. Production costs comprise, in addition to direct costs, an appropriate portion of production and material overheads and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. General administration expenses, expenses for social facilities, voluntary social costs and company pension scheme costs are not capitalized. Writedowns are recorded to cover inventory risks for reduced usability and technological obsolescence as well as in the context of loss-free valuation of unbilled contracts in construction-type and service businesses.\n\nAllowances on receivables are determined on the basis of the probability of default and country risks.\n\nDeferred tax assets for differences between valuations of balance sheet line items in accordance to commercial and tax law and tax loss carryforwards are recognized if a future tax benefit is expected. Deferred tax assets are netted with deferred tax liabilities. Recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities comprise temporary differences of assets, liabilities, and deferred items of entities forming part of the Siemens AG tax group and partnerships to the extent that the recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, or deferred items result in a deductible or taxable amount in the taxable profit (loss) of Siemens AG.\n\nOffsetting of assets and of income and expenses : Siemens AG measures assets at fair value that are designated as being held exclusively to settle specified pension obligations and obligations for early retirement ('Altersteilzeit') arrangements and which cannot be accessed by other creditors. Income and expenses relating to these designated assets are offset against the expenses arising from compounding the corresponding obligations and are reported within the line item Other financial income (expenses), net.\n\nPensions and similar commitments :  Siemens AG measures its pension obligations using the settlement amount calculated with the actuarial projected unit credit method on the basis of biometric probabilities. The discount rate used corresponds to the average market interest rate for instruments with an assumed remaining maturity of 15 years as published by German Federal Reserve Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank).",

        "page_content": "Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at the balance sheet date. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the pension provision is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting to a present value.\n\nAccording to the Act on the Improvement of Company Pensions (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der betrieblichen Altersversorgung), Siemens AG is secondarily liable for pension benefits provided under an indirect pension funding vehicle (mittelbarer Durchf\u00fchrungsweg). Siemens AG recognizes the underfunding in the item Provisions for pensions and similar commitments as far as the respective assets of the pension fund or of the pension and support fund (Pensions- und Unterst\u00fctzungskasse) do not cover the settlement amount of the respective pension obligations.\n\nOther provisions are recognized in an appropriate and sufficient amount to cover individual obligations for all identifiable risks relating to liabilities of uncertain timing and amount and for anticipated losses on onerous contracts, taking account of price and cost increases expected  to  arise  in  the  future.  Provisions  for  agreed  personnel  restructuring  measures  were  recognized  for  legal  and  constructive obligations. Significant provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are discounted using a discount rate which corresponds to  the  average  market  interest  rate  appropriate  for  the  remaining  term  of  the  obligations,  as  calculated  and  published  by  Deutsche Bundesbank.\n\nForeign currency translation : Receivables, other current assets, securities, cash and cash equivalents, provisions and liabilities (excluding advance  payments  received  on  orders)  as  well  as  commitments  and  contingencies  denominated  in  foreign  currency  are  generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Balance Sheet line items denominated in foreign currency which are part of a valuation unit used to hedge foreign currency risk are measured using the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date. Non-current assets and inventories acquired in foreign currency are generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date.\n\nGuarantees and other commitments : Siemens AG issues parent company guarantees, i.e. guarantees to ensure performance obligations incurred from the delivery of goods or provision of services by affiliated and long-term investee companies or their parent companies. For measurement purposes, the contract amount of the secured delivery or service agreement is reduced using the straight-line method over the planned term of the delivery or service agreement, unless there are reasons for a different risk assessment and an increased liability amount  ('risk-adequate  liability  amount').  Credit  lines  included  in  the  guarantee  obligations  in  the  context  of  financing  affiliated companies are recognized at their nominal amount.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used by Siemens AG almost exclusively for hedging purposes and - if the relevant conditions are met - are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. When a valuation unit is created, changes in values or cash flows from the hedged item and hedging contract are compared. A provision is recognized only for a negative surplus from the ineffective part  of  the  market  value  changes.  The  unrealized  gains  and  losses  from  the  effective  part  offset  each  other  completely  and  are  not recognized in the Balance Sheet or the Income Statement.\n\nClassification of items in the annual financial statements : Siemens AG aggregates individual line items of the Income Statement and Balance Sheet if the individual line item is not material for providing a true and fair view of the Company's financial position and if such an aggregation improves the clarity of the presentation. Siemens AG discloses these items separately in the notes.\n\n## 3.3 Notes to the Income Statement\n\nSiemens' decision to exit business activities in Russia following the war in Ukraine resulted in burdens on Net income totaling \u20ac0.8 billion.

Subscription rights of existing shareholders are excluded. The new shares may exclusively be offered to employees of Siemens AG and its affiliated companies (employee shares). To the extent permitted by law, employee shares may also be issued in such a manner that the contribution to be paid on such shares is covered by that part of the annual net income which the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board may allocate to other retained earnings under Section 58 para. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n- \u00b7 Further, by resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of January 30, 2019, the Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until January 29, 2024 by up to \u20ac510 million through the issuance of up to 170 million registered no-par value shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind (Authorized Capital 2019). Under certain conditions, the Managing Board is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights in the event of issue against contributions in kind. In the case of issue against cash payment, the shares are generally to be offered to shareholders for  subscription.  However,  the  Managing  Board  is  authorized,  with  the  consent  of  the  Supervisory  Board,  to  exclude subscription rights, firstly for any fractional amounts, secondly, to grant dilution compensation in connection with convertible bonds or bonds with warrants already issued, and thirdly, under certain further conditions, if the issue price of the new shares does not fall significantly below the stock exchange price of the Company's already listed shares.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nThe following table presents the development of treasury shares:\n\n| (in number of shares)                                           | Fiscal year  2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Treasury shares, beginning of fiscal year                       | 47,644,581          |\n| Share buyback                                                   | 14,185,791          |\n| Issuance under share-based payments and employee share programs | (4,376,201)         |\n| Treasury shares, end of fiscal year                             | 57,454,171          |\n\nSiemens AG held 57,454,171 treasury shares, equaling a nominal amount of \u20ac172 million, representing 6.8% of the capital stock.\n\nOn June 24, 2021, Siemens announced a share buyback with a volume of up to \u20ac3 billion in the period from the beginning of fiscal 2022 to 2026. The share buyback, which began on November 15, 2021 and will run no longer than until September 15, 2026, is executed based on the authorizations granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020. In addition to the dividend policy, the share buyback  is  intended  to  allow  shareholders  to  continuously  participate  in  the  success  of  the  Company.  In  fiscal  2022,  Siemens  AG repurchased a total of 14,185,791 treasury shares under this buyback program. This represented a nominal amount of \u20ac43 million or 1.7% of  capital  stock.  In  this  reporting  period,  \u20ac1,566  million  (excluding  incidental  transaction  charges)  were  spent  for  this  purpose;  this represents a weighted average stock price of \u20ac110.38 per share. The purchases were made in the reporting period on 218 Xetra trading days and were carried out by a bank that had been commissioned by Siemens AG; the shares were purchased exclusively on the electronic trading platform of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra). The average volume on these trading days was about 65,072 shares.\n\nThe treasury shares purchased under the share buybacks may be used for purposes of retirement, distribution to employees, members of the executive bodies of companies affiliated with Siemens and members of the Managing Board, as well as the servicing of convertible bonds with attached warrants.",

        "page_content": "In fiscal 2022, Siemens AG re-issued in total 4,376,201 treasury shares under the exclusion of subscription rights in connection with sharebased payments and employee share programs in the Group, equaling a nominal amount of \u20ac13 million and 0.5% of the capital stock. The Company received in total \u20ac255 million for 2,004,924 shares, re-issued against payment of a purchase price. Siemens AG received this amount for unrestricted use. All shares were sold as investment shares in connection with the share matching program to plan participants. In each case, the purchase price was determined on the basis of the closing rate in Xetra trading, determined on a monthly effective date. Therefore, in the reporting period, in total 1,405,428 shares related to the monthly investment plan at a weighted average share price of \u20ac122.02 per share, 259,927 shares related to the share matching plan at a weighted average share price of \u20ac139.50 per share, and 339,569 shares related to the base share program at a weighted average share price of \u20ac69.75 per share (after consideration of a 50% subsidy by the Company). The other shares re-issued during the reporting period can be primarily attributed to the servicing of stock awards granted in fiscal 2018 totaling 1,699,017 shares, to 573,441 matching shares under the share matching program for fiscal 2019, and to 98,819 jubilee shares.\n\n## Information on amounts subject to dividend payout restrictions\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                                                                                                                      | Fiscal Year  2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Amount representing the difference of the recognition of provisions and similar commitments based on average interest rates covering ten and  seven years, respectively | 687                 |\n| Amounts from the capitalization of deferred taxes                                                                                                                       | 2,065               |\n| Amounts from the capitalization of assets at fair value                                                                                                                 | 16                  |\n\nThese amounts subject to dividend payout restrictions face other retained earnings in a sufficiently high amount. The unappropriated net income of \u20ac3,613 million is available for distribution.\n\n## Disclosures on shareholdings of Siemens AG\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the following information on shareholdings subject to reporting requirements was available to the Company pursuant to Section 160 para 1 No. 8 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz):\n\nBlackRock, Inc., Wilmington, USA, notified us on June 21, 2022, that its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG amounted to 6.25% (53,108,691 voting rights) on June 16, 2022.\n\nThe State of Qatar, Doha, acting by and through the DIC Company Limited, notified us on May 10, 2012, that its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG exceeded the threshold of 3% of the voting rights in our Company on May 7, 2012 and amounted to 3.04% (27,758,338 voting rights) as per this date.\n\nThe Werner Siemens-Stiftung, Zug, Switzerland, notified us on January 21, 2008, that its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG exceeded the threshold of 3% of the voting rights in our Company on January 2, 2008 and amounted to 3.03% (27,739,285 voting rights) as per this date.\n\n## NOTE 16 Provisions for pensions and similar commitments\n\nIn Germany, Siemens AG provides pension benefits through the BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans and deferred compensation plans. The majority of Siemens' active employees participate in the BSAV. The benefits are predominantly based on nominal contributions by the Company and investment returns on assets designated to that plan, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the Company. In connection with the implementation of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified  to  substantially  eliminate  the  effects  of  compensation  increases.  Therefore,  valuation  assumptions  for  salary  and  pension increases including career trend are no longer significant for the pension obligation of Siemens AG. The pension benefits are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA). A portion of these trust assets also covers the pension obligations of other domestic subsidiaries. Therefore, the assets do not meet the criteria for offsetting against the pension obligation and are presented as financial assets of Siemens AG.\n\nThe actuarial valuation of the settlement amount as of September 30, 2022 was based, among others, on a discount rate of 1.78% (2021:1.98%) and on a rate of pension progression of 2.00% (inflation-related increase compared to prior year-rate of 1.50%) per year, except  for  the  BSAV  and  deferred  compensation  plans  with  1.00%  (2021:  1.00%)  per  year.  The  mortality  tables  used  (Siemens  Bio 2017/2022) are primarily based on data of the German Siemens population, using a set of formulas that corresponds to generally accepted actuarial standards.\n\n## NOTE 17 Other provisions\n\nThe major amounts in other provisions were contributed by provisions related to personnel costs amounting to \u20ac1,026 million, provisions for contingent losses from derivative financial instruments amounting to \u20ac782 million, provisions for warranties, delay compensations, penalties for delay and breach of contract amounting to \u20ac634 million, provisions for decontamination obligations amounting to \u20ac493 million, and provisions related to guarantees and expected obligations from consortium agreements amounting to \u20ac187 million.\n\nIn May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal Republic of Germany entered into a public-law contract based on which the obligation of final disposal of nuclear waste is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of \u20ac360 million. The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules. Estimation uncertainties still relate to assumptions made to  measure  the  obligations  that  remain  with  Siemens  AG,  with  regard  to  conditioning  and  packaging  of  nuclear  waste,  as  well  as intermediate storage and transport to the final storage facility 'Schacht Konrad' or a logistics depot until year-end 2032.",

The increase in expenses for pensions was due mainly to the increase in the rate of pension progression as part of the actuarial valuation of the settlement amount of pension obligations, and the recognition of indirect pension obligations.\n\nThe breakdown of employees per function is as follows:\n\n|                                      | Fiscal year  2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Production                           | 27,200              |\n| Sales                                | 8,300               |\n| Research and development             | 7,000               |\n| Administration and general functions | 6,600               |\n| Employees                            | 49,100              |\n\n## NOTE 21 Share-based payment\n\nSiemens AG allows employees and members of the Managing Board to participate in share-based payment programs. For the purpose of servicing share-based payment programs, Siemens AG also delivers Siemens shares, which have been granted by affiliated companies.\n\n## Stock Awards\n\nSiemens AG grants stock awards to members of the Managing Board, members of the senior management and other eligible employees.\n\nStock awards to beneficiaries of Siemens AG are expensed as incurred over the vesting period and are measured at the intrinsic value (= share  price  of  the  Siemens  stock)  at  the  balance  sheet  date  on  a  pro  rata  basis  for  the  proportion  of  the  vesting  period  expired considering the estimated target attainment at the balance sheet date.",

        "page_content": "Warranty obligations relating to financing of affiliated companies included guarantees towards banks for credit lines granted to affiliated companies.\n\nThe items Obligations from guarantees and Warranty Obligations - Others included guarantees and other commitments for the benefit of companies of the Siemens Energy Group totaling \u20ac0.4 billion and \u20ac7.2 billion, respectively, with corresponding full reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co. KG. In addition, the items included indemnifications issued in connection with dispositions of businesses. Such indemnifications, if customary to the relevant transactions, may protect the buyer from potential tax, legal and other risks in conjunction with the purchased business.\n\nWarranty obligations included obligations of Siemens AG towards affiliated companies totaling \u20ac0.5 billion.\n\nSiemens AG only enters into guarantees and other commitments after careful consideration of the risks concerned and in general only in relation to its own business activities or those of affiliated companies as well as to business activities of companies, if it holds an investment in them or their parent companies. Based on an ongoing risk evaluation of the arrangements entered into and taking into account all information available up to the date on which the Annual Financial Statements were issued for approval, Siemens AG concluded that the relevant primary debtors are able to fulfill the underlying obligations. For this reason, Siemens AG considered it not probable that it will be called upon in conjunction with any of the guarantees and commitments described above.\n\n## NOTE 24 Financial payment obligations under lease and rental arrangements\n\nExpenses for lease and rental arrangements with third parties in which the economic ownership of the leased/rented asset was not attributable to Siemens AG and the relevant items were not recognized as assets by Siemens AG amounted to \u20ac197 million. Object of these contracts were mainly real estate and other non-current assets.\n\nPayment obligations under lease and rental arrangements amounted to \u20ac1,350 million, of which \u20ac134 million resulted from transactions with affiliated companies. Payment obligations under lease and rental arrangements due within the next fiscal year amounted to \u20ac268 million.\n\n## NOTE 25 Other financial obligations\n\nApproximately \u20ac1.8 billion were outstanding as of September 30, 2022, from an outsourcing agreement with a maturity of several years. Obligations for equity contributions were \u20ac408 million.\n\nSiemens AG has entered into a contract to pay its affiliated company Siemens Trademark GmbH & Co. KG, Germany, a running royalty for the use of the Siemens trademark rights. The fee is calculated by applying business-specific royalty rates to brand-related revenue. The contract has an indefinite duration. For fiscal 2022, the corresponding expenses amounted to \u20ac804 million. For fiscal 2023, the royalty is expected to be in the same magnitude.\n\nIn  the  course  of  its  normal  business  operations,  Siemens  AG  is  involved  in  numerous  legal  and  regulatory  proceedings  as  well  as governmental investigations (legal proceedings) in various jurisdictions. These legal proceedings could result in particular in the Company being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or criminal or civil sanctions, fines or disgorgements of profit. In individual cases, this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. In addition, further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be expanded. Some of these legal proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens AG that may have material effects on its financial position, the results of its operations and/or its cash flows in the respective reporting period. In addition, Siemens is jointly and severally liable within consortia. As far as not recognized in the financial statements, Siemens AG did not expect any material negative effects on its financial position, the results of its operations and/or its cash flows at balance sheet date.\n\n## NOTE 26 Derivative financial instruments and valuation units\n\nAs a consequence of its global operating, investing and financing activities, Siemens AG is in particular exposed to risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, managed in line with a proven risk management system in consideration of defined risk limits. As the parent company of the Siemens Group, Siemens AG has the central role within the group-wide management of financial market risks. To manage the risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, Siemens AG uses primarily foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps as well as combined interest and foreign currency swaps. Thereby the operating units of Siemens AG are not allowed to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The contract partners of the Company for derivative  financial  instruments  are  banks,  brokers  and  affiliated  companies.  The  credit  rating  for  banks  and  brokers  is  constantly monitored.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, interest rate swaps with a net negative fair value of \u20ac635 million (notional amount: \u20ac10,005 million) were not included in a valuation unit. For interest rate swaps with a negative fair value of \u20ac782 million, provisions for contingent losses were recognized in the same amount. The notional amount equals the contract value of the individual derivative financial instruments before netting (gross notional amount), independent of the type of contracted position (purchase or sale).\n\nThe notional amounts equal the contractual amounts of the individual derivative financial instrument which - irrespective of the nature of the concluded position (sale or purchase) - are presented on a gross basis (gross notional amounts).\n\nFair values of interest rate derivative financial instruments are determined by discounting expected future cash flows over the remaining term of the instrument using current market interest rates and yield curves.\n\nProvided the relevant conditions are met, derivative financial instruments are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. Using the freezing method, the hedging transactions are not recognized in the balance sheet. The effectiveness of the valuation unit is either ensured through risk management, or is demonstrated both prospectively and retrospectively based on appropriate methods used to demonstrate effectiveness (e.g. dollar offset method, regression method, sensitivity analysis). Valuation gains and losses from derivative  financial  instruments  and  hedged  items  are  netted  for  each  valuation  unit.  A  provision  for  anticipated  losses  on  onerous contracts is recognized for the respective valuation unit in the amount of an existing loss surplus. Profit surpluses are not recognized.",

Foreign currency transaction exposure of the Siemens units from contracted business and cash balances in foreign currency is generally hedged approximately by 100% with Corporate Treasury. Foreign currency transaction exposure of the Siemens units from planned business above defined thresholds has to be hedged with Corporate Treasury within a band of 75% to 100% for a hedging period of at least three months.\n\nThe remaining foreign currency risk after offsetting cash flows in the same currency is hedged by the Corporate Treasury with external contract partners. The net foreign currency position (before hedging) is combined with the offsetting foreign currency exchange contracts to  a  macro  valuation  unit.  For  this  purpose,  hedged  items  and  hedging  instruments  are  measured  with  the  respective  underlying discounted cash flows. For foreign currency derivative financial instruments, the determination is based on the changes in relevant forward exchange rates. The existing derivative currency hedging contracts are included in the valuation unit in their entirety and had maturity terms until the year 2042. The cash in- and outflows from the foreign currency exchange contracts, firm commitments and forecast transactions are disclosed on a net basis in the following table.\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                               | Sep 30,  2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Foreign currency risk from balance sheet items                                   | 2,243           |\n| thereof assets                                                                   | 16,368          |\n| thereof liabilities                                                              | (14,124)        |\n| Foreign currency risk from firm commitments and forecast transactions            | 759             |\n| thereof expected cash inflows from firm commitments and forecasted transactions  | 1,239           |\n| thereof expected cash outflows from firm commitments and forecasted transactions | (480)           |\n| Net foreign currency position (before hedging)                                   | 3,002           |\n| Foreign currency exchange contracts (net face value)                             | (3,305)         |\n| thereof with external contract partners                                          | 6,026           |\n| thereof with affiliated companies                                                | (9,331)         |\n| Net foreign currency position (after hedging)                                    | (303)           |\n\nFirm commitments and forecast transactions concern business transactions for which a legally binding contract was concluded but not yet performed on by either contracting party, as well as contingent payment claims for already partially completed performance obligations in the project and product businesses.\n\nThe net fair value of derivative financial instruments from foreign currency hedge accounting was \u20ac633 million as of September 30, 2022; positive fair values were \u20ac3,814 million and negative fair values were \u20ac3,181 million. Accordingly, no provision for anticipated losses was recognized for the derivative financial instruments with negative fair values that were included in this macro valuation unit.\n\n## Valuation unit used to hedge the interest rate risk\n\nThe interest rate hedging contracts used by Siemens AG serve to reduce interest rate risks within the framework of an integrated assetliability management approach and to optimize the interest results.\n\nSiemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties to hedge interest rate swaps transacted with its affiliated companies against interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2022, the interest rate swaps transacted with affiliated companies included in this macro valuation unit had a notional amount of \u20ac1,163 million and maximum maturity terms until the year 2028. At balance sheet date, these underlying transactions were matched by external interest rate derivatives in the same amount. Thereby, positive fair values of \u20ac105 million were offset by negative fair values in the same amount.\n\nTo hedge receivables from affiliated companies against interest rate risk, Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties and combined these instruments with the underlying transactions in a macro valuation unit. As of September 30, 2022, the notional amount of the receivables, which had a maximum maturity until the year 2047, amounted to \u20ac15,966 million. As of September 30, 2022, the negative cumulative market value changes of these receivables of \u20ac504 million were matched by offsetting interest rate derivatives with a positive net fair value of \u20ac257 million and a maximum maturity until the year 2041, of which positive fair values were \u20ac547 million and negative fair values were \u20ac290 million.\n\nTo hedge payables to affiliated companies against interest rate risk, Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties. The payables hedged within this micro valuation unit had a nominal volume of \u20ac2,551 million as of September 30, 2022 and a maximum maturity until the year 2025. As of September 30, 2022, positive cumulative changes in market value of these payables of \u20ac125 million were matched by external interest rate derivatives with identical maturities whose negative market value was \u20ac100 million.\n\nThe amount of interest rate risks hedged with the valuation unit that did not lead to a provision for anticipated losses accordingly totaled \u20ac494 million.\n\n## NOTE 27 Proposal for the appropriation of net income\n\nThe Supervisory Board and the Managing Board propose the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, amounting to \u20ac3,613 million to be appropriated as follows: Distribution of a dividend of \u20ac4.25 on each share of no par value entitled to the dividend, and carry-forward of the unappropriated net income for shares of no par value not entitled to the dividend.",

In addition, we have audited the management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the group management report, for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the last paragraph of chapter 1 beginning with 'Disclosures in accordance with EU taxonomy' of the combined management report, the sections '8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM' and '8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)' in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report as well as the content of the Corporate Governance Statement which is published on the website stated in the combined management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- \u00b7 the  accompanying annual financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law applicable to business corporations and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022 in compliance with German legally required accounting principles, and\n- \u00b7 the accompanying management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position. In all material respects, this management report is consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the management report does not cover the last paragraph in chapter 1 beginning with 'Disclosures in accordance with EU taxonomy' of the combined management report, the sections '8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM' and '8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)' in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report and the content of the Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nPursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the annual financial statements and of the management report.\n\n## Basis for the opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as 'EU Audit Regulation') and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). In  conducting  the  audit  of  the  annual  financial  statements  we  also  complied  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  (ISA).  Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional  responsibilities  in  accordance  with  these  requirements.  In  addition,  in  accordance  with  Art.  10  (2)  f)  of  the  EU  Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art. 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report.\n\n## Key audit matters in the audit of the annual financial statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual financial statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the annual financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:\n\n## Impairment of non-current financial assets\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The impairment test of non-current financial assets was a key audit matter, as in particular shares in affiliated companies and investments, especially the investment in Siemens Energy AG, entail a higher risk of material misstatement due to the materiality of these assets as well as the estimation uncertainties and judgments involved in assessing whether there is objective evidence to indicate a lower net realizable value and permanent impairment, and the determination of the fair values. In case of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, in which 26.7% is held directly, the market capitalization during fiscal 2022 was below the book value sometimes significantly. As of September 30, 2022, an impairment of the investment to the stock market price has been recorded.\n\nThe determination of the fair values of non-current financial assets also depends to a large extent on the assessment of future cash inflows, in  individual  cases  particularly  considering  the  potential  effects  of  the  Russia-Ukraine  conflict  and  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  the discount rate applied.\n\nAuditor's response: In assessing whether there was objective evidence to indicate a lower net realizable value and permanent impairment, we obtained an understanding of management's evaluation and also obtained external evidence in this regard, amongst others, on the development of stock market prices. With regard to the net realizable values calculated by management and its assessment as to whether",

        "page_content": "an impairment is expected to be permanent, we examined the underlying processes related to the planning of future cash flows as well as to the calculation of net realizable value.\n\nWe assessed the underlying valuation models for the determination of the net realizable value in terms of methodology and reperformed the  calculations  with  the  assistance  of  internal  valuation  specialists.  We  further  obtained  explanations  from  management  regarding material  value  drivers  of  the  planning,  particularly  considering  the  potential  effects  of  the  Russia-Ukraine  conflict  and  the  COVID-19 pandemic,  and  examined  whether  the  budget  planning  reflects  general  and  industry-specific  market  expectations.  Decisions  of  the Managing Board regarding the termination of business activities in Russia were taken into account. Forecast accuracy was assessed on a sample basis using budget-to-actual comparisons of historically forecast data with the actual results. The parameters used to estimate net realizable value such as the estimated growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital rates were assessed by comparing them to publicly available market data. We also performed our own sensitivity analyses to assess the impairment risk in the case of a reasonably possible change in one of the significant assumptions.\n\nWith regard to the impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, we have traced the development of the stock market price and assessed the determination of the fair value as well as the calculation of the impairment as of September 30, 2022. Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures regarding the investment in Siemens Energy AG and its impairment in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to assessing the impairment of non-current financial assets.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied for the impairment of non-current financial assets, refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles in the notes to the financial statements and with respect to write-downs and write-ups of non-current financial assets, refer to chapter 3.3 Notes to the Income Statement, Note 3 Income (loss) from investments, net as well as chapter 3.4 Notes to the Balance Sheet, Note 10 Non-current assets in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Other Provisions for legal disputes, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: We considered the accounting for other provisions for legal disputes, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations (legal proceedings) out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations to be a key audit matter. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the  recognition  and  measurement  of  the  respective  provision  and,  accordingly,  on  assets,  liabilities  and  financial  performance.  The proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal issues and accordingly, considerable management judgment, in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks.\n\nAuditor's response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. To determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted also in connection with joint and several liability are known and to assess management's estimates of the expected cash outflows, our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the Company entrusted with these matters, obtaining written statements from in-house legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their probability, obtaining confirmations from external legal advisors and evaluating internal statements concerning the accounting treatment in the annual financial statements. Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.\n\nWe further considered alleged or substantiated non-compliance with legal provisions, official regulations (including sanctions) and internal company policies (compliance violations) by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters, obtaining written statements from external legal advisors, and by inquiring of the compliance organization. In this regard, among other procedures, we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and assessed on this  basis  whether  management's  evaluation  of  any  risks  to  be  accounted  for  in  the  annual  financial  statements  is plausible.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for other provisions, refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles in the notes to the financial statements. With respect to the legal proceedings, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations, refer to chapter 3.5 Other Disclosures, Note 25 Other financial obligations.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions and recoverability of deferred tax assets\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions, and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, the recoverability of deferred tax assets as well as management's assessments regarding the tax implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, especially with regard to the tax deductibility of recognized expenses.\n\nAuditor's response: With the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of tax law, we examined the processes installed by management for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions.\n\nIn the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, we evaluated whether management's assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year 2022, which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions, was in compliance with tax law. In particular, this includes the tax implications arising from cross border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices, the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company shares and corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities. With regard to the accounting implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict we assessed the deductibility of the respective recognized expenses. In order to assess measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors. Further, we evaluated management's assessments with respect to the  prospects  of  success  of  appeal  and  tax  court  proceedings  by  inquiring  of  the  employees  of  the  Siemens  tax  department  and  by considering current tax case law. In this context we also inspected expert tax opinions and assessments commissioned by management.",

Management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the declaration pursuant to Sec. 161 AktG ['Aktiengesetz': German Stock Corporation Act] on the Corporate Governance Code, which is part of the Corporate Governance Statement, and for the Compensation Report. In all other respects, management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the last  paragraph of chapter 1 beginning with 'Disclosures in accordance with EU taxonomy' of the combined management report, the sections '8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM' and '8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)' in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report as well as the content of the Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nIn addition, the other information comprises parts to be included in the Annual Report, of which we received a version prior to issuing this auditor's report, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 the Responsibility Statement (to the annual financial statements and the management report),\n- \u00b7 the Responsibility Statement (to the consolidated financial statements and the group management report),\n- \u00b7 the Five-Year Summary,\n- \u00b7 the Compensation Report,\n- \u00b7 the Report of the Supervisory Board,\n- \u00b7 Notes and forward-looking statements,\n\nbut not the consolidated financial statements and the annual financial statements, not the disclosures of the combined management report whose content is audited and not our auditor's reports as well as not our auditor's report on a limited assurance engagement on the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy thereon.\n\nOur opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information, and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- \u00b7 is materially inconsistent with the annual financial statements, with the management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- \u00b7 otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the annual financial statements and the management report\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  the  annual  financial  statements  that  comply,  in  all  material  respects,  with  the requirements of German commercial law applicable to business corporations, and that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Company in compliance with German legally required accounting principles. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as it, in accordance with German legally required accounting principles, has determined necessary to enable the preparation of annual financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  annual  financial  statements,  management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  It  also  has  the  responsibility  for  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern.  In  addition,  management  is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.\n\nFurthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Company's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as management has considered necessary to enable the preparation of a management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the management report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process for the preparation of the annual financial statements and of the management report.",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error  and  are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual financial statements and this management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual financial statements and of the management report, whether due to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the annual financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems of the Company;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures;\n- \u00b7 conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the annual financial statements and in the management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to be able to continue as a going concern;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the annual financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Company in compliance with German legally required accounting principles;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the consistency of the management report with the annual financial statements, its conformity with German law and the view of the Company's position it provides;\n- \u00b7 perform  audit  procedures  on  the  prospective  information  presented  by  management  in  the  management  report.  On  the  basis  of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the annual financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n## Other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Report on the assurance on the electronic rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report prepared for publication purposes in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report (hereinafter the 'ESEF documents') contained in the file SIEMENS\\_2022.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format ('ESEF format').

        "page_content": "## A. Fiscal 2022 in retrospect\n\n## What did the economic and political environment look like at the start of fiscal 2022?\n\nIn the fall of 2021, the starting position for fiscal 2022 was beset by many uncertainties. The COVID-19 pandemic had not yet peaked, and there was a risk of further, more-contagious  or more-severe virus variants. Supply chain bottlenecks continued as did the trade conflict between the U.S. and China. The already tense geopolitical situation further deteriorated dramatically due to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. Inflation subsequently rose to heights not seen in decades, triggered mainly by large price jumps in the energy sector. Siemens withdrew from Russia following the imposition of international sanctions. This move had a negative impact on the Company's profit as did the necessary impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy. However, Siemens AG proved, in retrospect, to be very strong: the Company leveraged growth opportunities  in  many  key  markets.  The  Siemens  team  delivered  a  very  good  operating  performance  in  extremely challenging times.\n\n## How is the strategy reflected in Managing Board compensation?\n\nSiemens positioned itself as a leading technology company focused on accelerated high-value growth. The Supervisory Board is convinced that this strategy positions Siemens to  meet the challenges of the future. The Managing Board compensation that has been determined by the Supervisory Board fosters the implementation of the Company's strategic targets by providing incentives for increasing profit and capital efficiency and for cash generation.\n\nIn addition, sustainability - as a strategic goal and an expression of Siemens' social responsibility - is a high priority at Siemens. Sustainability is managed using the DEGREE framework. Introduced in fiscal 2021, this framework addresses sustainability from every angle and determines Siemens' ambitions in the sustainability area with systematized, measurable and specific long-term targets for environment, social and governance (ESG) dimensions. DEGREE is an acronym that stands for  decarbonization,  ethics,  governance,  resource  efficiency,  equity  and  employability.  The  DEGREE  framework  is continuously developed and adapted to the commitments that Siemens has made, such as the Science Based Targets initiative. The key performance indicators applied in long-term variable compensation are part of this DEGREE framework (CO2 emissions and digital learning hours per employee) and/or reflect the Company's priorities (Net Promoter Score as an expression of customer satisfaction).\n\n## How did Siemens perform in fiscal 2022?\n\nSiemens was very successful in fiscal 2022 despite the complex geopolitical and economic environment. Many of our key customer industries - including automotive, machine building, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, electronics, cloud services and public transport - kept growing, and we continued to successfully avoid major supply chain disruptions.\n\nOur  Industrial  Business  again  achieved  excellent  results,  particularly  in  Digital  Industries,  Smart  Infrastructure  and Siemens Healthineers. Results at Mobility were strongly impacted by the negative effects of withdrawing from business activities in Russia. Outside Industrial Business, exiting our financing and leasing activities in Russia resulted in further charges. A significant decline in the market value of Siemens Energy AG also led to an impairment of our stake in that company as of June 30, 2022.\n\nRevenue increased at all our industrial businesses and, including positive currency translation effects, climbed 16% to \u20ac72.0 billion. Net of currency translation and portfolio effects, revenue for Siemens grew 8.2%. Profit Industrial Business rose 17% to a record high of \u20ac10.3 billion. Our Industrial Business generated a strong profit margin of 15.1%.\n\nDespite the excellent performance of our Industrial Business and a net gain of \u20ac2.2 billion from the successful further focusing of our business, which included gains from the divestments of Siemens Logistics' mail and parcel business and Yunex Traffic, Siemens' net income declined to \u20ac4.4 billion. This decline was chiefly due to the \u20ac2.7 billion impairment of",

        "page_content": "our stake in Siemens Energy AG and a negative effect of \u20ac1.3 billion related to our previously mentioned decision to exit business activities in Russia. Basic earnings per share (EPS) from net income came in at \u20ac4.65, and earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA) was \u20ac5.47. The impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG burdened basic EPS from net income and EPS pre PPA by \u20ac3.37 per share.\n\nThe impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG burdened return on capital employed (ROCE) by 5.3 percentage points, resulting in ROCE of 10.0% for fiscal 2022.\n\nFree cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal 2022 was \u20ac8.2 billion, reaching the high level of fiscal 2021. The cash conversion rate for Siemens, defined as the ratio of free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations to net income, was 1.86, exceeding our targeted cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate for Siemens.\n\nSiemens' strong operating performance in fiscal 2022 is reflected in the Managing Board's variable compensation, which takes into account not only financial success but also environmental and social aspects. As a result, the compensation of the Managing Board members is also oriented toward the interests of the shareholders as well as the other stakeholders of Siemens AG.\n\n## Composition of the Managing Board and the Compensation Committee\n\nThere were no changes in the composition of the Managing Board of Siemens AG or in the Compensation Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG in fiscal 2022.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, the Managing Board comprised Dr. Roland Busch (President and CEO), Cedrik Neike, Matthias Rebellius, Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas and Judith Wiese.\n\nIn  fiscal  2022,  the  Compensation  Committee  comprised  Michael Diekmann  (Chairman),  Harald Kern,  J\u00fcrgen Kerner, Jim Hagemann Snabe, Birgit Steinborn and Matthias Zachert.\n\n## Vote on the Compensation Report for fiscal 2021 at the 2022 Annual Shareholders' Meeting\n\nThe Compensation Report for fiscal 2021 was prepared for the first time in accordance with Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), and its content was also audited by the independent auditors, beyond the requirement of Section 162 para. 3 sent. 1 and 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act. The Compensation Report on the compensation individually awarded and due to the members of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG in fiscal 2021 was approved by a majority of 91.70% at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 10, 2022.\n\nIn discussions between the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and investors, we received very positive feedback on the structure and transparency of the Compensation Report for fiscal 2021. The suggestions for improvement mentioned in these discussions have been taken into account in the current Compensation Report for fiscal 2022. To make compensation reporting even more transparent, chapter B.3.1  SHORT-TERM VARIABLE COMPENSATION (BONUS) has been expanded to include  further  details  of  the  Managing  Board  members'  individual  targets.  Chapter B.3.2  LONG-TERM  VARIABLE COMPENSATION  (STOCK  AWARDS) has  also  been  expanded  to  include  further  information  on  the  Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index.\n\nIn view of the high level of approval of the application of the compensation system in fiscal 2021 and taking into account regular feedback from investors, no changes to the compensation system were deemed necessary in fiscal 2022. Pursuant to Section 120a para. 1  sent. 1  of the German Stock Corporation Act, the compensation system for Managing Board members must be presented to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for approval in February 2024. In this connection, a comprehensive audit of the current compensation system is planned for fiscal 2023.",

Compensation of Managing Board members\n\n## B.1 The compensation system at a glance\n\nThe current compensation system for the members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG has been in place since fiscal 2020 and was endorsed by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020, by a majority of 94.51%.\n\nThe compensation of the Managing Board members consists of fixed and variable components. Fixed compensation, which is not performance-based, comprises base salary, fringe benefits and a pension benefit commitment. Short-term variable compensation (Bonus) and long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards) are performance-based compensation and thus variable.\n\nThe Share Ownership Guidelines are a further key component of the compensation system. They obligate Managing Board members to permanently hold Siemens shares worth a defined multiple of their base salary and to purchase additional shares in the event that the value of their shares falls below the defined amount.\n\nThe  Managing  Board  compensation  system  is  also  supplemented  by  commitments  granted  in  connection  with  the commencement and termination of appointments to the Managing Board as well as any change in the regular place of work.\n\nOverview of the compensation system for Managing Board members\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Compensation  components                       | Design of compensation components                                           | Design of compensation components                                  | Maximum payout  (in % of target amount)  regulations   | Malus and clawback     | Maximum  compensation                                                                                               | Other design characteristics                                          |    |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Fixed compensation                             | Base salary                                                                 | Pension benefit commitment                                         | Fringe benefits                                        | 100%  1 Not applicable | Equals the sum of maximum amounts that can possibly be paid out to each Managing Board member from all compensation | Share Ownership Guidelines                                            |    |\n| Short-term variable compensation (Bonus)       | 33.34% Siemens Group                                                        | 33.33% Managing Board portfolio                                    | 33.33% Individual ta rgets                             | 200%                   | components for the relevant fiscal year                                                                             | Commitments in  connection with the commence- ment of appoint- ments  |    |\n| Long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards) | 80% Total shareholder return (TSR) com- ired to MSCI World  dustrials Index | 20% Environment, Social and Governance (ESG/ Sustainability index) |                                                        | 300%                   | Equals the sum of maximum amounts that can possibly be paid out to each Managing Board member from all compensation | Commitments in the event of termination of appointments Severance cap |    |\n\n- 1 Fringe benefits are reimbursed up to a maximum amount set by the Supervisory Board.",

In making this determination, the Supervisory Board has ensured that the proportion of long-term variable compensation always exceeds that of short-term variable compensation and that the proportions of total target compensation represented by each of the individual compensation components are within the ranges defined in the compensation system.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of its regular review to determine the appropriateness of Managing Board income and the latter's conformity with market conditions, the Supervisory Board approved, at its meeting on September 23, 2021, an increase in the total target compensation of Dr. Roland Busch effective October 1, 2021. This increase was implemented by raising his Stock Awards target amount to \u20ac2,954,000 from \u20ac2,390,000.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board decided at its meeting on December 2, 2021, to extend the appointment of  Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas until December 2026. In connection with this extension, the Supervisory Board  approved  retroactively  an  increase  in  the  total  target  compensation  of  Prof.  Dr.  Ralf  P.  Thomas  effective October 1, 2021.  This  increase  was  implemented  by  raising  his  Stock  Awards  target  amount  to  \u20ac2,000,000  from \u20ac1,544,000.\n\nBy increasing the Stock Awards target amounts, variable compensation is structured on a more long-term basis, while compensation as a whole is oriented even more toward sustainable Company development.\n\nRegarding compensation, all components of the compensation of the position of President and CEO are differentiated. The target amount of Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas's Stock Awards is differentiated due to his particular responsibilities as CFO.\n\nThe following table shows the individualized target compensation of each Managing Board member and the relative proportions of total target compensation represented by each of the individual compensation components.",

Maximum compensation is equal to the total of the maximum amounts of all compensation components that can possibly be paid out to each Managing Board member for the relevant fiscal year. It is calculated by adding base salary, maximum fringe benefits and the BSAV contribution (or the amount for free disposal) as well as two times the Bonus target amount and three times the Stock Awards target amount. Twice the Bonus target amount and triple the Stock Awards target amount also correspond to the respective limits (individual caps) on the amount of variable compensation.\n\nThe following table shows the maximum compensation of each Managing Board member as approved by the Supervisory Board for fiscal 2022 in accordance with Section 87a para. 1 sent. 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\n| Maximum compensation fiscal 2022   | Maximum compensation fiscal 2022                                                      | Maximum compensation fiscal 2022      | Maximum compensation fiscal 2022   | Maximum compensation fiscal 2022   | Maximum compensation fiscal 2022   | Maximum compensation fiscal 2022   | Maximum compensation fiscal 2022   | Maximum compensation fiscal 2022   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                    |                                                                                       | Dr. Roland Busch                      |                                    | Cedrik Neike                       | Matthias Rebellius                 | Prof. Dr. Ralf P.

In no case did the fringe benefits awarded to a Managing Board member exceed the maximum amount defined for fiscal 2022. The Bonus cap was not reached in fiscal 2022.\n\nSince the 2022 Stock Awards tranche is not due until November 2025, compliance with the maximum limit of the Stock Awards for fiscal 2022 can be finally assessed only in November 2025, when the 2022 Stock Awards tranche is settled.\n\nThe final assessment of compliance with the maximum compensation for fiscal 2022 will be included in the Compensation Report for fiscal 2026.\n\n## B.2.3 Appropriateness of compensation\n\nThe Supervisory Board conducted the annual review of Managing Board compensation in order to determine the latter's appropriateness and conformity with market conditions. For this purpose, the Supervisory Board assessed -  with the assistance of an external and independent compensation consultant and in accordance with the compensation system the compensation's level and structure relative to the companies included in the DAX 40, the German blue-chip stock index, and relative to the companies included in the STOXX Europe 50 (horizontal comparison). In the course of its review, the Supervisory Board also assessed the development of Managing Board compensation relative to the compensation of Senior Management and Siemens' total workforce in Germany (vertical comparison). Senior Management comprises executive employees. The total workforce comprises Senior Management as well as the Siemens employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements and those who are not. In addition to a status quo analysis, the vertical comparison took into account the development of compensation ratios over time. Since Siemens Healthineers is a separately managed, publicly listed company, its workforce was not included in the vertical comparison.",

It consists of a short-term variable component (Bonus) and a long-term variable component (Stock Awards).\n\nThe performance criteria and the key performance indicators used to measure performance for variable compensation in fiscal  2022  are derived from the Company's strategic goals and operational steering and are in line with the current compensation system. As a rule, all the performance criteria measure successful value creation in all its different forms, as strategically envisioned. In line with Siemens' social responsibility, sustainability is also included in the performance criteria.\n\nThe performance criteria relevant for fiscal 2022, the key performance indicators, the focus topics and the explanations of how these foster the Company's long-term development are shown in the following table.\n\nPerformance criteria of variable compensation and link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Performance criterion             | Key performance indicator /  focus topic                          | Bonus   | Stock   | Awards  Link to  strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Profit                            | Earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA) |         |         | EPS reflects the net income attributable to the shareholders of Siemens AG and incentivizes the sustainable increase in profit -  particularly by focusing on profitable growth.

If they are not reached, variable compensation can be reduced to zero. If the targets are significantly exceeded, target achievement is capped at 200%.\n\n## B.3.1 Short-term variable compensation (Bonus)\n\n## B.3.1.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES AND FUNCTIONING\n\nThe Bonus system is based on three equally weighted target dimensions, which take account of the overall responsibility of the Managing Board as well as each Managing Board members' specific business responsibilities and individual challenges:\n\n- \u2192 'Siemens Group'\n- \u2192 'Managing Board portfolio'\n- \u2192 'Individual targets.'\n\nPerformance  criteria  are  assigned  to  each  of  the  three  target  dimensions  based  on  Company  priorities  and  the responsibilities of each Managing Board member. One financial performance criterion is assigned to the 'Siemens Group' dimension and another to the 'Managing Board portfolio' dimension. The fulfillment of these criteria is measured on the basis of key performance indicators. Within the 'Individual targets' dimension, the financial performance criteria 'growth' and  'liquidity'  can  be  employed  as  can  additional,  non-financial  performance  criteria.  In  the  case  of  non-financial performance criteria, the Supervisory Board considers the degree to which a Managing Board member has fulfilled so-called focus topics, which comprise operations-related aspects of the execution of the Company's strategy as well as sustainabilityrelated aspects.\n\nAt the end of the fiscal year, target achievement for the individual key performance indicators and the achievement of the Managing Board members' individual targets are determined and aggregated to form a weighted average. The percentage of weighted target achievement multiplied by the individual target amount yields the Bonus payout amount for the past fiscal year. The payable Bonus is capped at two times the target amount and is paid in cash, at the latest, together with the compensation paid at the end of February of the following fiscal year.",

BONUS FOR FISCAL 2022\n\n## 'Siemens Group' target dimension\n\nFor the 'Siemens Group' target dimension in fiscal 2022, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG defined the performance criterion 'profit.'  In accordance with external communications and the Siemens Financial Framework for the financial steering of the Company, the focus is on the transparent presentation of Siemens' operating performance. For this reason, 'profit' is measured in terms of basic earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA). EPS pre PPA is defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and related income taxes. It includes the amounts attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG.\n\nTo take account of the Company's long-term performance and provide incentives for a sustainable increase in profit, the average EPS pre PPA of three consecutive fiscal years was used for target setting. Because of the significant change in the portfolio of Siemens AG due to the spin-off of Siemens Energy at the end of fiscal 2020, target setting for fiscal 2022 was defined on the basis of the comparable EPS pre PPA values of continuing operations for the fiscal years 2019 and 2020 as well as the EPS pre PPA value for fiscal 2021.\n\nAs part of target achievement, the actual EPS pre PPA value of the reporting year is used to ensure that the focus in the reporting year is on performance.\n\nEarnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA): Target setting and target achievement\n\n<!-- image -->",

ROCE is defined as profit before interest and after tax divided by average capital employed. For the purposes of target setting and determining target achievement, ROCE - as defined in the Siemens Financial Framework, which excludes certain Varian-related acquisition effects - is adjusted for main effects relating to the stake in Siemens Energy (profit 'Siemens Energy Investment' in the numerator and asset 'Siemens Energy Investment' in the denominator). The target value for ROCE adjusted is derived from budget planning.\n\nAs a result of the war in Ukraine, Siemens AG decided to withdraw from the Russian market. This decision was neither foreseeable in budget planning, which is used as a basis for target setting, nor in the actual target setting in November 2021 and was thus not taken into account. In fiscal 2022, the necessary measures resulted in extraordinary charges of \u20ac1.3 billion. These charges are reflected in the financial key performance indicators in the Bonus - in particular, in ROCE adjusted  -  and  resulted  especially  from  the divestment and impairment of businesses, the  termination of customer contracts and write-downs of assets.\n\nIn the case of such unforeseeable extraordinary developments, it is at the discretion of the Supervisory Board whether to take them into account when determining target achievement. In order to acknowledge Siemens' performance in fiscal 2022 and the actual performance of Managing Board members in the context of variable compensation, the Supervisory Board has decided to take into account the effect of the withdrawal from the Russian market when determining the target achievement of ROCE adjusted.\n\nReturn on capital employed adjusted (ROCE adjusted): Target setting and target achievement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 'Individual targets' target dimension\n\nThe 'Individual targets' target dimension comprises four equally weighted individual targets, achievement of each of which may be between 0% and 200%.\n\nThe cash conversion rate (CCR) was defined as the first individual target for all Managing Board members. The CCR reflects a company's ability to convert profit into available cash. For the President and CEO and the Managing Board members with primarily functional responsibility, the CCR target was defined on the basis of the  Siemens  Group in order to support Siemens' voluntary commitment to generate cash at Group level. CCR Siemens Group is defined as the ratio of free cash flow  from  continuing and discontinued operations to  net income. For the Managing Board members with business",

BASIC PRINCIPLES AND FUNCTIONING\n\nSiemens grants long-term variable compensation in the form of Stock Awards. A Stock Award is the claim to one share conditional on target achievement - after the expiration of a defined vesting period. The vesting period is, accordingly, the term of each tranche.\n\nAt the beginning of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board defines a target amount in euros based on 100% target achievement for each Managing Board member. This target amount is extrapolated to target achievement of 200% ('maximum allocation amount'). Stock Awards for this maximum allocation amount are then allocated to the Managing Board members. The number of Stock Awards is calculated by dividing the maximum allocation amount by the price of the Siemens share on the allocation date, less the estimated discounted dividends ('allocation price').\n\nAn approximately four-year vesting period begins with the allocation of Stock Awards, after the expiration of which Siemens shares are transferred. The beneficiary Managing Board members are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period.\n\n## Performance criteria\n\nSince fiscal 2020, the number of Siemens shares that is actually transferred depends 80% on the financial performance criterion 'long-term value creation,' measured on the basis of the key performance indicator 'total shareholder return' (TSR), and 20% on the non-financial performance criterion 'sustainability.' For measuring the 'sustainability' performance criterion, Siemens AG's performance in the environment, social and governance (ESG) area is assessed on the basis of a Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index, the composition of which is determined annually by the Supervisory Board.\n\nTotal shareholder return - TSR is indicative of the performance of one share over a specified period of time - in the case of Siemens, over the approximately four-year vesting period. It takes into account changes in the share price and the dividends paid during this period. To reflect the Company's international footprint, the TSR of Siemens AG is compared at the end of the vesting period with the TSR of an international sector index, the MSCI World Industrials or a comparable successor index.\n\nTarget achievement for TSR is concretely determined by first calculating a TSR reference value for Siemens AG and a TSR reference value for the sector index. The TSR reference value is equal to the average of the end-of-month values over the first 12 months of the vesting period (reference period).",

Of the calculated number of Stock Awards reported here, 2,275 were awarded and paid by Siemens Ltd. China. For the calculation of the additional cash payment resulting from the Siemens Energy spin-off, the Siemens Energy share's Xetra closing price of \u20ac24.32 on November 11, 2021, was used, in accordance with the plan requirements applicable to the Managing Board, for the 7,889 Stock Awards awarded by Siemens AG, while the Siemens Energy share's Xetra closing price of \u20ac24.45 on November 12, 2021, was used, in accordance with the plan requirements applicable to Senior Management, for the 2,275 Stock Awards awarded by Siemens Ltd. China.\n\nIn the course of transferring the 2018 Stock Awards tranche, compliance with the maximum amounts of total compensation for fiscal 2018 was also reviewed.

For this reason, the number of Stock Awards from the 2018 tranche, as set out in the table, is based on a target achievement of 100%. Starting with the 2019 tranche, settlement of Stock Awards will be entirely by share transfer. For this reason, the number of Stock Awards, as set out in the table, is based on a target achievement of 200%. At the end of the vesting period, a final number of Siemens shares to be transferred will be determined on the basis of actual target achievement and taking into account the Stock Awards cap.\n- 2 The target achievement of the Stock Awards from the 2018 tranche, which were due and settled in fiscal 2022, was 91%. As the Stock Awards from the 2018 tranche were allocated on the basis of 100% target achievement, a number equivalent to this shortfall was forfeited without refund or replacement, in accordance with plan requirements.\n- 3 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board, Cedrik Neike served as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Siemens Ltd. China from May 1, 2017, to March 31, 2019. The reported figures include the Stock Awards allocated to Cedrik Neike by Siemens Ltd. China due to this position.\n- 4 The reported figures also include the Stock Awards allocated to Judith Wiese in November 2020 as compensation for the loss of benefits granted by her former employer in addition to the regular allocation of Stock Awards from the 2021 tranche.",

As a result, they include  all  the  amounts  actually  paid  to  individual  Managing  Board  members  in  the  reporting  period  ('awarded compensation') and/or all the compensation that is legally due but not yet received ('due compensation').\n\nThe Bonus is reported under 'Short-term variable compensation' as 'due compensation' since the underlying services were fully rendered by the end of each period (September 30). Therefore, the Bonus payout amounts for the reporting year are reported, although payout only occurs after the end of each reporting year, in order to make reporting transparent and comprehensible and in order to guarantee a connection between performance and compensation in the reporting period.\n\nFurthermore, in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, the Stock Awards from the 2018 and 2017 tranches allocated in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, became due and were settled by transfer of Siemens shares. The value of Siemens shares at the time of transfer is reported under 'Long-term variable compensation.'\n\nIn connection with the due date and settlement of the Stock Awards for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, the table also includes the additional cash payments to eligible Managing Board members as a result of the Siemens Energy spin-off. The spin-off of Siemens Energy in fiscal 2020 led to adjustments in the stock-based compensation allocations agreed upon until the spin-off date. At the time when the 2018 and 2017 Stock Awards became due, the Managing Board members - like all other eligible employees - were, accordingly, entitled to receive an additional cash payment based on the spin-off ratio of 2:1 and on the Siemens Energy share price of \u20ac24.32 and \u20ac22.20, respectively, on the date when their respective stockbased compensation allocations became due.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the amounts of compensation, Section 162 para. 1 sent. 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act requires disclosure of the relative proportion of total compensation represented by all fixed and variable compensation components. The relative proportions reported here refer to the compensation components 'awarded' and 'due' in the respective fiscal years in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\nAlthough the service costs for Company pension plans are not to be classified as awarded and due compensation, they are also reported in the following table for purposes of transparency.",

China from May 1, 2017, to March 31, 2019.

Likewise, a portion of the additional cash payment attributable to the Stock Awards allocated by Siemens Ltd. China is included under \"Cash payment Siemens Energy spin-off.\" For details, see chapter \"B.3.2.3 Transfer of Stock Awards in fiscal 2022 (2018 tranche).\"\n- 5 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, Matthias Rebellius is CEO of Smart Infrastructure and CEO of Siemens Schweiz AG.

Compensation of Supervisory Board members\n\nThe currently applicable rules for Supervisory Board compensation are set out in Section 17 of the Articles of Association of Siemens AG. They have been in effect since October 1, 2021, and stem from a decision of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 3, 2021, in accordance with Section 113 para. 3 of the German Stock Corporation Act. The compensation system for Supervisory Board members submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and the proposed new version of Section 17 of the Articles of Association were approved by a majority of 97.49% of the valid votes cast. The compensation system approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting as well as the Articles of Association are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE .\n\nSupervisory Board compensation consists entirely of fixed compensation; it reflects the responsibilities and scope of the work of the Supervisory Board members. Under the applicable rules, the members of the Supervisory Board receive base compensation  for  each  full  fiscal  year,  and  the  members  of  the  Audit  Committee,  the  Chairman's  Committee,  the Compensation Committee and the Innovation and Finance Committee receive additional compensation for their committee work. The Chairman and Deputy Chairs of the Supervisory Board as well as the chairs of the Audit Committee, the Chairman's Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Innovation and Finance Committee receive additional compensation.\n\nCompensation of members of the Supervisory Board and its committees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  the  event  of  changes  in  the  composition  of  the  Supervisory  Board  and/or  its  committees  within  a  fiscal  year, compensation is paid on a pro-rated basis, rounding up to the next full month.\n\nIn addition, the members of the Supervisory Board receive a fee of \u20ac2,000 for each of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees that they attend. Attendance at a meeting also includes participation via telephone, video conference or other similar customary means of communication. For attendance at several meetings on the same day, only a single fee is paid.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their duties and for any value-added tax to be paid on their compensation. For the performance of his duties, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is also entitled to an office with secretarial support and the use of a car service.

Comparative information on profit development and annual change in compensation\n\nThe following table shows, in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 2 No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act, Siemens' profit development, the annual change in the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members' compensation and the annual change in average employee compensation on a full-time equivalent basis over the last five fiscal years.\n\nProfit development is presented on the basis of the Siemens Group's key performance indicators revenue, comparable revenue growth and basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations. Through fiscal 2021, the latter was also one of the financial targets for the short-term variable compensation (Bonus) of the Managing Board and thus had a significant influence on the amount of the compensation of the Managing Board members. Beginning in fiscal 2022, the comparative information will also include basic earnings per share before purchase price allocation. This key performance indicator supersedes basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations in the Bonus in accordance with the Siemens Financial Framework, which has been in effect since fiscal 2022. In accordance with Section 275 para. 3 No. 16 of the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch , HGB), the development of the net income of Siemens AG is also shown.\n\nThe compensation awarded and due to the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members in each fiscal year is presented in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act. Pension payments to former members of the Managing Board are not listed here since they do not depend on Siemens' profit development.\n\nThe presentation of average employee compensation is based on the size of the workforce, including trainees, employed by Siemens in Germany. In fiscal 2022, this workforce comprised on average 69,767 employees (full-time equivalent). By way of comparison, the Siemens Group had about 247,000 employees and trainees worldwide as of September 30, 2022. The figures exclude the workforce of Siemens Healthineers, which is not included in the presentation since it is a separately managed, publicly listed company.\n\nAverage  employee  compensation  comprises  the  personnel  costs  for  wages  and  salaries,  fringe  benefits,  employer contributions to social insurance and any short-term variable compensation components attributable to the fiscal year. For compensation in connection with share plans, the amounts received in the fiscal year are taken into account. Therefore, employee compensation is also equivalent, in principle, to awarded and due compensation within the meaning of Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act and thus in line with Managing Board and Supervisory Board compensation.",

In fiscal 2020, the segments \"Gas and Power\" and \"Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy\" were classified as discontinued operations and are therefore not included in the amount reported for fiscal 2020.\n- 2 The primary measure for managing and controlling revenue growth is comparable growth, because it shows the development in Siemens' business net of currency translation effects arising from the external environment outside of Siemens' control and the portfolio effects that involve business activities that are either new to or no longer a part of the relevant business.\n- 3 Basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations as reported.\n- 4 The increase in compensation in fiscal 2019 is primarily attributable to the one-time benefit from two Stock Awards tranches -  the 2014 and 2015 tranches -  in November 2018, due to a reduction in the duration of the Stock Awards to the customary four-year period starting with the 2015 tranche.",

We have not audited the content of disclosures regarding appropriateness and marketability of the compensation in chapter B.2.3 APPROPRIATENESS OF COMPENSATION that is beyond the scope of Sec. 162 AktG.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board\n\nManagement and the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG are responsible for the preparation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures in compliance with the requirements of Sec. 162 AktG. In addition, management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a Compensation Report and the related disclosures that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this Compensation Report and the related disclosures based on our audit. We conducted our audit in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Compensation Report and the related disclosures are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts in the Compensation Report and the related disclosures. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures in order to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the Supervisory Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the Compensation Report for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022 and the related disclosures comply, in all material respects, with the financial reporting provisions of Sec. 162 AktG. Our opinion on the Compensation Report does not cover the content of the above mentioned disclosures of the Compensation Report that go beyond the scope of Sec. 162 AktG.\n\n## Other matter - formal audit of the Compensation Report\n\nThe audit of the content of the Compensation Report described in this auditor's report comprises the formal audit of the Compensation Report required by Sec. 162 (3) AktG and the issue of a report on this audit. As we are issuing an unqualified opinion on the audit of the content of the Compensation Report, this also includes the opinion that the disclosures pursuant to Sec. 162 (1) and (2) AktG are made in the Compensation Report in all material respects.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nBerlin and Munich, December /seven.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, Siemens AG accelerated growth, gained market share in its key markets and created ground\u00ad breaking innovations. These achievements were par\u00ad ticularly striking in view of the major disruptions that took place during the year - above all, Russia's war against Ukraine and the geopolitical, energy\u00adrelated and economic distortions that it entailed. Siemens strongly condemned this war, while demonstrating its ability to deal with the resulting disruptions. The Company's inno\u00ad vative, sustainability\u00adfocused portfolio proved to be a reliable, future\u00adoriented basis for business success.\n\nThe new image of Siemens that the Supervisory Board and the Managing Board are pursuing consistently and in close cooperation is gaining ever\u00adwider recognition the image of a globally successful technology company focused on industry, infrastructure, transport and health\u00ad care with strong business models in the areas of digitali\u00ad zation and sustainability.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, technology and sustainability were key focal topics of the Supervisory Board's work in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted. In the area of technology, the launch of Siemens Xcelerator - an open, digital business platform for accelerating the digital transformation of the global economy - is a particular highlight. The steps to imple\u00ad ment this groundbreaking project were continuously discussed by the Managing and Supervisory Boards. In the area of sustainability, the Supervisory Board paid particular attention to the further development of busi\u00ad ness models: effective solutions that cut CO /two.fitted emissions, reduce resource utilization and are indispensable for advanced economies. These solutions are becoming a centerpiece of successful business activity - both at Siemens and far beyond. In addition, the Supervisory Board intensively monitored the further development of DEGREE, Siemens' sustainability framework.\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, the Supervisory Board performed in full the duties assigned to it by law, the Siemens Articles of Asso\u00ad ciation and the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board. On the basis of detailed written and oral reports provided by the Managing Board, we monitored the Managing Board and advised it on the management of the Company. In my capacity as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, I regu\u00ad larly exchanged information with the President and CEO and the other Managing Board members. As a result, the Supervisory Board was always kept up to date on pro\u00ad jected business policies, Company planning - including financial, investment and personnel planning - and the Company's profitability and business operations as well as on the state of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group. We were directly involved at an early stage in all decisions of fundamental importance to the Company and dis\u00ad cussed these decisions with the Managing Board inten\u00ad sively and in detail. To the extent that Supervisory Board approval of the decisions and measures of Company management was required by law, the Siemens Articles of Association or our Bylaws, the members of the Super\u00ad visory Board - prepared in some cases by the Supervisory Board's committees - issued such approval after inten\u00ad sive review and discussion.\n\nA special focus of our activities in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted was the fur\u00ad ther implementation of the Company's growth strategy. At our meetings and in additional informational sessions, we concerned ourselves intensively with the goals and priorities of Siemens' businesses and with the Managing Board's technology and personnel strategy. In this con\u00ad nection, we focused our attention on the accelerated transformation toward digitalization, sustainability and business and technological innovation and on the related opportunities for growth. Together with the Managing Board, we discussed markets, trends and growth fields. An additional focus of our activities in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted was Siemens AG's sustainability strategy. We concerned our\u00ad selves with sustainability\u00adrelated topics in the environ\u00ad mental, social and governance (ESG) area. At the center",

The Supervisory Board discussed the risks and opportunities for the Company connected with social and environmen\u00ad tal factors as well as the environmental and social impact of the Company's activities. The Supervisory Board also concerned itself with the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted Sustainability Report.\n\n## Topics at the plenary meetings of the Supervisory Board\n\nWe  held  a  total  of  six  regular  plenary  meetings  in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted. Two meetings were held in person, two in a virtual  format via video conference and two in a so\u00adcalled hybrid format - that is, as in\u00adperson meetings with the pos\u00ad sibility of virtual participation. No meetings were held via telephone conference. We also made four decisions using other customary means of communication. Topics of dis\u00ad cussion at our regular plenary meetings were revenue, profit and employment development at Siemens AG and the Siemens Group, the Company's financial position and the results of its operations, personnel\u00adrelated matters and sustainability. In addition, we concerned ourselves, as oc\u00ad casion required, with acquisition and divestment projects and with risks to the Company. We received regular reports from the Managing Board regarding the political and eco\u00ad nomic consequences of the war in Ukraine, its impact on Siemens and the impact on Siemens of the COVID\u00ad/one.fitted/nine.fitted pan\u00ad demic. In this connection, we discussed, in particular, the risk of bottlenecks in the supply chain. In addition, we met regularly in closed sessions without the Managing Board in attendance. In these sessions, we dealt with agenda items that concerned either the Managing Board itself or internal Supervisory Board matters.\n\nOn October /one.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, the Supervisory approved - in a decision using other customary means of communi\u00ad cation - the Managing Board's preliminary decision re\u00ad garding the holding of the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Annual Shareholders' Meeting in a virtual format.\n\nAt our meeting on November /one.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, we discussed the key financial figures for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted and approved the  budget for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted. On a recommendation by the Compensation Committee, we also defined the Manag\u00ad ing Board members' compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted on the basis of calculated target achievement. A review con\u00ad ducted by an external compensation expert confirmed\n\nthe appropriateness of this compensation. We had al\u00ad ready defined the performance criteria for the Managing Board's variable compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted at our meeting on September /two.fitted/two.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. On this basis and on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, we made a decision on target setting for Managing Board compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted at our meeting on Novem\u00ad ber /one.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. At this meeting, we also approved the Corporate Governance Statement for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nOn December /two.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, we discussed the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted Annual Financial Report - comprising the financial statements and the Combined Management Report for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted - as well as the Report of the Supervisory Board to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Sustainability Report, the Com\u00ad pensation Report for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted and the agenda for the ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /one.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted. In addition, we concerned ourselves with the annual reporting by the Chief Compliance Officer and the Global Chief Cybersecurity Officer. As part of a technology focus, the Managing Board reported on the status of Siemens Xcelerator, the Company's open digital busi\u00ad ness platform for accelerating the digital transformation. We  also  concerned  ourselves  with  personnel\u00adrelated matters regarding the Managing Board. With a view to the long\u00adterm succession planning for the composition of the  Managing Board, we decided - on the recommen\u00ad dation of the Chairman's Committee - to terminate Prof. Dr. Ralf  Thomas's current appointment by mutual consent, effective the end of December /one.fitted/four.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, and to re appoint Prof. Dr. Ralf Thomas a full member of the Managing Board for a term of office extending from December /one.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, through December /one.fitted/four.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/six.fitted.\n\nOn January /one.fitted/seven.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, we approved - in a decision using other customary means of communication - the Manag\u00ad ing Board's decision to sell the Yunex Traffic road traffic business to Atlantia S. p.

The focus was on the political and economic consequences of the war in Ukraine and on the war's impact on Siemens. The Manag\u00ad ing Board informed us about its decision, as a result of the war in Ukraine, to withdraw from the Russian market and to wind down the Company's industrial business activi\u00ad ties in Russia through an orderly process. As part of a stra\u00ad tegic and technology focus, we concerned ourselves at this meeting extensively and in detail with the growth targets and the further implementation of Siemens' strat\u00ad egy as a focused technology company. We discussed the market and business situation and the Company's strat\u00ad egy for China. The Managing Board informed us about the planned market launch of Siemens Xcelerator, the Company's open digital business platform, and reported on the business situation at Siemens Financial Services. We were also informed about the planned acquisition of Brightly Software, Inc., USA, a leading U. S. software\u00ad  as\u00ada\u00ad service (SaaS) provider in the area of building technology. On June /two.fitted/three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, we approved - in a decision using other customary means of communication - the Managing Board's decision regarding this acquisition.\n\nOn June /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, we were informed about the publi\u00ad cation of an ad hoc announcement in which Siemens AG reported an extraordinary write\u00addown of its at\u00adequity investment in Siemens Energy AG.\n\nAt our meeting on August /one.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, the Managing Board reported on the Company's current business and finan\u00ad cial position and on personnel\u00adrelated matters, as of the third quarter. The Managing Board explained to us, in particular, the unscheduled write\u00addown of the  Company's investment in Siemens Energy AG, which was published in an ad hoc announcement, and the resulting nontax\u00ad deductible impairment in the third quarter of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted. Sustainability\u00adrelated topics were also a  focus of the meeting. We dealt with the Company's sustainability\n\nstrategy as well as the Companywide DEGREE sustainabil\u00ad ity framework. We discussed the Company's business opportunities connected with sustainability\u00adrelated fac\u00ad tors and concerned ourselves with business potential particularly in the areas of decarbonization, energy effi\u00ad ciency and resource efficiency. We also discussed the re\u00ad quirements of the EU Taxonomy and their impact on Siemens. With regard to Siemens Healthineers, we were informed about progress in the integration of Varian. We discussed  the  business  situation  and  the  Managing Board's deliberations in the area of Large Drives Applica\u00ad tions. We approved the Managing Board's decision to sell Siemens Financial Services' leasing business in Russia. As part of regular reporting on the activities of the Super visory Board committees, we were informed that the  Audit Committee had decided - following a compre\u00ad hensive tendering process in accordance with the current European legal norms - to propose that the Super\u00ad visory Board recommend to shareholders at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/four.fitted two audit firms - Price\u00ad waterhouseCoopers GmbH, Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesell\u00ad schaft,  Frankfurt  a.  M.,  and  KPMG AG,  Wirtschafts\u00ad pr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, M\u00fcnchen, with a preference for PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH - as independent audi\u00ad tors for the tendered audit mandate for the fiscal year beginning on October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted. We discussed the results of the Super visory Board's comprehensive self\u00adassess\u00ad ment,  which  had  been  conducted  in  May  through July /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted with the support of an external consultant, and the resulting recommendations and measures. Finally, we made a decision regarding the engagement of an independent compensation expert to conduct an appro\u00ad priateness review of Managing Board compensation in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted.\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  meeting  on  September /two.fitted/three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, was held at the Company 's locomotive plant in Munich\u00adAllach, Germany. While touring the facility, we familiarized ourselves with the advanced production methods at the longstanding location and had products for freight and passenger transport and the modular and adaptable approach to manufacturing explained to us. At the meeting, the Managing Board reported on the state of the Company. The Company's personnel strategy - in\u00ad cluding talent and leadership development, long\u00adterm succession planning for the composition of the Managing Board and diversity - was also a focus of this meeting. We discussed the Managing Board's  considerations regarding the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted budget. In connection with Siemens' strategy,",

        "page_content": "the Managing Board reported to us on the successful market launch of Siemens Xcelerator, the Company's open  digital  business  platform.  Under  the  heading ' Future of Industrial Operations,' the Managing Board reported to us - as part of an in\u00addepth focus - on Digital Industries' strategic approach to the acceleration of the digital transformation. In light of the changes in market conditions due to digitalization and the change in cus\u00ad tomer behavior, the Managing Board also reported to us on the transformation of the Company's sales activities. We approved the Managing Board's decision regarding the Facility Siemensstadt Square Project in Berlin, Ger\u00ad many. A further focus of the meeting was Managing Board compensation. A review by an independent com\u00ad pensation expert confirmed the appropriateness of this compensation in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted. As part of the annual review of Managing Board compensation and - after prepara\u00ad tion by and on a recommendation of the Compensation Committee - we defined each Managing Board mem\u00ad ber's individual target total compensation and maximum compensation as well as the performance criteria for vari\u00ad able compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted. At this meeting, we also made a decision regarding the engagement of an auditor for the Compensation Report for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted. In addition, we dealt with matters relating to corporate gov\u00ad ernance, in particular, with the Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code. Due to changes in the legal requirements and the reform of the German Corporate Governance Code in /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, we ap\u00ad proved changes to the diversity concept for the Manag\u00ad ing Board and to the objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board as well as the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Supervi\u00ad sory Board. We concerned ourselves with the indepen\u00ad dence of the Supervisory Board members within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code and with the qualification matrix for the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Corporate Governance Code\n\nAt our meeting on September /two.fitted/three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, we approved a Declaration of Conformity in accordance with Section /one.fitted/six.fitted/one.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz , AktG). Information on corporate governance is provided in the Corporate Governance Statement, which is  publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW. SIEMENS.COM/CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE.

The  current Declaration of Conformity is also available in the Corpo\u00ad rate Governance Statement.\n\n## Work in the Supervisory Board committees\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, the Supervisory Board had six standing committees. These committees prepare proposals and issues to be dealt with at the Supervisory Board's plenary meetings. Some of the Supervisory Board's decision\u00admak\u00ad ing powers have been delegated to these committees within the permissible legal framework. The committee chairpersons report to the Supervisory Board on their committees' work at the subsequent Board meeting. A list of the members and a detailed explanation of the tasks of the individual Supervisory Board committees are set out in the Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nThe Chairman's Committee met eight times. Two meet\u00ad ings were held in person, four in a virtual format via video conference and two in a so\u00adcalled hybrid format. The Chairman's Committee also made two decisions using other customary means of communication. In my capac\u00ad ity as Chairman of the Chairman's Committee, I discussed topics of major importance with the other Committee members also between meetings. The Committee con\u00ad cerned itself, in particular, with personnel\u00adrelated mat\u00ad ters, long\u00adterm succession planning for the composition of the Managing Board, corporate governance issues and the acceptance by Managing Board members of positions at other companies and institutions.",

The Nominating Committee gave in\u00addepth consideration to  succession  planning  for  the  composition  of  the Supervisory Board. Based on the results of the Super\u00ad visory Board's self\u00adassessment, which was conducted in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, the Nominating Committee further devel\u00ad oped the qualification matrix for the Supervisory Board. One focus of the Nominating Committee's activities in fiscal  /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted was  the  preparation  of  the  Supervisory Board's nominations of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board for election by the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Nominating Committee was supported in this connection by an external consulting firm. In selecting the potential candidates and in pre\u00ad paring a recommendation for the Supervisory Board decision, the Nominating Committee gave particular con\u00ad sideration to the objectives that the Supervisory Board had previously approved for its composition, including the profile of required skills and expertise, the diversity concept and the further developed qualification matrix for the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Mediation Committee had no need to meet.\n\nThe  Compensation Committee met three times. All three meetings were held in person. The Compensation Committee also made two decisions using other custom\u00ad ary means of communication. The Compensation Com\u00ad mittee prepared, in particular, Supervisory Board deci\u00ad sions regarding the definition of performance criteria and the targets for variable compensation, the determination and review of the appropriateness of Managing Board compensation and the approval of the Compensation Report. In addition, the Compensation Committee pre\u00ad pared the Supervisory Board's decision regarding the engagement of an auditor for the Compensation Report for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted.\n\n## The Innovation and Finance Committee met two times.\n\nOne meeting was held in person and one in a so\u00adcalled hybrid format. The Innovation and Finance Committee's work focused on innovation\u00ad and technology\u00adrelated top\u00ad ics. The Innovation and Finance Committee discussed the Company's strategic priorities, technologies and growth opportunities relating to the industrial metaverse. Under the heading 'UX Transformation,' the Managing Board reported on progress in user\u00adcentered product design.\n\nThe Innovation and Finance Committee also concerned itself with Next/four.fitted/seven.fitted, the independent unit established by Siemens in /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/six.fitted to bundle the Company 's venture capital activities in order to foster disruptive ideas more inten\u00ad sively and expedite the development of new technolo\u00ad gies. In addition, the Committee's meetings focused on the discussion of the pension system and the preparation and approval of investment and divestment projects and / or financial measures. The Innovation and Finance Committee approved the Managing Board's decision re\u00ad garding the Siemens Campus Erlangen Project.\n\nThe Audit Committee held six regular meetings. Three meetings were held in person, one in a virtual format via video conference and two in a so\u00adcalled hybrid format. In the presence of the independent auditors, the President and CEO, the Chief Financial Officer, the General Coun\u00ad sel, the Head of Accounting and the Head of Corporate Audit, the Audit Committee dealt with the financial state\u00ad ments  and  the  Combined  Management  Report  for Siemens AG  and  the  Siemens  Group,  including  the non\u00adfinancial information integrated into the Combined Management Report. It discussed the Half\u00adyear Financial Report and the quarterly statements with the Managing Board and the independent auditors. In the presence of the independent auditors, it also discussed the report on the auditors' review of the Company's Half\u00adyear Consoli\u00ad dated Financial Statements and of its Interim Group Man\u00ad agement Report. As part of the preparation and imple\u00ad mentation of the audit, the Audit Committee regularly exchanged views with the independent auditors without the Managing Board in attendance. In addition, it met regularly in closed sessions without the Managing Board and the independent auditors in attendance. Outside its meetings, the Chairman of the Audit Committee regu\u00ad larly exchanged views with the independent auditors re\u00ad garding the progress of the audit and reported to the Audit Committee thereon. The Audit Committee recom\u00ad mended that the Supervisory Board propose to the An\u00ad nual Shareholders' Meeting that Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, be elected independent auditors for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted. It awarded the audit contract for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted to the independent auditors, who had been elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, defined the audit's focus areas and determined the audi\u00ad tors' fee. The Audit Committee defined the audit plan and the Audit Committee's focus areas. It monitored the se\u00ad lection, independence, qualification, rotation and effi\u00ad ciency of the independent auditors as well as the services",

In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, against the backdrop of the Wirecard situa\u00ad tion, the Audit Committee regularly discussed the role of Ernst & Young  GmbH  Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, as the independent auditors of Wirecard AG. The Audit Committee questioned the independent audi\u00ad tors regarding this matter and assessed the impact on Siemens AG. No impediments were identified that would preclude  Ernst & Young  GmbH  Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungs\u00ad gesellschaft, Stuttgart, from being elected to serve as independent auditors for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted. The Audit Commit\u00ad tee also dealt with the Company's accounting and ac\u00ad counting process, the appropriateness and effectiveness of its internal control system and its risk management system (including sustainability\u00adrelated aspects), and the effectiveness, resources and findings of its internal audit as well as with reports concerning potential and pending legal disputes. In addition, the Audit Committee con\u00ad cerned itself with the Company's compliance with legal requirements, official regulations and the Company's internal guidelines (compliance) and dealt, in particular, with the quarterly reports, the Chief Compliance Offi\u00ad cer's annual report and the compliance management system. For this topic, the Managing Board member re\u00ad sponsible for People & Organization also attended the Audit Committee meetings at the invitation of the Audit Committee Chairman. The Audit Committee concerned itself with the new German Supply Chain Act ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz , LkSG). It also focused on the current and future regulatory requirements regarding sustainability reporting and its implementation, includ\u00ad ing, in particular, the requirements of the EU Taxonomy. Due to the regular external rotation of independent audi\u00ad tors at the conclusion of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted required in accor\u00ad dance with the current legal situation, the Audit Commit\u00ad tee's work in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted also focused on the preparation and implementation of a transparent and non\u00addiscrimi\u00ad natory process for the selection of the independent audi\u00ad tors for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/four.fitted. At its meeting on August /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, the Audit Committee had already approved for this purpose the introduction of a tendering process in accordance with Article /one.fitted/six.fitted of the EU audit regulation (Regulation (EU) No. /five.fitted/three.fitted/seven.fitted / /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/four.fitted of the European Parliament and of the Council of April /one.fitted/six.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/four.fitted, on specific requirements regarding the\n\nstatutory audit of public\u00adinterest entities and repealing Commission Decision /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/five.fitted / /nine.fitted/zero.fitted/nine.fitted / EG, 'EU audit regula\u00ad tion'). After a thorough review of the applicants, the Audit Committee decided to propose to the Supervisory Board two  audit  firms  -  PricewaterhouseCoopers  GmbH, Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft,  Frankfurt  a.  M.,  and KPMG AG,  Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft,  M\u00fcnchen, with a preference for PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH - as independent auditors for the tendered audit mandate for the fiscal year beginning on October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted.\n\nThe Supervisory Board members take part, on their own responsibility, in the educational and training measures necessary for the performance of their duties - measures relating, for example, to changes in the legal framework and new, groundbreaking technologies. The Company supports them in this regard. Internal informational events are offered when necessary to support targeted training measures. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, two internal training events  concerning  strategically  relevant  technology\u00ad related topics were held for all Supervisory Board mem\u00ad bers: one on March /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, and one on April /one.fitted/two.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted.\n\nNew Supervisory Board members can meet with Manag\u00ad ing Board members and other managers with specialist responsibility to exchange views on current topics and topics of fundamental importance and thus gain an over\u00ad view of Company\u00adrelevant matters (onboarding). There was no need for such informational events in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted since the Supervisory Board's composition did not change over the course of the year.\n\n## Disclosure of participation by individual Supervisory Board members in meetings\n\nThe average rate of participation by members in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees was /nine.fitted/eight.fitted %. Due to the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID\u00ad/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic, all meetings in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted were held not only in person but also in a virtual format via video conference or as in\u00adperson meetings in which virtual participation was also possible (so\u00adcalled hybrid meetings). No meetings were held via telephone confer\u00ad ence. The participation rate of individual members in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees is set out in the following chart:",

The convening of a share\u00ad holders' meeting - even taking into account the short\u00ad ened time limits stipulated in the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act ( Wertpapiererwerbs\u00ad und \u00dcbernahmegesetz, Wp\u00dcG) - is an organizational chal\u00ad lenge for large publicly listed companies. It appears doubtful whether the associated effort is justified also in cases where no relevant decisions by the shareholders' meeting are intended. Therefore, extraordinary share\u00ad holders' meetings shall be convened only in appropriate cases.\n\nFurther corporate governance practices applied beyond the applicable legal requirements are contained in our Business Conduct Guidelines, which are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ COMPLIANCE .",

The Companywide DEGREE pro\u00ad gram, which was approved by the Managing Board in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, intensified the focus of all Siemens businesses on ambitious sustainability targets - targets for environ\u00ad mental and social sustainability and good governance even further.

Manag\u00ad ing Board members may engage in secondary activities in particular, supervisory board positions outside the Siemens Group - only with the approval of the Chairman's Committee of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is responsible for decisions regarding any adjust\u00ad ments to Managing Board compensation that are neces\u00ad sary in order to take account of compensation for second\u00ad ary activities. Every Managing Board member is under an obligation to disclose conflicts of interest without delay to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and to inform the other members of the Managing Board thereof.\n\nFurther details regarding the operation and composition of the Managing Board are provided in the Bylaws for the Managing Board, which are publicly available on the  Siemens  Global  Website  at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ BYLAWS-MANAGINGBOARD .\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Siemens AG has /two.fitted/zero.fitted members.

The Supervisory Board approves the Managing Board's proposal for the appropriation of net income and the Report of the Supervisory Board to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Supervisory Board is jointly responsible with the Managing Board for the preparation of the Compensation Report. In addition, the Company's adherence to statutory provisions, official regulations and internal Company policies (compliance) are monitored by the Supervisory Board and  /  or the Audit Committee. The Supervisory Board's oversight and advi\u00ad sory activities also encompass, in particular, sustainabili\u00ad ty\u00adrelated topics in the environmental, social and gover\u00ad nance (ESG) area. The Managing Board reports regularly to the Supervisory Board on Siemens' Companywide sus\u00ad tainability strategy and on the status of this strategy's implementation. The Supervisory Board deals with both the risks and the opportunities for Siemens relating to social and environmental factors and the environmental and social impact of the Company's activities. The Super\u00ad visory Board and the Audit Committee also concern themselves with sustainability reporting, which includes the Sustainability Report in addition to reporting on non\u00adfinancial matters in the Combined Management Re\u00ad port, and are kept up to date on new developments and the status of their implementation at Siemens. In addi\u00ad tion, the Supervisory Board appoints and dismisses the members of the Managing Board and determines each member's portfolios. The Supervisory Board approves on the basis of a proposal by the Compensation Commit\u00ad tee - the compensation system for Managing Board members and defines their concrete compensation in accordance with this system. It sets the individual targets for the variable compensation and the total compensa\u00ad tion of each individual Managing Board member, reviews\n\nthe appropriateness of total compensation and regularly reviews the Managing Board compensation system.

The Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Managing Board in attendance. Every Supervisory Board member must disclose conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board. Information regarding conflicts of in\u00ad terest that may have arisen and their handling is provided in the Report of the Supervisory Board. Special informa\u00ad tional (onboarding) events are held in order to familiarize new Supervisory Board members with the Company's business model and the structures of the Siemens Group. The Supervisory Board members take part, on their own responsibility, in the educational and training measures necessary for the performance of their duties - measures relating, for example, to changes in the legal framework and new, groundbreaking technologies.

The members of the Audit Committee are, as a group, familiar with the sector in which the Company operates. Pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, the Super visory Board must have at least one member with expertise in the area of accounting and at least one ad\u00ad ditional member with expertise in the auditing of finan\u00ad cial statements. According to the Code, expertise in the area of accounting consists of specialist knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, while  expertise  in  the  area  of  auditing  consists  of specialist knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial  statements.  Accounting  and  auditing  also include  sustainability  reporting  and  its  audit  and assurance. In the person of Matthias Zachert, the Super\u00ad visory Board and the Audit Committee have at least one member with expertise in the area of accounting and in the person of Dr. Werner Brandt, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, at least one additional member with expertise in the area of auditing. Pursuant to the Code, the chair of the Audit Committee shall be an expert in at least one of these two areas and independent. The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr. Werner Brandt, fulfills these requirements.\n\nIn the course of his professional career, Matthias Zachert has served as the chief financial officer of a variety of publicly listed companies and thus has specialist knowl\u00ad edge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management sys\u00ad tems, including sustainability reporting. His activities as the chief financial officer of a publicly listed international company include engagement with non\u00adfinancial aspects and the reporting thereon. As the current chief executive officer and former chief financial officer of Lanxess AG, Matthias Zachert has extensive knowledge of the require\u00ad ments for sustainability reporting and of current develop\u00ad ments in this area. Matthias Zachert follows and moni\u00ad tors current developments in sustainability reporting and\n\nactively applies this expertise for the benefit of the Super\u00ad visory Board and the Audit Committee of Siemens AG.\n\nDue to his many years of work at a major auditing firm the former Price Waterhouse GmbH - and his many years of service as the chief financial officer of publicly listed international companies - Fresenius Medical Care AG and, subsequently, SAP AG - Dr. Werner Brandt has spe\u00ad cialist knowledge and experience in the auditing of finan\u00ad cial statements. Due to his above\u00admentioned activities and his many years of experience as the chairman of the supervisory board and audit committee of various pub\u00ad licly listed international companies, he also has specialist knowledge and experience in the application of account\u00ad ing principles and internal control and risk management systems and thus has expertise in the area of accounting. In addition, Dr. Werner Brandt is independent. As former chief financial officer of various companies and as the current chairman of the supervisory board of RWE AG and Chairman of the Audit Committee of Siemens AG, Dr. Werner Brandt also has extensive knowledge regard\u00ad ing sustainability reporting. Dr. Werner Brandt follows current developments in sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance and is an active participant in discus\u00ad sions of this topic in expert committees. He actively applies this expertise for the benefit of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee of Siemens AG.\n\nThe Nominating Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Supervisory Board on suitable candidates for the election by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of shareholder representatives on the Super\u00ad visory Board. In preparing these recommendations, the objectives defined by the Supervisory Board for its com\u00ad position and the approved diversity concept - in particu\u00ad lar, independence and diversity - are to be appropriately considered, as are the proposed candidates' required knowledge, abilities and professional experience. Fulfill\u00ad ment of the required profile of skills and expertise is also to be aimed at. Attention shall be paid to an appropriate participation of women and men in accordance with the legal requirements relating to the gender quota as well as to ensuring that the members of the Supervisory Board are, as a group, familiar with the sector in which the Company operates.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, the Nominating Committee comprised Jim Hagemann Snabe (Chairman), Dr. Werner Brandt, Beno\u00eet Potier and Dr. Nathalie von Siemens.",

In addition, the Innovation and Finance Committee has been authorized by the Supervisory Board to decide on the approval of transactions and measures that require Supervisory Board approval and have a value of between \u20ac /three.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted million and \u20ac /six.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted million.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, the Innovation and Finance Committee  comprised  Jim  Hagemann  Snabe  (Chair\u00ad man), Tobias B\u00e4umler, Harald Kern, J\u00fcrgen Kerner, Dr. \u00adIng.

Sustainability is one of the fo\u00ad cus topics of the Supervisory Board's work. Sustainability is of such central importance for Siemens that it is dis\u00ad cussed regularly and in detail at the Supervisory Board's plenary meetings. As a cross\u00adcutting issue, sustainability touches on the areas of responsibility of several commit\u00ad tees. To the extent that sustainability affects reporting, the Audit Committee considers sustainability\u00adrelated questions in detail and reports on these matters at the Supervisory Board's plenary meetings. To prepare for dis\u00ad cussions and decisions at these meetings, the sustain\u00ad ability\u00adrelated aspects of Managing Board compensation are dealt with in the Compensation Committee.\n\nFurther details regarding the operation and composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees are pro\u00ad vided in the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board and the bylaws for its committees, which are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE .\n\n## SUPERVISORY BOARD SELF-ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Supervisory Board and its committees regularly con\u00ad duct reviews - either internally or with the involvement of external consultants - in order to determine how effi\u00ad ciently they perform their duties. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, the Su\u00ad pervisory Board conducted a comprehensive self\u00adassess\u00ad ment with the support of an external consultant. This assessment also took into account the Managing Board's perspective. The Supervisory Board discussed the assess\u00ad ment's results and the measures to be derived from it at its meetings on August /one.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, and September /two.fitted/three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted. The results of the assessment confirm that cooper\u00ad ation within the Supervisory Board and with the Manag\u00ad ing Board is professional, constructive and characterized by a high degree of trust and openness. The composition and structure of the Supervisory Board, including the structure and mechanisms of its committees, were as\u00ad sessed as effective and efficient. The results also confirm that meetings are organized and conducted efficiently and that the participants receive sufficient information. The external consultant confirmed that, in all key catego\u00ad ries, the results compare well with those of oversight bodies at other companies. The review did not reveal a need for any fundamental changes. Individual sugges\u00ad tions for improvement are also discussed and imple\u00ad mented during the year.\n\n5.  Targets, within the meaning of Section /seven.fitted/six.fitted para. /four.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act, for the quota of women at the two management levels below the Managing Board; Information on Managing Board compliance with the participation require\u00ad ment and Supervisory Board compliance with minimum gender quota requirements\n\nPursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, the Man\u00ad aging Board of Siemens AG must include at least one woman and at least one man (minimum participation requirement). In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, Siemens AG complied with this requirement.

For  the Siemens Group worldwide, the targets set out in the Companywide DEGREE sustainability framework con\u00ad tinue to apply without change.\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board fulfilled the legal requirements regarding the minimum gender quota in the reporting period.\n\nStatutory provisions on the equal participation of men and women in management positions that may be appli\u00ad cable to Group companies other than Siemens AG remain unaffected.\n\n## 6.  Diversity concept for the Managing Board and long\u00adterm succession planning\n\nIn September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, the Supervisory Board approved the following diversity concept for the composition of the Managing Board:\n\n'The goal of this diversity concept is to achieve a com\u00ad position that is as diverse as possible and comprises individuals who complement one another in a Manag\u00ad ing Board that provides strong leadership and brings different perspectives to the management of the Company as well as to ensure that, as a group, the members of the Managing Board have all the know\u00ad how and skills that are considered essential in view of Siemens' activities.\n\nWhen selecting members of the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board pays close attention to candidates' personal suitability, integrity, convincing leadership qualities, international experience, expertise in their prospective areas of responsibility, achievements to date and knowledge of the Company as well as their ability to adjust business models and processes in a changing world. Diversity with respect to such charac\u00ad teristics as age and gender as well as professional and educational background is an important selection cri\u00ad terion for appointments to Managing Board positions. When selecting members of the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board also gives special consideration to the following factors:\n\n- In addition to the expertise and management and leadership experience required for their specific tasks, the Managing Board members shall have the broadest possible range of knowledge and experi\u00ad ence and the widest possible educational and pro\u00ad fessional backgrounds.\n- Taking the Company's international orientation into account, the composition of the Managing Board shall reflect internationality with respect to different cultural backgrounds and international experience (such as extensive professional experi\u00ad ence in foreign countries and responsibility for business activities in foreign countries in areas that are relevant for Siemens).",

According to the legal requirement applicable to Siemens AG (Section /seven.fitted/six.fitted para. /three.fitted a of the German Stock Corpora\u00ad tion Act), the Managing Board must include at least one woman and at least one man (minimum partici\u00ad pation requirement). Beyond the minimum partici\u00ad pation requirement, the consideration of women is an essential aspect of the Supervisory Board's long\u00ad term succession planning for the Managing Board.\n- It is considered helpful if different age groups are represented on the Managing Board. In accordance with the recommendation of the Code, the Super\u00ad visory Board has defined an age limit for the mem\u00ad bers of the Managing Board. In keeping with this limit, the members of the Managing Board are, as a rule, to be not older than /six.fitted/three.fitted years of age.\n\nWhen making an appointment to a specific Managing Board position, the decisive factor is always the Com\u00ad pany's best interest, taking into consideration all cir\u00ad cumstances in the individual case.'\n\n## Implementation of the diversity concept for the Managing Board in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted\n\nThe diversity concept for the Managing Board is imple\u00ad mented as part of the process for making appointments to  the  Managing  Board.  When  selecting  candidates and  /  or making proposals for the appointment of Manag\u00ad ing Board members, the Supervisory Board and  /  or the Chairman's Committee of the Supervisory Board take into account the requirements defined in the diversity con\u00ad cept for the Managing Board.\n\nIn its current composition, the Managing Board fulfills all the requirements of the diversity concept. The Manag\u00ad ing Board members have a broad range of knowledge,\n\nexperience  and  educational  and  professional  back\u00ad grounds as well as international experience. The Manag\u00ad ing Board has all the knowledge and experience that is considered essential in view of Siemens' activities. As a group, the Managing Board has experience in the busi\u00ad ness areas that are important for Siemens - in particular, in the industry, infrastructure, energy, mobility and healthcare sectors - as well as many years of experience in technology (including information technology, digita\u00ad lization and cybersecurity), sustainability, transforma\u00ad tion, procurement, manufacturing, research and devel\u00ad opment, sales, finance, risk management, law (including compliance) and human resources.\n\nSiemens AG complies with the minimum participation requirement set out in Section /seven.fitted/six.fitted para. /three.fitted a of the German Stock Corporation Act. The Managing Board has one fe\u00ad male member, Judith Wiese. Beyond the minimum par\u00ad ticipation requirement, the consideration of women is a key component of the Supervisory Board's long\u00adterm succession planning for the Managing Board. Different age groups are represented on the Managing Board. No Managing Board member is currently older than /six.fitted/three.fitted years of age.\n\n## Long-term succession planning for the Managing Board\n\nJointly with the Managing Board and with the support of the Chairman's Committee, the Supervisory Board con\u00ad ducts long\u00adterm succession planning for the Managing Board. In its long\u00adterm succession planning, the Super\u00ad visory Board takes into account the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Code and the Bylaws for the Chairman's Committee as well as the criteria set out in the diversity concept it has approved for the Man\u00ad aging Board's composition. Considering the concrete qualification requirements and the above\u00admentioned criteria, the Chairman's Committee prepares an ideal profile. When a concrete decision regarding succession is to be made, it compiles a shortlist of the available candi\u00ad dates on the basis of this profile. Structured interviews are then conducted with these candidates. After the in\u00ad terviews, a proposal is submitted to the Supervisory Board for approval. When developing the profile of re\u00ad quirements and selecting candidates, the Supervisory Board and the Chairman's Committee are supported, if necessary, by external consultants.",

Objectives regarding the Supervisory Board's composition as well as the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Super\u00ad visory Board\n\nIn September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, the Supervisory Board approved the objectives for its composition including the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept:\n\n'The  composition  of  the  Supervisory  Board  of Siemens AG shall be such that the Supervisory Board's ability to effectively monitor and advise the Managing Board is ensured. In this connection, mutually comple\u00ad mentary collaboration among members with a wide range  of  personal  and  professional  backgrounds and diversity with regard to internationality, age and gender are considered helpful.\n\n## Profile of required skills and expertise\n\nThe candidates proposed for election to the Super\u00ad visory Board shall have the knowledge, skills and ex\u00ad perience necessary to carry out the functions of a Supervisory Board member in a multinational com\u00ad pany oriented toward the capital markets and to safe\u00ad guard the reputation of Siemens in public. In particu\u00ad lar, care shall be taken with regard to the personality, integrity, commitment and professionalism of the individuals proposed for election.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that, in the Supervisory Board, as a group, all the knowhow and experience is available that is considered essential in view of Siemens' activities. This includes, for instance, knowledge and experience in the areas of technology (including information tech\u00ad nology, digitalization and cybersecurity), sustainability, transformation, procurement, manufacturing, research and development, sales, finance, risk management, law (including compliance) and human resources. In addi\u00ad tion, the members of the Supervisory Board shall collec\u00ad tively have knowledge and experience in the business areas that are important for Siemens, in particular, in the areas of industry, infrastructure, energy, mobility and healthcare. As a group, the members of the Super\u00ad visory Board are to be familiar with the sector in which the Company operates. In accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act, at least one member of the Supervisory Board must have knowledge and expertise\n\nin the area of accounting, and at least one additional member of the Supervisory Board must have knowledge and expertise in the auditing of financial statements. The expertise in the field of accounting shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk man\u00ad agement systems and the expertise in the field of audit\u00ad ing shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its au\u00ad dit and assurance. The chairman of the audit committee shall have appropriate expertise in at least one of the two areas and shall be independent. In particular, the Supervisory Board shall also include members who have leadership experience as senior executives or members of a supervisory board (or comparable body) at a major company with international operations.\n\nWhen a new member is to be appointed, a review shall be performed to determine which of the areas of ex\u00ad pertise deemed desirable for the Supervisory Board are to be strengthened.\n\n## Internationality\n\nTaking the Company's international orientation into account, care shall be taken to ensure that the Super\u00ad visory Board has an adequate number of members with extensive international experience. The goal is to make sure that the present considerable share of Supervisory Board members with extensive inter\u00ad national experience is maintained.\n\n## Diversity\n\nWith regard to the composition of the Supervisory Board, attention shall be paid to achieving sufficient diversity. Not only is appropriate consideration to be given to women. Diversity of cultural heritage and a wide range of educational and professional back\u00ad grounds, experiences and ways of thinking are also to be promoted. When considering possible candidates for new elections or for filling Supervisory Board posi\u00ad tions that have become vacant, the Supervisory Board shall give appropriate consideration to diversity at an early stage in the selection process.\n\nIn accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board is composed of at least /three.fitted/zero.fitted % women and at least /three.fitted/zero.fitted % men. The Nominating Committee shall continue to include at least one female  member.",

Knowledge and experience in the business areas important for Siemens - in particular, in the industry, infrastructure, energy, mobility and health\u00ad care sectors - are also present in the Supervisory Board. A considerable number of Supervisory Board members are engaged in international activities and  /  or have many years of international experience. Appropriate consid\u00ad eration has been given to diversity in the Supervisory Board. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, the Supervisory Board had seven female members, of whom three are shareholder repre\u00ad sentatives and four are employee representatives. As a result,  /three.fitted/five.fitted % of  the  Supervisory  Board  members  are women.

Annual Shareholders' Meeting and investor relations\n\nShareholders exercise their rights at the Annual Share\u00ad holders' Meeting. An ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meet\u00ad ing normally takes place within the first five months of each fiscal year. The Annual Shareholders' Meeting de\u00ad cides, among other things, on the appropriation of net income, the ratification of the acts of the members of the Managing and Supervisory Boards, and the appointment of the independent auditors. Amendments to the Articles of Association and measures that change the Company's capital stock are approved at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and implemented by the Managing Board. The Managing Board facilitates shareholder participation in this meeting through electronic communications - in par\u00ad ticular, via the Internet - and enables shareholders who are unable to attend the meeting to vote by proxy. Proxies can also be reached during the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Furthermore, shareholders may exercise their right to vote in writing or by means of electronic commu\u00ad nications (absentee voting). The Managing Board may enable shareholders to participate in the Annual Share\u00ad holders' Meeting without the need to be present at the venue and without a proxy and to exercise some or all of their rights fully or partially by means of electronic com\u00ad munications. The Company enables shareholders to follow the entire Annual Shareholders' Meeting via the Internet. Shareholders may submit motions regarding the proposals\n\nof the Managing and Supervisory Boards and may contest decisions of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Share\u00ad holders owning Siemens stock with an aggregate notional value of \u20ac /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted,/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted or more may also demand the judicial appointment  of  special  auditors  to  examine  specific issues. The reports, documents and information required by law for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, including the Annual Financial Report, can be downloaded from the Siemens Global Website. The same applies to the agenda for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and to any counter\u00ad proposals or shareholders' nominations that may require disclosure. For the election of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board, a detailed curriculum vitae of every candidate is published.\n\nIn accordance with Section /one.fitted of the German Act Concern\u00ad ing Measures Under the Law of Companies, Cooperative Societies, Associations, Foundations and Commonhold Property to Combat the Effects of the COVID\u00ad/one.fitted/nine.fitted Pandemic ( Gesetz \u00fcber Ma\u00dfnahmen im Gesellschafts\u00ad, Genossen\u00ad schafts\u00ad, Vereins\u00ad, Stiftungs\u00ad und Wohnungseigentums\u00ad recht zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der Auswirkungen der COVID\u00ad/one.fitted/nine.fitted\u00ad Pandemie , GesRuaCOVBekG) of March /two.fitted/seven.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted (Federal Gazette I No. /one.fitted/four.fitted /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, p. /five.fitted/seven.fitted/zero.fitted) as  amended  by  the German Act on the Further Shortening of the Residual Debt Exemption Procedure and on the Adjustment of Pandemic\u00adRelated Provisions in Company, Cooperative, Association and Foundation Law and in Tenancy and Lease Law ( Gesetz zur weiteren Verk\u00fcrzung des Restschuld\u00ad befreiungsverfahrens und zur Anpassung pandemiebe\u00ad dingter Vorschriften im Gesellschafts\u00ad, Genossenschafts\u00ad, Vereins\u00ad und Stiftungsrecht sowie im Miet\u00ad und Pacht\u00ad recht ) of December /two.fitted/two.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted (Federal Gazette I No. /six.fitted/seven.fitted /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, p. /three.fitted/three.fitted/three.fitted/two.fitted), the validity of which was extended until August /three.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, by the German Act on the Establishment of a Special Fund 'Reconstruction Assistance /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted' and on the Temporary Suspension of the Obligation to File an Insolvency Petition due to Heavy Rainfall and Floods in July /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted and on the Amendment of Other Laws ( Gesetz zur Errichtung eines Sonderverm\u00f6gens ' Aufbauhilfe /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted ' und  zur  vor\u00fcbergehenden  Aussetzung  der  Insolvenz\u00ad antragspflicht wegen Starkregenf\u00e4llen und Hochwassern im  Juli  /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted sowie  zur  \u00c4nderung  weiterer  Gesetze ) of  September /one.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted (Federal Gazette I No. /six.fitted/three.fitted /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, p. /four.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted/three.fitted), the ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /one.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, was conducted as a virtual share\u00ad holders' meeting without the physical presence of share\u00ad holders or their proxies due to the special circumstances created by the COVID\u00ad/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic.",

        "page_content": "This document contains statements related to our future business and financial performance and future events or developments involving Siemens that may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by words such as 'expect,' 'look forward to,' 'anticipate,' 'intend,' 'plan,' 'believe,' 'seek,' 'estimate,' 'will,' 'project' or words of similar meaning. We may also make forwardlooking statements in other reports, in prospectuses, in presentations, in material delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In addition, our representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the current expectations and certain assumptions of Siemens' management, of which many are beyond Siemens' control. These are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and factors, including, but not limited to, those described in disclosures, in particular in the chapter Report on expected developments and associated material opportunities and risks in the Combined Management Report of the Siemens Report (siemens.com/siemensreport).  Should  one  or  more  of  these  risks  or  uncertainties  materialize,  should  decisions,  assessments  or requirements of regulatory authorities deviate from our expectations, should events of force majeure, such as pandemics, unrest or acts of war, occur or should underlying expectations including future events occur at a later date or not at all or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results, performance or achievements of Siemens may (negatively or positively) vary materially from those described explicitly or implicitly  in  the  relevant  forward-looking  statement.  Siemens  neither  intends,  nor  assumes  any  obligation,  to  update  or  revise  these forward-looking statements in light of developments which differ from those anticipated.\n\nThis document includes - in the applicable financial reporting framework not clearly defined - supplemental financial measures that are or may be alternative performance measures (non-GAAP-measures). These supplemental financial measures should not be viewed in isolation or as alternatives to measures of Siemens' net assets and financial positions or results of operations as presented in accordance with  the  applicable  financial  reporting  framework  in  its  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Other  companies  that  report  or  describe similarly titled alternative performance measures may calculate them differently.\n\nDue  to  rounding,  numbers  presented  throughout  this  and  other  documents  may  not  add  up  precisely  to  the  totals  provided  and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\n\nThis document is an English language translation of the German document. In case of discrepancies, the German language document is the sole authoritative and universally valid version.\n\nFor technical reasons, there may be differences between the accounting records appearing in this document and those published pursuant to legal requirements.\n\nThe Sustainability Report 2022 which reports on Sustainability and Citizenship at Siemens is available at: siemens.com/investor/en/",
